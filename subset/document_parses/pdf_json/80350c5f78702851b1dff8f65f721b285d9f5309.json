The aim is to provide recommendations that would allow Latin American ports to reach high performance scores through governance practices, and face the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, fostering a more resilient port ecosystem. A three-stage methodological framework, composed of six steps, is proposed. In the first stage, semi-structured interviews were carried out, with a total of 178 participants, to assess the state of implementation of governance practices in 24 Latin American ports. These practices were identified from a literature review and are promoted among successful port systems worldwide. In a second stage, the relationship between governance practices in ports and their performance was analyzed, aiming to identify those governance and institutionalist strategies that are most extensively used by the best performing ports. Finally, in a third stage, we provide recommendations that would allow Latin American ports to reach high performance scores through improved governance practices. The results indicate that digitalization and coordination among the stakeholders of the port logistics community are two of the most cited governance practices in the best performing Latin American ports. This paper contributes to the theory of port governance in Latin America, by empirically relating and identifying those governance practices which contribute to port performance.",

Accordingly, modern seaports can be considered pivotal entities of global supply chains (Notteboom and Haralambides 2020) . Gonz\u00e1lez-Laxe et al. (2016) correctly argue that when a port intends to take part in a global supply chain, its activities transcend domestic/regional frontiers. Notteboom (2007) has emphasized the fact that \"ports are inclined to develop new governance structures, which should be tailored to the specific local conditions in terms of culture and port objectives.\" Particularly in the region of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), Pinto and S\u00e1nchez (2015) highlight the need for a new governance model for the region, referring to this as \"governance 2.0.\" This is justified as challenges exist to which ports in the region need to effectively respond. Previous efforts made in the 90s for the modernization of ports by the participation of private companies that developed infrastructure are no longer enough to respond to the challenges and pressures imposed nowadays by both globalization and fierce competition that demand better service levels and agile distribution channels. In the same line, Gonzalez-Laxe et al. (2016) evidence the gap that Latin America has with respect to Southern Europe, remarking on the need for a profound revision of port governance to adapt to changes and new challenges.",

This procedure also allowed us to probe respondents who were reticent or nonverbal. Most of the interviews were scheduled in groups, to which the participants were invited with the support of the Port Authority (PA). During the activity, the objectives of the D&CP Network program were explained to the participants. In addition to developing a structured interview to assess governance and institutionalist practices, a second goal of the study was to determine the relationship between the ports' reported use of these strategies and an omnibus measure of logistics accomplishment: their achievement track in logistics efficiency.",

Governance is about an autonomous self-governing network of actors and identifies the power dependence involved in the relationships between institutions involved in collective actions.\" In this regard, the multiple and diverse public and private stakeholders involved in international trade processes represent such network of actors.

In this regard, port governance needs to adapt to the changing port ecosystem. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how complex and uncertain the port environment is and the vulnerabilities that global supply chains face; the role of the PA must, therefore, be adapted as well (Notteboom and Haralambides 2020) .",

            "text": "A typology of port administration models was defined by the World Bank (2001). Four port administration models were identified: the private service port, the landlord port, the tool port, and the service port. At present, the most commonly employed model corresponds to the landlord port in which the PA leases the port land and adjacent aquatic surfaces under a concession model aiming to balance public and private goals. However, as highlighted by Notteboom and Haralambides (2020) , the landlord model is commonly bureaucratic, and in several cases, the PA has limited autonomy and authority over the different stakeholders of the port community. For instance, PAs commonly do not have authority over stakeholders such as bonded warehouses and empty container depots that play a significant role in the efficiency of port processes as an important echelon of the port supply chain. Hence, sometimes PAs have what is referred to as \"responsibility without authority\" (Notteboom and Haralambides 2020). Drewe and Janssen (1998) remark that the port is the focus of two types of logistics: product logistics and cargo logistics. A ship-oriented port implies a strategy of standardization and massing of flows and services, in which the port no longer constitutes a breakpoint in the transport chain. In contrast, a cargo-oriented port is marked by more value adding and customization of activities and less technologydriven port development (Haven van Rotterdam 1986) . How cargo oriented a port is, has a significant impact on port competitiveness, as this is an attribute that generates more value than just the port infrastructure offered.",

Based on the implications of the port business ecosystem, innovation and integration capabilities are critical factors for ecosystem developers, in this case, the PDC or PA. Vieira et al. (2014) study port governance in the Port of Valencia, Spain. In 2009, this port was considered best in class by the Port of Cluster Governance Committee of the Global Institute of Logistics. Based on interviews with experts, the port governance model was analyzed from the managers' and users' points of view. The main findings of the study identified the governance actions that have been undertaken by the port. Among them, we can highlight the Quality System named \"Marca de Garant\u00eda,\" whose direct outcomes impact the efficiency of the port supply chain by reducing cargo dwell times and costs of operations.",

These are instances of collaboration to generate consensus among the actors of the port logistics chain, discuss local problems, and reduce gaps that may have been identified (MTT 2018). The PLC is formed so that stakeholders work together and solve problems that affect the port supply chain under the umbrella provided by the PA (in the case of public ports), playing a fundamental role as leader and coordinator. Accordingly, the port community is born as a collective management and coordination tool between the key stakeholders of a port cluster, or a port region, who interact and at the same time, benefit from business processes, operations, products, and services. Its current importance is attributed to the challenges, complexities, and increasing intensity of business relationships, strategies, and common investments necessary to make a node more competitive (SELA 2018) .",

They study the determinants of waterborne transport costs, with emphasis on the efficiency at port level, providing also some measures of port efficiency based on a survey of Latin American common-user ports. As part of their results, the need to study the impacts of port efficiency on Latin American foreign trade, competitiveness and regional integration is highlighted. Another related contribution to the region is presented by Wilmsmeier et al. (2006) . They analyze the impact of port characteristics as determinants of international maritime transport costs, reporting empirical results on trade among 7 importing and 16 exporting Latin American countries. Results show that port privatization has a small and positive impact on an importing country, while the opposite is the case for exporting country. The authors also show that indicators of port efficiency, port infrastructure, private sector participation, and inter-port connectivity have significant impacts on international maritime transport costs. Hence, the role of ports in foreign trade and transport costs is clear. Gonzalez-Laxe et al. (2016) provide a comparative analysis of ports in LAC and Southern Europe. They conclude that, in contrast to their European counterparts, port governance in LAC relies on traditional concepts of port governance, of low adaptability to change, and a low adaption to the needs of an enhanced port supply chain. Hence, they highlight the need of a profound revision of port governance in LAC. This has been also remarked by Pinto and S\u00e1nchez (2015) , in what they refer to as \"Governance 2.0.\" Accordingly, they point out that previous efforts made in the 90s for the modernization of ports by the participation of private companies in the development of infrastructure are no longer enough to respond to the current challenges. Schulte et al. (2016) discuss directions for sustainable ports in LAC, highlighting the importance of formalized port communities with appropriate governance structures, as basic elements of a life-cycle approach towards the sustainable development of ports. Aligned with the need of strengthening port governance in the region, Schulte et al. (2016) emphasize the need of basic steps such as the definition of a strategic plan in which all the stakeholders are consulted and define a common vision for a more sustainable port supply chain. Another related study in LAC is presented by Vairetti et al. (2019) . Port digitalization and the use of new technologies to not only enhance the exchange of documents and information among the stakeholders of the ports, but also support decision making are a relevant aspect for ports to face the current challenges. In this regard, Vairetti et al. (2019) analyze, based on an empirical study, what are the factors influencing the successful adoption of interorganizational information systems (IOISs). Their results show that stakeholder collaboration and governance of the PLC are the most critical success factors.",

The higher the index, the better the logistics performance. We use LPI data from 2018. \u2022 Time spent in port (Time). This variable measures the average time (in days) vessels spent in ports. We use data from 2019 World Bank records. \u2022 Port Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (PLSCI). The Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI) is computed by UNCTAD. This allows the assessment of maritime connectivity for container shipping, enabling comparisons between countries and over time. It considers six components, such as the number of shipping lines servicing the country and the size of the largest vessel used on these services, among others. The index can be calculated at the country and port levels. The higher the index, the easier it is to access a high capacity and frequency global maritime freight transport system, and its effective participation in international trade. We use PLSCI from 2019 UNCTAD records at the port level (PLSCI). \u2022 Container Port Throughput. This measures the annual container throughput from 2019. Table 3 shows the records. A cluster analysis was applied to group homogeneous ports together, considering their performance. Two country-level variables (LPI and Time in port) and two port-level variables (PLSCI and throughput) were considered to avoid grouping low throughput and connectivity ports together with high throughput and connectivity ones, just because they are from the same country. However, considering that the four variables are in different units, we use the k-means clustering algorithm with standardized values to minimize the effect of scale differences. As a check on the achievement differences of the three groups of ports, their LPI scores were compared. The mean level of achievement for the high group was 3.234, and the means of the low group were 2.749. Table 4 shows the clustering results. Table 5 lists the characteristics of the 178 interviewees and participants in the interviews (either individual or in groups). As shown in Table 5 , most respondents represented government agencies (28.65%) and PAs (27.53%), while the minority of the respondents came from the consulting and academic fields (10.67%). This is important because top management employees, planning staff, and academics with experience in ports were invited to the workshops, as they have the most significant involvement in the port community and have the most influence in the strategic decision process relating to governance best practices. This supports the reliability of the survey findings. Regarding respondent seniority, more than half of the respondents (67.8%) had more than 5 years of experience in their companies. The respondents ranged in age from 36 to 57, with a mean age of 45.",

In this governance scheme, a single institution governs all the public ports in the country. Examples include the cases of Peru (National Port Authority), Uruguay (National Port Administrator), Paraguay (National Administration of Navigation and Ports) and Jamaica (Port Authority of Jamaica). \u2022 Regional PA. In this case, there is a PA that governs more than one port, generally associated with a state or region of the country.

To make each context as meaningful as possible, a concrete example was provided.

Hence, we can conclude that this is a commonly used practice although it does not achieve the value of 4, and hence, there is still room for adjustments and for a better definition of such commissions or task forces. We can also notice that this corresponds to an internal governance practice. This is consistent with what we can expect, as it is harder to carry out external governance practices if the internal ones are not implemented yet. For instance, having representation of the PLC on national task forces, thus, positively influencing national policies, is very difficult if the PLC does not have its own structure and organizational scheme that represents the view and common interests of the different stakeholders participating in foreign trade operations. \u2022 For the LPP group, the practice with the lowest score of implementation corresponded to the continuous review of port governance and strategy. This practice requires a solid base and organizational structure of the PLC, as well as the existence of mechanisms fostering local debate. This would aim at a positive influence of the different stakeholders of the PLC, in terms of promoting an adequate review and updating of port governance. Hence, the lowest level of implementation is consistent with the lowest performance of ports in this group. \u2022 For the HPP group, the practice with the lowest level of implementation related to \"Sustainability and port supply chain integration.\" The literature in this regard has shown the importance that the different port stakeholders, and the need for coordination in the port supply chain as guiding principles in the strategic plan of the PLC. Hence, ports in the region are still lagging behind other ports worldwide that have been working to improve their port supply chain integration (e.g., the efforts that the Port of Botany in Sydney, Australia, has made, since the definition of its Port of Botany Landside Improvement Strategy, PBLIS).",

The Ministry of Transport of the country has been supporting their creation, providing mechanisms, such as guides of best practices, for their creation and management, under the scope of the Program \"Connect Logistics\" (MTT 2021) . This is an important step in which the authority has the active role of promoting port governance, visualizing the port as an ecosystem and not just as an isolated node of the global transport chain. \u2022 The above is a positive aspect that could be considered by other countries in the region, as a first step towards developing digitalization projects, as well as any other infrastructure or logistics coordination projects. Having a formal structure and organization of the PLC facilitates actions that require consensus. \u2022 Forming PLCs requires commitment and leadership from the part of the PA.",

As an example, we can mention the case of the Port of Buenaventura, in which the PLC has been developed under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce. However, we can observe a lower maturity when compared to the Chilean PLCs that have been supported by their PAs and, in recent years, by the Ministry of Transport. \u2022 As part of the formation of PLCs, it is necessary to define the strategic plan in consultation and with the consensus of the different stakeholders. This is an important step toward getting the different stakeholders engaged, and generating synergies for collaborative and active participation in the development of port projects. \u2022 The role of the PAs as a PDC is a key one, in which port projects and investments must be guided not only by the profits directly generated but also by the productivity that can be gained for the entire PLC (De Langen and Haezendonck 2012; S\u00e1nchez and Pinto 2015; Kang and Kim 2017; De Langen et al. 2020) . This is an important message that must be disseminated in the region. \u2022 Cooperation of ports in proximity is an important element as, traditionally, ports tend to compete against each other rather than collaborate (Notteboom et al. 2016) . So, mechanisms that foster collaboration and competition (coopetition) are needed, as such ports share their hinterland and there may be several common stakeholders (e.g., truck carriers, custom agents, etc.) that will benefit. For this, public policies that facilitate such collaborative schemes are required.",

The ports were classified into three groups (LPP, MPP, HPP) according to their performance, by a clustering procedure that considered four variables: (i) LPI, (ii) Time spent in port, (iii) PLSCI, and (iv) Container port throughput. Best governance practices were identified from the literature and classified as internal and external best practices. In order to understand the level of adoption of such practices in the region, field work was done, based on semi-structured interviews and a workshop, held at each of the selected ports. Results show that the level of implementation of such practices is in general very low for all the participating ports, but that this is consistent with the three port performance groups. Ports with higher performance (HPP) presented a higher level of implementation of such practices. Hence, we can conclude that port governance practices have a positive impact on port performance.",

None of the best practices had an average score equal to or greater than 3. This means that none of the practices are perceived to be totally implemented (value = 4) or that, at least, there is a commitment to implement them (3). So, ports in LAC need to make important efforts to adopt best governance practices that will positively impact their performance and competitiveness. As noted by Gonzalez-Laxe et al.
