Even though physiological research has contributed insights to the work conditions of saturation divers, research on the qualities of the divers' psychosocial work environment is lacking. This study aimed to explore which job demands and resources are viewed as characteristic among saturation divers working within an isolated and confined environment. Based on data from 6 in-depth semi-structured interviews, template analysis was applied to map unique characteristics. By using the theoretical framework of the job demands-resources model, we found that the work environment in saturation diving was characterized by shifting demands and big contrasts, requiring adaptability in each individual diver. One major demand described by the informants was an unpredictable future, somewhat due to the changes in the oil and gas industry. Another important demand was the conflict between family and work/leisure when committing to work for extended periods in isolated environments. The monotony that characterizes the work environment is a challenge that must be managed. High wages, periods of leisure, and a prestigious job provide external motivation, while personal resources such as mental endurance and flexibility, a willingness to learn, and keeping up small personal routines, may benefit the divers' mental health. This is also affected by the quality of team climate-with features such as being sociable and considerate, having a dark sense of humor and having trust in one another.",

            "text": "Divers have played an important role in the development of the offshore oil and gas industry in the North Sea since its beginning. The diving activity was necessary for the implementation of the industry and has contributed to societies economic income. Accumulated research has led to an improvement in saturation diving procedures. Today, saturation diving can be performed safely and efficiently, but there are still many questions to be answered (1) . A knowledge status on offshore diving (2) indicates that most research on saturation diving to this day are physiological studies investigating how the human body reacts to, or adapts to living and working in an extreme hyperbaric environment [e.g., (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) ]. Yet, there is a shortage of studies investigating possible psychological effects of this type of diving (2) . Saturation diving was introduced in the North Sea in the 1970s [(7), p. [47] [48] [49] [50] . Because the divers don't return directly to the surface, saturation diving requires a comprehensive support system, including pressurized living chambers, diving bells, and life support systems usually installed on a Diving Support Vessel (DSV). The pressurization, or the so-called \"blowdown\", takes place in the saturation chambers on the DSV, where the pressure is increased to match the pressure they experience at working depth. This system is where the divers live when they are not working on the construction site on the seabed (1), and is therefore equipped accordingly. On the vessel, many people serve to support the life and work of the divers in the pressurized chamber system, including dive managers, dive supervisors, life support technicians, and life support supervisors.",

Though saturation diving is a very procedural and carefully planned job, divers must also get around challenges, such as lose bottom material that can reduce the visibility to near zero in extreme cases, as well as ocean currents giving the divers additional physical strain (11) . The maximum duration the diver stays saturated in the North Sea is 21 days in the Norwegian sector, and 28 days in the UK sector down to depths of 180 meters of sea-water (msw) (12, 13) , including the time needed for decompression back to surface pressure.",

Physically, because the divers are exposed to an increased pressure related to the depths of the dives. Heliox is the preferred gas in saturation diving, since hyperbaric air has higher breathing resistance and can induce nitrogen narcosis. In deeper dives, below 180 msw, the divers are at risk of developing high-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) a neurological syndrome characterized by headache, tremor, vertigo, nausea, and moderate changes in cognitive functioning (1, 2, 14) . Socially, because saturation diving requires long-term confinement in saturation chambers for weeks on end, the environment in hyperbaric saturation can be boring due to the lack of stimulation, absence of privacy, and social interaction with a restricted number of people, as well as a reduction in the satisfaction of basic human needs such as feelings of personal significance, and need for affection (14) .",

In such environments, the living and working conditions of the ICEs provide a natural laboratory for studying human behavior.

The JD-R model is a heuristic and flexible theoretical framework that considers how job characteristics influence individual wellbeing and work performance. This is done by integrating motivational and stress research. The model implies that physical, psychological, and contextual factors of the psychosocial work environment can be categorized into two broad categories, job demands and job resources (20) . The resources and demands may be located in social and interpersonal relations, the tasks that are performed, in the individual employee, or in the organization at large. The combination of these two categories leads to two fairly independent psychological processes that influence employees' performance and wellbeing: a health impairment process and a motivational process (20) . The health impairment process assumes that in poorly designed jobs, the job demands function as initiators of a process of health impairment fostering burnout or physical or psychological strain. Whereas, job resources initiate a motivational process, hence fostering growth, learning, and development (21) .",

Meanwhile, the motivational process assumes that the job resources are described as the factors that contribute to reducing physiological and psychological costs of the job demands; by helping the employee achieving work goals, and stimulates to personal development, learning, and growth (22) (23) (24) , and may generate work engagement and organizational commitment (23) . Examples of job resources may be the perceived job control, social support from colleagues or management, and performance feedback. The model assumes that high job demands and limited job resources can result in burnout as this form of working conditions lead to an undermining of employees' motivation and depletion of energy (25) . The relationship between the job demands and resources and work engagement has been shown not to vary significantly. Hence, the JD-R model can be used irrespective of the type of occupation (23), for instance saturation diving.",

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that the informants were in different countries the interviews were carried out digitally using Zoom Video Communications. The interviews were divided into different topics. To get a thorough contextual understanding of the working day as a saturation diver the first part of the interview revolved around the diver's experiences and background and their general everyday working conditions (e.g., their motivation for becoming a saturation diver, years of experience, type of tasks performed, etc.). Further, the questions aimed to get an understanding of the specific job demands the divers face in their daily lives, and what kind of personal and jobrelated resources are helpful to master challenges and demands of their working life (e.g., issues relating personal characteristics to master this line of work, different type of challenges, social cohesion, etc.). Furthermore, the interviews were recorded and transcribed. Transcriptions were done thoroughly and as \"true\" to the audio file as possible (30) to avoid overlooking valuable information or statements. Transcriptions were done word-forword (verbatim), including non-verbal utterances (e.g., pauses and irony, etc.), and indications of striking words.",

The method was chosen because it allows for definition of some themes in advance of the analysis, together with a flexible coding structure that allows for an in-depth exploration of the richest aspects of the data (33) . Hierarchical coding is a key feature of the template analysis, and the coding process is often done according to predefined themes. For this study, the a priori coding was done based on the two broad themes of demands and resources, using the JD-R model (20) . The data was coded line-by-line (34) , bearing in mind a potential adjustment or expansion of the initial template if needed, while remaining open to the data. After applying this initial template to the first three interviews it seemed befitting to proceed and finalize the analysis based on these two themes. Further, passages and paragraphs were reread and sub-themes and concepts related to the higherorder themes were revealed. When comparing the codes from the different interviews some themes and concepts were mentioned frequently, whilst others were disclosed more indirectly.

This way, personal resources serve as coping mechanisms in managing the high demands and the big contrasts in the working life in saturation diving. The results indicate an active process of enduring the different demands by changing their focus away from stressor, using humor as levity, and crafting their off-time to experience control and meaning. Although danger was not explicitly expressed to be one of the main demands, some of the personal resources still seem to function as a buffer toward this aspect of the job. The results of this study indicate that mental detachment or the ability to selectively shift the focus away from the inherent dangers of the occupation, or challenges due to prolonged periods away from their families are helpful to the divers. Similarly, research on detached mindfulness-that is the ability to observe internal events without responding to them-found that trusting luck and practicing detached objectivity would reduce proneness to worry (35) . A Swedish study investigating daily uplifts and effective coping strategies for the hassles in the working lives of military veterans suggested that similar coping strategiese.g., living in a bubble where risks aren't acknowledged and distancing oneself from emotions-may limit stress reactions under constant exposure to various stressors (36) . This means of limiting the perception of danger is also seen among another group experiencing ICE; Israeli submariners, as a strategy of \"optimal denial\" (37) .",

            "text": "It has been suggested that organizations characterized by great demands are more likely to foster resilience resources to manage a potentially damaging process (44) . Space flight experts have defined resilience during a space mission to involve mental endurance or the ability to sustain when being exposed to stressors such as monotonous tasks or poor lighting, along with recovering from acute stressors, such as unscheduled space walks (45) . Similarly, to the findings of this study, mental endurance was one of the main personal resources highlighted by the divers for coping with demands such as the monotony of the working days in saturation, and the procedural tasks on the seabed. Moreover, research on resilience has led the development of the Resilience Scale for Adult (RSA) assessing resilience factors among adults. The scale was developed based on empirical evidence that existed at the time, it is assumed to be applicable regardless of culture (46, 47) . According to the RSA, resilience consists of six factors; perception of self, planned future, social competence, structural style, family cohesion, and social resources (48). People with a higher level of resilience (as per RSA) seem to tolerate stressful life events better (49), whilst individuals reporting fewer resilience resources were more prone to develop psychiatric symptoms when exposed to stressful life events. Thus, resilience resources act as protective factors. With regards to the present study, the results reflect several of the resilience factors of the RSA. As assessed in the factor of Perception of Self (assessing a fundamental confidence in own abilities in solving, managing, and coping in dire events/situations), saturation diving itself can be considered a dire event. In line with the factor of Planned Future (assessing a preference of making plans or setting clear future goals, and having a positive outlook of own future) the divers expressed plans such as early retirement or studying in the chamber to have a way out after their diving career. As to the factor Structured Style (assessing the preference for establishing routines, planning ahead, and approaching tasks in an organized manner), the divers displayed a preference to create personal routines. Further, the factor Social Competence (assessing the ability to create friendships and engage socially, feeling at ease, and being flexible in social interactions or social settings), the divers emphasize this when describing successful divers to be socially competent, showing consideration to one another, and being sociable. Based on the corresponding findings between the descriptions given by saturation divers, and the empirical evidence gained by the work on RSA, it could be recommended to go further with investigating how these resources may prospectively influence the health and career of saturation divers.",

Psychological flexibility refers to a human ability to adapt to and recognize shifting situational demands, as well as the ability to shift behavioral repertoire or mindset if required in order to uphold a healthy personal and social functioning. Psychological flexibility may protect a person from depression and anxiety, and be a source to psychological health (50) . The divers also highlighted the value of a stable family/home life when adapting to life at home between assignments. Hence, family can be considered an interpersonal resource that supplies the diver with social support, which is considered exceptionally important for maintaining good mental health by enhancing resilience to stress (20, 25, 51, 52) .",

However, the tasks performed on the seabed can be described as highly procedural for safety reasons, seeing that small errors may have economic, environmental, and lifethreatening consequences. This leaves the divers with little taskrelated autonomy. Further, the time spent in the chamber system is characterized by little room for privacy, spending several weeks living together in a chamber with the size of a caravan, leaving the divers with limited room for activities of daily living. Interestingly, the divers seem to create some form of autonomy in a seemingly little autonomous supporting work environment by creating unique personal routines in the chamber. Little routines, such as bringing enough of the right sort of tea or hand brewing specific types of coffee, are described as essential when living in the chamber system. The same routines were nonessential to the divers at home. Three of the divers explain that these types of routines can become so important that it may determine whether the day is good or bad. One diver described these routines as a means of establishing meaningfulness in situations that can be perceived as meaningless. This act of creating personal routines can be considered as a form of job crafting, or maybe even \"leisure crafting\" (56) as it is performed during the off-time in saturation. Job crafting is the act of optimizing of work environment by proactively changing the job demands or job resources, making their job more meaningful or interesting (55) . Further, this meaningfulness which the divers create by shaping personal routines, is considered in Work-Related Sense of Coherence (57) to be a motivational component that reflects whether the employee experience own work situation as worthy of involvement and commitment. A work situation experienced as meaningful is shown to enhance the employees engagement (58) .",

The team climate does not have to be disharmonious to be demanding. One informant explains that small things, such as chewing on the spoon, can become irritating over the weeks in isolation. Similarly experienced by a soviet cosmonaut; \"All conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 and leave them for two months.\" (59) . A solid group cohesion has countless benefits, e.g., lightening the social monotony of living in an ICE, or creating a safe space for venting frustrations, hence avoiding serious conflicts [(60), p. 56]. A review and analysis of astronauts' and cosmonauts' personal journals (59) show that the participants highest priority before launch was to get along with their crewmates. Their journals show that astronauts and cosmonauts actively behave in a way to maintain interpersonal harmony (by being cooperative, avoiding certain topics in conversation, and other sincere acts of comradeship). Similarly, the informants of the present study highlight that the most important group characteristics in saturation are being considerate and sociable.",

As one diver points out, when working with a less experienced diver, they must ensure and control that safety precautions are followed so no lives are at risk. Thus, lack of trust can be demanding. Trust, defined as a person's willingness to rely on another individual in a risky situation (61) , is developed by ones perception of the other person's qualities (62) . Inexperienced divers or divers who show little interest in learning the procedures of the job are experienced as less trustworthy, which increases the demands on more experienced divers who must control the situation. Research has demonstrated that a combination of high job demands and low perceived job control is related to significant strain and negative health effects (53) . Similarly, the constant responsibility for the lives of others was considered to be one of many daily hassles among Swedish military veterans, whilst the capability of the unit, and trusting each other were seen as daily uplifts to their work environment (36) . A study investigating the effects of trust in high reliability organizations found that higher levels of trust were related to a lower risk perception (63) . These findings may explain why danger is not explicitly considered to be one of the main challenges in the working lives of the divers.",

Studies have found job insecurity to negatively impact workers' mental health (66, 67) . Further, meta-analysis relates job insecurity to the absence of trust in management, lower organizational commitment, higher turnover intention, and poorer performance (66) . A study applying the JD-R model found job insecurity to have a direct and an indirect effect (via burnout) on organizational outcomes such as turnover intentions and commitment (68) . As demonstrated above, job insecurity affects not only the individual employee exposed to it, the organization is also negatively affected. However, neither social support from colleagues, management, nor the unions seem to have a buffer effect on this type of stress. Job insecurity is therefore regarded as a stressor to be dealt with independently, and cannot be made less harmful by providing social support (69, 70) .

In accordance with the JD-R model rewards such as pay might function as job resource, and therefore as a predictor of work engagement (20) . In studies that apply the JD-R framework, non-financial rewards such as social support, positive feedback, and developmental opportunities are convincingly documented as job resources that can mitigate demanding work conditions and predict work engagement (18) . As explained in Kulikowski and Sedlak (71) the role of monetary rewards in predicting work engagement is undecided. Studies investigating the connection between monetary rewards and work engagement are few, and have reported mixed conclusions. On one hand one study found that positive evaluation of current pay functions as a positive predictor on work engagement (68) , and another that the prospect of being rewarded for high job performance correlated positively with work engagement (72) . On the other hand, Hulkko-Nyman et al. (73) suggested that salaries was unrelated to work engagement, whilst Kulikowski and Sedlak (71) found no relationship between the commonly used Human Resource Management rewards (salary, benefits, and bonuses) controlled for different job demands and resources. In this study, the high salaries seem to serve as a buffer for the high job demands (22) , rather than a direct predictor of work engagement.",

Periods of leisure might function as a buffer for the high job demands after 4 or 5 weeks of working. When employees encounter high job demands repeatedly, it's likely that they experience higher levels of strain and should therefore launch into recovery activities. Recovery can be defined as a process of restoring cognitive and energetic resources expended in the work situation (74) where the employee is considered to be recovered when these resources return to baseline (75) . Daily recovery during off-time was positively associated with work engagement the next day (74) , and better work performance (76) . Moreover, leisure may function as a buffer for negative workfamily spillover, which has been associated with lower subjective wellbeing (77) and reduced mental health (78) (79) (80) . It has been suggested that engaging in leisure activities might enhance the subjective wellbeing (81) either by facilitating the work and the family domain, or via leisure satisfaction (82) . However, the contrasts in levels of autonomy are great when comparing the divers' lives in saturation and their off-time at home. The divers are fully autonomous when they are not at work, until they are summoned for a new assignment. This way, the leisure during off-time is indirectly controlled or on the leash of the diving companies.",

This feeling of passing the \"eye of a needle\" by getting a job in saturation diving might function as a buffer resource in line with the findings of Rennesund and Saksvik (83) who studied collective or organizational efficacy on stressor-strain relationships. Their study found that the feeling of being member of a highly competent organization seems to mitigate the inimical effects of work stressors on the individual employee by providing them with a sense of being \"best in class\" and a sense of security.",

Working as a saturation diver therefore seems to encompass a willingness to periodically renounce personal needs in exchange for major external rewards. Still, throughout the results it is apparent that the divers themselves act in a way to fulfill their needs for relatedness, competence and autonomy (84), as a way to foster \"optimal\" functioning in a challenging work environment. With regards to relatedness, the divers spend weeks away from family and friends and miss out on big life events such as funerals and their children's birthdays, etc. This way the divers periodically disconnect from the outside world and the people who usually contribute to the fulfillment of the personal need of relatedness. In saturation, the comradery and the social climate within the team are highlighted as essential for a good work situation, comprising both adaptability and consideration from every team member. Being interested in learning is a personal resource that was highlighted by the informants as important for success in their profession. The studying some divers do during their off-time in the chamber may also be considered an act of fulfillment of their need for competence. Ultimately, the need for autonomy is shown by the leisure crafting during their off-time in saturation through which they control their existence by shaping personal routines. This way the divers may avoid need frustration which has been associated with job strain and higher levels of work-related stress (85) .",

The informants included in the study had extensive experience within this line of work and provided rich descriptions of the working life of saturation divers. By using an already established theoretical framework, the Job-Demands Resources Model, the results add unique information to this specific occupation. However, this study has some limitations. When applying the template analysis to the data, the focus was to capture the specific factors expressed by the divers as either protecting or demanding. This focus may have forsaken other important aspects of the divers' experiences of their work environment. Moreover, the JD-R model is heuristic; it characterizes the job and personal traits that lead to the outcome, but does not explain their origins. Further, studies with an exploratory nature, like the present, are prone to debatable generalizations. Furthermore, the results were based on data from divers with several years of experience within this line of work, which may give rise to bias. The findings may primarily be relevant to people who are comfortable in ICE conditions, due to the possible selection bias of the \"survival effect\" or the \"healthy worker effect\" (86) . This may also explain how some of the challenges the divers encounter are seen by them as merely daily hassles. The viral pandemic that was raging at the time of the study should also be considered as it -along with low oil pricesputs an extra pressure on the industry. Even though saturation diving for the oil and gas industry may be at risk, the results of this study may be relatable to other occupations characterized as isolated. The obvious links to occupational fields such as space flight and army missions have been discussed earlier. But also, during the pandemic, many people have been forced to work from home, experiencing the demands of decreased freedom. To that end, this current study may provide a bit of insight from the isolated environment that saturation divers embark, when they are called on duty. While this study focused on the identification of demands and resources as described by commercial saturation divers themselves, further longitudinal quantitative research is needed to investigate the potential importance and impact of these factors. To that end, our results provide insight into areas for further investigation.",

In answer to the research question: \"Which unique demands and resources are viewed as characteristic among saturation divers working within an isolated and confined environment?\" The informants emphasized an unpredictable future as a major demand, due to changes in the oil and gas industry. Another important demand was the conflict between family and work/leisure when committing to work for 21-28 days in an isolated environment. The monotony of this environment provides an additional challenge. High wages, long periods of leisure, and a prestigious job provide external resources in order to maintain this work, while personal resources such as an interest in learning, mental endurance and flexibility, and keeping up small personal routines, play important roles. Also emphasized are the quality of team climate-described with features such as being sociable and considerate, having a dark sense of humor, and having trust in one another. The results from this study indicate a need for further research into resilience resources and their application in ICE occupations like commercial saturation diving.",

I have a Norwegian wife, and I think without her my life would be very different. She has been quite a rock, or a hand break even. I don't know if you spoke much about it, certainly when I started... take a 20-year-old male and lock him away for 28 days in a chamber with other men. All they are going to talk about are women, cars, and how much money they are going to make. And then take him out of that chamber with a substantial amount of money and send him home. He has got no wife, he has got no kids, it's the middle of the week and you can imagine how destructive that can be. You know you have been locked away, you are not yourself. I'm telling you. You don't do any... as a diver when you get out of that chamber, it takes you a week until you are thinking right again. You know you can be really snappy, you can be very aggressive. Some people, you know, I certainly see a lot of obsessive-compulsive behavior amongst divers and certainly... I have experienced it so as I've got older it's gotten easier. Certainly having a stable homelife is a massive help. But I would say that the thing is with diving you get a lot of free time and you've got a lot of money, and that is not always a good thing. I feel personally I manage it well now, you know my home life is incredibly busy with * number * children, and yeah my wife and I spend a lot of time together. I don't... you know. . . I feel like when I am away, that when I am at home I want to be with my family so... that's good but I have colleagues that are totally opposite. They come back and they spend most of their leave drinking and yeah not living a healthy lifestyle, so it's a real mixed kind of. . . (. . . ) I certainly know guys that don't manage it well. Like I said, a big part of it is a stable home-life.",
