Using pharmacoinformatics-based analysis, we explored the relevance of bioactive chemicals found in Rasam (a South Indian cuisine) against oxidative stress-induced human malignancies. The Rasam is composed of twelve main ingredients, each of which contains a variety of bioactive chemicals. Sixtysix bioactive compounds were found from these ingredients, and their structures were downloaded from Pubchem. To find the right target via graph theoretical analysis (mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6)) and decipher their signaling route, a network was built. Sixty-six bioactive compounds were used for in silico molecular docking study against MAPK6 and compared with known MAPK6 inhibitor drug (PD-173955). The top four compounds were chosen for further study based on their docking scores and binding energies. In silico analysis predicted ADMET and physicochemical properties of the selected compounds and were used to assess their drug-likeness. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation modelling methodology was also used to analyse the effectiveness and safety profile of selected bioactive chemicals based on the docking score, as well as to assess the stability of the MAPK6-ligand complex. Surprisingly, the discovered docking scores against MAPK6 revealed that the selected bioactive chemicals exhibit varying binding ability ranges between \u2212 3.5 and \u2212 10.6 kcal mol \u22121 . MD simulation validated the stability of four chemicals at the MAPK6 binding pockets, including Assafoetidinol A (ASA), Naringin (NAR), Rutin (RUT), and Tomatine (TOM). According to the results obtained, fifty of the sixty-six compounds showed higher binding energy (\u2212 6.1 to \u2212 10.6 kcal mol \u22121 ), and four of these compounds may be used as lead compounds to protect cells against oxidative stressinduced human malignancies.",

It is the second greatest cause of mortality in the world, behind cardiovascular illnesses, and the number of cases continues to rise 1 . According to the GLOBOCON-2020 report, there are around 19.30 million new cancer cases diagnosed and 10.00 million cancer deaths worldwide 2 . A range of modifiable health behaviours, such as high fat and simple carbohydrate diet, irregular eating habits as well as poor physical activity contributes to the sudden rise in cancer incidences 3 . Several studies have shown that dysregulated nutrition and sedentary life style are key factors in the cellular redox process, resulting in unwanted by-products such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and DNA reactive aldehyde 4-6 . In mitochondria, ROS is an unavoidable byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation 7 . ROS is a two-edged sword that has both helpful (at low concentration) and harmful (at high concentration) properties. At low concentration, ROS regulates cellular activities such as cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and death while an increased quantity of ROS may damage proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, membranes, and organelles, it also reduces cell viability and causes apoptosis 8, 9 .",

Based on their structure and functions, they are classified into conventional and atypical MAPKs. Conventional MAPKs, such as, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 isoforms (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4), and atypical MAPKs are ERK3/4 and ERK7/8 14 . The ERK 1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways have been targeted by numerous drugs to battle the various types of cancer with some clinical success. While compared with ERK 1/2 (conventional) MAPKs, much less work has been explored on ERK3, also known as MAPK6 signaling, and its cellular functions 15 . The ERK3 has significant physiological functions, including pulmonary differentiation, T cell activation, and angiogenesis 16 . In addition, MAPK6 has been connecting a series of signaling cascades and play a major role in the migration and invasiveness of certain types of cancers. MAPK6 is essential for production of several cellular factors including interleukin-8 (IL-8), in both, normal and tumorigenic cells 16 . MAPK6 is a widely expressed protein in all tissues with highest expression levels detected in skeletal muscle, brain, and gastrointestinal tract. MAPK6 interacts with and phosphorylates steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3), an oncogenic protein overexpressed in multiple human cancers at the amino acid residue, serine 857 (S857) 17 .",

These mutated genes, enzymes, proteins and transcription factors are thought to be significant drug targets for slowing down the progression of cancer 31 . The signaling networks, such as genes, proteins, and enzymes, are shown in this perspective using graph theoretical network analysis. The graph theoretical concepts applied in the multifaceted signaling network, it may be possible to systematically examine the topology and functions of these selected network. Further, the graph theoretical network analysis can be used to predict the structural and dynamic properties of selected signaling pathway. Such predictions can assist the selection of ideal drug targets for reducing the complications of cancer 27 . It also gives data on the active site and molecular interactions of bioactive active compounds (ligands), which may help in the molecular docking study. As a result, the current research used pharmacoinformatics to examine the relevance of bioactive chemicals found in Rasam spices against oxidative stress-induced human malignancies. The predicted ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) characteristics of the selected bioactive compounds were also investigated. Further, molecular dynamics simulation was investigated to determine the stability and binding modes of selected bioactive compounds with an appropriate cancer receptor protein.",

All the four bioactive compounds are soluble in nature, except standard drug (CID: 447077). The solubility class of all the compounds are listed in the Table 5 . The synthetic accessibility score was found to be > 6 except CID: 12041593 and the standard drug (CID: 447077), which indicated that other three compounds are very difficult to synthesize. The graphical representation of drug-likeness of four selected compounds are presented in the Fig. 9 . The pink area within the hexagon represents the optimal range for the compounds. The recommended range for drug-like compound was insaturation (INSATU): fraction of carbons in the sp3 hybridization not less than 0.25, insolubility (INSOLU): log S not higher than 6, hydrophobicity (LIPO): between \u2212 0.7 and + 5.0, rotatable bonds (FLEXI): www.nature.com/scientificreports/ no more than 9 rotatable bonds, molecular weight (SIZE): between 150 and 500 g mol \u22121 and polar surface area (POLAR): between 20 and 130 \u00c5 2 ). The compound CID: 12041593 (ASA) possess drug-like properties and are displayed by the red slanted hexagon within the pink shade ( Fig. 9 ). Other three compounds (CID: 442428, CID: 5280805 and CID: 28523) and standard drug (CID: 447077) have high polar surface area, poor solubility and high molecular weight (size) which indicated off-shoot of the vertex (polar and size). Moreover, the pharmacokinetic properties were investigated by using egg-boiled model of selected four compounds and standard MAPK6 inhibitor is depicted in Fig. 10 . The egg-boiled model is helpful to predict two key pharmacokinetic properties simultaneously, i.e., the passive gastrointestinal absorption and blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration. The egg-shaped organisation plot shows that the compound present in the yolk (i.e. yellow region) represent the highly probable BBB permeation whereas albumin (i.e. white region) represent the highly probable human intestinal absorption. From the Fig. 10 , the compound ASA (CID: 12041593) and standard drug (CID: 447077) found in albumin (white region) elucidated the good absorption in gastrointestinal region. Remaining three compounds were found to be outside of the boiled-egg region. From the above observed results, it can be interpreted that the compound ASA (CID: 12041593) have sufficient potential to be drug.",

RMSD of the protein backbone atoms were plotted against time to assess its variations in structural conformation. Initially, the 7AQB-ASA complex showed variations in backbone RMSD till 30 ns ranging from 0.15 to 0.44 nm. The stable conformation was attained in the time period between 21 and 50 ns with no considerable deviations in the values (Fig. 11 ). 7AQB-NAR complex showed variations in backbone RMSD till 20 ns ranging from 0.17 to 0.43 nm. The stable conformation was attained in the time period between 21 and 50 ns with no considerable deviations in the values (Fig. 11) . The 7AQB-RUT complex showed variations in backbone RMSD till 30 ns ranging from 0.13 to 0.35 nm. The stable conformation was attained in the time period between 31-50 ns with no considerable deviations in the values (Fig. 8) . The 7AQB-TOM complex showed variations in backbone RMSD till 35 ns ranging from 0.14 to 0.43 nm. The first stable conformation was attained in the time period between 36 and 50 ns with no considerable deviations in the , pocket 4 (12 AA with predicted score 3.43), pocket 5 (13 AA with predicted score 3.10), pocket 6 (11 AA with predicted score 3.0), pocket 7 (10 AA with predicted score 2.14), pocket 8 (12 AA with predicted score 2.04), pocket 9 (08 AA with predicted score 1.90), pocket 10 (11 AA with predicted score 1.77) and pocket 11 (08 AA with predicted score 1.75). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ values (Fig. 11 ). This clearly specifies that the protein underwent small structural changes in all the complexes during simulations. RMSF is an another crucial parameter while examining the stability and flexibility of complex systems during simulation 47 . RMSF was examined to analyse the changes in the behaviour of amino acid residues of target protein on binding to a ligand 48, 49 . The RMSF values for C\u03b1 atoms of the protein were calculated and plotted with respect to the residues. In all the complexes, examined, the amino acid residues showed minimal fluctuations throughout the simulation. The amino acids of MAPK6 which interacted with ASA during docking showed minimal fluctuation values during MD simulation viz. CYS28, GLY29, LYS185 and LYS229, with NAR it showed low fluctuation values during MD simulation viz GLY29 and LEU192, with RUT showed minimal fluctuation values during MD simulation viz. GLY29, ARG70, LYS229 and ASN269 and with TOM it showed moderate fluctuation values during MD simulation viz. GLY29, LYS185, SER189, TYR266 and PRO301 (Fig. 12) . These results revealed that binding of the ligands actuated no major effects on the flexibility of the protein.",

Pharmacoinformatics is a collection of in silico molecular modeling tools for screening the bioactive substances based on their binding affinities, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic features 52 . By enabling researchers to narrow down the biological and synthetic research impacts, pharmacoinformatics has sped up the discovery of bioactive substances. Several substances have their positive effects predicted using pharmacoinformatics research, which were then validated by in vitro and in vivo activities. Understanding how chemicals bind, interact, and inhibit/ stimulate a certain protein might help researchers find therapeutic options for certain disease conditions. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Initially, a graph theoretical network was developed using centrality metrics, and it was suggested for metabolic networks that included enzymatic cascades and synergistic ligand-enzyme interactions. Biological networks, which are made up of a number of vertices (or nodes) linked in a pattern by a set of edges (or connections), are designed to mimic the structure of genuine biological systems. MAPK6/ERK3 was identified as a receptor (target) for ligand (bioactive substances) binding in ROS-induced oxidative stress that leads to malignancies, according to the network analysis study. MAPK6 pathway has been shown to be impacted not just by receptor ligand interactions, but also by various other stresses. MAPK6 is shown to be a key factor for organogenesis, cancer cell growth and invasiveness. MAPK6 overexpression has been detected in numerous human cancers, including squamous cell lung carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer and melanoma 53 . DNA microarray studies have produced inconsistent information about the regulation of MAPK6 expression in cancer. Several investigations demonstrated that expression of MAPK6 mRNA is down-regulated in brain tumors, ovarian carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma, and up-regulated in leukemias, adrenocortical carcinoma, squamous cell lung carcinoma, salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma, tongue squamous cell carcinoma and cervical cancer 54 . Furthermore, since MAPK signaling cascade regulate both mitogen-and stress-activated signals, the regulation of both pathways by ROS has drawn researchers' attention 55 . The goal of the current research work was to look Figure 10 . The EGG-BOILED model for the selected bioactive and standard MAPK6 inhibitor drug. The EGG-BOILED represents for intuitive evaluation of passive gastrointestinal absorption (HIA) white part and brain penetration (BBB) yellow part as well as substrates (PGP +) and non-substrates (PGP-) of the permeability glycoprotein (PGP) are represented by blue and red color circles, respectively, of the selected bioactive compound and standard MAPK6 inhibitor in the WLOGP-versus-TPSA graph. The grey region is the physicochemical space of compounds predicted to exhibit high intestinal absorption. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ into the detoxification/neutralization of ROS by employing bioactive chemicals found in Rasam spices to protect cells against cancer. A total of sixty-six bioactive compounds were chosen from twelve spices using the IMPPAT database, as well as previously published publications on their effects against different human malignancies. All the chemicals chosen were docked against MAPK6 protein kinases, with binding energy ranging from \u2212 3. Bioactivity of a substance is largely governed by its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) characteristics, all of which are connected to its pharmacokinetic characteristics. The bioavailability of dietary phytochemicals to target cells, as well as their absorption and metabolism in the human body are certain key aspects in promoting their bioactivity and maintaining body health 57 . The small intestine absorbs some, but not all, of the components of dietary phytochemicals into the circulatory system. Some phytochemical compounds that were absorbed by the colon and altered by the gut microbiota; the microbial metabolites that were released back into the circulation showed significant activity 58 . In order for any molecule to permeate the membrane, phytochemicals/test substance must break hydrogen bonds in the aqueous environment and partition across the membrane 59 . The polar surface area (PSA) of a chemical is connected to its hydrogen-bonding potential, whereas molecular mass and lipophilicity are associated to membrane permeability 60 . As a consequence, the ADME properties must be assessed at the earlier stages of drug design and discovery process in order to pass the standard clinical studies required to be considered as prospective therapeutic candidate 61 . In this study, all the discovered phytoconstituents were confirmed in terms of usual pharmacokinetic properties using multiple www.nature.com/scientificreports/ bioinformatics methods. Phytochemicals are naturally derived from variety of plants that are often consumed by humans and are usually considered safe to consume. While most phytochemicals are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, their potential toxicity is unknown. Phytochemicals are utilized as supplements in conjunction with illness therapy all around the world, but the users do not necessarily inform this to their physicians 62 . Substance toxicity refers to the property of any compound to be poisonous and to cause harm to an organism. Toxicity testing of a substance necessitates in vitro www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and in vivo animal experiments, which is a time-consuming, expensive, and complicated technique. Because there are no animal trials, and improved precision, accessibility, and speed, in silico toxicity assessment has become very popular in recent times and it can offer information on any synthetic or natural molecule. In this work, in silico approaches were used to estimate the toxicity levels of four chemicals. The non-carcinogenic and non-skin irritating properties of four substances were determined using in silico testing. Three compounds, Assafoetidinol A, Rutin, and Tomatine were shown to be negative in Ames testing. Toxicity tests revealed that the four phytochemicals chosen had no negative side effects (hERG). The LD 50 (median fatal dosage) indicates the immediate or acute toxicity of substances that were determined to be the most effective in the investigation. Hence, the complexes of these compounds were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations and the results were analysed with the results of apo form of MAPK6 (7AQB). The complexes were validated by interpreting the RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA and the lead phytochemical complexes were found to be stable during the simulations.",

This study looked at the antioxidant properties of bioactive chemicals found in the south Indian cuisine, Rasam against oxidative stress-induced human malignancies. In the human body, ROS is a metabolic by-product of cellular respiration. Oxidative stress and overexpression of MAPK6 protein are caused by an increase in ROS levels. MAPK6 overexpression causes a cascade of events in cells, including mutations and carcinogenesis. Through a thorough pharmacoinformatics-based molecular docking investigation of bioactive substances against MAPK6, the antioxidant potential of Rasam has been proven in the current work. In silico molecular docking investigations found that the four lead phytochemicals (Assafoetidinol A, Naringin, Rutin, and Tomatine) may suppress MAPK6/ERK3 expression. In addition, MD stimulation tests and in silico pharmacokinetic prediction analyses gives the safety profile of four lead compounds as well as the stability of the protein-ligand complex, although, in order to determine the Rasam's effectiveness, further in vitro and in vivo animal research work will be necessary.
