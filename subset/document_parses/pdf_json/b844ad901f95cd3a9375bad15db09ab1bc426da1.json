As greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the unprecedented threat of climate change has belatedly prompted an increased awareness of critical care's environmental impact. Within our role as pediatric critical care providers, we have a dual responsibility not only to care for children at their most vulnerable, but also to advocate on their behalf. There are clear, demonstrable effects of our worsening climate on the health of children, with the resultant increased burden of pediatric critical illness and disruption to health care systems. From increasing wildfires and their effect on lung health, to the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue, and the increased migration of children due to a changing climate, the effects of a changing climate are here, and we are beginning to see the changing epidemiology of pediatric critical illness. Ensuring that the effects of ongoing changes are minimized, including its future effects on child health, requires a multifaceted approach. As part of this review, we will use the Lancet Countdown on Climate Change indicators to explore the impact of pediatric critical care on climate change and the inevitable influence climate change will have on the future practice of pediatric critical care globally.",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group 1 in 2013 stated the warming of the climate system is unequivocal and that human influence was the dominant cause (4) . With limited progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 (5) , the current and future detrimental effect on health is felt to be irrefutable (6) (7) (8) (9) , despite the fragmented evidence base, particularly in low-income countries (10) . In 2004, \u223c0.2% of global deaths were attributable to climate change, 85% of which were children (11). Current estimates place an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050 secondary to climate change, the vast majority of which will be under the age of 5 years (12) . Children are projected to bear 88% of the burden of the disease related to climate change (13, 14) . With this clear direct impact on children's well-being, many consider the anthropogenic global warming a violation of the rights of future people (15) .",

What can we do therefore as practitioners to not only reduce our input into the climate emergency but also respond to the already initiated changes? The \"Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change\" is a global collaboration tracking progress of a number of indicators across five domains relating to health, climate change, and their implications for national governments (6) . As part of this review, we will use and highlight those Lancet indicators relevant to the care of critically ill children. The impact of pediatric critical care on climate change will be explored, and the inevitable influence climate change will have on the practice of pediatric critical care globally discussed (Figure 1) .",

The health and social care sector of England represented 6.3% of the total nation's carbon footprint emissions in 2017. Almost two-thirds are accounted by supply chain emissions, one-fourth from core (including building's energy use), and one-eighth from the community including patient travel and staff commuting (21). In 2016, health care in the United States contributed to 10% of the country's entire CO 2 footprint (19) , 7% in Australia (20), and 3.5% in India (28) . Globally, health care sectors were responsible for 4.4% of the global total CO 2 emissions in 2014 (28) . Significant progress can be made, however, with the implementation of legal targets and political will, as evidenced by the reduction in total health and social care emissions by 18.5% in England over the last decade (21, 29). The total emissions per bed day in a critical care unit were calculated to be approximately equivalent to 9 kg of CO 2 (CO 2 e) (not including heating, travel, or procurement) (30) . Prior work has demonstrated the daily carbon footprint of treating one adult intensive care patient (178 kg CO 2 e) with septic shock in the United States to be equivalent to the total daily carbon output of 3.5 Americans (31).

The majority of morphine's carbon footprint, perhaps the most commonly used pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) medication, was found to derive from sterilization and packaging, with the production of every 100 mg of morphine sulfate having an emission of 204 g CO 2 , equivalent to that of the emissions of driving 1 km in an average car (32) . The overall carbon footprint of pharmaceuticals is high when consideration is given to the chemicals used, the degree of refinement required in factories, transportation costs, and the fact that a large proportion go to waste (33) . Potential actionable routes for individual units, hospitals, and governments to take may include an environmental rating for drugs (34) and a preference to use those medications with a lower environmental impact.",

A 10-bed Australian intensive care unit (ICU) at a 320-bed hospital produced 5% of total hospital waste, approximately, 44% of which was recyclable, with almost 60% of the ICU general waste suitable for recycling (36) . A later audit revealed only 15% of the waste to be recyclable, with almost half (70 kg of 145 kg) actually recycled. The estimated cost was \u223c$13 per week (37) . An average of 3.4 kg of single-use materials per patients per day (31) was used. This predominantly plastic produces, for a 20-bed PICU with 90% occupancy year-round, 22,338 kg of plastic annually, equivalent to 134,028 kg of CO 2 . For reference, this is approximately equivalent to the emissions from half a million kilometers driven by the average passenger car. Recycling itself is, however, energy-intensive, especially in a health care setting where high reprocessing standards must be (38) , and initial outlay high. Addressing this high initial cost may be difficult to justify, particularly in areas where resources are limited, and finances best diverted to actual patient care.",

It is already playing an increasing role in the fight against recent outbreaks. With health care-related travel accounting for around 5% of all road travels in England each year (21)-patient travel and staff commuting the largest contributory sources-limiting unnecessary travel and promoting work from home needs to be encouraged. There are limitations associated with the use of telemedicine in pediatric critical care, however, including the obvious inability to examine patients, privacy, and security concerns related to patient data and the initial setup cost. An example of a direct contribution pediatric critical care has on climate change is air travel related to the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies (WFPICCS) meetings. The carbon dioxide emissions were calculated for air travel to and from the meeting site for the nations with the 20 leading delegates. Carbon dioxide emissions were calculated according to the universally determined model, incorporating the type of airplane likely used and assuming an average occupancy of the plane. Emissions were calculated for 3,556 delegates for the three meetings (78.7% of the total 4,520 delegates). Total emissions for flying the majority of delegates to the three meetings were 760 tons for Istanbul, 856 tons for Toronto, and 1,148 tons for Singapore (Supplementary Table 1) . For the purposes of large conferences, where a stated goal is to build community, virtual meetings likely do not satisfy these goals. Medical conferences will still play a role for advancing our fieldresearch presented at meetings in face-to-face conversations is cited more highly than that which has not (43) , and scientific progress in our field has direct impact on the lives of sick children, including those affected by a changing climate.

With limited ability and infrastructure to mitigate the impact of climate change, those working in an LMIC setting will undoubtedly face the greatest challenges, while being the ones least responsible for its causes (Figure 2) . The United Nations Environment found that nearly a quarter of all deaths globally in 2012 could be attributed to modifiable environmental risks, with a greater portion occurring in populations in a vulnerable situation and in developing countries (55) . In Sub-Sahara Africa, total annual expenditure on health is commonly under US $25 per capita and often <3% of the gross domestic product, compared to 8.5% in the United States (56) . With limited budgets and challenges accessing international climate finance for health, many nations do not have a national health and climate change strategy, let alone the means to implement it (57) . Furthermore, the number of intensive care beds as a percentage of hospital beds is \u223c1.5% in LMICs compared to 2.5 to 9% in high-income countries (58) . Concerns extend to dealing with increased and unexpected acute demand, blackouts caused by disruption to the power supply, increased air conditioning use if present, and coping with extreme heat (59) . As the link between climate change and the increasing frequency of natural disasters and variable rainfall continues to be explored, the impact of both acute and longer-term weather events on medical care and societies in LMICs will be devastating. Loss of medical records, damage to water supplies and sanitation, and interruption to medical supply chains from extreme weather events are real and pressing fears (60, 61). In addition, health access for climate refugees may be restricted, and staff and patients experience great difficulties in physically accessing the hospital (62) secondary to natural disasters. At present, 1.6 billion people live in places where protracted crises (including famine, conflict, drought, and population displacement), and weak health care services leave them without access to basic care (63).",

However, because of changes in vector distribution and environmental suitability (6, 69) , vector-borne diseases are emerging in previously unaffected regions. Of particular relevance to pediatric critical care is the rapid increase in dengue fever (6) , especially in South East Asia. The incidence and severity of respiratory infections may alter over the coming years, with potential increases in bacterial pneumonia and influenza and a reduction in respiratory syncytial virus during the milder winters (70) . Managing this population of high-risk, critically unwell individuals with little physiological reserve in settings with strained health systems due to acute weather events, migration, or conflict will be challenging and require a global coordinated response. In addition to the potentially disrupted medical and utilities infrastructures, a compromised vaccination program and restricted medication availability are all prime breeding grounds for epidemics (71) . Higher temperatures and humidity will lead to an increased risk of food and water borne diseases (17) .",

A rise in demand, with a predominance of heat-related disorders, respiratory illness, and climate-sensitive diseases, interspersed with the direct and indirect effects of extreme weather events on health and infrastructure, will challenge us all ( Table 2) . Critical care skills and experience are relevant to each of the WHO's six common \"building blocks\" for health systems, although importantly critical care is not limited to the ICU. The timely provision of antibiotics to a child with pneumonia is every bit as critical as establishing a periarrest patient on extracorporeal life support (73) , and the occurrence of the former will be of vital importance to the vast majority affected by climate change.",

We should ensure that staff, our units, hospitals, and local authorities are all aware of the likely impact climate change will have on us all over the coming years and the increased demand on critical care resources and services that will ensue.
