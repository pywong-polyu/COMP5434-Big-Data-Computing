Soon after the coronavirus became a widely understood threat, the internet was awash in false -sometimes downright harmful -information about preventing and treating COVID-19. Included within this misleading health information were premature claims by some prominent government officials that therapeutics like chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might hold promise as a repurposed drug for COVID-19. Such unfounded advice caused avoidable poisonings from people self-medicating with chloroquine. Subsequent clinical investigations demonstrated no notable benefit and potential adverse reactions to chloroquine when used to treat COVID-19. Such unfortunate events remind us that preliminary findings may be misinterpreted as conclusive treatments or as evidence to support inconclusive health claims. The hyperparameters tested in our experiments are presented in Section F It is certainly possible to improve the accuracies of our experiments by conducting a vaster coverage of the loss landscape through more extensive training (e.g. running longer experiments with smaller learning rates on more complex network architectures), especially for results in Experiment II. However, due to performance constraints, the scope of hyperparameter tuning as well as the ANN architectures experimented on are relatively constrained as we focused on the methodology as opposed to optimal performance in this study. It should be noted that much improvement is possible in this front, as pointed out in Discussion and Future Work. Additional notes regarding our observations during hyperparameter tuning are presented below.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Broader Impact"}, {"text": "\u2022 For the threshold, we wanted to predict eagerly, i.e. we considered false negatives more costly errors than false positives. A high threshold would mean the outputs would be composed only of the antivirals our models are very confident about per amino acid sequence. This we deem undesirable, as while we do hope these outputs narrow the scope of antivirals to focus on, over-restricting could prevent antivirals that are predicted frequently yet with low probability be detected. A low threshold such as 0.2 filtered the number of antivirals sufficiently, but also left enough breathing room for the domain experts to draw their own conclusions on a per-drug basis. \u2022 While a larger sequence length cutoff was possible and not detrimental to the results, we deemed 500 a suitable trade-off in terms of performance versus accuracy, as many sequences do not reach lengths in the thousands to begin with. \u2022 As mentioned, the number of epochs trained could be increased, as we did not see dramatic signs of overfitting at 20 epochs or further. However, a flattening of the metrics were evident around 20 epochs with the hyperparameters listed, which therefore was selected a suitable stopping point.
