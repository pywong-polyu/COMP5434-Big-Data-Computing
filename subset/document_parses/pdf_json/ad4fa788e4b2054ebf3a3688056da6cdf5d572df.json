            "text": "Modelling the emergence of foodborne pathogens is a crucial step in the prediction and prevention of disease outbreaks. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that drive the evolution of such continuously adapting pathogens remain poorly understood. Here, we combine molecular genotyping with network science and Bayesian inference to infer directed genotype networks-and trace the emergence and evolutionary paths-of Salmonella Typhimurium (STM) from nine years of Australian disease surveillance data. We construct networks where nodes represent STM strains and directed edges represent evolutionary steps, presenting evidence that the structural (i.e., network-based) features are relevant to understanding the functional (i.e., fitness-based) progression of co-evolving STM strains. This is argued by showing that outbreak severity, i.e., prevalence, correlates to: (i) the network path length to the most prevalent node (r = \u22120.613, N = 690); and (ii) the network connected-component size (r = 0.739). Moreover, we uncover distinct exploration-exploitation pathways in the genetic space of STM, including a strong evolutionary drive through a transition region. This is examined via the 6,897 distinct evolutionary paths in the directed network, where we observe a dominant 66% of these paths decrease in network centrality, whilst increasing in prevalence. Furthermore, 72.4% of all paths originate in the transition region, with 64% of those following the dominant direction. Further, we find that the length of an evolutionary path strongly correlates to its increase in prevalence (r = 0.497). Combined, these findings indicate that longer evolutionary paths result in genetically rare and virulent strains, which mostly evolve from a single transition point. Our results not only validate our widely-applicable approach for inferring directed genotype networks from data, but also provide a unique insight into the elusive functional and structural drivers of STM bacteria.",

The ability to function effectively arises in complex networks not from individual nodes, but rather from the way they interact and process information [27] [28] [29] : the function is constrained by the structure, and the structure reconfigures due to function. In this study we consider the evolutionary aspect of epidemics as part of the \"function\" (i.e., fitness), ascribed to rapidly adapting pathogens. We then relate this function to the \"structure\" revealed in the network topology, formed by connecting genotypes of microorganisms observable over time.",

Thus, our specific aim is to identify distinct evolutionary pathways within the STM population, and show that emergence of virulent STM strains is guided by an evolutionary drive, rather than with random sets of co-circulating STM genotypes [31, 32] .

The temporal threshold of an edge requires that an existing strain, within genetic proximity, occur within a certain number of days (\"pre-window\") of the new strain, or no-more than a certain number of days after it (\"post-window\"). The post-window accounts for possible delays in case isolation, e.g., from a delay in symptom-onset or analysis. For two strains that are genetically close and have their first instances detected within the post-window of each other this may lead to a bidirectional network edge. The Bayesian inference algorithm that dynamically identifies plausible temporal pre-and post-windows, given the genetic distance between predecessor and successor profiles, is described in Materials and methods. Thus, the directionality of the inferred edge is determined by the chronological synchrony of the reported STM cases, given their MLVA difference.

For each profile, an overlapping clustering algorithm groups all neighbours of the profile within a certain threshold distance G max , as described in Materials and methods. This allows us to compute the average cluster prevalence approximating the average virulence across genetically close strains. This clustering produces an underlying undirected network, where we characterize each node (MLVA profile) in terms of two quantities: (i) the average prevalence of the immediate cluster of the node, that is, the average prevalence of genetically close MLVA profiles, (ii) the centrality of the node within the corresponding undirected genetic network (where network centrality is suitably defined, see Materials and methods). The average prevalence of a network node (MLVA profile) represents the average strength of outbreaks associated with the genetically close strains. On the other hand, the centrality of the node within the entire weighted network quantifies how genetically connected it is overall with other strains. The network comprises 690 connected nodes and 1,020 directed edges, with each node representing an MLVA profile and each edge representing an inferred evolutionary step. In addition, each profile may be associated with a cluster of other profiles within a genetic distance G. Formally, the cluster C i associated with node i is given by C i = {j: G ij \ufffd G max }, for some threshold G max (Materials and methods). The size of the nodes represents the average prevalence within this cluster approximating the average virulence across closely related strains. In this network, the node associated with the most prevalent cluster (profile 3-9-7-17-523) is highlighted and circled in orange. The color of all other nodes illustrates their genetic distance to this reference node, from light green (closest) to dark (farthest). The layout of nodes is given by Cytoscape's edge-weighted spring-embedded algorithm, which groups together cliques of nodes. From this graph, we can capture a potential evolutionary path between two connected nodes as a sequence of directed edges between them, as described in Model. We highlight three case studies as paths in magenta, blue, and red that contain eleven, nine, and five STM strains respectively. These paths include profiles associated with outbreaks previously investigated by the Australian Department of Health (see Materials and methods). The path shown in magenta includes (as the 9th node) profile 3-10-7-14-523, which caused a significant outbreak in October 2013.

Moreover, there are two branches distinguishable in the space formed by node centrality and cluster prevalence. The first, lower, branch develops from weakly-prevalent and peripheral nodes (the bottom-left corner of Fig 3) , towards a region comprising the profiles with high centrality and medium cluster prevalence, i.e., node centrality between 0.033 and 0.036, and cluster prevalence between 12 and 32.1.

It will be specifically analyzed later on, in terms of a transition to the second, upper, branch which continues from this region in the direction of increasing prevalence (bottom to top) and decreasing centrality (right to left), towards a reference profile shown in orange in Fig 3. We find that the gradient of coloring, set with respect to the most prevalent cluster (MLVA 3-9-7-17-523), i.e., our reference point, indicates the presence of an evolutionary pathway along the upper branch: from the highly-central nodes with medium cluster prevalence towards the most prevalent and very \"successful\" clusters (i.e., right-to-left and bottom-to-top). In addition, the gradient highlights a somewhat punctuated evolution along the lower branch from the weakly-prevalent periphery toward highly-central, but not yet most dominant, nodes (i.e., left-to-right and bottom-to-top).

The points with higher than 75% of the maximum expected value form a well-defined region within the centrality-prevalence space. Specifically, it is shaped by high centrality (i.e., between 0.033 and 0.036) and medium cluster prevalence (i.e., between 12 and 32.1), and so emerges as the transition region. The evolutionary paths starting from profiles contained within this region tend to produce a higher average change in prevalence and are thus considered more successful.

While increasing the average cluster prevalence, this pathway initially follows from low to high centrality (left-toright), and then reverses its direction from high to medium centrality (right-to-left). This function-structure correlation is also confirmed by Fig 6 which: (i) traces the average prevalence as a function of the distance to the most prevalent (reference) node, as well as (ii) compares the average prevalence with the size of connected components in the directed network. Firstly, the average prevalence is shown to decrease as the distance to the reference node grows, with a high correlation between log prevalence and distance, calculated as r = \u22120.613 (N = 690, p < 0.00001). In other words, the main evolutionary pathway is well-formed along both genetic branches, despite being somewhat punctuated at the low-to-medium centrality branch, as indicated by a step-wise character of the prevalence increases ( Fig 6A) . Secondly, as the prevalence grows, the average size of the connected components within the directed genotype network grows as well (Fig 6B) . This high correlation between log prevalence and log component size (measured as r = 0.739 (N = 690, p < 0.00001)) indicates that the network itself becomes more interconnected along the main evolutionary pathway. It is interesting to contrast these two log-linear relationships with the nonlinear pathway-reversal in the prevalence-centrality space (Fig 3) , where the centrality quantifies a more subtle topological role of individual nodes, rather than the more coarse connectedness within multi-node network components.",

The absolute majority of the identified paths (66% of the paths, or 4,532 out of 6,897 paths) lead from right-to-left (reducing centrality) while going from bottom-to-top (increasing average prevalence). Furthermore, 72.4% of all paths originate from the transition region described above, and 64% of the paths starting in this region follow the RL-BT direction, amounting to 46.3% of all paths, see S6 Fig. We point out that there are only 2.87% of the all 1,673 nodes in the transition region. These observations strongly suggest a preferential evolutionary drive within the STM population (Fig 7) . In other words, these paths evolve in a certain direction, RL-BT, in the centrality-prevalence space shown in Fig 3. We reiterate that the RL-BT direction is aligned with the \"exploitative\" branch pointed towards the most prevalent nodes. Furthermore, there is a significant correlation between the path length and the change in the average prevalence, measured as r = 0.497 (N = 6, 897, p = 0), see S7 Fig. Importantly, on this evolutionary pathway, longer paths are more likely to achieve higher prevalence: as the path length increases, a higher number of paths are associated with this dominant direction (RL-BT). As Fig 7 illustrates , this is not the case for three other possible directions, including the \"explorative\" branch pointed towards both higher prevalence and higher centrality (LR-BT).",

For example, the path shown in magenta passes through MLVA profile 3-10-7-14-523, which caused a significant outbreak in October 2013. This successful path is exploitative (RL-BT), with profile 3-10-7-14-523 appearing as the 9th node, within the bottleneck region. Another exploitative path, shown in red, starts at the profile 3-16-9-11-523, which is associated with at least two outbreaks in February 2014 and September 2015. The placement of this path on the upper branch indicates a strong potential for further outbreaks linked to its geneteic relatives along the path. We believe that the analysis of evolutionary paths in the centrality-prevalence space presents an effective means for classifying specific case studies and informing disease surveillance in general.",

In the latter case, the correlation of path length to change in prevalence is not tangible at r = \u22120.121. Although the preferential pathway is still discernible in the direction (RL-BT), it is less dominant, with only 41% of the identified paths following it (Fig 7A) .

In inferring the directed network, however, we define the distance G between two MLVA profiles in two, more constrained, ways which capture two opposing perspectives. The first definition sets multiple-loci distance, G ffl ij , as the number of loci which differ by at most one tandemrepeat, that is, 1 \ufffd G ffl \ufffd 5. Consequently, if two MLVA profiles i and j differ in any locus by more than one tandem repeat, they are considered as unrelated (distance is G ffl ij set to infinity). The second definition, single-locus distance, G y ij , restricts the differences between the tandemrepeats to only one locus, but allows profiles to disagree by more than one tandem-repeat. In other words, the multiple-loci distance captures dispersed but limited genetic variations across several loci, and may consider two profiles as genotypical neighbors if they differ by one tandem-repeat in each of their loci (for example, distance G ffl ij \u00bc 3 indicates that the two profiles differ in three loci, but only by one tandem-repeat in each). On other hand, the single-locus distance quantifies local but variable genetic variations, and would consider genetic proximity only when the profiles differ in one locus (for example, distance G y ij \u00bc 3 means that the two profiles disagree only in one locus, but by three tandem-repeats).",

Formally, the cluster C i associated with node i is given by C i = {j: G ij \ufffd G max }, for some threshold G max . Following [25] , we set G max = 5. Each node (i.e., profile) is associated with at least one cluster, even if that cluster only contains a single node. An interesting example is given by MLVA profile 3-9-7-12-622 (or 3-9-7-12-17 after the adjustment to match the study of Larsson et al. [41] ): it has the individual prevalence of only 1, having been detected only once over the study period, but its average cluster prevalence is among the highest [25] . The reason is that there are multiple other MLVA profiles within the distance G max = 5 from this profile, and some of these cluster neighbours show very high individual prevalence. The overlapping clustering algorithm that we employ aims to approximate the average virulence across such genetic neghbourhoods, which may correspond to various clonal complexes, groups, etc. S11-S14 Figs compare the centrality-prevalence spaces and the corresponding correlations, obtained for different thresholds G max : 0, 3, 5, 10.",

The dataset contains 17,005 cases of STM, which comprises 98.7% of all isolated cases in NSW over this 3,287 day period. The profiles are sorted according to the date of their first detection-resulting in a diagonal outline-indicating that new MLVA profiles are usually detected regularly throughout the observational period. Once detected, the profiles typically continue to be observed in the dataset. Three actual case studies associated with outbreaks previously investigated by the Australian Department of Health (see Materials and methods) are highlighted in different colors, illustrating distinct MLVA profiles that are grouped according to their genetic and temporal proximity (that is, profiles with the same color lie on the same inferred evolutionary path). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008401.g001",

Intensity of each colour indicates the estimated probability density, given the average changes in prevalence for either positive or negative profiles. Similar toFig 4,the transition region (intense red colour) is shaped by the successful profiles with high centrality and medium cluster prevalence. The evolutionary paths originating from profiles in this region tend to develop from right to left and from bottom to top, producing the higher average change in prevalence. Conversely, the bottleneck region (intense blue colour) is formed by unsuccessful profiles with the centrality around 0.03 and the cluster prevalence just below 10 2 . The evolutionary paths originating from these profiles tend to follow the opposite direction: from left to right and from top to bottom, reducing their prevalence on average. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008401.g005",

Each point represents a node (MLVA profile), with the y-axis as the average prevalence of that profile's undirected cluster. A: this prevalence as a function of the distance to the reference node (the orange node in Figs 2 and 3). B: each node's prevalence is compared with the size of its connected-component in the directed network. The trend is punctuated: the prevalence increases in a stepwise fashion with decreasing distance (from successful strains), or increasing connected-component size (connectivity of the node). For the sample size of N = 690 connected nodes, the correlation between log prevalence and distance is r = \u22120.613 (N = 690, p < 0.0001) and between log prevalence and log component size is r = 0.739 (N = 690, p < 0.0001).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008401.g006",

            "text": "Evidence for an evolutionary drive within the STM population. The 1,020 edges in the genotype network yield 6,897 potential evolutionary paths. The subfigures show the proportion and number of paths evolving in a certain direction in the centrality-prevalence state space fromFig 3.This direction depends on the start and end-points of the path: right-to-left (RL), left-to-right (LR), top-to-bottom (TB), and bottom-to-top (BT). For instance, the first case study (magenta) is categorised as RL-BT (with ten edges), while the second case study (blue) follows the RL-TB direction (with eight edges). The absolute majority of paths (66%, or 4,532 paths) are shown to travel from the right-to-left (RL, decrease in centrality) and the bottom-to-top (BT, increase in prevalence), as shown in the figure legends. Further, the correlation between the path length and the change in prevalence is r = 0.497 (M = 6,897, p < 0.00001). A: as the path length increases, a higher number of paths are associated with this dominant direction. B: a majority of these paths are within the range of 6-12 edges; the smaller set of longer paths (above 12 edges) all decrease in centrality, mostly capturing exploitative adaptation (RL-BT) with a minority attributed to unsuccessful exploration (RL-TB).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008401.g007",
