Although the plant is known to treat ulcers, there is no significant scientific validation. e present study aimed to assess the acute toxicity, subacute toxicity, and antiulcer properties of the leaf methanol extract of I. wightii (IWL). In the subacute study, the extracts were given orally at 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg doses for 28 days, and we analyzed the biochemical and histological parameters to evaluate the toxicity of IWL. Two different models were assessed to explore antiulcer properties, such as indomethacin-and ethanol-induced ulcer model. Ulcer areas and ulceration percentage histopathology of the stomach were used to study the efficacy of extracts. e acute toxicity study showed that IWL was safe to the maximum dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight. In a subacute toxicity study, the oral administration of IWL did not produce any mortality in the tested animals. e analysis of haematological, liver biochemical, kidney profile, lipid profile, and in vivo antioxidant parameters depicted that all the values were within the control limits after the experimental period and were considered nontoxic to animals. Additionally, the antiulcer study demonstrated a positive response of IWL in a dose-related manner (indomethacin-and ethanol-induced models). Macroscopic analysis showed that pretreatment with I. wightii leaf methanol extract significantly reduced the gastric lesion and decreased the ulceration area (14.52 mm 2 ), demonstrating superior results to the positive control group (27.71 mm 2 ). e histopathological analysis revealed that pretreatment with a high dose of 400 mg/kg of I. wightii leaf methanol extract and positive control group (omeprazole) markedly protected pathological effects, and the gastric mucosa appeared normal. In conclusion, I. wightii has solid nontoxic potential as a promising native herb for an integral therapy for the treatment of ulcers.",

More than a few hundred medicinal plants, for-instance Aglaonema hookerianum [5] , Alstonia scholaris [6] , Andrographis paniculata [7] , Lepidagathis hyaline [8] , Ophiorrhiza rugosa [9] , Psychotria calocarpa [10] , Spirulina platensis [11] , and Syzygium fruticosum [12] , are widely used as therapeutic sources because of their active principles. India is an ethnobotanically diverse country since traditional medicine relies on ethnic groups for primary health. India has about 35,000 plants, which have several medicinal values, among which 8000 plant species are used in traditional medicine to improve health conditions. However, scientific validation and the effectiveness of many plants have not been welldocumented so far [13] . Phytochemicals could be extracted successfully from medicinal plants for a wide range of use as preventive or therapeutic medicine to treat cancer, liver disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure [14] .",

Most developed nations exert certain regulations and have developed reliable strategies for monitoring the safety and standardization of these products while providing quality assurance for any of such natural substances [20] . However, many traditional and complementary medicine practitioners often refute the WHO certification scheme to regulate the quality of medicinal products [21] . It explains why divergent opinions exist on the various applications of medicinal herbs [22] . Also, it constitutes a setback against the scientific justification of folklore medicines applications [23] . ree crucial steps must be followed to ensure and maintain the quality, efficacy, and safety profile of herbal drugs. Firstly, there must be a study to show the safety profiles of any compound/ product that is claimed to be beneficial to a living organism. e second is to assess the chemical constituents of the traditional medicinal agent. Lastly, it is to set the guidelines to investigate the proposed folklore application, which is a step toward drug development and discovery [24, 25] . erefore, there has been an increased effort to identify herbal-derived therapeutic agents with reduced side effects to treat the ailment. In many eastern countries, traditional medicines in the mode of herbal extracts have been used to treat diseases. On the other hand, herbal medicine can be further examined before their use regarding the toxicity [26] .",

Gastric ulcer is caused by injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa by smoking, stress, alcohol consumption, prolonged ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), gastric acid hypersecretion, pepsin activity, gastric contractions, gastric mucosa ischemia, and infection by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori [27] . It is well-known that orally consumed ethanol is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream from the stomach and intestine. A high concentration of ethanol directly destroys the gastric mucosa. Currently, gastric ulcers are managed by chemical and cytoprotective drugs. However, most of these drugs have side effects, such as joint pain, altered heartbeat, hemopoietic changes, gynecomastia, cancer, and systemic alkalosis [28, 29] . e number of plant-derived phytocompounds, such as curcumin [3] , cannabidiol [30, 31] , and palmitoylethanolamide, [32] [33] [34] are used to treat gastric ulcers [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] .

Choisy belonging to the family Convolvulaceae has long been used in traditional herbal medicine in India and Africa. e family comprises nearly 1600 species that are widely distributed worldwide. It is a perennial herb with twining or prostrate stem from tropical Asia. e leaves were used as a leafy vegetable by Paliyar or Paliyan tribes in Southern India [35] . e ashes of the plant are used to treat leprosy by many. In Rwanda, leaf extracts were taken orally to treat liver complaints, whereas the root is taken against a cough in East Africa, and the leaf was used to treat stomachache and ulcer [36] . In this perspective, Ipomoea wightii has immense therapeutic potential, which must be investigated scientifically. With this background and existing meager reports on the scientific evidence of this species, the present study was designed for exploring toxicological profile by acute, subacute toxicity, and antiulcer potential of Ipomoea wightii using in vivo animal models by the evaluation of haematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters. e powdered leaf materials (100 g) were packed in small thimbles using Whatman No. 1 filter paper (Imperial Scientific Works, Coimbatore, India) and extracted with solvents (500 mL), such as petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water, in the increasing order of their polarity using Soxhlet apparatus. Each time before extracting with the next solvent, the thimble was dried in a hot air oven (New Lab, Newlab Equipments, Coimbatore, India) at 35\u00b0C. Based on the activity for further studies, the methanol extract was selected and concentrated in a rotary vacuum evaporator and stored in a deep freezer at \u221220\u00b0C (BFS-150, Celfrost Innovations Pvt. Ltd., Haryana, India).",

Even with advances in herbal medicine, medicinal plants continue to be used without any scientific basis and have survived for generations only in terms of their widespread use. However, toxicology studies show that many plants are harmful or even lethal because of their toxicity [49, 50] . Even the most effective traditional plants should not be used as a therapeutic unless their toxic parameters are adequately assessed. A complete scientific toxicology assessment is mandatory for using a plant for its medicinal effects [50] . e present study investigated the toxicity of the IWL extract through in vivo biochemical and hematological parameters.",

According to Feres et al., if 10% of the initial body weight is lost, then that the animal should not survive, which is a sign of adverse side effect [54] . However, the present study shows that no animals lost weight. It can be said that growth retardation does not occur during the continuous doses of the IWL extract. Similarly, changes in organ weight are present in the levels of toxicity in animals, which are immediately determined by toxicity tests. When herbal products are ingested, they can be toxic to vital organs, such as the kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain, because of their different roles in the human body. Based on the findings in body weight and the nonsignificant increase in organ weights and index, it can be said that IWL extract is nontoxic to animals. e hematological analysis is fundamental because the hematopoietic system is one of the most critical targets for toxic compounds. It provides an important indicator of humans and animals' physiological and pathological status [55] . No mortality was reported in subacute toxicity assessments performed with 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg IWL extract doses. In hematological parameters, rats treated with 400 mg/kg of IWL extract showed an increase in the number of red blood cells and a decrease in lymphocytes (80.17%), with respect to the vehicle control (80.83%).",

Ethanol consumption is known to be one of many factors responsible for gastric ulcer formation because of the production of oxygen-derived free radicals, such as superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and lipid peroxides [64, 65] . Another important common feature of gastric mucosal injury is acute ethanol ingestion observed in alcoholics, and since available antiulcer agents display many side effects [61] , there is a need to develop highly effective and safer antiulcer agents. e present study demonstrated that animals pretreated with I. wightii leaf possess a dosedependent protection ability of mucosal layer damage compared to the negative control rats. Also, it was observed that in reducing the epithelial cells damage, I. wightii leaf efficacy was slightly higher than the standard drug. e screening of the plant potential against ethanol and indomethacin-induced damage was observed in this study. e animals treated with I. wightii leaf extract before administering ethanol and indomethacin significantly reduced the number of ulcer spots and ulcer index. It may be because of the cytoprotective effect of the extract via an antioxidant effect. e considerable raise in the antiulcer activity of I. wightii could be attributed to flavonoids and tannins. It is suggested that these active compounds would stimulate mucous bicarbonate and inhibit prostaglandin secretion and counteract the liberating effect of reactive oxygen in the gastrointestinal lumen [66] .",
