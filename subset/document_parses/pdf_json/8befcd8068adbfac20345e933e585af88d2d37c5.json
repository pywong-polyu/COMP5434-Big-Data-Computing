While vaccinations protect the recipients from mortality and morbidity, they also bear some risks to that individual, and some of the vaccination's benefits are enjoyed by others as the population moves toward herd immunity. Accordingly, individual decisions may not alone reach socially efficient levels of vaccination (Robertson et al., 2020) .",

The first of these, Ohio's Vax-A-Million program, was announced on May 12, 2021. According to our systematic review of public announcements and media reports, 18 states have instituted vaccine lotteries as of July 7, 2021. 1 Smaller drawing-based incentives have been effective for encouraging a range of health behaviors (Kimmel et al., 2012; Sen et al., 2014; Patel et al., 2018) . Nonetheless, behavioral economists and ethicists have prominently suggested that ''financial incentives are likely to discourage vaccination'' (Volpp et al., 2021) or ''stoke new fears and, perversely, increase resistance to vaccination'' (Largent and Miller, 2021) .",

Likewise, an unpublished study using synthetic controls and full vaccination as the outcome found no effect for the lottery (Lang et al., 2021) . Another unpublished study, using both differences-in-differences and synthetic controls, found that the Ohio lottery ''increased first dose Covid-19 vaccinations by between 50,000 and 100,000'' at a cost of about $112 per starting dose (Brehm et al., 2021) . In this paper, we expand beyond the work on Ohio and look across all current vaccine schemes to evaluate their effects on state vaccination rates.

For example, at least in some states, policymakers were induced to opt for lottery schemes because of systematically low vaccination rates relative to their counterparts.
