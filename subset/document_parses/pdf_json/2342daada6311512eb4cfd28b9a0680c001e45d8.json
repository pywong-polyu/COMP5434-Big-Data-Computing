Silk fibroin backbones were cross-linked using horseradish peroxide/H 2 O 2 to form printed hydrogel scaffolds. OBC with a concentration of 7wt% increased the viscosity of inks during the printing process and further improved the shape fidelity of the scaffolds. Rheological measurements and image analyses were performed to evaluate inks printability and print shape fidelity. Three-dimensional construct with ten layers could be printed with ink of 1SF-2OBC (SF/OBC = 1/2, w/w). The composite hydrogel of 1SF-1OBC (SF/OBC = 1/1, w/w) printed at 25\u00b0C exhibited a significantly improved compressive strength of 267 \u00b1 13 kPa and a compressive stiffness of 325 \u00b1 14 kPa at 30% strain, respectively. The optimized printing parameters for 1SF-1OBC were 0.3 bar of printing pressure, 45 mm/s of printing speed and 410 lm of nozzle diameter. Furthermore, OBC nanofibrils could be induced to align along the print lines over 60% degree of orientation, which were analyzed by SEM and X-ray diffraction. The orientation of OBC nanofibrils along print lines provided physical cues for guiding the Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.Cellulose https://doi.org/10.1007/s10570-020-03526-7( 0123456789().,-volV) ( 01234567 89().,-volV) orientation of lung epithelial stem cells, which maintained the ability to proliferate and kept epithelial phenotype after 7 days' culture.

            "text": "Pulmonary disease, especially COVID-19, is a worldwide public health problem recently. Transplantation of lung suffers the shortage of donors as well as inevitable immunosuppressive drugs for patients. Lung tissue engineering shows an alternative to relieve the problems of shortage of lung transplantation (Tebyanian et al. 2019) and is beneficial to the recovery of patients' lung. Biological scaffolds made by threedimensional printing technology combining regenerative cell population is an attracting candidate strategy for lung tissue engineering. Natural polymers or synthetic polymers have been introduced to the scaffold's studies of lung tissue. For example, decellularized scaffolds from human or animals, collagen type I-GAG, gelatin, polyglycolic acid (PGA), poly-DL-lactic acid (PDLLA), poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), polylactic acid (PLLA), Pluronic F-127 etc. (Tebyanian et al. 2019; Wagner et al. 2014 ) However, synthetic polymers sometimes fail to drive the differentiation of cultured cells (Lin et al. 2006; Mondrinos et al. 2006) . In contrast, natural biomaterials are promising for constructing biomimetic extracellular matrix (ECM) for ex-vivo research of lung tissue engineering. Recently, 3D printing technology using biomaterials as inks offers a fascinating method for tissue engineering application. Various natural polymers-based biomaterials such as ECM components, alginate, chitosan, cellulose, starch, and silk fibroin, etc., have been used for bioink preparation (Aljohani et al. 2018) . Proteins and polysaccharides are the commonly used natural polymers-based biomaterial inks due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability and low immunogenicity properties (McCarthy et al. 2019; Moohan et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "Silk fibroin (SF) derived from silkworm cocoons (Bombyx mori) has been developed as an ink because of its excellent biocompatibility, low toxicity and immune reactivity in addition to its low bacterial adherence (Wlodarczyk-Biegun and Campo 2017) . SF is a fascinating material for the preparation of physically crosslinked ink. It is possible to induce a sol-to-gel transition in SF conformation from random coil to b-sheet using shear force (Ghosh et al. 2008) , sonication (Das et al. 2015) , polyols (Jose et al. 2015) , high temperature (Hu et al. 2011) , low pH (Terry et al. 2004) , etc. Physical cross-linking caused by dynamic and reversible bonding due to noncovalent interactions was mild and the corresponding SF hydrogel exhibited good cytocompatibility in cell-laden printing (Jungst et al. 2016 ). However, although the b-sheet domains of the SF hydrogel provided stiffness and tensile strength they exhibited poor elasticity (Yan 2016) . Enzymes have also been adopted to produce chemically-crosslinked SF hydrogel (Chawla et al. 2018; Das et al. 2015) . Approximately 5% tyrosine residues provide the phenol functional groups in the SF sequence (Murphy and Kaplan 2009 ) which can form dityrosine through an enzyme-mediated reaction in horseradish peroxide (HRP)/H 2 O 2 (Kurisawa et al. 2010) . The SF inks exhibited the required thinning behavior at low concentrations (\\ 20%) for printing prior to gelation (Chawla et al. 2018) . However, it is difficult to form a self-standing construct from pristine SF solution with high shape fidelity during printing. Therefore, bulk filling agents, e.g. gelatin (Das et al. 2015) , hydroxyapatite (Sun et al. 2012) or polyethylene glycol (Zheng et al. 2018 ) have been commonly used for SF-based inks. Even so, it has been a huge challenge for applications of SF-based inks due to their suboptimal printability and poor ECM mimicry in contemporary research.",

Furthermore, cellulose nanofibers are promising printer-friendly materials whose properties include shear thinning behavior, high zero shear viscosity, high shape fidelity, and structural stability when 3D printed (Cheng et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2019; Nimeskern et al. 2013; Schwarz et al. 2015) . Various cellulosic nanomaterials including cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), bacterial cellulose (BC) have been used as hydrogels or reinforced materials for 3D printing (Chinga-Carrasco 2018; Xu et al. 2018) . BC displays the unique physiochemical characteristics of highly pure and crystalline in comparison with plant cellulose (Moniri et al. 2017) . Recently, Dorishetty et al. reported for the first time the detailed effects of various kinds of nanocellulose, namely, BC, CNF, and CNC on the morphology, structure-property relationship, and 3D printability of the photochemically cross-linked SF/nanocellulose composite hydrogels. Results indicated that SF/BC composite hydrogel possessed the superior mechanical performance among the hydrogels (Dorishetty et al. 2020) . However, it has been found that clogging is experienced when pastes of cellulose nanofibers are used at high concentration ([ 0.8%) in 3D printing, due to the large bunches of fibers. For example, only very small quantities (0.7 wt%) of BC fibers were used for the printing of complicate SF/Gelatin mixture (Huang et al. 2019b ). Dorishetty et al. developed the SF/BC inks which could achieve a maximum cellulose content of about 5 wt% and could only print two layers structure. Higher resolution with 3D stereoscopic construct was difficult to achieve due to limited cellulose in inks (Dorishetty et al. 2020) . Because TEMPO-mediated oxidation helps reduce the adhesion and provide electrostatic repulsions between microfibrils by introducing certain amount of carboxylate groups, which facilitates the dispersion of cellulose nanofibers, especially BC. Therefore, this issue could be addressed by using TEMPO-mediated oxidation and co-solvents (Dai et al. 2019 ). In addition, the incorporation of cellulose nanofibrils into inks provides structural similarity of 3D printed scaffolds to ECMs which possess filamentous architecture, benefitting cell growth and phenotype maintenance in addition to providing tissue with specific properties (Huang et al. 2019a; Prince and Kumacheva 2019; Theocharis et al. 2016) . Therefore, artificial ECM-mimetic fibrillar hydrogels are important materials for use in tissue engineering applications.",

            "text": "At present, stem cell technologies have been the focus of considerable attention in organ transplantation and regenerative medicine due to their unique ability to proliferate and differentiate. However, stem cells are sensitive to their microenvironment and can be influenced by physical and chemical factors. On one hand, the poor viability, limited proliferation and undesirable differentiation of stem cells may be attributed to unsuitable matrices. On the other hand, the fate of stem cells can also be regulated by the specific design of the stem cell niche to satisfy the requirements of stem cells and thus direct their differentiation (Huang et al. 2019c; Prince and Kumacheva 2019) . For example, in mature lungs, cell polarity and orientation are important in the self-renewal/differentiation of epithelial cells and can impact normal physiological processes such as epithelial tissue branching and differentiation (El-Hashash and Warburton 2011; Plosa et al. 2012) . Therefore, it is of great benefit to provide essential structure and biophysical cues for lung tissue regeneration. In addition, lung tissue engineering is different from other forms of tissues engineering, for example skin or cartilage, in that it requires complex 3D structures comprising soft biological materials (Comber et al. 2019 ). However, traditional molding techniques do not easily lend themselves to the fabrication of intricate geometries or precise features. 3D bioprinting is an approach with the potential to produce scaffolds with sufficient complexity of high resolution using soft materials (Kang et al. 2016; Malda et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "Approximately 70% of the SF amino acid sequence consisted of repeat units of glycine, alanine and serine (Mita et al. 1988) . Tyrosine residues with a 4-hydroxyphenyl side groups occupied 5.3% of silk fibroin's composition (Chirila et al. 2017; Pereira et al. 2015) and can be used in chemical crosslinking, as shown in (Fig. 2a) . In addition, a sol-gel transition occurred over a narrow region of time for the SF solution (Fig. 2b) , while there was a broad time window in which SF-OBC composite inks were close to the critical point at the interface between liquid and solid (Fig. 2b) . Therefore, it was not possible to obtain shape retention characteristics for SF/HRP/H 2 O 2 inks prior to gelation, to allow smooth extrusion through the nozzle after gelation in the syringe. A strategy to maintain printability by adding OBC paste to SF inks was tested. Dispersed nanofibrils morphology of the bacterial cellulose following TEMPO-mediated oxidation is shown in TEM images in Fig. 1 . Native BC fibrils displayed an external network structure. Mechanical treatment alone was hardly sufficient to disintegrate the cellulose fibers into a homogeneous suspension of separate microfibrils (Moon et al. 2011) . Furthermore, there were large numbers of hydroxyl groups on the BC nanofibers, resulting in strong intra/intermolecular hydrogen bonds (Moon et al. 2011 ). The formation of aggregates caused a considerable barrier for the processing of the BC. However, after a number of hydroxyl groups of the BC were converted into carboxyl groups, the negatively charged nanofibrils dispersed well due to repulsive forces. The complex moduli of SF-OBC composite inks began to increase at approximately 1000 s, indicating the initiation of SF chain crosslinking, as displayed in Fig. 2c . All complex moduli of the composite inks exhibited a similar tendency with different concentrations of OBC. In addition, the complex moduli increased with increasing OBC ratio in the SF-OBC composite inks, as indicated by the red arrow in Fig. 2c . It has been reported that a b-sheet conformation could be induced in spider silk ink from an amorphous state under shearthinning without clogging (DeSimone et al. 2015) . It was impossible to print high concentrations of silk fibroin solution without additives due to frequent clogging during the shearing process (Das et al. 2013 ). SF at a concentration of 20 wt% displayed a tendency to shear-thinning at the low shear rates (\\ 1 s -1 ) but maintained constant at higher shear rates ([ 1 s -1 ), as shown in Fig. 2d . The results indicate that 20 wt% SF solution could flow through nozzle under shear force and did not have a negative impact on the printing of composite inks. Unfortunately, the low viscosity of the SF solution restricted printability. However, an OBC paste of 7 wt% (0SF-1OBC) exhibited not only shear thinning behavior, but also high zero shear viscosity, Fig. 2d . Therefore, cellulose nanofibril pastes were an ideal choice as inks for 3D bioprinting, also commonly used to modify the rheological behavior of 3D printing materials (Abouzeid et al. 2018; Markstedt et al. 2015; Ojansivu et al. 2019 ). The SF-OBC composite inks displayed similar shearthinning behavior and high zero shear viscosity properties of the OBC paste alone, as shown in Fig. 2d . Furthermore, OBC pastes significantly enhanced SF solution viscosity, as indicated by the red arrow in Fig. 2d , indicating promotional printability. SF-OBC composite inks displayed greater stability and higher storage moduli (G 0 ) than SF solutions due to the presence of OBC (Fig. 2e) . Furthermore, the G 0 of SF-OBC composite inks increased with higher OBC ratios, indicating the promotion of stability. In addition, G 0 values were considerably higher than the G 00 values across the frequency range for all composite inks, providing better initial shape fidelity and structural stability after extrusion. Oscillatory measurements at low strains were performed to assess the viscoelastic properties of the inks (Fig. 2f) . Storage moduli G 0 that were larger than loss moduli G 00 (G 0 [ G 00 ) prior to the cross point indicated a predominantly elastic behavior at low shear stresses. As stated previously, a solid-like behavior of hydrogel ink is crucial to maintain structural stability and shape fidelity and is therefore desirable for 3D printing (Sultan and Mathew 2018) . Composite inks exhibit well-defined dynamic yield stress values (G 0 = G 00 ) (Siqueira et al. 2017) increasing from 63 Pa (2SF-1OBC) to 593 Pa (0SF-1OBC) in the present study. The yield stress of 1SF-2OBC was 580 Pa, close to that of 0SF-1OBC. Higher OBC ratios resulted in higher shear yield stress, which had to be overcome during printing. This observation may guide the optimization of print parameters.",

Inks of 1SF-1OBC, 1SF-2OBC and 0SF-1OBC formed clear pores between print lines and the extruded lines were uniform, as presented in Fig. 3b d, f-h. The line width of the printed lines decreased at higher OBC concentrations meant improvement of printing resolution (Fig. 3i) . Furthermore, semi-quantitative evaluation was used to characterize printability, as shown in Fig. 3j , based on printed grids, in Fig. 3e -h. A P r value approaching 1 indicates higher printability (Kyle et al. 2017 ). The P r values of 1SF-1OBC, 1SF-2OBC and 0SF-1OBC gradually approached 1 as OBC content increased. The results demonstrate that OBC played a key role in facilitating the printability of SF solution. Therefore, scaffolds with more than two layers could be achieved as shown in the inserts of 1SF-1OBC, 1SF-2OBC and 0SF-1OBC in Fig. 3b -d. Furthermore, 3D construct with ten layers could be printed with ink of 1SF-2OBC as shown in Fig. S1 . The printing process with 1SF-1OBC ink can be seen in the video in the Supplementary data. Printing of scaffolds using OBC alone demonstrated the capability of producing high fidelity shaped scaffolds over 10 layers in the present study.",

            "text": "The morphologies of printed lines were observed after freeze-drying, as shown in Fig. 4a(i-iv) . The printed lines became smooth and uniform with higher concentrations of OBC, contributing to the retention of shape. Nanofibrils of OBC were observed in enlarged SEM images. The results in Fig. 4a (i-iii) indicate that OBC nanofibrils could be bonded together by SF hydrogel. Without SF, however, the OBC fibers were incompact in the printed lines of 0SF-1OBC, Fig. 4 a(iv). Furthermore, alignment of the OBC nanofibrils improved with higher ratios of OBC in the inks. These results were further supported by 2D-WAXD pattern of SF-OBC printed lines (Fig. 4b) . Their corresponding 1D-WAXD diffractograms and azimuthal profiles at d-spacing of 3.93 \u00c5 of SF-OBC printed lines are shown in Fig. 4c , d, respectively. In Fig. 4c , the broad peak at d-spacing of 4.07 \u00c5 indicates the amorphous structure of SF hydrogel which agrees with the results of FTIR in Fig. 5b . The sharp diffraction peaks at d-spacing of 5.28 \u00c5 , 3.95 \u00c5 , 2.58 \u00c5 correspond respectively to (110), (200), (004) planes of OBC (cellulose Ib) (French 2014) . The diffraction peaks of OBC are significantly enhanced at d-spacing of 2.58 \u00c5 as the increase ratio of OBC. As shown in Fig. 4b , the arc patterns, corresponding to reflections of the (200) lattice planes of OBC, became clearer as OBC content increased from (i) to (iv). This suggests that improved alignment of OBC fibers occurred along the longitudinal axis of the print lines. To further assess the orientation of nanofibrils in the printed lines, azimuthal intensity distribution (Fig. 4d) and degree of orientation (p) of the lattice plane (200) which has d-spacing of 3.93 \u00c5 (Fig. 4c) for OBC were calculated. The degree of orientation of nanofibrils in 2SF-1OBC, 1SF-1OBC, 1SF-2OBC and 0SF-1OBC was 31%, 60%, 61%, and 69%, respectively. These results were in good agreement with the SEM results in Fig. 4a . As noted in Table 1 , high OBC content ink required greater printing pressure, which might also contribute to the orientation of nanofibrils. It has been reported that controlled filler alignment represents a wide range of applications including improved structural properties of composites in addition to enhanced cell growth in nanofibrous scaffolds for tissue engineering (Prince and Kumacheva 2019; Siqueira et al. 2017; Song et al. 2017) . Thus, alignment of OBC nanofibers along their longitudinal direction may also have promising applications in tissue engineering to mimic natural tissues or organs. Note that porous structures on the surface of print lines were covered during the post-treatment at 37\u00b0C. However, hydrogels of SF-OBC showed the porous structure (Fig. S2) at their cross sections after equilibrium swelling in deionized water. Moreover, nanofibrils of OBC became visible as higher ratio of OBC mixed in hydrogels from 2SF-1OBC to 1SF-2OBC in Fig. S2 .",

The peak in the FTIR spectrum at 1647 cm -1 of BC representing the hydroxy methyl group (CH 2 OH). Peak at 1727 cm -1 of OBC is related to the C = O stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group (Fig. 5a) , indicating successful oxidation of the (Lai et al. 2014) , appearing in 2SF-1OBC, 1SF-1OBC and 1SF-2OBC spectra (Fig. 5b) . The carboxyl groups in OBC paste reduced adhesion between the BC nanofibers, which were well dispersed in the paste (Lai et al. 2014) . In this study, the oxidation process was maintained for 1 h. In Yao's work , the ultimate carboxylate groups were about 0.65 mmol/g after 1 h reaction and kept unchanged even by multiple trials. The peak at 3348 cm -1 was assigned to OH stretching in BC and OBC (Fig. 5a) . The appearance of a broad band around 3348 cm -1 in 2SF-1OBC, 1SF-1OBC, and 1SF-2OBC (Fig. 5b) was associated with hydrogen bond interactions between OBC and SF. The FTIR spectral regions 1700-1600 cm -1 and 1600-1500 cm -1 are attributable to amide I and amide II, respectively due to the absorption of the peptide backbone, spectra that are commonly used for the analysis of secondary structures in SF. The regions at 1630-1610 cm -1 in amide I and 1520-1510 cm -1 in amide II were assigned to silk II secondary structure while the regions at 1660-1640 cm -1 in amide I and 1542-1535 cm -1 in amide II were assigned to silk I conformation (Leisk et al. 2010; Oliveira Barud et al. 2015) . Peaks at 1651 cm -1 and 1537 cm -1 in 1SF-2OBC, 1SF-1OBC, 2SF-1OBC, and 20wt% SF (Fig. 5b) correspond to the conformation of silk I (ahelices and b-turns), exhibiting no significant 0SF-1OBC. The 1D SR-WAXD diffractograms of SF hydrogel from 20wt% SF solution are also shown in c for comparison. Scale bars in first and second lines are 500 lm and 1 lm, respectively difference in intrinsic SF in aqueous solution. As a result, SF hydrogels crosslinked using HRP/H 2 O 2 mostly consisted of random coils, easily acquiring the conformational transition from random coil to b-sheet in alcohol or in vitro or in vivo conditions (Su et al. 2017; Yan et al. 2016) .",

SF-OBC hydrogels consisted of SF networks with dityrosine formation with large numbers of interpenetrating OBC nanofibrils, as shown in the schematic presentation of Fig. 1 . Enzymatically formed SF hydrogel exhibited excellent elasticity and resilience due to the covalent dityrosine bonds capable of withstanding 3600 cycles at 10% strain. However, the compressive stiffness of the SF hydrogel was only 0.2-10 kPa, limited practical application due to poor rigidity (Partlow et al. 2014) . The stress-strain curves for SF-OBC hydrogels are displayed in Fig. 5c . The hydrogel 1SF-1OBC had the highest compressive strength at 267 \u00b1 13 kPa compared with 2SF-1OBC and 1SF-2OBC. The compressive strain of all SF-OBC hydrogels was greater than 50%. The compressive stiffness at 30% strain is shown in Fig. 5d . The 1SF-1OBC hydrogel exhibited the largest compressive modulus of 325 \u00b1 14 kPa, an order of magnitude higher than that of reported SF hydrogel (Partlow et al. 2014) , which compressive stiffness was below 10 kPa. Compared with the 2SF-1OBC hydrogel, 1SF-1OBC hydrogel with greater OBC content provided sufficient strength and stiffness. However, when the mass ratio of SF/OBC was altered from 1/1 to 1/2, the mechanical properties of 1SF-2OBC clearly deteriorated. For hydrogels 2SF-1OBC and 1SF-1OBC, the SF component acted as a continuous phase, while the OBC component displayed a dispersed phase in the hydrogel at the same solid content. As mentioned above, the enzymatically crosslinked SF hydrogel displayed excellent elasticity but poor stiffness. Conversely, OBC nanofibrils were demonstrated to be outstanding materials, providing sufficient rigidity due to high crystallinity. In addition, large numbers of hydrogen bonds formed between the SF molecular chains and OBC nanofibrils. These contributed to the higher strength and stiffness but relatively lower strain of 1SF-1OBC compared with 2SF-1OBC. However, in (Fig. S2bd) . Too many defects were formed in the SF hydrogel and it was not possible to ''lock'' the OBC with insufficient SF crosslinking (Fig. S2d) . Thus 1SF-2OBC exhibited poor strength and stiffness. As a result, 1SF-1OBC showed the best combination between SF and OBC among three kinds of hydrogels of 2SF-1OBC, 1SF-1OBC, 1SF-2OBC (Fig. S2b-d) .",

            "text": "The biocompatibility and potential for construction of a lung tissue model using printed SF-OBC hydrogel scaffolds were evaluated using LESCs. LESCs were seeded on 1SF-1OBC scaffold and cultured for 3 and 7 days. The LESCs adhered and proliferated well on the scaffold in growth medium, as shown in Fig. 6a-f . The MTT results (Fig. 6i) indicate that the LESCs grew faster on the scaffolds than TCPS from days 1-3. This is probably because grooved structure formed by OBC nanofibrils on the surface of printed 1SF-1OBC scaffolds, which benefited to the initial adhesion and proliferation of LESCs (Fig. 6f ). This kind of grooved topological surface has also been proved to be competitive in cell culture than flat substrate of TCPS (Campodoni et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2012) . Cell proliferation on 1SF-1OBC was not significantly different from the TCPS control after 7 days. Similar results were also reported in BC/SF scaffolds, that exhibit biocompatibility Oliveira Barud et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2019) . It can be seen from Fig. 6c , d, f that cells on the printed lines exhibited anisotropic topography and aligned along their longitudinal axis, also the direction of orientation of OBC nanofibrils. In lung tissues, epithelial cells are oriented in the lining of the airway (El-Hashash and Warburton 2011; Plosa et al. 2012 ). The printed SF-OBC hydrogel scaffolds with aligned OBC nanofibrils could be used to achieve ECM remodeling of the lung tissue. Orientation of the OBC nanofibrils in the printed lines provide physical cues and consequently influence cell fate. Moreover, after culture on scaffolds for 7 days, LESCs maintained the ability to proliferate, as demonstrated by Ki67 expression (Fig. 6g ) and epithelial phenotype, as indicated by p63 expression (Fig. 6h) . As for freshly isolated pneumocytes, they generally lose their proliferative capacity and phenotype over the first 3-5 days of standard cell culture (Ghaedi et al. 2014; Poon et al. 2018) . Therefore, it is critical important to obtain these cells by the differentiation of corresponding stem cells after extensive proliferation (Miller et al. 2019) . As a result, the 3D printed 1SF-1OBC scaffold represents a biomimetic matrix similar to lung tissue that may also supports further epithelial differentiation of LESCs. In addition, cellulose materials alone showed a slow degradation due to their packed molecular structure and the lack of cellulose-degradation enzymes in animals. Moreover, the foreign body reaction is stimulated by cellulose materials due to their slow degradation in vitro or in vivo (Rashad et al. 2019 ). However, SF/BC hydrogel with 5wt% BC displayed a fast degradation and lost almost 90% weight within a month (Fig. S4) , which was ascribed to the main component of SF hydrogel with amorphous structure. Moreover, the degradation of SF hydrogel could be further accelerated with protease XIV (Yan et al. 2016 ). In addition, the degradability of BC could be induced by modification with varieties of strategies and thus formed the derivatives which evoked mild to moderate foreign body reactions (Stalling et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2012) . Overall, printed scaffolds with SF-OBC hydrogels present a promising application in lung tissue engineering.",

The viscoelastic properties of SF hydrogel inks were modified by OBC nanofibrils pastes. The SF-OBC composite inks exhibited excellent shear thinning behavior with reversible stress softening, thus producing a novel silk-based ink for 3D printing. Shape fidelity and fiber alignment were enhanced by the incorporation of OBC in the printed scaffolds. Three-dimensional construct with ten layers was achieved by ink of 1SF-2OBC. Oxidative OBC nanofibrils not only improved printability but also promoted the mechanical properties of the SF-OBC hydrogel. SF-OBC hydrogel with SF/OBC ratio of 1/1 exhibited significantly improved compressive stiffness of 325 \u00b1 14 kPa at 30% strain, which was considerably higher than that previously reported. The OBC nanofibrils aligned along the direction of extrusion in the printed lines provided the biomimetic structures of the ECM of lung, contributing to the micro-structure which induced orientation of LESCs. LESCs on SF-OBC hydrogel scaffolds could maintain their capacity of proliferation as well as epithelial phenotype for at least 1 week. Overall, the 3D printed SF-OBC hydrogel scaffolds mimicked lung tissue structure with anisotropic ECM and thus could represent a promising material for the lung tissue regeneration applications.
