According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, nearly 300,000 breast augmentation procedures were conducted in 2019. Learning the ideal shape of a breast and which esthetics lead to public perception of the most attractive breast is beneficial to properly performing these procedures. Objectives: The authors aimed to quantify the public's perception of attraction to breast shape by measuring public opinion for various esthetic elements of breast anatomy and linking this to various demographic factors. Methods: Survey responses were collected from 1000 users of Amazon Mechanical Turk to collect demographic data and ask users to rank preferences for randomized image panels of breast proportions. Results: 960 responses were used for analysis. A majority of respondents were male (60%), with a plurality being 25 to 34 years old (49.3%). The most notable preferences between all groups were breast projection proportion and nipple direction, with preferences of 1.0 and frontal nipple direction, respectively. Breast width to shoulder width ratio also had a clear preference among the crowd, with 105% being the preferred percentage, and the 25 to 34 age group having a very strong preference for this. Conclusions: The authors used a crowdsourcing survey technique with randomized image panels to analyze ideal breast preference using images of various anatomical traits of the female breast. It was concluded that crowdsourcing can be a favorable technique for learning ideal overall preferences for specific anatomy.",

As mentioned in Lee and Ock, the authors believe that breast preferences should be calculated in proportion to the rest of the body. 7 For this reason, 11 image panels were used, taken from Lee and Ock, which depict different proportions and ratios for various aspects of the female breast. Some of these characteristics include the \"vertical nipple position\" and \"upper anterior breast to lower anterior breast ratio.\" The vertical nipple position, for example, is defined as the ratio of the distance from the sternal notch to the nipple level divided by the vertical distance from the sternal notch to the umbilicus. The more in-depth definition for each of the other characteristics can be found in their original research article. 7 Each of the 11 image panels was cropped into individual subimages. The original image panels can be seen in the Lee and Ock study, although the image panels used were: These subimages were randomized for each survey participant completing a survey, to encourage careful examination of each image panel for differences. Participants were prompted to not only choose the subimage, which was most attractive to them, but also rank the following subimages in order of preference. All participants were given a code after finishing their survey, which they used at the original website to confirm their completion. All users who submitted their correct completion code were compensated $0.25USD for their response. The survey was available for completion during the time period of July 22, 2021, to July 27, 2021, although all surveys were completed within 21 hours of the creation time. The average ranking of preferences between images was calculated overall and across demographic variables and compared using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model. Statistical inference was determined through a GEE Wald test of an interaction term in the mixed effects model between each separate demographic variable and the image number. Data from the surveys were analyzed using both Python and R programming languages. 19, 20 ",

            "text": "1. The position of the breast footprint (labeled as lateral nipple position or front nipple position) in relation to the thorax is key. We know that one common issue in breast augmentation is releasing the lower fold or dropping the IMF to accommodate larger implants or as an error. When the lower fold is dropped down, for instance, to accommodate a 12-cm base width implant in a female with a 5-cm nipple to inframmary fold (IMF) distance, there is a risk of this larger fold making the entire chest appear heavier by decreasing breast projection. The crowd agrees that wider breasts or breasts that are slightly wider than the upper hip width tend to be more attractive. However, this should not come at the expense of making the breasts appear lower. This also explains why larger implants may satisfy the crowd's aesthetic preference for volume, and the shape is in fact also a key determinant of outcome. Surgeons know this to be true and modern breast augmentation incorporates concepts including lower breast skin expansion with modern cohesive implants. 21 Austin et al described in several talks and articles the fact that modern constricted breasts and short lower pole distances can be managed in some cases without lowering the IMF, as these newer implants are capable of tissue expansion over time. 22 2. The crowd shows a split in several areas between males' and females' preferences. This may serve as an educational instrument for our patients, to show them that there are differences in preferences and to help provide appropriate data for selection of outcomes. For instance, we can show females that males prefer a higher breast width to hip width ratio, whereas females are more evenly split. This may change their targeted result depending on their goals, desires, sexual preferences, and motivations. 3. The curves from Figure 4 with U-shaped results help us to identify key inflection points, and these may be expanded to hone in closer to exact ratios and proportions for the ideal breast. This study is a good early crowdsourcing study to help set guidelines for further exploration into breast shape, volume, and body proportions for the public's perception of ideal beauty. Given there are differences in preferences for proportions and shape, it may be possible to target outcomes and to inform patients better about their bodies and their proportions and what are achievable outcomes based on their starting proportions. Miroshink et al have lectured several times on the long torso vs the short torso and the implications for breast augmentation in these 2 groups, focusing on the full body proportion and how breast surgery can change the entire perception of the breast and body shape, not just the size of the patient's breasts. 23 4. The linear relationships seen in preferences from Figure 4 may point to the fact that there are some areas where our metrics capture cross-cultural demographic preferences. For instance, the breast width to shoulder width data illustrated a common trend for all ethnicities except Asian culturally-identified Turkers. Additionally, younger age groups reported stronger attraction to a higher breast width to shoulder width ratio.",

It may be valuable in the future to examine these demographic preferences more carefully and to hone in on the age groups, ethnicities, and demographics for purposes of targeting. Regardless, imagine the power of identifying first the target demographic customer or patient in this case, and then identifying their exact preferences and targeting them with appropriate aesthetically pleasing marketing, photographs, text, and outcomes. A good system could utilize these findings and translate them into a win-win for both patients and surgeons, by better identifying the granular desires of each patient group and better pairing them with the surgeons, implants, and practices which can help them achieve the results they do not even know that they want yet.",

The image panels used for this study were taken from a previous study in which the authors illustrated effective use of the image panels with specifically Asian populations. It is possible a few of the image panels or the names of the characteristics may not fully convey the entire breadth of variation possible in each aesthetic characteristic, but the authors wanted to use the image panels in the form they were previously created as opposed to altering panels any further. Additionally, it is worth noting that crowds may view illustrations of varying breast characteristics differently than they would view photographs of breast augmentation patients. The population of the Mechanical Turk crowd was fairly close to a representative sample of a crowd, albeit there was a slight skew toward males vs females. In addition, it should be noted that this grouping of people is an internet literate crowd with an age skew slightly favoring the 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 age groups. A few of the ethnic groupings included smaller amounts of peoples, but in accordance with previous research conducted by the authors regarding numbers of crowd workers needed for reliable data collection, the number of crowd workers in each subgroup as shown in Figure 4 should still be considered repeatable and trustworthy. 24 In the age of crowdsourcing and targeted drip-based communication, data are becoming increasingly more valuable. This study helps to best elucidate the ideal aesthetic outcomes for several demographic groups. In the future, these data will be utilized to train reviewers for outcomes for breast augmentation and to better study the outcomes that are already published and available for view. The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of aesthetic outcomes and goals and to help improve patient outcomes by pairing the patients with the best possible cosmetic outcome for them.",
