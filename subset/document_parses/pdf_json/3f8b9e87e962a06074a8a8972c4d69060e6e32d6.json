            "text": "Understanding the process of producing creative responses to open-ended problems solved in small groups is important for many modern domains, like health care, manufacturing, education, banking, and investment. Some of the main theoretical challenges include characterizing and measuring the dynamics of responses, relating social and individual aspects in group problem solving, incorporating soft skills (e.g., experience, social aspects, and emotions) to the theory of decision making in groups, and understanding the evolution of processes guided by soft utilities (hard-to-quantify utilities), e.g., social interactions and emotional rewards. This paper presents a novel theoretical model (TM) that describes the process of solving open-ended problems in small groups. It mathematically presents the connection between group member characteristics, interactions in a group, group knowledge evolution, and overall novelty of the responses created by a group as a whole. Each member is modeled as an agent with local knowledge, a way of interpreting the knowledge, resources, social skills, and emotional levels associated to problem goals and concepts. Five solving strategies can be employed by an agent to generate new knowledge. Group responses form a solution space, in which responses are grouped into categories based on their similarity and organized in abstraction levels. The solution space includes concrete features and samples, as well as the causal sequences that logically connect concepts with each other. The model was used to explain how member characteristics, e.g., the degree to which their knowledge is similar, relate to the solution novelty of the group. Model validation compared model simulations against results obtained through behavioral experiments with teams of human subjects, and suggests that TMs are a useful tool in improving the effectiveness of small teams.",

Second, groups can be distinguished depending on the type of the implemented group memory, such as short term memory when participants access only a limited amount of information (like similar or preferred information, beliefs describing subjective or global preferences), and incubated knowledge (i.e. insight produced after a certain amount of times from the initial moment when the output was created). Third, the physical context in which groups operate influences if outcomes must immediately be produced (e.g., in real-time for participants in physical proximity), or if they interact through a medium that allows sampling and filtering of available outcomes. Fourth, new human -machine interaction solutions can generate a large variety of cues that become available to group members, like summarizations, trends, and content extraction through data analytics and Machine Learning (ML). Cues can be used to connect based on previous outcomes (convergence) or to expand towards previously unexplored situations (divergence). Fifth, various group level strategies and procedures can emerge depending on the group size, composition, and management. Groups do not have centralized control, however, different constraints can be set on the available resources or participants' characteristics.",

            "text": "Combining the options of the above five criteria produces a large variety of new group interaction mechanisms. Moreover, interactions between group members are strongly connected to group behavior and final results [4, 14, 18, 19] . Still, many open research issue remain. For example, explaining the apparent contradiction between selfish individuals and altruistic populations is under debate [19] . The causal impact of parameters on group behavior is often difficult to distinguish and characterize, especially for co-occurring parameters [19] . It is likely that multiple hypotheses can explain a certain observed situation, which demands for additional observation to further narrow down the possible hypotheses. Also, it has been explained that aggregated measures, like fitness, utility, and usefulness, which drive evolution selection, relate to basic parameters that are hard to observe, characterize, and model [19] . In general, developing more effective computing technologies for team-based applications requires understanding the connection between group interactions, group behavior, and evolution of group responses. New theoretical models are needed to capture the details of this connection. This paper describes a novel theoretical model (TM) to describe solving of open-ended problems in a smallgroup setting, e.g., around five members in a group. In particular, the model refers to the problem of devising solutions to improving the American health care system, but other similar problems can be tackled too. The model mathematically describes the connection between group member characteristics, interactions inside a group, group knowledge evolution, and overall novelty of the responses created by the group as a whole. Every group member is characterized by his/her local (personal) knowledge, a way of interpreting the knowledge, beliefs, priorities and preferences, resources, motivation, and emotions associated to problem goals and concepts. The local (personal) knowledge of an agent is similar to a weak ontology [20] , as it is expandable and specific to each agent. Five solving strategies can be employed by a participant to generate new knowledge that can be of different types, e.g., it refers to affordability, quality, education, and prevention, and includes different aspects of a solution, like what is the described solution (goal), how is the solution implemented to produce a desired outcome, who is performing the activity, for whom is the activity conducted, and why is the solution needed (reason). Group responses form the solution space, in which responses are grouped into categories based on their similarity and organized on abstraction levels. The solution space also includes concrete features and samples as well as the causal sequences that indicate how concepts are logically connected with each other. The nature of group interactions, like different degrees of competition or collaboration between members, emerges as a result of the strategies that are selected by members. Moreover, group knowledge evolution can be convergent, if response similarity increases, or divergent, if similarity decreases. The model was used to explain how group member characteristics relate to group solution creativity. The two main requirements of the model are having a way to decide the similarity of two knowledge items, as well as a method to describe the purpose of each knowledge token. The presented implementation of the model uses WordNet [21] for satisfying the two requirements.",

Such situations are frequent in modern and emerging domains, including health care (e.g., teams of medical doctors must create holistic, customized treatment plans), industry, banking and investment [1, 2, 6, 10, 22, 23] . These areas include situations in which having global control based on global data is difficult. Several independent studies have recently argued that future careers will seek creative problem solving skills as well as capabilities to work effectively in teams. Studies suggest that team organization and management will be increasingly important, including the management of softer individual skills, such as participant's expertise and experience, personal beliefs, motivation, and resources. Such skills can be both implicit or explicit, can change during problem solving (i.e. motivation might increase or decrease depending on the group dynamics), and can be partially observed and learned during the process. Another application refers to markets with minuscule or even without price [24] , like open source software development. These markets pay less emphasis on monetary retribution, but stress motivational and emotional rewards to the participants. The paper argues that future markets will redraw the balance between rationality vs. emotions and motivation in decision making as hard-to-quantify incentives will be increasingly common.",

The system could improve group creativity by recognizing the opportunities unused by the group (opportunities that should be further explored), reorganizing and rebalancing the interactions between team members, and gaining new insight on how to solve a problem. Insight gaining include understanding the causality of trade-offs and limitations (bottlenecks) of present solutions, identifying solutions that could tackle the causality of bottlenecks, and how the interaction between group members influences their beliefs, motivation, emotions, and decision making (including how certain cues offered by others influences a participant's decisions).

Related systems implement different creative paradigms, including analogy, concept combinations, domain-specific rule-based reasoning systems, cognitive architectures, and transformational and evolutionary systems [27, 31, 32] . The work in [28] uses ontologies to deconstruct and reconstruct inputs into features and structures during conceptual recombination. Evolutionary algorithm, including Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been suggested for creative applications, like composing music, generating stories, drawing, and engineering design. New electronic circuits were created using GAs [33, 34] . However, the creativity of such design is much lower than that of circuits invented by humans [35] . A recent semi-autonomous system suggests creating new recipes or menus by mimicking human creative activities, like finding a problem, acquiring a problem, gathering information, incubation, generating ideas, concept combination, selecting the best ideas, and externalizing solutions [31] . Solutions are described as schema that express ingredients and steps for cooking a dish. Our recent work proposed InnovA, a cognitive architecture for computational innovation through robust divergence [29] . Similar to [31] , InnovA is inspired by human cognitive activities. However, it uses a different knowledge representation in which concepts are associated based on their similarity, and causally linked in sequences depending on their purposes in the final solution. Creating new solutions involves identifying new building blocks [36] , symbolically understanding the similarities and differences between concepts [37] , generalization, causal reasoning [38] , and various types of concept combinations [39, 40] .",

            "text": "In addition to the above creative activities, open-ended problem solving in teams, groups, or large communities includes two other facets [41, 42] : (i) the emergence of insight by a participant or few participants possibly due to cues produced by the group, and (ii) the readiness of the group to understand, propagate, and embrace the new insight. Crosson and Grachter summarize existing theories that span from psychology, e.g., models of individual cognition, to models for economic behavior [41] . From a cognitive point of view, insight is a sudden restructuring of the problem representation. It is likely to represent a discontinuity (divergence) in the space of solutions uncovered by an individual or a group. Even though a person is convinced about the correctness of his/her insight, in a small group setting, it is possible that the group rejects an insight that does not resonate well with the group ideas and opinions, even though the individual might be passionate about the new solution. It has been explained by research in organization science that teams in which members share information about pursued goals and solutions are more efficient in reaching solutions than teams in which members do not interact with each other [42] [43] [44] . Creating a shared memory model between participants has been an important objective in team training, e.g., teams in commercial aviation [42, 43, 45] . Alternatively, the occurrence of discontinuities in large communities, like paradigm shifts, has been a main recent research topic in sociology and social networking with the main goal of understanding technological trends and which outcomes are more likely to produce a significant impact [6, 8, 16, [46] [47] [48] . There is a consensus among researchers that knowledge dynamics in a group or community includes a sequence of four stages: stagnation when little new information is created as current barriers are difficult to overcome, marginal and incremental change of the current paradigms, short periods of radical changes when new insight and solutions become available to the group, and swift adaptation of the new yet superior paradigm [49, 50] .",

            "text": "As summarized later in Figs. 1, 4, and 5, from a theoretical point of view, models are at three abstraction levels: the bottom level uses agent-based models to study individual-related aspects (parameters), like the importance of diversity (knowledge, knowledge interpretation, strategy, and rewards) on team performance [2, [50] [51] [52] . The second level aggregates the individual outcomes to create cumulative, stochastic or differential algebraic models typically used to describe a group's dynamics [14, 16, 53] . Finally, the most abstract models offer an interpretation of the group behavior as black box models that indicate how the parameters of the dynamic process influence the behavior (i.e. properties) of the group [42, 44, 54] . Often, such models do not indicate causal relationships, like the parameters that determine a certain group-level outcome. Agent-based models conduct an optimization process in which every agent explores locally, while global 1. Agent-based models study group behavior, including problem framing and solving as well as propagation of new knowledge, by setting up an agent model, in which an agent expresses a group member or a sub-group (i.e. a team) [55, 56] . An updated review of related work is offered in [57] . Agents perform with certain probabilities a set of activities, like sampling the problem space, sampling the solution space, experimenting new solutions, and interacting with other agents. Agents are rewarded depending on the activities of the other agents as well as the value (utility) of their outputs for the entire group. The expressed parameters of the agent models, as well as their level of details and connections to other parameters, are described depending on the purpose of the models. Early work by Lakatos and Feyerabend considers that paradigm shifts occur only after sufficient accumulation of complementary innovations [58, 59] , even though the impact of individual innovations or the quality of the overall progress are hard to evaluate [58] . Understanding the nature of the problem space, e.g., technological landscape, is a difficult yet critical problem, as problem framing decides to a large degree the usefulness of the problem solving activity. Sickert et al. consider a simple description of the technological landscape as quadratic polynomials with local and global optima [50] , but this assumption might be less effective for cross-disciplinary problems, for which such unifying functions are hard to identify. They propose an agent model to study the social dynamics of paradigm shifts. Agents learn the characteristics of physical-technological landscapes by attaching weights to their individual search vs. social influence by other agents [50] . Computationally, social influence is a means to aggregate the impact of agents on other agents, thus represent a self-organization feature through which agents are influenced by the group [56, 60] . Each member assigns specific weights to each of the peers. The model is capable to produce dynamic situations that correspond to incremental changes of the solutions as well as paradigm shifts around disruptive ideas. Experiments indicate that strong social influence is a barrier in front of paradigm shifts. Hence, a lower social influence is needed to propagate knowledge from the surrounding peers, beyond the local technological landscape available to an agent, while enabling the propagation of disruptive ideas, like sudden insight. Also, large communities with strong social influence between their members are less likely to adopt innovative changes. Hong and Page show that agents with diverse problems solving perspectives and heuristics (selected randomly from a population) produce better solutions than a team of best performing agents or than the most effective agent [2] . In addition to the support offered by an agentbased model, the authors also prove mathematically the result. The diversity of the agents' local perspective enable reaching of better optimal solutions than if only high performing but similar agents are being considered. Recently, Gabora and Tseng studied the optimized ratio among imitators and creators, the degree to which social regulation of the creativity level of an individual helps the success of the entire population, and the usefulness of chaining simple outputs for solving open-ended problems [52] . Other agent models focus on the effect of complementariness among group members, populations sizes, minimum number of required pioneers, impact of the shapes of technological landscapes [61] [62] [63] , individual adaptation strategies to landscape changes [50, 64] , dynamic knowledge representation [65, 66] , and conceptual reorganization of individuals' knowledge representations [67] . We previously studied the impact of different problem framing strategies and possible resource allocation schemes on the successful evolution of a community [51] .",

            "text": "2. Social network based statistical analysis assumes that there is a connection between the topology of the network representing the social interactions of a group or community and the behavior or role of its members for the entire group [53] . Then, insight about the network static and dynamic behavior can be inferred from the metrics computed over the topological properties of the network. Seminal work by Granovetter suggests that weak ties in a group are important for increasing creativity as they serve as bridges between clusters of members with similar ideas [14, 68] . The strength of a tie depends on the amount of interaction, reciprocity, and emotional intensity. Perry-Smith and Shalley propose a social network model in which the peripheral nodes with many connections outside the network are more likely to acquire unique insight and generate more groundbreaking contributions [53] . However, as their contributions are accepted by the community, and thus peripheral nodes are more linked through new connections, their centrality within the group increases. The behavior of the peripheral nodes is called spiraling model. The authors explain that weak ties improve creativity as they enable access to diverse perspectives and approaches to problems, different outlooks, various interests, access to a wider group of people, and utilization of less redundant information [69] . Weak ties are also the most effective way of spreading rumors [14] , but also help in validating alternatives as members identify less with the ideas and beliefs of a certain group [53] . In conclusion, the spiraling model suggests that many weak ties and few strong links help creativity, however, beyond a certain threshold, weak ties reduce focus and attention by introducing too much distraction [70] . While weak ties seem to be important for instrumental purposes when trust is not critical [71], strong ties are necessary for problems that involve complex and proprietary information, and for which trust and affect are needed between group members [72] . Strong ties encourage members to share information in competitive environments [71] . In recent work, Montjoye et al. show that strong ties are more correlated with the performance of a small team (e.g., four persons) than competencies and personality [16] . The studied teams were working on problems like high-level programming, data modeling, and simple ML algorithms. In this work, the strength of a tie is measured as a ratio between how often two persons were in each other's vicinity and the total number of participants. Strong ties are likely to be important because they enable the access to the needed piece of information available for the entire group. A limitation of statistical analysis of social networks relates to the capability to relate various topological metrics of the networks to group behavior. Traditionally, for small teams, this link has been realized by using surveys in which participants individually answered to questions describing the components describing ties [14, 16] . However, these approach does not easily scale to very large groups (e.g., thousands of participants), and also it is not clear how group level self-structuring processes relate to the concept of tie strengths. Moreover, the causality of creating ties of various strengths is not fully understood.",

            "text": "This category of research has studied the way in which the design of a certain organization influences the behavior and performance of individuals and organizations. Classical research has shown that high performance teams use different adaptation strategies than low performance teams in the case of high demand situations [42] . Adaptation can include different aspects, like the team composition, coordination strategies, decision making methods, and interaction between team members. Pursued work is often experimental. For example, the shared situational mental model considers that the shared knowledge model describes a common model about the problems as well as a shared model about the environment, including the team members, their abilities and expected reactions [42] . An optimized interaction strategy senses and anticipates the needs and responses of other members due to the problem changes. Interaction and coordination mechanisms are both explicit and implicit, however, in the presence of increased stress and constraints, more effective teams show an increased level of implicit coordination through the shared mental models. Along the same lines, Wohl presents the stimulus -hypothesis -option -response model, in which teams alternate between implicit and explicit interaction, periodic explicit communication being required to update and reinforce the shared mental models of the participants [43, 74] . Similarly, Salas and Cannon-Bowers consider that an optimized organization has superior sensitivity and responsiveness to changes [44] . The rate of correct responses generated by a team increases with the upward-anticipation ratio, which is the ratio between the number of information transfers from subordinates to the leader and the number of requests by the leader. Shared mental models reduce the number of errors committed by a team as each member offers a different views on the causal explanations of certain errors, which leads to better prediction of the effects of faults as well as the capacity of the group to solve the errors [45] . The model of zone of proximity facilitation considers that teams of experts (with superior background knowledge and interaction skills) perform better than expected for complex problems in aviation, but perform worse than expected for simple problems [75] . On explanation, is that experts interact less for simpler problems as they try to solve them individually.",

An important topic has been the emergence of information or decision cascades in a group [54] . Cascades describe situations in which individuals decide mainly based on others' previous decisions than based on their local information. Cascading produces superior decisions than individual decision making, but can also result in poor production and performance of a group [54] . An experimental study focused on the relationship between emergence of information cascades and the type of the institutions [54] . Three institution types were considered, individualistic institutions in which agents are rewarded based on the quality of their announced decisions, majority-rule institutions, in which agents are rewarded depending on whether the majority decisions were good or bad, and conformity-rewarding institutions in which agents are rewarded depending on their similarity with the majority. The study considers that individuals can make three types of decisions: Bayesian-Nash equilibrium behavior, private information revealer, public information seeker, and strategic player. Experiments show that cascades are more likely to emerge if rewards are made based on announced decisions. Also, cascades are more likely in individualistic organizations than in majority-rule organizations, and also more likely in conformity rewarding organizations [54] . The theoretical model supporting the work is based on General Decision Weight model, which is a weighted sum of the public announcements and private knowledge, a model which assumes a naive Bayesian interpretation of decision making.",

Compared to other models, TM focuses on presenting bottom-up the connection between the evolutionary process through which new knowledge is created by a team, and the individual characteristics of team members (agents). Figure 1 summarizes the three main components of TM. As shown in Fig. 1(a) , the characteristics of team interactions depend on the alignment between agents, e.g., the similarity of their local knowledge (i.e. previous experiences) and exchanged cues (e.g., information, social and emotional cues). Each agent uses its local knowledge ( Fig. 1(b) ) to create new knowledge, i.e. solutions to the problem that is jointly solved by the team. The new knowledge is produced through activities, like top-down and bottomup reasoning, implicit and explicit knowledge, and reusing previous solutions for new needs. The group knowledge evolves as a result of the new knowledge, as shown in Fig. 1(c) .",

Let's assume that the following responses are created in this sequence, R1: \"screening for prevention and detection\", R2: \"prevention of pregnancy using age discounts\", R3: \"insurance contracts should include prevention\". The frames of the four responses are gradually clustered depending on the similarity of their frames of the same kind. Top-down and bottomup reasoning is performed as new responses are created. Besides, similar concepts representing similar frames in the responses represent alternatives of the same, more general concept, e.g., detection and checkup. Both are subcategories that can be further detailed through top-down reasoning. Also, concrete examples are connected to more abstract concepts, like STI to treatment. Different what frames can correspond to the same goal, like contract and screening to prevention. Finally, implicit sub-categories can result when less similar concepts serve the same purpose (e.g., correspond to the same frame), like prevention and the sub-category corresponding to checkup and detection. The proposed TM describes in Section 3.4 the group behavior by indicating how the solution space description is changed by subsequent responses. Section 6 illustrates the solution space created during behavioral experiments with human subjects.",

Our solution space representation includes elements similar to prototype schema [81] , but emphasize the connection between concepts based on their roles in solutions. The representation includes causal association sequences, which show how frames with different roles produce a solution. Sequences describe the reasoning process of a team during problem solving, and are important to highlight solutions that are less similar to the previous cases. Other related but less similar representations include a metadata representation for case-based reasoning [82] , a network representation to highlight the activities performed during problem solving [83] , patterns used in concept generation [84] , ontologies [85, 86] , semantic web [87] , and various rule-based systems [88] . Frame descriptions (FDs) are relational descriptions between the elements of a response, similar to other relational notations, like relational schema [89] . Descriptive attributes and slots in relational schema focus mainly on the roles (purposes) of the elements. FDs also present how roles are achieved, such as suggested implementations. Fig. 6 . The model describes an agent's capability to produce a new solution with its current resources. The capability is a trade-off between the expected benefits by the agent and the required resources, including its motivation. Among other models [55, 57] , the presented agents are most similar to the model of Budaev et al. [90] . Their rules are selected by an agent using an individual genome. Instead of a genome, our agents have local knowledge, which represents an individual hierarchy of concepts linked in a causal sequence, like in Fig. 3 (a). The local knowledge models the previous experience of an agent, i.e. its previous responses. Maximizing the expected benefit or minimizing the cost of a new response balances between divergent and convergent responses, e.g., responses that are less or more similar to previous solutions.",

It has been shown that some concepts suggest a certain outcome and create enough motivation to produce a response [25, 79] . Figure 1 (b) shows the structure of the local knowledge of a group member. It includes concepts in responses grouped in categories similar to the models discussed in [10, 77, 78, 80] . Categories can include sub-categories, which inherit the features of the more abstract category, but also have distinguishing parameters and constraints that separate it from other sub-categories pertaining to the same category. Each category can have multiple features (attributes) and several specific samples (exemplars) belonging to the category. Categories might also be related to other semantically similar categories (synonyms) or semantically opposite categories (antonyms). Every category can have a how component that present the way in which the outcome is created by a causal sequence. Categories might also have a why element which justifies the reason for certain features, outcome, or how component. Justification relates to a category's usefulness. Categories are organized into the overall local knowledge based on their interpretation, priority, and attached emotions. The software implementation in Section 5 uses data tables cognition table and emotion table to store an agent's local knowledge and attached interpretation and emotional content, respectively.",

Next, the individual estimates the expected output and its impact on the group (hence, the rewards to be received by the individual from the group), and decides if a certain amount of effort should be utilized to produce the envisioned response. The selected knowledge, external cues, and selected strategy generates a response that is new knowledge for the group. Responses have two components: component 1 is common knowledge (already existing), and component 2 is the new knowledge created by the solving process. Component 2 receives a certain attention (i.e. degree of surprise), which connects to a certain emotion and motivation to consider the cue for creating a new response. The new knowledge is added to an agent's local knowledge and also propagated through the group through mechanisms, like dissemination, visibility, and prestige.

There is no other definition of a mini-group than the fact that one person uses the responses posted by another member. Figure 1(c) illustrates this process. The existence of the interaction indicates a certain alignment of the local knowledges of the involved members meaning that there is a certain similarity between their knowledge items (concepts, goals, features, outcomes, and causal sequences) while they might have similar or opposing interpretations that, however, create enough motivation to a group member to select and elaborate a certain response. Still, the creation of a specific alignment prevents the production of another alignment, thus a certain direction of evolution is not pursued by the group. For example, two members that interact through repeated Strategy 4 create a sequence of repeated contradictions of each other's responses, even though another alignment would steer knowledge evolution along a more productive direction. Then, group problem solving is a process representing the sequence of interactions between some participants (called mini-groups) during which their local knowledge aligns, and responses are produced that can serve as cues to illuminate new knowledge items (which otherwise might be hard to access). Optimizing group problem solving requires determining the best sequence of interaction among members (or the best sequence of mini-groups) to create responses of the highest novelty.

The model in [97] uses nine primary and three secondary emotions of two valences. Emotional states correspond to homeostatic states, which change due to internal and external cues. Even though methods are not mature yet, the implementation includes emotion and social interaction modeling to capture their effect on the selected knowledge, decisions, group interactions, and knowledge evolution. Future work will continue to improve the used models. Moreover, future work will also attempt to address new challenges that are likely to occur. For example, the current lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic forced many teams to work remotely.

This strategy describes a situation in which the two agents keep contradicting each other, because they have opposite understandings of their responses, e.g., field not in table cognition table (Fig. 6) is set. Figure 8 illustrates the learning hierarchy implemented for each agent. The hierarchy has the following six levels: Each clause has a typical exemplar and the variety of the related alternatives. The implementation uses the similarity metrics provided by WordNet [21] . For example, the concept \"mental illness\" has \"autism\" as a typical exemplars, and \"Asperger\", \"ADHD\", \"depression\", and \"schizophrenia\" as related instances. The variety associated to \"mental illness\" includes the similarities of the four latter instances and the typical exemplar. This level mainly implements associative learning, which identifies the invariant attributes of the concepts [37, 78] . 2. The next bottom level learns the main causal relations of the outcomes. The algorithm produces a relation (shown as a purple dashed line in the figure) between the most dominant clause of the outcome and the outcome consequence. Two causal relations are shown in the figure, one used green boxes and the other pink boxes. The first causal relation indicates that \"free healthcare for all\", one of the how clauses used in an outcome, acts as a causal relation to the consequence that \"taxes will be high\". The second causal relation describes that \"education\" produces \"more treatment\". Note that the same outcome, \"mental illness care\" has two causal relations defined by two distinct outcomes. The learning algorithm generates a representation as shown by the bottom second, light blue box. 3. The third level learns the trade-offs and limitations of certain outcomes. It pairwise compares all causal relations associated to the same outcome. The similarity of the consequences is found using the metrics offered by WordNet.",

For example, \"education about pharmaceuticals\" is used to produce the new consequence that \"effective treatment\" is produced for \"mental illness\". 5. The fifth level creates new combinations using clauses from different outcomes for the same what clause, e.g., \"mental illness\". For example, \"education\" and \"therapy methods\" are combined together in a new solution. Both where previously how clauses, but after combination, one became the new what clause, e.g., \"therapy methods\". 6. The top-most learning method involves creating a new frame (clause), and then using it to produce a new outcome. It is achieved by adding new properties to an existing frame, i.e. \"effective\" and \"cheap\" to \"therapy methods\". Figure 8 suggests that the local knowledge structure of an agent continuously expands along the six levels by adding new (i) typical exemplars and alternatives, (ii)-(iii) causal relations and trade-offs of the outcomes, (iv) causal templates, (v) clause combinations, and (vi) frames and outcomes. Thus, the expandable, local knowledge structures are weak ontologies. As defined in [20] , as opposed to an ontology which is a shared conceptualization, a weak ontology allows insertion of new details to an ontology, and is not shared by all agents. We argue that knowledge representations similar to weak ontologies are more appropriate for describing team activities, as team members rarely share precisely the same knowledge and its interpretation. An intriguing future work topic is understanding the nature of the logic that can be used for reasoning based on the local knowledge representation of each agent.",

The most discussed concepts are less elaborated as compared to the previous groups, like they include a set of sub-categories and a set of features or a set of real examples, but not both. The graph structure is in general less deep than the previous representations, while concepts with more levels of abstraction indicate situations, in which group members disagreed with each other, therefore repeatedly used Strategy 4 to argument their responses (why frames). The real examples described concrete situations, constraints, or specific cases that presented for who and why frames.

All members of the group with highest novelty (Group 1) were concerned about insurance, as all provided a response on this topic. However, there were fewer detailed ideas. Three members agreed about having insurance at the job, out of which two agreed on having job-related insurance with the exception of avoidable accidents. Two members agreed on giving free insurance to low income persons. Two members agreed that every doctor must accept any insurance. Even though four members were concerned about pharmaceuticals, there was only a reduced idea overlapping, as one member indicated that pharmaceuticals should be affordable, a response that was cited by a second member when suggesting that their cost must be reduced. Similarly, for the group with the next highest novelty, four group members were concerned about the need to offer affordable insurance, however, there were only pairwise agreement on the more detailed issues, like different pairs agreed that insurance should be offered at work and be provided in case of lay-offs too, taxing marijuana, free or affordable medicine, and low interest rates for medical expenses. As group response novelty decreases, there was higher incidence of cases in which members had opposing ideas. For example, two members of Group 5 had distinct responses on how to prevent abusing the healthcare system. There was disagreement between them on how the verification process should be implemented. Also, there was a higher incidence about detailed agreements between group members. For example, three members of Group 6 agreed not only on healthcare having a lower price, but also on offering a bare minimum of services to everyone. Still, similar to groups with high novelty, there were instances when members agreed on the more abstract concepts too, while they generated an increased variety of more detailed responses for abstract concepts. Members in groups with low novelty often disagreed about topics with high emotional content, like vaccination, replicating medical services in other western countries, globalization, universal insurance, or health insurance for illegal immigrants. Figure 11 presents the evolution of the solution space that was rated by human raters as having the highest novelty [26] . It corresponds to Group 1. Responses were relatively equally distributed among the four frame categories, what, who, for who, and how. Responses transitioned among the four categories, usually by using Strategy 3 to create a new outcome. Strategy 2 was applied to create a sub-category by adding constraints and conditions to a more abstract concept, like concept \"health insurance given by employer\" was further refined into a new sub-category by adding the constraint \"in case of work accidents\". Strategy 2 was rarely utilized. The longer sequences of responses pertaining to the same category were mostly produced using Strategy 1, when multiple related real examples were enumerated by a member, like \"long term care\", \"vaccination\", \"drugs\", and \"natural remedies\". Strategy 1 was also used for creating responses that described a concrete, but well-known situation (example), like offering health insurance to college students. Longer sequences of responses in the same frame category were created by repeatedly using Strategy 4. Strategy 5 was seldom used, but when used, the general concept was not further developed by the group. Thus, Strategy 5 had little impact on the solution space. Figure 12 illustrates the evolution of the solution space for the group with the least novel responses ( Group 19) . In addition to responses that sampled the four categories, there was also a strong modularity of the outcomes indicating that responses had a higher similarity with each other, hence performing a localized sampling (search) of a certain aspect. There were much fewer responses describing what frames as compared to the previous group. Most of the responses were how frames with some indication of elements referring to what and for who, but with very few mentioning who elements. The proposed solutions were mostly a subset of the solutions found by the previous group, such as the idea that healthcare for students should be supported by parents' insurance until students graduate from college. Each member produced a much smaller number of responses as compared to the previous group. The transition from one category of responses to another category was produced mostly through responses produced by using Strategy 3. Hence, responses described more abstract outcomes that could have served as categories or subcategories of the solution space. However, these responses were usually not followed-up by further elaborations to increase the diversity of their category (sub-category). Strategy 1 was used to add details to a given situation, including responses that were suggested through Strategy 4 as alternatives to another response. Responses describing how frames referred to concepts with strong emotional content (and likely to trigger a certain kind of response from the others), e.g., taxation, involvement of government, and ",

The model was calibrated using the responses of the experiment with human subjects in [26] . The frames used in responses were used to set-up the database utilized to create the agents' local memory (experience). Solution quality was estimated by computing the shortest paths for the similarities of the frames used in the solutions created by the agents. Shorter paths among frames suggests that responses span a greater area of the solution space without creating separate solution clusters with few concepts to bridge the gaps between clusters. Clustered solutions have less variety, hence lower novelty. Experiments were run with model parameters that mimic the experiment with human subjects, as well as some cases that were not covered by the experiment. The model was run for a number of parameters, including the number of agents in a small group (i.e. 2, 3, and 4 agents), the number of responses created by each agent (e.g., 30, 60, and 100 responses), the size of an agent's initial experience (local knowledge) (i.e. 20, 30, and 40 ideas), and the amount of shared ideas among agents in a group, 0.0%, 25%, 50%, and 100% of shared ideas. Other considered parameters were the threshold between effort and available resources, which is used to select between minimizing effort (cost) or maximizing knowledge (considered ratios were 0.15, 0.375, and 0.6), the upper similarity degree perceived by an agent for distinct concepts (used values were 0.2, 0.5, and 0.7, the higher value suggesting only that words with a high WordNet similarity are considered to be similar in the model), and different models for spending resources and receiving rewards for the created solutions.

Results show that reducing the final average paths lengths of the agents (columns 2-3) correlates to their capability of accessing resources (columns [12] [13] . The path length is high if an agent runs out of resources, e.g., Agent 1 for case 0% (Column 12) or Agent 2 for case 50% (Column 13). More resources not only increase the number of responses of an agent, but also increase the likelihood of having strategies 2, 3, and 5. Strategies 2 and 3 bridge the gaps between clusters of similar responses, and Strategy 5 increase the height of the knowledge hierarchy. Columns 6 and 7 also illustrate this aspect. Bridging gaps between different clusters reduces the fragmentation (increases the clustering) of the responses. Finally, having more strategies 2 and 3 increases the total number of clauses (columns 4 and 5), as they combine the clauses in different responses. Results show that case 25% produces the best access to resources of the two agents, which finally leads to the shortest final average paths lengths. The best results were obtained when knowledge maximization was selected more often than cost minimization.

The agent performs a moderate number of generalizations (Strategy 5) and few abstract concept combinations (Strategy 3).

The best approach was to gather resources during the initial steps by maximizing the produced knowledge through strategies that combined concepts, like strategies 2 and 3.

Solution spaces with average novelty had a higher fragmentation than those for group responses with high or low novelty. However, there is less elaboration of the variants (e.g., the concept branches in the graph representation), which suggests that the local knowledges of members overlapped less with each other.

Tackling a broad concept from the different perspectives of a trade-off was a way of creating a larger variety of similar responses using strategies 2 and 3.

Not being aware of the intrinsic trade-off of the solution was likely to trigger using Strategy 4, through which incompatible solutions were proposed. This suggests that the existence of trade-offs for a response frames it as an ill-defined problem. Hence, it encourages using solving specific strategies for such problems.

For example, providing cheaper ER for everyone might be unsustainable due to large costs. The high cost is a bottleneck of the solution. Reducing the ER cost involves reducing the cost of regular treatment that is likely to lower its quality. Reducing cost without reducing quality can be achieved only if the number of ER visits is reduced, such as by better prevention, or if new technology is created that can lower cost, like by increasing automation.

It has arguably been the most successful application of transformation-based design in engineering. However, transformation-based design has been less successful for applications which are less algorithmic, like analog and mixed-signal design [103] [104] [105] . Previous work has suggested using Genetic Algorithms [33, 34] , but produced solutions are less creative than those generated by human designers [35] . Our recent approach proposed a cognitive architecture that mimicks the cognitive activities of designers [38] . It uses an evolutionary process that uses five transformation rules similar to those presented in this paper. In our experience, we don't think that the rules are a significant barier in limiting the nature of the created solutions. Rules allow moving top-down and bottom-up through the solution space representations, abstractions, instances, and concept combinations. Instead, we think that the main limitation in creating more novel solutions is in that the system cannot produce novel concepts (i.e. building blocks), beyond the concepts that already occurred in designs. For the discussed TM, it means that the solutions will not include other words than those that appear in previous solutions. We performed preliminary work on a system that would automatically create new concepts (building blocks) [36] , but our future work will address this issue in more detail.",
