            "text": "Countries across the world imposed lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been proposed that lockdown conditions, including social and physical distancing measures, may disproportionately impact those living with chronic pain and require rapid adaptation to treatment and care strategies. Using an online methodology, we investigated how lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom impacted individuals with chronic pain (N = 431) relative to a healthy control group (N = 88). Data were collected during the most stringent period of lockdown in the United Kingdom (mid-April to early-May 2020). In accordance with the fear-avoidance model, we hypothesised lockdown-related increases in pain and psychological distress, which would be mediated by levels of pain catastrophising. Responses indicated that people with chronic pain perceived increased pain severity, compared to their estimation of typical pain levels prior to lockdown (p < .001). They were also more adversely affected by lockdown conditions compared to pain-free individuals, demonstrating greater self-perceived increases in anxiety and depressed mood, increased loneliness and reduced levels of physical exercise (p \u2a7d .001). Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that pain catastrophising was an important factor relating to the extent of selfperceived increases in pain severity during lockdown (\u03b2 = .27, p < .001) and also mediated the relationship between decreased mood and pain. Perceived decreases in levels of physical exercise also related to perceptions of increased pain (\u03b2 = .15, p < .001). Interestingly, levels of pain intensity (measured at two time points at pre and during lockdown) in a subgroup (N = 85) did not demonstrate a significant change. However, individuals in this subgroup still reported self-perceived pain increases during lockdown, which were also predicted by baseline levels of pain catastrophising. Overall, the findings indicate that people with chronic pain suffer adverse effects of lockdown including self-perceived increases in their pain. Remote pain management provision to target reduction of pain catastrophising and increase health behaviours including physical activity could be beneficial for this vulnerable population.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease related to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. 1 Due to the high infection and mortality rate of COVID-19, many countries implemented periods of lockdown to reduce uncontrolled spread of the virus. 2 Lockdown of economic and social activities creates a situation of threat in vulnerable populations due to health anxiety, physical inactivity, reduced accessibility to usual care, social isolation and financial-economic uncertainty. 2, 3 It was recently proposed that the COVID-19 pandemic would substantially impact those living with chronic pain and thus require efforts to adapt treatment and care strategies. 4 Chronic pain affects around 40% of the UK adult population 5 and represents a significant global burden at both the individual and socioeconomic levels. 6, 7 Increased prevalence of chronic pain in the elderly and those with comorbid illness or disability 5, 8 overlaps with the highest risk for COVID-19. Empirical research is essential to capture how people living with chronic pain are affected by the current pandemic and to support efforts to develop pain management approaches in these challenging conditions, for example, online technologies to improve levels of social support, combat social isolation and offer treatment provision. 9, 10 Previous research indicates a likelihood that chronic pain populations suffer increased severity of symptoms in high-stress situations including war or the aftermath of terrorist attacks. 11, 12 If we can better understand how high-stress situations exacerbate chronic pain, we can adapt clinical strategies to mitigate the associated suffering. 13 A likely mediator of greater pain severity resulting from high-stress situations is psychological distress, 14 which critically impacts on the perception of pain, physical disability 15 and overall quality of life. [16] [17] [18] For example, anxiety augments neural processes modulating the perception of pain. [19] [20] [21] In addition, the fear-avoidance model of chronic pain 22, 23 points to the theoretical importance of pain-related fear and catastrophising as contributors to decreased mood and physical activity, which in turn exacerbate pain symptoms. A unique characteristic of the COVID-19 lockdowns are physical and social distancing measures; these measures would be expected to impact pain symptoms via a combination of changes in physical activity levels, mood and anxiety. Reduced physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate effects of psychological stress and reduce coping with anxiety and depression, especially in vulnerable populations. 24 The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is becoming increasingly apparent. Increased psychological distress is evident in COVID-19 patients and health professionals who treat them. 25, 26 During peak lockdown conditions, sharp increases were seen in prevalence of anxiety and depression in the general adult population in China. 27 In research from the United States and Spain, 'stay at home' directives and living with chronic illness are factors associated with greater risk of adverse effects. 28, 29 Considering this evidence, there is a clear need to understand how changes in psychological well-being and physical activity levels, due to the ongoing pandemic and related lockdown conditions, impact on pain experience in chronic pain populations.",

We hypothesised that lockdown conditions would cause increased levels of pain severity relative to pre-lockdown period in respondents living with chronic pain. Second, we predicted that lockdown conditions would have a greater impact on the psychological and physical well-being of people with chronic pain, relative to non-pain, respondents. Third, we hypothesised that self-perceived changes in reported pain levels could be related to levels of pain catastrophising, and changes in their psychological well-being and physical activity, in accordance with theoretical models of fear avoidance.",

A subgroup (N = 85) of chronic pain patients were also recruited sequentially from a database of patients who had previously given the experimenters permission to be contacted for future research. This subgroup had previously proffered comparable pre-lockdown baseline data on pain and psychological measures. Responding participants were directed to the study pages which were programmed in Qualtrics software (Qualtrics, Utah, USA). First, participants read an information sheet and gave informed consent using a tick box procedure. They answered demographic questions, self-reported whether they had chronic pain and their relevant diagnosis, and answered some questions about their personal lockdown conditions such as size of household. A series of visual analogue scales (VAS) captured current pain and well-being levels before participants completed self-report differential measures indicating their self-perception of change in their pain, physical exercise and well-being relative to pre-COVID levels. Finally, participants completed a series of short, validated questionnaires to capture pain, pain-related cognition and psychological well-being (full description below). A debrief page at the end of the study provided information on the purpose of the study. They were informed of how to contact the researchers directly with any questions and we also highlighted some useful resources for those suffering pain or psychological distress during lockdown. All respondents were recruited for this study as part of an ongoing longitudinal investigation comprising six fortnightly sessions to be completed over a period of 3 months. Every participant was offered reimbursement of \u00a33.33 for completing each session which was paid upon completion of the longitudinal data collection (maximum total \u00a320). Payment was made in the form of a bank transfer or online shopping gift voucher depending on participant preference at the end of the longitudinal period.",

Again, this utilised a VAS (0-100, anchors 'Very much better', centre marker 'About the same', to 'Very much worse'). All participants completed differential VAS to indicate their perceived change (relative to a typical week in pre-COVID period) for the levels of mood, anxiety and exercise over the past 7 days. The items specifically asked 'How tense, nervous or anxious have you felt? (0-100, anchors \"Very much better\", centre marker \"About the same\", to \"Very much worse\"), how depressed or blue have you felt?' (0-100, anchors 'Very much better', centre marker 'About the same', to 'Very much worse'), 'how much physical exercise have you managed to take?' (0-100, anchors 'Very much more than usual', centre marker 'About the same', to 'Very much less than usual'). The wording for the questions and anchors for VAS differential items was adapted from similar items in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire. 31 Participants in the chronic pain group then reported any 'difficulties obtaining pain medication, other treatments or social care in the past two weeks'. All participants were asked whether they had experienced any illness other than chronic pain in the previous 2 weeks. They also reported whether they were self-isolating due to high-risk status, which encompassed following enhanced recommendations to completely shield oneself during lockdown. 30 Finally, participants completed a series of brief, validated questionnaires to consider pain experience, pain cognition and psychological well-being. Specifically, these included the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), 32 a 13-item self-report measure of negative cognitive-affective responses to anticipated or actual pain. We also delivered an adapted version of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form 33 to assess the severity of pain and its impact on functioning. Finally, we utilised the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 34 a commonly used 14-item self-rating scale developed to assess psychological distress with subscales for Anxiety and Depression. The adaptations to the BPI included removal of items requesting patients draw pain location, as well as items on minimal pain and medication lists.

In this subgroup of participants, a within-subjects t-test was utilised to compare current pain intensity with previous data. For comparison with existing baseline NRS data, the current pain score was converted from the 100-point VAS to a 10-point NRS equivalent by dividing by 10 and then rounding to nearest whole integer. Five participants had some missing data for the comparison of pain scores and were omitted from the pain comparison.

The prior hierarchical multiple regression model was repeated with the addition of an intermediary step. After controlling for the confound variables, PCS scores were entered as a mediating variable, before the differential predictors were finally entered. As before, participant age, sex and reports of other illness were entered in Step 1 of the model which was not statistically significant F (3, 415) = .67, p = .55 (Table 5) . Following entry of PCS scores in Step 2, the total variance explained by the model was 12% (F (4, 414) = 13.57; p < .001). PCS scores accounted for an additional 11% of variance in self-reported changes in pain, after controlling for participant demographics (R 2 Change = .11; F (1, 411) = 51.96; p < .001). After the inclusion of self-reported changes in mood, anxiety and exercise levels in Step 3 of the model, the total variance explained was 18% (F (4, 411) = 12.63; p < .001).

In the final adjusted model, PCS scores exhibited the best predictive value (\u03b2 = .27, p < .001) than self-reported changes in physical exercise (\u03b2 = .15, p = .001). Change in mood was no longer significant (\u03b2 = .11, p = .08), nor were perceived changes in anxiety levels t (\u03b2 = .09, p = .17). The analysis indicates that PCS scores are also a significant predictor of self-perceived changes in pain levels during lockdown period.

            "text": "We set out to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated lockdown restrictions, impacted individuals with chronic pain in terms of their psychological well-being, physical activity levels and pain experience. The findings reveal that people with chronic pain reported self-perceived increases in levels of pain severity during the most stringent period of lockdown in the United Kingdom (mid-April to early-May 2020) compared to the period before lockdown. They were more adversely affected by lockdown conditions than pain-free individuals, reporting greater selfperceived increases in anxiety and depressed mood, increased loneliness and reduced levels of physical exercise. People with chronic pain were more likely to be self-isolating due to high-risk status (observing increased levels of social distancing and restrictions on activity) and more likely to report any other illness in the preceding fortnight compared to non-pain counterparts. We hypothesised a mediating role for pain catastrophising on perceived changes in pain during lockdown and its mental and physical health consequences. The extent of self-perceived increases in pain symptoms in individuals with chronic pain was magnified by greater levels of pain catastrophising, which also mediated the impact of decreased mood on perception of pain. Perceived decreases in levels of physical exercise also independently related to perceptions of increased pain. Interestingly, actual changes in pain severity (relative to pre-lockdown reports of pain measured in a subgroup with baseline data) did not change significantly. Yet patients in this subgroup still reported self-perceived pain increases during lockdown, which were also predicted by baseline levels of pain catastrophising. Overall, the findings suggest that, during this period of crisis, pain catastrophising and physical activity levels are potentially important targets for pain management interventions.",

            "text": "Pain catastrophising and reduced levels of exercise are both essential components of the fear-avoidance model of chronic pain. 22, 23, 36 In chronic pain populations, pain catastrophising contributes to hypervigilance and fear related to pain and results in lower levels of psychological resilience. 37 People with high pain catastrophising scores have been shown to avoid strenuous exercise. 38 Research evidence from chronic pain patients demonstrates that catastrophising predicts psychological distress, 39 avoidance of daily living activities and increased levels of physical dysfunction. 40 Physical inactivity promotes physical deconditioning, which then exacerbates pain during activity to cause greater aversion in a cycle of fear avoidance. 22, 41 In this manner, pain catastrophising promotes behavioural responses which lead to exacerbation of pain and other symptoms in chronic pain patients contributing to reduced quality of life. 36 In the present research, pain catastrophising mediated the relationship between lockdown-related changes in perceived pain and depressed mood which reflects a recent study of older chronic pain patients. 42 Pain catastrophising was previously shown to mediate the relationship between negative interpersonal events and pain-related affective symptoms 43 and also moderated effects of exposure to missile attacks on pain and depressed mood in chronic pain patients in Israel. 44 Together, these studies highlight the importance of catastrophising in chronic pain populations during the response to negative, high-stress situations. No other studies have yet analysed levels of pain catastrophising in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, health anxiety, which causes one to amplify perception of bodily sensations or changes as symptoms of being ill and which impacts on chronic pain experience, 45 was recently shown to be exacerbated by the current pandemic, 46 particularly in vulnerable populations. 47 In this study, perceived changes in anxiety levels did not relate to lockdown pain increases. This aligns with previous research suggesting that pain catastrophising predicts post-operative pain levels independently of anxiety and/or depression 48 It was recently highlighted that public health, social, clinical and psychological factors point to the likelihood of increased risk of pain and other symptoms in chronic pain populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. 4 The present findings confirm this risk and demonstrate that people with chronic pain are more adversely affected by lockdown conditions compared to pain-free individuals. Perceived increases in pain severity and psychological distress offer empirical support to calls for rapid measures to provide appropriate care provision to chronic pain patients throughout this period. 4, 13 Cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic pain has greatest effectiveness when specifically targeting high catastrophising patients 50 and can be successfully delivered using remote technology to reduce pain catastrophising. 51 Remote technologies also have the potential to deliver pain physiology education, which are effective in alleviating pain catastrophising. 52, 53 Physical exercise interventions also offer a flexible and potentially effective approach. 54, 55 Meta-analyses of telemedicine approaches for pain management provision and exercise therapy in chronic pain patients indicate positive outcomes that are broadly comparable to usual care 56, 57 and highlight that telemedicine options may be a suitable substitute when usual care is not possible. Based on our data, we contend that remote pain management approaches to reduce pain catastrophising (particularly in high catastrophising patients) and promote physical activity should be considered for rapid implementation during the current crisis.",

            "text": "The findings from the baseline group indicated that, although self-reported levels of pain severity are perceived to increase during lockdown, actual levels of pain reported are comparable to data recorded before the pandemic. There are a number of reasons why this may be the case. First, it could indicate that self-perceived increases in pain severity are not due to actual increases in physical pain, but more a consequence of increased psychological distress. In this study, baseline pain catastrophising levels predicted the degree of selfperceived pain increase in the baseline subgroup. Previously, prospective studies have shown that baseline pain catastrophising predicts severity of post-operative pain. 58, 59 As pain catastrophising was also the strongest predictor of self-perceived increases in pain in the full chronic pain cohort, this points to the need to make this a principal clinical outcome and target for telemedicine pain management. On the contrary, it must be noted that the baseline sample was selected from ongoing or previous research which utilised local pain clinics for recruitment. These respondents did exhibit some demographic differences (older, greater proportion of males) and significantly higher levels of pain severity relative to chronic pain respondents recruited through other methods (Supplemental material 1). There could also be differences due to the data collection methods, with lockdown data collected using online tools compared to face-to-face clinics which could promote demand characteristics. Furthermore, actual changes in pain were measured using a different question and response scale compared to retrospective change ratings, pointing to the possibility that the latter method may be more sensitive to measuring changes in pain, albeit less quantifiable in terms of actual pain severity. Overall, we caution that the finding of no actual pain increases, compared to pre-lockdown data, in the baseline subgroup should be interpreted with restraint.",

            "text": "The present research has some limitations. First the chronic pain group were more adversely affected on all included measures of interest, although we could not practically include every clinically relevant measure available. For example, pain acceptance and perceived self-efficacy could be important factors not captured here. The relevant tools to capture these contributors typically include items that discuss quality of life in the context of pain (e.g. 'I lead a full life even though I have chronic pain') in the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire. 60 There was a high risk that the validity of such items would be negatively impacted by the confounding effect of lockdown restrictions on lifestyle. The decision to focus on pain catastrophising in this study also reflects the fact that negative thought patterns have been shown to be more closely related to outcomes of perceived pain severity than positive factors such as pain acceptance. 61 The recruitment also resulted in a much greater proportion of female respondents. This was entirely driven by increased levels of uptake among females, despite the fact that advertising always utilised locations open to any sex or gender. It is also important to note that online survey methodologies are subject to specific limitations such as the inability to validate accuracy of responses and levels of participant engagement. To maximise participant response engagement, free text responses were interspersed throughout the survey and validity of free text input was manually checked. On the same line, use of self-report for changing pain levels and participants own judgements of what constitutes a 'typical' pre-COVID week are subject to known psychological influences in chronic pain populations, specifically memory recall and aggregation biases. 62 Despite the necessity imposed by lockdown, these factors should be considered as limitations of the present methodology. Additionally, no data was collected on participants' own perceived adherence to the lockdown guidance which could represent an important factor for consideration. Finally, as a cross-sectional design, it is not possible to infer the causal nature of relationships between the many biopsychosocial factors which could be impacted during the current pandemic. All participants were subject to consistent lockdown conditions when responding to the survey, but there was variability in the time spent experiencing restrictions prior to providing their responses. In light of this, it is worth highlighting that this study reports on the first phase of data in a longitudinal design. Current respondents will continue to report on these measures regularly across coming months. Longitudinal data will permit more complex analyses to consider causality of the relationship between pain severity, pain cognition, psychological and physical well-being, and permit greater consideration of the influence of lockdown in a manner that is sensitive to temporal changes. It will also allow for consideration of long-term impacts of lockdown restrictions which could yet have unforeseen and far-reaching implications.",

Specifically, people with chronic pain reported self-perceived increases in pain levels as well as increased adverse effects of lockdown compared to the non-pain comparison group. The findings support the urgent need for additional research concerning efforts to adapt remote clinical provision and to consider whether adverse effects of lockdown on vulnerable populations warrant consideration when generating guidance and implementing restrictions for specific groups. We highlight a potentially important role for pain catastrophising and reduced physical activity in the experience of people who live with chronic pain during lockdown conditions. This is significant because it points to possible clinical targets for therapeutic and behavioural interventions during the current, and future, crises. With additional research, it may be possible to rapidly adapt efforts to target remote pain management towards reducing levels of pain catastrophising, particularly in high catastrophising patients, and promoting physical activity as the pandemic continues. However, it is important to note that to truly establish whether such measures would be beneficial would require prospective research support, preferably within a randomised controlled trial design.",
