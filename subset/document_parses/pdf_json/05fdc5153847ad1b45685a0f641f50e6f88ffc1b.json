As of 20 December 2021, the country had about 50 635 831 tests done for COVID-19 with a test rate of 1 324 623 per 1 million population. 4 Irrespective of the type of COVID-19 test used, random testing is postulated to be the most efficient ways of controlling the spread of the disease among the population. 10 11 Yet, Canada's testing capacity has been limited to symptom-based screening. 12 This situation may have serious repercussion on the country's capacity to effectively control the disease in the wake of yet another wave of COVID-19, hence, warranting the need for a study that examines the association between self-reported symptoms and testing for COVID-19 in Canada.",

This survey has been adapted from Canning et al. 15 The survey adopted a cross-sectional design, with the data collection taking place in three waves. However, for this study, we relied on data from the first wave which was conducted between July and October 2020 (as shown in figure 1 ). For data collection, we shared the survey in various social networks and encouraged the snowball method. We also shared the University of Ottawa's Web links via sponsored posts on Facebook in English and French via the university's institutional account. Survey questions were related to sociodemographic characteristics, recent work experience and loss of income, symptoms of COVID-19 among individuals and members of their households, mental health condition, social distancing behaviour and COVID-19 testing. On average, the English survey took 7 min and French survey took 8 min to be completed by the respondents. In total, 4875 responses across Canada were collected. Of this number, 3225 responses were in English with the remaining 1650 in French. However, for the purpose of this study only respondents who had complete information on reported COVID-19-related symptoms and that of members of their households were included. Therefore, the sample size used for the analysis is 2790. ",

There were two explanatory variables that were used to generate this variable: COVID-19-related symptoms among respondents and COVID-19-related symptoms among household members. We derived the former by asking whether the respondents had experienced either fever, dry cough, decreased sense of smell/ taste, other influenza-like symptoms and/or shortness of breath within the past 2 weeks preceding the survey. The responses were 'yes', 'no' and 'don't know'. Respondents who reported having experienced at least one of the aforementioned symptoms were considered as those with reported COVID-19-related symptoms whereas the remaining respondents were categorised as having experienced no COVID-19-related symptoms. For the second explanatory variable, that is, COVID-19-related symptoms among household members, the variable was derived by asking whether 'anyone else in your household besides yourself experienced any of the following symptoms in the past 2 weeks'. The responses were categorised as 'yes', 'no' and 'don't know'. COVID-19-related symptoms among household members were obtained from affirmative responses provided by respondents to at least one of the symptoms among household members (fever, dry cough, decreased sense of smell/taste, other influenza-like symptoms and/or shortness of breath); otherwise, they were categorised as not reporting any COVID-19-related symptoms among household members. Finally, COVID-19-related symptoms among respondents or household members was obtained by creating a composite variable from the two variables. Respondents who mentioned that they and/or members of their households had COVID-19-related symptoms were put in one category (coded as 1) and those who responded that they and/or members of their households had no COVID-19-related symptoms were put into another category (coded as 0).",

Frequencies and percentages were first used to describe the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents and present the proportions of testing for COVID-19 among the respondents using charts. Next, \u03c7 2 test of independence was used to show the difference in testing for COVID-19 among the respondents across self-reported COVID-19 symptoms and the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents. Statistical significance was obtained at 95% CI. Next, a multivariable logistic regression was employed to examine the effect of reported COVID-19 symptoms on COVID-19 testing among the respondents. Progressive modelling, consisting of gradually controlling for covariates in five regression models, was performed. Model 1 had only reported COVID-19 symptoms and testing. In model 2, demographic variables such as gender and age were added as controls. In model 3, province, ethnicity and minority group were added to the variables in model 2 as controls. In model 4, education, and total income in 2019 were included in the modelling. In the final model (model 5), number of household members was included to the variables in model 4. The results were presented as adjusted ORs (aOR) at 95% CI. Finally, the results of the multivariable logistic regression were disaggregated by gender.

Only 18.2% of Canadian adults reported that they or a member of their household had been tested for COVID-19. This prevalence is higher than what has been reported in previous nationally representative study conducted in Canada 16 that found a prevalence of three percent for COVID-19 testing in Canada in January 2020. Although the observed prevalence of COVID-19 testing reflects an improvement in the testing capacity in the country, the prevalence remained low at the time the first wave of our survey was completed. This could be due to the testing guidelines in Canada that is mainly focused on individuals who actively seek a test, thereby resulting in a selective set of cases that are largely presenting symptoms associated with the virus. 11 The odds of getting tested was significantly associated with report of COVID-19 symptoms at the individual level, with higher education levels, with number of household members and with the province of residence of the respondents.",

Analogous findings have been reported in studies conducted in Canada. 14 16 For example, the present analysis is in agreement with Lapointe-Shaw et al 14 who found COVID-19 testing to be reported in 2%-9% of symptomatic responses. The result implies that, despite Canada's relatively effective response to COVID-19 at the federal, provincial and regional levels, there may be several cases that are missed out due to the over-reliance on symptomatic testing, 11 thus leading to increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Other studies suggest that in situations where COVID-19 testing is most likely to be undertaken by symptomatic individuals, it stifles accurate measurement of COVID-19 infection rate in the larger population. 17 18 Moreover, persons who do not experience COVID-19related symptoms (asymptomatic) are often reluctant to seek COVID-19 test. 19 The findings of this study underscore the importance of random testing that the federal, provincial and regional public health departments have not considered to date. The governments should also educate and sensitise the Canadian population about the need to undertake routine testing irrespective of being symptomatic or asymptomatic.",

Generally, available empirical evidence suggests that older people (65 years and older) are at the greatest risk of COVID-19 infections, 24 25 hence, it is expected that they would be most likely to seek COVID-19 test. Unexpectedly, we found that respondents aged 65-84 years had significantly lower odds of undertaking COVID-19 test compared with those aged 18-44 years. This unexpected result may be attributed to the fact that the current study did not include older Open access people living in long term care homes, nursing homes or retirement homes. Report from the 2016 census shows that 6.8% of Canadians aged 65 years and older were residing in nursing homes or senior residences; however, this proportion increases to 30% when only those aged 85 years and older are considered. 26 This inherent limitation of our study explains the observed lower likelihood of COVID-19 testing among those aged 65-84 years. Lower odds of testing were found among respondents in British Columbia compared with those in Quebec. Also, respondents who lived in Alberta had greater likelihood of undergoing COVID-19 test compared with those who resided in Quebec. This observation could be linked to the administrative, management and governance disparities. For instance, Alami et al 27 posit that unlike Quebec where substantial governance challenges concerning the clarification of roles and alignment of positions between the provincial government and large municipalities exist, 27 Alberta experienced stronger governance coherence and response to the pandemic, translating to greater odds of testing for COVID-19 in Alberta compared with Quebec.",

Due to the nationally representativeness of the data, we can generalise the findings to the larger Canadian adult population. However, several associations cannot be interpreted as causal relationship since the study adopted a cross-sectional design. Perhaps, a longitudinal study would be helpful in ascertaining and establishing a causal relationship between the reported COVID-19 symptoms and COVID-19 testing among the Canadian population. Again, data collection was conducted online. Hence, due to the lack of verification, the accuracy of reporting could be a limitation.
