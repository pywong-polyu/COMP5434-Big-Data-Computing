On the Roche platform, at time of writing, of 2055 tests run, the probability of getting a value <1.0 but >0.2 is <1%. Likewise, on the Abbott method, results around the cut-off are hard to find.",

However, out of an initial verification set of 52 confirmed PCR-positive samples, one gave a 'not detected' antibody result on the Roche assay. During routine use, a further two PCR-positive patients on the Roche have tested antibody negative. At 62, 60 and 45 days postpositive swab, the Roche results were 0.08, 0.18 and 0.247, respectively. Similar cases have been identified on the Abbott system.",

            "text": "It may be that some cases were caught early, prior to seroconversion, or late when the antibody response had faded. This may also account for the rarity of intermediate values. Alternative explanations include the possibility that the PCR result may have been a falsepositive, or that not all individuals produce antibodies detectable by the current methods available (confirmed in PHE validation). Further data will be reviewed locally, and trials are being set up nationally to review the natural history of antibody status. We would encourage such studies in order to identify the reasons for discrepancies either biological or analytical.",
