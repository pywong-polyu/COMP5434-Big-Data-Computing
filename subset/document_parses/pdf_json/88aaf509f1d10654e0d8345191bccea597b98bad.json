Since the emergence in Hubei province, China, during late 2019, the situation evolved to pandemic level. Following China, Europe was the second epicenter of the pandemic. To better comprehend the detailed founder mechanisms of the epidemic evolution in Central-Eastern Europe, particularly in Hungary, we determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 32 clinical samples collected from laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients over the first month of disease in Hungary. We applied a haplotype network analysis on all available complete genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from GISAID database as of 21 April 2020. We performed additional phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses to achieve the recognition of multiple and parallel introductory events into our region. Here, we present a publicly available network imaging of the worldwide haplotype relations of SARS-CoV-2 sequences and conclude the founder mechanisms of the outbreak in Central-Eastern Europe.",

Secondly, the edge weights were transformed (100-weight) in the full network to make high values low and low values high. Next, a minimum spanning tree (MST) was identified as described previously [8] . The path of MST is considered as the most probable chain of infection. Although it should be interpreted with caution, considering the underrepresentation of sequence data to the size of epidemic, this method is suitable to conclude the origin of an epidemic. In our case it means the verification of single or multiple introduction theories and associate Hungarian sequences with geographic regions of the epidemic. In a spanning tree, every node has only one or two connections. If multiple edges have the same minimum weight, the algorithm will randomly pick one and not select all links with the same values. To manage this issue, the graph with additional edges was modified by adding every edge for each node having an equal or higher weight than the edges in the initial MST to the corresponding node. All data analyses were performed using the R 3.6.2 on Linux [9], for network creation, and the Igraph package was applied [10] .",

Subsequently, both best-fitting substitution model and the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with ultra-bootstrapping were implemented in IQTREE webserver [13, 14] . The resulting tree was subjugated to a root-to-tip regression analysis in TempEst [15] to assess the clock-likeness regarding the data. A positive correlation was observed between sampling time and root-to-tip genetic divergence (r = 70, R 2 = 54) indicating the suitability of the dataset for molecular clock analysis using the Beast v1.10.4 package. The KHY+I substitution model with the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock, in addition to the coalescent exponential population growth model, were applied [16] . The MCMC chains were run for 200 million iterations and sampled every 10,000 cycles, or generations, with 10% discarded as burn in. We explored the effective sample sizes in Tracer (ESS > 200) [17] . Moreover, to explore the phylogeographic diffusion of SARS-COV-2 in continuous space, the lognormal relaxed random walk diffusion model and a lognormal uncorrelated relaxed clock model were implemented in the same package, were next employed. Thus, the maximum clade credibility tree was visualized in SpreaD3 [18] .",

Clusters are defined as monophyletic clades with minimum two taxa and at least one Hungarian sequence on Figure S2 . The investigated Hungarian genomes are dispersed within four main clusters (Figure 2 ). The genome designated SARS-CoV-2/human/Hungary/620/27_03_2020 is solely positioned in the B3 genetic lineage, which is a main European lineage with mostly England-related, mainly Welsh sequences [25] .

Two of these are structured by mostly the Western-European sequences, whilst the others are dominant clusters in the USA and the China-Australia-USA relation.

Using the complete haplotype network dataset as a backbone, we applied additional phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Figure S2) . It is likely that occupation-related movement within the EU resulted in multiple introductory events from Western-European host countries towards Central-Eastern Europe. This observation is further supported by a narrative analysis on the Nextstrain online platform focusing on Eastern European processes of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolution [26] . Similarly to Hungary and possibly to the entire region, there were eleven separate introductions to Poland, based on the currently available sequence data [26] . In order to leverage additional support regarding this phenomenon, we applied a local Nextstrain database workflow in the addition of the sequences from this manuscript (Supplementary Figure S3) [27] . As a result of this analysis and considering the observation from Poland, we were able to lend more support for the Using the complete haplotype network dataset as a backbone, we applied additional phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Figure S2) . It is likely that occupation-related movement within the EU resulted in multiple introductory events from Western-European host countries towards Central-Eastern Europe. This observation is further supported by a narrative analysis on the Nextstrain online platform focusing on Eastern European processes of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolution [26] . Similarly to Hungary and possibly to the entire region, there were eleven separate introductions to Poland, based on the currently available sequence data [26] . In order to leverage additional support regarding this phenomenon, we applied a local Nextstrain database workflow in the addition of the sequences from this manuscript (Supplementary Figure S3) [27] . As a result of this analysis and considering the observation from Poland, we were able to lend more support for the regular and dispersed introductions into Central-Europe. In addition to regular movement, the border restrictions as outbreak mitigation measures fixed a narrow timescale for individuals returning to Hungary and likely facilitated the parallel introductory events dispersed throughout the country. Based on genetic lineage categorization using PANGOLIN software, 20 out of the total 32 Hungarian sequences fell into the most dominant (i.e., most sequenced) lineage B.1 (Table 1) . Dominance may largely depend on sampling heterogeneity Viruses 2020, 12, 1401 8 of 10 between geographic regions and countries. However, it substantiates the connection of Hungary regarding SARS-CoV-2 cases to multiple European sources and provides additional support for the network analysis.",

These observations elegantly support the scenario regarding multiple individual introductions. In parallel, local clusters were also observed (PP = 100%) indicating local transmission even within the short timeframe of sampling.
