            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an important public health problem. Studies indicated that TAP plays a key role in the presentation and transport of antigenic peptides during anti-M.tb infection. Given the important biological role of the TAP gene involved in anti-M.tb infection, a family-based case-control study including 133 tuberculosis patients, 107 healthy household contacts, and 173 healthy controls was conducted to assess the association between TAP gene polymorphisms and TB susceptibility. The basic information of subjects and their blood samples were collected. Four SNPs including rs1135216, rs1057141, rs241447, and rs3819721 were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Our results suggested that BMI, residence, bedroom crowding, indoor humidity, fitness activities, history of smoking, and TB exposure history were associated with the occurrence of tuberculosis (P < 0.05). A significant association was observed between the TAP1 rs1135216 CT/CC genotype and increased TB risk, and the ORs were 2.56 (95% CI 1.31-4.99) and 6.73 (95% CI 1.33-34.02), respectively. TAP2 rs3819721 GG genotype carriers also showed an increased risk of TB when compared TB patients to healthy household contacts. Haplotype analysis revealed that the haplotype CT at rs1057141 and rs1135216 (OR = 11.34, 95% CI 1.49-86.56; OR = 7.45, 95% CI 1.43-38.76), as well as TA at rs241447 and rs3819721 (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.07-4.56) had a significantly increased risk of TB. The genetic risk scores (GRS) analysis of the four loci indicated that the risk of tuberculosis increased with increasing GRS scores in TB vs HHC (P trend = 0.010) and in TB vs HC (P trend = 0.001). In conclusion, our findings suggested that the SNPs of rs1135216 and rs3819721 were associated with TB susceptibility among the tuberculosis-prone families in the Chinese Han population and the risk of developing tuberculosis increases with the number of risk alleles, which could help identify high-risk groups in time and take scientific preventive measures. Further cohort studies with large samples are needed to validate the role of TAP gene variants on TB susceptibility.",

            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB), a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is a serious threat to human health and a major public health problem in developing countries (Zumla et al. 2013) . The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that there were 10 million new cases of TB in 2020 and China has the second highest TB burden in the world, accounting for 9% of the world's TB cases (Chakaya et al. 2021) . The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) ravages the world, and extraordinary health demands during the pandemic have diminished efforts to diagnose and treat people with tuberculosis (Kuehn 2020) . While one-third of the world's population were infected with M.tb according to the statistics, only 10% of infected individuals eventually develop active TB, the other 90% may never develop symptomatic disease (Tang et al. 2011; Moonan et al. 2020) . This suggests that a large proportion of these individuals may be naturally resistant to TB infection and that host genetic susceptibility plays a non-negligible role in the development of TB. However, the specific role played by specific genetic factors in the development of tuberculosis is unknown, so further research into host genetic factors associated with M.tb infection could help us uncover new Several studies support the influence of host genetics on TB susceptibility, including case observations, twin studies, candidate gene association and genome-wide association studies (Thye et al. 2010; Vannberg et al. 2011) . Moreover, in recent years, there have been a large number of previous studies proving the evidence of association between host genetic polymorphisms and TB susceptibility (Selvaraj et al. 2015; Yuan et al. 2016) . These genetic variants are mainly involved in the body's immune response to M.tb and their polymorphisms may lead to increased genetic susceptibility to TB. Therefore, it is essential to determine the relationships between the genetic variations and the susceptibility to TB to comprehensively understand the pathogenesis of mycobacterial infection (Zhang et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "TB is considered to be an immune-related disease. The incidence and development of TB are associated with host immune status, which is mostly decided by host immune regulation-related genes (Verway et al. 2013) . Transporterassociated antigen processing (TAP) is responsible for transferring the endogenous antigen peptides from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then handling and presenting them to immune cells (Harriff et al. 2013) . TAP complex is a heterodimer consisted of two subunits encoded by TAP1 and TAP2 genes, a cluster of genes located within the HLA class II region of the HLA between the HLA-DP and -DQ loci on the short arm of human chromosome 6 (6p21.3) (Ramos et al. 2009 ). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TAP1 and TAP2 genes may result in structural changes that prevent TAP heterodimer formation and alter antigen recognition and presentation, as evidenced in several experimental models, human case studies and malignancies (Zhang et al. 2002; Tang et al. 2001) . These polymorphisms can serve as markers for human disease. Several studies have supported the association of TAP genes with various multifactorial diseases, such as immune-mediated, viral, and bacterial diseases and various types of cancers (Ozbas-Gerceker et al. 2013; Abitew et al. 2020; Qian et al. 2017; Thu et al. 2016) . Studies were also performed on TAP polymorphisms and TB in various populations, including Iran, Koreans, Chinese, etc. (Naderi et al. 2016; Roh et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2021) . However, the research conclusions are not always consistent. Notably, the research in Han Chinese population into the relationship between TAP gene polymorphisms and TB is limited.",

Some of the most studied factors include the history of smoking, alcohol consumption, BCG vaccination, crowded housing and exposure to TB patients. BMI, fitness activities, socioeconomic conditions, indoor humidity, lighting and hygiene may also influence the development of TB, and studies were relatively limited. This study was based on the literature to comprehensively examine the environmental factors that may influence the development of tuberculosis and then analyses the true link between the TAP gene and tuberculosis while controlling for environmental factors. Survey data was collected using epidemiological questionnaires and face-to-face field interviews. The questionnaire included general demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, occupation, education level, Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination history, and personal behavior, such as smoking status, alcohol consumption and fitness situation, as well as living environmental factors, such as lighting, humidity, ventilation and bedroom congestion. The definition and judgment criteria of related indicators as follows: smoking was defined as having at least one cigarette a day for 3 months, and drinking was defined as having at least three times a week for 1 year. At least three times a week, each time more than 30 min of fitness activities and lasting more than half a year is considered to have fitness, as a measure of nutritional status, a BMI of less than 18.5 is defined as low weight malnutrition according to the WHO.",

Several studies (L\u00f6nnroth et al. 2010 ) had shown that BMI could have an effect on the development of tuberculosis. Moreover, multivariate analysis indicated that living in rural areas and crowded bedrooms, as well as moist indoors may be a risk factor for the occurrence of tuberculosis. This may be due to the fact that rural areas are less hygienic than urban areas and M.tb survives more easily in moist environments. Individuals with a history of TB exposure are also at increased risk of developing TB. Literature (Horsburgh and Rubin 2011; Acu\u00f1a-Villaordu\u00f1a et al. 2018) published had demonstrated that close contact to infectious tuberculosis cases is considered the strongest predictor of M.tb infection, more constant exposures to infectious M.tb and subsequently to more risk of progression to tuberculosis, which is in accordance with the findings of this research. The present study sought to identify four polymorphisms in the coding regions of TAP1 and TAP2 genes and observed all the polymorphisms in the subjects enrolled in the study. Significant association between TAP1 rs1135216 and TAP2 rs3819721 genes and tuberculosis was observed when compared TB patients and healthy household contacts. Individuals containing TAP1 CC homozygote and CT heterozygote were found to be strongly associated with tuberculosis infection (OR = 6.73, 2.56, respectively). Similar to the study by Wang et al. (2012) showed that rs1135216 exhibited a significant relation to tuberculosis susceptibility. However, the study carried out in a Northwestern Colombian population also failed to detect any association of TAP1 gene with TB disease (Gomez et al. 2006 ). In addition, the present study also showed that the AG genotype of TAP2 rs3819721 was more common in tuberculosis patients than that in healthy household contacts, suggesting that AG genotype significantly increased risk of tuberculosis infection. In contrast, no association has been found between the risk of tuberculosis and the polymorphisms at TAP1 rs1057141 and TAP2 rs241447, which is not fully concordant with the results of studies by Naderi et al. (2016) and Zhang et al. (2021) found that polymorphisms at the TAP2 rs241447 locus can reduce the risk of tuberculosis. This may be due to the different races and regions of the subjects.",

In this study, the rs1057141 and rs241447 polymorphism was not found to be significantly associated with TB susceptibility. However, when the rs1135216 and rs1057141, as well as rs3819721 and rs241447 SNPs were combined in haplotypes, the rs1135216*C/rs1057141*T and rs3819721*T/ rs241447*A were found to be significantly associated with increased tuberculosis risk, and the OR were 11.34 (95% CI 1.49-86.56) and 2.20 (95% CI 1.07-4.56), respectively. The haplotype CT and TA were genetic markers that may predict tuberculosis risk. Consequently, it seems more important to determine the association between polymorphism and phenotype based on the configuration of haplotypes compared with alleles and genotypes. The results revealed that the combination of multiple genetic variants is a useful and valuable tool, providing deeper insights and additional clues for discovering the risk of disease incidence. The number of genetic variants affecting the development of complex diseases is large and genetic risk scores combine the weak effects of multiple genetic variants to improve the predictability of genetic variants for disease . Compared with those carrying 0-2 risk alleles, those carrying 3-4 risk alleles and those carrying 5-6 risk alleles increased the risk of tuberculosis by 2.13 times and 4.40 times, respectively, with increased disease risk with higher scores. The four genetic polymorphisms of the TAP1 and TAP2 genes have a certain cumulative effect in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.",
