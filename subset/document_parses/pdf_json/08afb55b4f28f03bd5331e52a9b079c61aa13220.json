Moreover, data about administration of TMZ in elderly (\u226565 years) people to treat aggressive PAs are scarce. We report the case of the oldest female patient undergoing the longest TMZ protocol described so far to treat an aggressive, initially silent corticotroph PA. Case report: The patient initially underwent partial surgical removal of the PA. Subsequent treatment with cabergoline was applied, but it was unsuccessful in controlling the growth of the residual tumor. Pasireotide and external radiation also showed to be ineffective; therefore, treatment with TMZ was started at the standard dose of 200 mg/ m 2 /day for 5 days every 4 weeks for a total of 47 cycles. At the time of treatment's beginning, the patient was 83 years old. Radiological follow-up documented a progressive, remarkable reduction of the adenoma and the last imaging, after 39 cycles of TMZ, showed an intrasellar lesion with large areas of cystic degeneration. The patient also developed adrenal deficiency managed with glucocorticoid replacement. No major side effects were observed throughout the treatment, with exception of nausea, well controlled with anti-emetic medication. TMZ therapy was discontinued after 47 cycles; hormonal and imaging follow-up investigations documented sustained functional and dimensional response.",

O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA-repairing protein able to remove alkylating adducts induced by TMZ; thus, its high expression is considered as predictor of resistance to TMZ [6, 7] .",

However, evidence through properly designed studies regarding the optimal duration of TMZ treatment to reach the best clinical response are still scarce [4, 6] . Most of the case-series available so far report short-term therapy (\u226412 months) protocols, but relapse of disease after TMZ withdrawal and subsequent failure of a second course of treatment have been often described [4, 6, 12, 13] . Recent data about long-term protocols of therapy (>12 months) are encouraging, showing a trend toward longer overall survival and progression-free survival in patients receiving extended treatment in association with good toxicity tolerance [4, 6, 11, 14] .",

Oral TMZ at the standard dose of 200 mg/m 2 /day (total 390 mg/day) was administered for 5 days every 4 weeks, according to the standard regimen [6] . The patient experienced notable nausea and vomiting after the first TMZ administration, however regular medication with anti-emetic at each monthly-cycle of TMZ therapy kept the symptoms under control for the whole treatment duration. The patient did not report any other significant side effects beside occasional mild headache and fatigue. The monthly blood investigations did not detect any sign of myelotoxicity. During the treatment, cortisol serum levels progressively decreased until below the normal range and were associated with inappropriate normal ACTH levels ( Table 1 ). In addition, the patient developed signs (mild hyponatremia) and symptoms (hypotension) of hypocortisolism. Therefore, a replacement therapy with glucocorticoids was implemented even without a prior ACTH-stimulating test confirming central hypocortisolism. MRI follow-up documented a progressive, remarkable reduction of the adenoma, with the most significant shrinkage starting from the 27 th cycle of therapy (Figs. 1H and 3) , while the MRI performed after 39 cycles of TMZ found that the lesion was limited to the sellar region and presented with large areas of cystic degeneration (Fig. 1I) .

            "text": "Furthermore, starting from the 27 th cycle of therapy, we recorded an extensive and rapid tumor shrinkage, up to the point that the last MRI performed during TMZ treatment described only a sub-centimetric, almost cystic and completely intra-sellar tumor residue (Figs. 1I and 3) . According to the data reported in literature, PAs achieving a significant dimensional reduction during TMZ treatment usually show the first radiological signs of shrinkage quite early, on average already after 3-9 cycles [4, 8] . Consequently, the latest European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) guidelines recommend a first evaluation of TMZ treatment response after 3 cycles and its withdrawal if radiological progression is documented [3] . Our experience suggests that some patients may obtain a significant response to treatment later than after 3 cycles of TMZ and encourages perseverance by both the clinician and the patient when no severe side effects occur. In fact, in our patient we obtained tumor shrinkage much later than described in literature, but, once detected, it was quick and of a considerable amount. One could argue that the delayed tumor shrinkage could be due to previous external RT treatment rather than to TMZ. Since the time window necessary in significantly reducing PAs size after external RT is not known and the effects of radiation treatments usually last for many years [20] , this hypothesis cannot be completely excluded. However, according to the few data derived from studies on stereotactic radiosurgery (acknowledging the difference between the two radiotherapy methods), the median time to the earliest volume reduction after radiation treatment is 6-9 months [21] , while the 10-months post RT MRI imaging in our patient documented a 67% volumetric increase of the lesion compared to the previous one (Figs. 2 and 3F) . Although an initial, small volumetric increase can occur within 6 to 12 months after radiation therapy (RT) likely because of induced intratumor edema, it is very rare in the setting of PAs and, in any case, dimensionally <15% [21] . Considering the previous discussion, we think that the PA was resistant to RT, and we link the good clinical outcome of our patient more to the salvage therapy with TMZ rather than to RT. To support the importance of TMZ treatment, we underline that the MRI imaging pattern of tumor shrinkage was strongly correlated to typical TMZ effects, including tumor necrosis, hemorrhage, and cystic degeneration (Fig. 1) [22] . However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the delayed effects of RT and the long-term TMZ therapy have reinforced each other thus leading to the tumor reduction. Although the median time between RT and TMZ reported in literature widely varies, it is usually very long, ranging from 39 to 64 months [4, 8] . In our case, the shorter-than-usual interval between the previous radiation treatment and the following TMZ may have helped in enhancing the TMZ effect. A recent ESE survey documented that TMZ therapy given concomitantly with RT can increase the rate of response if compared with TMZ in monotherapy [19] . This supports our presumption that, although a PA shows a radiation-resistant behavior, a shorter latency between RT and TMZ may allow their mutual reinforcement, which, on the other hand, can be lost with a yearslong interval in between the 2 treatments.",

[9] . In our case, we obtained an excellent clinical outcome despite a very low MGMT methylation. Anyhow, the MGMT methylation is not always able to predict responsiveness to TMZ, probably because of the lack of direct relationship between gene methylation and expression and/or the inaccuracy of methods used to estimate methylation [2, 4, 9] . Overall, the expression of MGMT assessed directly by immunohistochemistry methods is considered a good indicator of response to TMZ therapy [7] .",
