            "text": "Viral genomes not only code the protein content, but also include silent, overlapping codes which are important to the regulation of the viral life cycle and affect its evolution. Due to the high density of these codes, their non-modular nature and the complex intracellular processes they encode, the ability of current approaches to decipher them is very limited. We describe the first computationalexperimental pipeline for studying the effects of viral silent and non-silent information on its fitness. The pipeline was implemented to study the Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2), the shortest known eukaryotic virus, and includes the following steps: (1) Based on the analyses of 2100 variants of PCV, suspected silent codes were inferred. (2) Five hundred variants of the PCV2 were designed to include various 'smart' silent mutations. (3) Using state of the art synthetic biology approaches, the genomes of these five hundred variants were generated. (4) Competition experiments between the variants were performed in Porcine kidney-15 (PK15) cell-lines. (5) The variant titers were analyzed based on novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments. (6) The features related to the titer of the variants were inferred and their analyses enabled detection of various novel silent functional sequence and structural motifs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 50 of the silent variants exhibit higher fitness than the wildtype in the analyzed conditions. Viral genomes, in particular coding regions, determine not only the protein products of a virus, but also how their production is regulated such as the regulation of viral gene expression, the replication of the viral genetic material, and avoidance of the immune system 1-5 . This regulation is encoded by the different combinations of synonymous codons, forming an overlapping second layer of information.",

The structure of the mRNA can also influence the folding of the evolving amino acid (AA) chain by causing ribosome pausing 12 and, in some cases, change the protein sequence by causing ribosomal slippage 13 .

Experiments inserting different mutations (start codon alteration, splice-junction modification and in-frame termination) into these RNAs concluded that only Rep and Rep' are required for PCV2 DNA replication 28, 47, 58 . The proteins encoded by Rep, Rep' , cap, ORF3-RNA, ORF4-RNA, have been characterized. However, it is not clear yet what functions the minor RNAs have in the life cycle of the PCV 59, 60 . The capsid protein encoded by ORF2 encapsulates the single-stranded DNA to construct infectious virions, it may also play a role in bringing the proteins Rep and Rep' from the cytoplasm into the nucleus for the DNA replication 50, 61 .",

After downloading 2091 wildtype PCV variants from databases (68 PCV1 variants 2023 PCV2 variants, see details about the downloading dataset and date in Methods section), each of the two major genes was aligned at the amino acid level. Each multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was analyzed to calculate an entropy score for each position (see Methods section). Entropy measures the conservation at the nucleotide level and was computed for each position along the coding sequence. Higher entropy is related to lower conservation and the minimal entropy (zero) is related to the 100% conservation. As shown in Fig. 2 , ORF1 has lower entropy than ORF2 in both PCV types (PCV1 and PCV2), confirming as expected that in general ORF1 is more conserved than ORF2. It seems that positions with regulatory signals that are located in ORF1 such as splicing sites and start/stop sites on inner genes, tend to have relatively low entropy (as expected) as they are all in the top 2%/11% most conserved among all the positions in the PCV2/ PCV1 genomes respectively (see dotted lines in Fig. 2A -C marking these thresholds).",

The mutations in the non-conserved positions (high entropy, orange bars), tend to have a lower www.nature.com/scientificreports/ effect on fitness. This demonstrates that conserved positions are conserved due to selection (the conserved positions are important for the viral fitness) and not because of (random) genetic drift. Figure 6B shows Spearman's correlations between folding energy differences (in absolute values) and fitness difference from the wildtype vs. position in ORF1. Correlation values that are statistically significant are marked in yellow. A positive correlation suggests that there is a statistical relationship between the changes in the local folding energy in the position and between lowering the fitness of the variant compared to the wildtype. Approximately 40 nucleotides from the start of ORF1 there is an area of statistically significant positive correlations. This is an area where the mRNA of ORF1 is spliced in order to create short RNAs (Rep3a, Rep3b and Rep3c). The role of these 3 short RNAs is yet unclear 57 . We learn from this analysis that the local mRNA folding energy of PCV2 has a significant effect on its fitness. Figure 6C shows Spearman's partial correlations between folding energy differences and fitness difference from wildtype given the total number of mutations in ORF1 of the variant vs. position in ORF1. Orange bars indicate statistical significance. Figure 6B and Fig. 6C are almost identical, indicating that the total number of mutations in the ORF can't explain the result, supporting the conjecture that the correlation is directly related to local mRNA folding. The conclusion is that when designing a variant with different regulatory coding (in this case the folding energy) in the regulatory positions/areas mentioned above, the fitness of the variant is expected to decrease. Figure 6D shows fitness differences vs. folding energy differences of ORF1 mutated sequences compared to the wildtype in position 37 in the genome (counted in nucleotides from the beginning of ORF1), which is the position with the highest correlation in Fig. 6B .",

It is possible, that this region includes additional unknown regulatory signals which require/induce weak mRNA folding. This result was reproduced by calculating local folding energy with different window lengths and it is not fully reserved in a null model. In addition, we confirmed that ORF1 is more conserved than ORF2. This is probably a consequence of ORF1 including more regulatory signals (such as splicing sites and start/stop sites on inner genes) encoded in silent aspects of the ORF, and not simply because the only proteins known to be essential to the virus' replication (Rep and Rep') are encoded by ORF1.",

Post-library quantification and quality check (QC) were performed with BioAnalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent) and the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity fluorometric assay (Invitrogen). The size distribution and quality of the library was verified using TapeStation 2200 System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
