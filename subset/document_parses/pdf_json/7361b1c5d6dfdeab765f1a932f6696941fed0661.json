Therefore, to cope with this problem, we investigated the potentiality of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria in controlling this disease. Six strains (Bacillus subtilis, B. circulance, B. coagulanse, B. licheniformis, Pseudomonas fluroscence and P. koreensis) were screened for siderophore production, and using dual plate culture method and greenhouse experiment, antagonistic activity against C. maydis was studied. Using two superior strains, single and dual inoculation treatments in maize were applied in field experiment during the 2018 and 2019 seasons. Results indicated that B. subtilis and P. koreensis strains had shown the most qualitative and quantitative assays for siderophore production and antagonistic activities. In greenhouse, the most effective treatments on the pre-and post-emergence damping off as well as growth promotion of maize were T3 treatment (inoculated with B. subtilis), and T8 treatment (inoculated with P. koreensis). In field experiment, T5 treatment (inoculated with a mixture of B. subtilis and P. koreensis) showed significant increases in catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities, as well as total chlorophyll and carotenoids than control treatments during the two growing seasons. In the same way, the highest effect in reducing infection and increasing the thickness of the sclerenchymatous sheath layer surrounding the vascular bundles in maize stem was observed and these results were a reflection of the increase in yield and yield parameters.",

Worldwide, diseases on maize plants lead to detrimental effects on the economy and the food supplies and pose serious health hazards to both humans and animals. One of these fungal diseases in maize is late wilt, caused by Cephalosporium maydis, which is one of the main economical diseases in Egypt (Samra et al. 1963) , and the infection incidence leads to decrease in grain yield to 40% (Labib et al. 1975 ).

So, many researchers have used plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) as biological control against late wilt disease associated with the maize rhizosphere which could improve plant health, reduce chemical pesticides, and develop efficient biological control strategies (El-Mehalowy et al. 2004 and Ashour et al. 2013; Omara et al. 2017 Omara et al. , 2018 . Therefore, recently, biological control by PGPR has been adopted on a commercial scale by using a number of experimental approaches. These microorganisms can be found in the rhizosphere, rhizoplane or in association with roots, which improve plant growth promotion in the absence of pathogens (direct mechanism) or reduce the deleterious effects of pathogens on crop yield (indirect mechanism) by antibiosis, HCN production, competition, induced systemic resistance and siderophore production (Shivakumar 2007; Mohammed et al. 2020; Larkin 2020) .",

Fig. 3 showed that all inoculation treatments decreased damping off % and increased healthy plants compared with the control treatments (T1 and T2). The lowest pre-emergence damping-off plants (15 days) were recorded for the treatments T3 and T8 (11.66%) compared to other treatments. Also, the post-emergence percentages of damping-off plants (30 days) showed notable decreases due to the different studied bacterial strains; therefore, the most effective treatments were T3, T7 and T8 which completely prevent post-emergence. Concerning the growth promotion parameters (Table 3) , T3 treatment (grains inoculated with B. subtilis) attained an increase rate of 37.42% in fresh weight, 84.79% in dry weight, 76.29% in root length, 21.47% ",

            "text": "It is important to understand the mechanisms involved in the interactions between microorganisms, pathogens, and host plants for the better use of natural resources in crop productivity management (Thomashow and Weller 1991) . One of these mechanism are siderophores production, which are defined as low molecular weight organic compounds (< 10 kDa) that are excreted by microorganisms living in low iron conditions (Oswald 2010) , and is one of the mechanisms of antagonism and biocontrol agents (Sinha and Parli 2020) that has been proved in plant growth-promoting bacteria (Yang et al. 2011 ). In the present study, a total of six PGPR strains were tested in laboratory to produce siderophores using CAS-agar assay, CAS-liquid assay, Arnow\u02bcs assay, Cs\u00e1ky test and FeCl 3 test. Two strains, B. subtilis and P. koreensis, were found to be the most qualitative and quantitative assays for siderophore production (Table 2 ; Fig. 1 ). Rajkumar et al. (2010) showed that bacterial cells produce many types of siderophores, i.e., hydroxamate, catecholate, salicylate and carboxylate. These siderophores play a vital role in the accumulation of Fe from various organic materials (Balagurunathan and Radhakrishnan 2007 ). The antagonistic activity tested in our study effectively suppressed the mycelial growth of C. maydis in in vitro (Fig. 2) . Data indicated that B. subtilis and P. koreensis proved to be the most effective antagonist than other tested strains which reduced the growth of C. maydis by 4.36 and 4.26 cm (Fig. 2a) , and the reduction % attained was 51.55 and 52.66 (Fig. 2b) , respectively. The suppression of mycelial growth of C. maydis was mainly due to the diffusible antifungal substances such as hydrolytic enzymes, antibiotics or some other secondary metabolites (Beneduzi et al. 2012) . The antagonistic activities of Bacillus and Pseudomonas were recognized by many researchers. Ferreira et al. (1991) showed that different Bacillus spp. can produce 66 types of antibiotic compounds against bacteria and fungi such as bacillomycin, fengycin, mycosubtilin, and zwittermicin, which are effective in suppressing the growth of target pathogens in vitro (Kim et al. 2008) . Also, many biocontrol agents of Pseudomonas spp. can produce extracellular secondary metabolities such as cepacins, testin, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, pyoluteorin, phenazine, pyrrolnitrin, pyoverdine and altericidines that inhibit the growth of some soilborne fungal pathogens (Mavrodi et al. 2001; Subagio and Foster 2003) , and are attributed to the production of siderophores, volatile compounds, cell wall-degrading molecules, extracellular chitinase, and protease enzymes activity (Mavrodi et al. 2001) . Likewise, under in vitro conditions, Sandani et al. (2019) showed that Burkholderia and Pseudomonas bacteria are effective antagonists of C. truncatum causing anthracnose. Also, Ali et al. (2018) studied 40 PGPR strains which are able to produce siderophores as well as have a significant growth suppression of pathogenic F. oxysporum and R. solani. El-Shabrawy and Shehata (2018) demonstrated that maize grain treated with B. subtilis and P. fluorescens had a significant reduction in late wilt disease under greenhouse conditions.",

Results showed that the most effective treatments were T3 (grains inoculated with B. subtilis), T7 (grains inoculated with P. fluroscence) and T8 (grains inoculated with P. koreensis) which completely prevent pre-and post-emergence. These results may be due to the effective antibiotics (PCA, PLT, DAPG and PLN) and lipase, pectinase, amylase and protease enzymes as well as siderophores (pyoverdine and pyochelin) that are produced by P. fluorescens, which showed antagonistic activity toward C. maydis (Ebrahim 2010) . Also, Bacillus spp. have modes of action such as antibiosis, parasitism, colonization, competition and induced systemic resistance (Jacobsen et al. 2004) . Similar findings against C. maydis by actinomycetes and yeast fungi were stated by El-Mehalawy et al. (2004) . Hamza et al. (2013) reported that the formulations of B. subtilis, B. pumilus, P. fluorescens and Epicoccum nigrum caused noticeable reduction in maize late wilt. Also, El-Shabrawy and Shehata (2018) found that significant reduction in the disease incidence was recorded by maize grains treated with P. fluorescens, either individually or in combination with B. subtilis. Concerning the growth promotion parameters, results showed that grains inoculated with B. subtilis (T3) and grains inoculated with P. koreensis (T8) attained significant increase in fresh weight, dry weight, root length, shoot length, areal root, seminal root and stem diameter compared to control treatments in soil infested with (Table 3) . These results reflect the role of the tested bioagent inoculants in their effects on growth parameters and control plants such as stimulating cell division, elongation, formation of dried tissues in plants and production of plant growth regulators (L\u00f3pez-Reyes 2017; Shi et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2019; Khan et al. 2020) . Similarly, Laslo et al. (2012) reported that the rapid colonization of maize plant roots due to the production of siderophores by Pseudomonas strains stimulates plant growth and is often due to the reduction in the fungal population in the roots (Penyalver et al. 2001) . Under artificially infested field conditions, grains treated with rhizobacterial strains significantly decreased disease incidence and improved yield and yield component of maize during the 2018 and 2019 seasons. In the current study, antioxidant enzymes' activity (CAT, POX and PPO) significantly improved in plants exposed to inoculation treatments with B. subtilis and P. koreensis either alone or in combination, which in turn reflected in the reduced disease incidence. We observed that plants inoculated with dual inoculation showed higher (3 and 2.5 fold) CAT activities than control plants in the 2018 and 2019 seasons, respectively, at 60 days after sowing (Fig. 4) . These increases in CAT activity were associated with higher growth rates of the most infective fungus. Therefore, CAT plays a vital role in the regulation of intraradical fungal growth. Also, surveying with H 2 O 2 by CAT is an effective mechanism for mitigating plant defense responses (Wu et al. 1997) . These findings are supported by those reported for other crops grown under infested soil conditions such as maize (Kumar et al. 2009 ), eggplant (Altinok et al. 2013) , tomato (Chandrasekaran and Chun 2016), cotton (Selim et al. 2017) , soybean (Zilli et al. 2018 ) and potato (Bagy et al. 2019) .",

            "text": "A similar trend was also observed in the activities of POX. The higher activity of peroxidase was recorded by the application B. subtilis and P. koreensis (T5) which showed an increase rate recorded 55-60% during the two growing seasons (Fig. 4) . Vidhyasekaran (1997) showed that peroxidase enzyme may be involved in the regulation of plant cell elongation, polysaccharide cross-linking, phenol oxidation and IAA oxidation as well as associated with disease resistance in plants and increases in host plants following pathogen infection (Scott-craiz et al. 1995) . Several previous researches confirmed that addition of PGPR to plants induces the activity of POX enzyme and, therefore, enhances the plant's disease resistance (Ramamoorthy et al. 2001; Paul and Sarma 2005; Renuka et al. 2009; Kaur et al. 2017; Zilli et al. 2018; Bagy et al. 2019 ). In the case of PPO activity, we observed that maize plants inoculated with single inoculation showed 2.75-and 3.14-fold higher activity for T3 (grains inoculated with B. subtilis) and 5.5-and 4.75-fold for T4 (grains inoculated with P. koreensis), whereas dual inoculation for T5 (inoculated with a mixture of B. subtilis and P. koreensis) recorded 7-and 4.75-fold in the 2018 and 2019 seasons, respectively (Fig. 4) . It is known that the process of oxidizing phenols to quinones substances, which are toxic to pathogens due to PPO enzyme. Also, PPO enzyme can function in the following ways: (1) quinines substances produced by PPO may alkylate essential amino acids which decrease plant nutritional quality, (2) sometimes, and through redox cycling, quinones may produce oxidative stress in the gut lumen and (3) from phenolic oxidation, quinone substances produced may be absorbed and have toxic effects on herbivores (Helmi and Mohamed 2016) . Chandrasekaran and Chun (2016) indicated that B. subtilis CBR05 treatment showed a significant increase in PPO activity in the leaves of tomato infested with soft rot disease (Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora). Also, PPO enzyme activities have been well established by Kaur et al. (2017) . They found that infested wheat plants with aphid showed a significant increase in PPO activity (1.4fold) at 28 days after emergence (DAE) as compared to the respective uninfested plants. Also, the content of photosynthetic pigments showed a significant increase under the combined inoculation with B. subtilis and P. koreensis (Fig. 4) . In this regard, the severity of late wilt disease is associated with chlorophyll catabolism; therefore, the pathogen causes chlorophyll deterioration and organelle damage and cell death (Kariola et al., 2005; Bagy et al. 2019) . The inoculation treatments with B. subtilis and P. koreensis individually or in combinations may induce disease resistance through photosynthetic pigment restoration to reduce disease development. Our results are in agreement with the findings of Borkar and Yumlembam (2016) and El-Shabrawy and Shehata (2018), concerning the efficiency of inoculation treatments on maize late wilt disease and stem histological differences (Figs. 5, 6) . Treatment with a mixture of B. subtilis and P. koreensis (T5) gave the highest effect in reducing infection and increase in thickness of the sclerenchymatous sheath layer surrounding the vascular bundles. These results may be due to the production of siderophores, non-volatile diffusible metabolites which are related to significant inhibition and biocontrol of the pathogen (El-Mehalowy et al. 2004; Selim et al. 2017; Bagy et al. 2019) . Also, mycelial growth was clearly found in the bundles of stems in 85 days maize plants infected with C. maydis (control treatments). On the contrary, all inoculation treatments showed more layers of sclerenchymatous cells surrounding the xylem vessels. These findings are supported by (Kumar et al. 2009; Boon et al. 2012; Hajiboland et al. 2012; Ghazy et al. 2017) . For yield and yield parameters, inoculation treatments either alone or in combination showed significant influence compared to control (Table 4 ). These increase in yield due to improve the availability of essential nutrients, production of phytohormones, improved Fe availability through chelating soil iron by production of siderophores and enhanced plant resistance system. These results corroborate with those of , , , and ).",

Further investigations are required to study the interactions at the level of gene related to siderophore production in PGPR, pathogenic fungi or host plant.",
