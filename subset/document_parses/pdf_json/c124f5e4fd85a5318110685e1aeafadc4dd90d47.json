COVID-19 is one of the deadliest pandemics in history with more than 384 million cases confirmed, and 5.69 million deaths attributed to it as of February 3, 2022. COVID-19 variants of concern have emerged and become dominant in many countries since 2021, with Delta, Alpha and Beta being the most virulent variants. Omicron, the most recent variant of concern, has an immune escape ability that may allow it to spread via breakthrough infections, possibly allowing it to coexist with Delta, which more often infects the unvaccinated [3] .",
