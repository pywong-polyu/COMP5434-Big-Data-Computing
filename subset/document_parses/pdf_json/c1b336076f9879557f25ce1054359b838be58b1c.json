Herein, we propose an innovative method to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using isothermal amplification of nucleic acids on a mesh containing multiple microfluidic pores. Hybridization of pathogen DNA and immobilized probes forms a DNA hydrogel by rolling circle amplification and, consequently, blocks the pores to prevent fluid movement, as observed. Following optimization of several factors, including pore size, mesh location, and precision microfluidics, the limit of detection (LOD) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 0.7 aM at 15-min incubation. These results indicate rapid, easy, and effective detection with a moderate-sized LOD of the target pathogen by remote point-of-care testing and without the requirement of any sophisticated device.",

Due to symptoms similar to those of the common flu, including fever, cough, and sore throat Singhal, 2020) , most patients with the flu are regarded as COVID-19 suspects and require a molecular-precision virus test, which is highly expensive. Massive and timely testing is also required at airports and public health centers to effectively prevent and control infectious disease (Ding et al., 2020; Gayet et al., 2020; Jahanban-Esfahlan et al., 2019; Pokhrel et al., 2020) .

To date, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (Smyrlaki et al., 2020; Tahamtan and Ardebili, 2020; Xiao et al., 2020) and antibody-based detection (Cady et al., 2020; Vandenberg et al., 2020) have been applied clinically for COVID-19 detection. Antibody-based detection (immunoassay) is limited by its low sensitivity and dependence on a specific antibody. RT-qPCR has the highest sensitivity and accuracy, rendering it the most widely used assay in laboratory environments. The PCR assay requires sample preparation, synthesis of cDNA from viral RNA, a repetitive thermal cyclic process, and highly sensitive detectors, such as fluorescence detectors. Thus, the PCR assay requires specialized facilities, including a laboratory environment, skilled operators, and contamination-free operation. Considering the limitations of this test, it is clear that a cost-effective, and highly accurate method that can serve as an ultra-sensitive point-of-care (POC) device is required to detect COVID-19.",

The development of several isothermal amplification techniques-specifically loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA (LAMP) (Notomi et al., 2000) , smart amplification process (Mitani et al., 2007) , and rolling circle amplification (RCA) (Huang et al., 2020; Jarvius et al., 2006; Jung et al., 2016; Sato et al., 2010 Sato et al., , 2013 Wang et al., 2020a,b) -have been revived due to their enhanced performance, rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and reliable quantification. There have been several recent noteworthy studies on COVID-19 detection using LAMP (Crone et al., 2020; Ganguli et al., 2020; Thi et al., 2020; Thompson and Lei, 2020) , including a colorimetric assay and a handheld instrument. However, these detection tests are not fully applicable for virus detection in terms of time and limit of detection (LOD) . An RCA assay has demonstrated significant progress with the adoption of a dumbbell-shaped padlock probe, thus resulting in DNA gelation and flow stoppage in a microfluidic system (Goy et al., 2019; Nam et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019) . Unfortunately, these assays suffered due to a relatively low LOD (~0.1 pM) and increased test duration (~2 h), indicating significant inferiority to the conventional PCR method, even though the amplification rates of the isothermal assays were greatly enhanced (Ali et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2009) .",

Gentle mixing with a stirrer significantly enhances the binding between the target pathogen and the template. Throughout the RCA process, amplified DNA products become entangled with each other to form DNA hydrogels, which blocked flow paths in the mesh, as shown in Fig. 1(f) . After a certain time to allow completion of the RCA process, the rubber lid was punctured with a syringe needle, and the fluid motion and travel time to reach the other end of the test tube were precisely monitored. The travel time (t tr ) for a negative control sample that did not contain any pathogens was used as the reference value. A sample containing target pathogens resulted in an extended travel time compared with the reference value.

Most of the processes are similar to our previous concept of forming DNA hydrogel via RCA, except for the presence of a mesh (Na et al., 2018) . The unique difference involves the use of a very thin porous mesh instead of a thick porous hydrogel layer. A brief description of the proposed scheme is as follows: First, a primer was conjugated with the nylon mesh via surface activation and functionalization ( Fig. 2(a) ). Then, a padlock probe was hybridized with the primer (Fig. 2(b) ). The padlock probe was carefully designed to include a primer-binding site, a pathogen-binding site, and a self-assembly region that forms a molecular dumbbell shape. The padlock probe was constructed with consideration for thermal stability at room temperature (~23 \u2022 C) and specificity for primer and pathogen hybridization by controlling the length of each binding region. Upon annealing, the padlock probe formed an asymmetric dumbbell shape. The probe was then hybridized with the primer immobilized on the nylon mesh surface. When the padlock probe encountered a target pathogen, hybridization occurred. Using a ligase, the opened padlock probe was ligated to form a closed-loop template, which could then undergo the RCA process. As time passed, complementary single-stranded DNA were elongated with a dumbbell shape by Bst 3.0 DNA polymerase during the RCA process. Due to the dumbbell-shaped template, amplified long DNAs tended to easily entangle with one another, aggregating with neighboring DNAs and forming a DNA gel, as shown in Fig. 2 (f) . Further elaboration is given in the supplementary information (Fig. S4) .",

For this, the nylon mesh with or without primer immobilization was compared, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) . Successful immobilization of primers on the nylon mesh surface enabled combination with the complementary fluorescent probe (FAM). The nylon mesh immobilized with the primer produced bright fluorescent images, whereas the nylon mesh without the immobilized primer did not.

            "text": "To quantify the extent of difference in gelation, we characterized the rheological properties of the solutions with the COVID-19 pathogen target. As shown in Fig. 3(e) , the solution viscosity significantly increased with incubation time, showing a strong shear-thinning characteristic. At a low shear rate of 0.1 s \u2212 1 , the viscosity at 60-min incubation increased more than 1000 folds compared with that at 0 min. It is important to note that yield shear stress was significantly generated with gel formation, as shown in Fig. 3(f) . This significantly increased yield stress caused by DNA gelation was sufficient to resist driving pressure and prevent flow through the membrane micropores. The yield stress of fluids is frequently encountered in various fluids, including toothpastes, blood, foams, mud, and polymeric liquids. The common feature of these fluids is that they are able to flow only if they are subjected to a stress above some critical value (i.e., yield stress). Otherwise, under shear stress below the yield stress, they behave in a solid deformation manner. As the applied pressure on the nylon mesh was approximately 97 Pa (10 mmH 2 O), which was below the yield stresses measured in Fig. 3(f) , no flow resulted, which is in accord with the yield stress analysis. The sensitivity of the present assay was carefully examined in terms of limit of detection (LOD) with varying concentrations of target pathogen templates and incubation times. As described earlier, the measured parameters were the travel time between the inlet and outlet of a test tube and the corresponding velocity. If the mesh pores were completely blocked with amplified DNA gels, the travel time would be infinity and Fig. 2 .

When the pathogen concentrations were gradually decreased from 300 to 30 zM, the travel time decreased, whereas the corresponding velocity increased (Fig. 4(a) and (b)). At pathogen template concentrations of 3 nM to 3 fM, there was no flow (infinite travel time or zero velocity), which implies that the mesh pores were completely blocked with DNA gels via the RCA process. Using concentrations of 300 aM to 3 aM, there was flow, but the travel times and velocities significantly differed from those of the reference. However, at 30 and 300 zM template concentrations, the travel times and velocities were nearly the same as those of the reference.",

In the present study, the blank was used as the negative control. At a fixed incubation time of 15 min, the negative control (blank) travel time and velocity were 17.2 \u00b1 1.5 s and 5.9 \u00b1 0.5 mm/s, respectively. Thus, the LOB of the travel time and velocity were 19.6 s and 4.7 mm/s, respectively. The travel time and velocity SD at a low concentration (3 aM) were 11.2 s and 0.35 mm/s, respectively; thus, the determined LOD of travel time and velocity were 38.8 s and 4.3 mm/s, respectively. With these values, the LOD of the minimum pathogen concentration was found to be 0.7 aM for the travel time and 0.6 aM for the velocity. These LOD values are valid for a fixed incubation time of 15 min and are more sensitive with increasing incubation time and vice versa. We then examined the minimum test time needed for pathogen detection through the RCA process with varying incubation times. The incubation times were 5, 15, or 30 min for the two pathogen concentrations (3.13 and 31.3 aM). There were significant differences between the travel time and velocity at 5 min and 31.3 aM and 15 min and 3.13 aM compared with the corresponding values of the negative control (p < 0.05), as shown in Fig. 4 (c, d) . Thus, both incubation time and concentration should be considered to determine the LOD in the present system, as shown in Fig. 4(e) , which depicts the pathogen detection capability with colorimetric indication. All tests were performed more than five times throughout the experiments. Compared with our previous results (LOD = 0.1 pM) (Na et al., 2018) , the present LOD was nearly 10 6 -fold enhanced using the more elaborate design of the microfluidic system. First, the membrane was in contact with the sample chamber, maximizing the opportunity to react with the pathogen throughout the test time. In the previous system, a once-through flow system was adopted; as the probes were located in the middle of the microfluidic channel, gentle mixing was performed with a stirrer to further enhance the binding efficiency. Second, the pore size was optimally minimized for rapid blocking by the RCA-induced hydrogel. The smaller the pore, the quicker the blockage can occur. Several different nano-pore membranes were examined but failed to ensure a repeatable travel time, even for a negative sample, which might be due to non-uniform pore arrangements as well as surface tension. The current membrane is a nylon mesh with 1-\u03bcm pores. Third, the driving force of the sample fluid was minimized to avoid breaking the DNA hydrogel-induced sealing on the mesh pores. The previous driving force was 3.65 kPa (373 mmH 2 O), whereas the present one was 97 Pa (10 mmH 2 O). Due to this minimized driving force, the sealing test with the DNA hydrogel became more sensitive, and thus, the corresponding LOD was significantly enhanced.",

The LOD of a virus assay is an important parameter to determine the sensitivity of a sensor to detect viruses. Due to the emergency situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed unapproved in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) or unapproved uses of approved IVDs under emergency use authorization (EUA). According to the FDA EUA guidelines, the LOD of IVDs for SARS-CoV-2 is 100,000 copies/mL (or 200 copies/reaction), which is approximately 300 aM (FDA 2020). The LOD value of the present system (0.7 aM) is similar to that of FDA-approved PCR assays. Additionally, testing time should be short enough to manage high numbers of immediate tests at public places, such as airport and border checkpoints. Most FDA-approved devices that adopt thermal cyclic PCR assays require more than an hour for test completion and, thus, cannot be used as rapid POC tests. The test time of the present system at 30 aM and higher concentrations was 5 min, which is sufficiently short to be applicable towards massive testing at POCs.",

Unlike other meshes, the current one described herein is composed of a highly dense structure with a minimum opening rate of the 3D structured micropores and, thus, has a relatively small flow resistance, yet regardless is easily blocked with the RCA-induced DNA hydrogel. When a small-diameter glass tube is used, the test repeatability diminishes due to capillary phenomena that are sensitive to material types and surface conditions.

The microfluidic chip was equipped with a simple single channel containing a single DNA template of SARS-CoV-2. Incubating the COVID-19 pathogen for 30 min enabled the DNA template to generate a strong DNA hydrogel that completely blocked flow, whereas testing of other pathogens for the same specific incubation time failed to form hydrogels, and the ink flowed freely without any blockage.

In addition, because the flow paths through the nylon mesh were dramatically decreased with the high density of the micro-hole structures of the mesh, the amount of DNA hydrogel required to block the glass tube or channel reduced. Therefore, the present microfluidic system can detect SARS-CoV-2 with an excellent LOD (~3 aM in 15 min or 30 aM in 5 min), which is the lowest LOD until now. Furthermore, because the present method utilizes RCA as the molecular diagnostic tool, the present system is highly selective and accurate. Practical implementation of the present microfluidic system can be easily applied for screening tests at airports and other locations where infectious diseases commonly spread. Simultaneous multiplex detection of various infectious viruses, specifically those responsible for COVID-19, influenza-A, and influenza-B, using a microfluidic platform is the focus of ongoing research. As a limitation of the present study, the tested samples were not clinical samples obtained from various biofluids such as saliva, mucus, and nasopharyngeal swabs but synthetic templates of nucleic acid.
