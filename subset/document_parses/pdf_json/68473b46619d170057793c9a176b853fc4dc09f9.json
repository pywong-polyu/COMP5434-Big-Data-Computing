Humoral and cellular immune responses are detected after two primary COVID-19 vaccine doses in most patients with cancer (Ehmsen et al., 2021; Fendler et al., 2021; Oosting et al., 2021) , although neutralizing responses against variants of concern (VOCs) are reduced. Neutralizing re-sponses are frequently impaired in patients with hematological malignancies, especially those receiving B celldepleting therapies (Ehmsen et al., 2021; Fendler et al., 2021; Thakkar et al., 2021) . Because neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses are directly associated with vaccine efficacy (Gilbert et al., 2021; Khoury et al., 2021) , these patients without a neutralizing response are at higher risk of breakthrough infections (Hippisley-Cox et al., 2021) . Here, we report follow-up results from CAPTURE (NCT03226886), a longitudinal, prospective cohort study of vaccine response in patients with cancer, relative to the duration of response after two doses of either the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) or ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) vaccine; and following third vaccination with BNT162b2. We present data on NAb and T cell responses against whole live virus, including wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (WT), Beta, and Delta VOCs. We specifically evaluated responses to Beta and Delta given their known immuneevasive capacity.",

The symptoms were either mild (n = 7 patients; WHO severity score 2-3; fever [n = 5], coryza [n = 4], anosmia [n = 4], and cough [n = 3]) or absent (n = 1 patient), no patient requiring hospital care, and all recovered. We evaluated immune responses prior to infection following two vaccine doses; although all patients had detectable NAbT against WT SARS-CoV-2, only one had detectable NAbT against Delta. Following infection, all patients mounted detectable neutralizing responses to Delta ( Figure S1C ). T cell responses were evaluable in five patients prior to infection and in seven patients following infection. Although only 1/5 patients had detectable T cell responses to WT prior to infection, 5/7 had a detectable T cell responses following infection, including 2/4 patients who had undetectable T cell responses before infection ( Figure S1D ). We next evaluated 199 cancer patients (n = 115 [58%] with solid cancer) who received a third vaccine dose per UK guidelines. Patients who tested positive via RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between their second and third doses were excluded from this analysis. All patients received a third dose of BNT162b2 following two doses of either BNT162b2 (33%) or ChA-dOx1 (67%) ( Table S1 ). The median time between second and third vaccine dose was 176 days (range 65-274 days), and immune responses were measured at a median of 23 days after the third dose (range: 11-47 days). Prior to the third dose, 88% (n = 176) had detectable NAb against WT, but given the dominance of Delta, we considered all patients with undetectable NAb against Delta to be ''non-responders'' to two doses (51% [n = 102]; 43% [n = 50] of patients with solid cancer and 62% [n = 52] of patients with hematological malignancy; Table S1 ).",

Further, we show that T cell responses are amplified following the third vaccine dose, and this likely offers additional protection-especially in individuals with low or absent neutralizing responses. Encouragingly, the proportion of patients with solid cancer who had detectable responses after third vaccination is high and comparable to individuals without cancer.

In brief, adult patients with current or history of invasive cancer are eligible for enrolment. Inclusion criteria are intentionally broad, and patients were recruited irrespective of cancer type, stage, or treatment. Patients recruited to the CAPTURE study who have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine will be included in an analysis to explore vaccine immunogenicity in cancer patients. Patients were included in the analysis regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status. The primary outcome for this analysis was be the seroconversion rate in cancer patients at 14-28 days following the second dose of vaccine. At establishment of the study protocol, there was no prior published data of seroconversion in cancer patients in this setting and thus sample size was exploratory. The most precise estimate of seroconversion in cancer patients would therefore be achieved through recruitment of as many patients as possible in the time period.",

Briefly, Vero E6 cells (Institut Pasteur) or Vero E6 cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (VAT-1) (Centre for Virus Research) (Rihn et al., 2021) at 90-100% confluency in 384-well format were first titrated with varying MOI of each SARS-CoV-2 variant and varying concentrations of a control monoclonal nanobody in order to normalise for possible replicative differences between variants and select conditions equivalent to wild-type virus. Following this calibration, cells were infected in the presence of serial dilutions of patient serum samples. After infection (24 hrs Vero E6 Pasteur, 16hrs VAT-1), cells were fixed with 4% final Formaldehyde, permeabilised with 0.2% TritonX-100, 3% BSA in PBS (v/v), and stained for SARS-CoV-2 N protein using Alexa488-labelled-CR3009 antibody produced in-house and cellular DNA using DAPI (Brink et al., 2005) . Whole-well imaging at 5x was carried out using an Opera Phenix (Perkin Elmer) and fluorescent areas and intensity calculated using the Phenix-associated software Harmony 9 (Perkin Elmer). Inhibition was estimated from the measured area of infected cells/total area occupied by all cells. The inhibitory profile of each serum sample was estimated by fitting a 4-parameter dose response curve executed in SciPy. Neutralising antibody titres are reported as the fold-dilution of serum required to inhibit 50% of viral replication (IC50), and are further annotated if they lie above the quantitative (complete inhibition) range, below the quantitative range but still within the qualitative range (i.e. partial inhibition is observed but a dose-response curve cannot be fit because it does not sufficiently span the IC50), or if they show no inhibition at all. IC50 values above the quantitative limit of detection of the assay (>2560) were recoded as 3000; IC50 values below the quantitative limit of the assay (< 40) but within the qualitative range were recoded as 39 and data below the qualitative range (i.e. no response observed) were recoded as 10.",
