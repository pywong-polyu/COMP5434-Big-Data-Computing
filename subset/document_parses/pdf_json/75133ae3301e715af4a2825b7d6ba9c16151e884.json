The present systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess hematological changes seen in COVID-19 infection and their association with the severity of the disease. Methods Pooled proportions were calculated using both fixed effects model and random effects model. Weighted mean difference and 95% CI were calculated and reported. Results Initial search identified 84 reference articles, 23 relevant articles were selected and reviewed. Compared to general population, the weighted mean difference of WBC count in all COVID-19 patients was lower by 0.97 \u00d7 10 9 mm 3 (95% CI = -1.29 to -0.66). In severe COVID-19 patients, the weighted mean difference of platelet count was lower by 23.85 \u00d7 10 9 / liter (95% CI = -35.18 to -9.53), as compared to general population. The weighted mean difference of prothrombin time, D-Dimer, and fibrinogen in severe COVID-19 patients was higher by 1.92 seconds (95% CI = 0.01 to 3.84), 6.23 mg/liter (95% CI = 0.11 to 12.36) and 1.88 g/liter (95% CI = 1.18 to 2.48) respectively, as compared to general population. Pooled proportion showed D-Dimer to be elevated in 80.00% (95 % CI = 50.00 to 99.00) of severe patients.",

The reason for this lymphopenia while exactly unclear is thought to be related to lymphocyte expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptors, which are in turn utilized by the virus to infect and cause destruction of CD-4 and CD \u22128 cells [19] . Another explanation for lymphopenia is increased bone marrow production of macrocytes to enhance the phagocytic process as explained by Liu et al. [20] . In our meta-analysis, while we did not directly assess lymphopenia, the trend towards leukopenia was noticed in non-severe COVID-19 patients. White cell count was found to be higher in severe disease as compared to the general population; however, the difference was non-significant. While the reason for this pattern is not exactly clear, trends towards leukocytosis in severe patients could be multifactorial due to superimposed bacterial infection or pneumonia in severe patients, steroid use, multiple medications being trialed, enhanced stress response. Analysis of pooled patient population also demonstrated that severe COVID-19 patients were more likely to have leukocytosis as compared to non-severe patients; these results are in accordance with previously reported results [18] .",

Our results in contrast show the weighted mean difference of hemoglobin to be significantly higher in non-severe COVID-19 patients and non-significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients.

The pathophysiology of the thrombotic state remains unclear. It has been postulated that virus attaches to ACE-2 receptors on endothelial cells causing endothelitis and activation of thrombotic cascade causing a prothrombotic state [25] . In addition to the loss of protective endothelium, the acute phase reactants produced in the setting of severe infection also contribute to hypercoagulability and microvascular thrombosis [26] . Case reports of ischemic digits and cerebral infarcts along with elevated anticardiolipin and antiphospholipid antibodies have also been reported [27] . Han et al. reported significantly increased D-dimer and fibrinogen values in COVID-19 patients as compared to controls. Tang et al. [10] also reported similar findings and their correlation with mortality, elevated D-dimers have been associated with increased mortality [19] . The result of our meta-analysis supports these findings; however, we did not assess mortality. The weighted mean difference of D-dimer in all Covid-19 patients and patients with severe COVID-19was found to be higher by 0.35 mg/dl and 6.23 mg/dl, respectively, as compared to the general population. The pooled proportion of patients showed D-dimer to be elevated in 19% of the total population and 80% of patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Previously D-dimer levels have been elevated in up to 25% of patients with COVID-19 infection [28] . Fibrinogen also showed similar trends, the weighted mean difference value of fibrinogen was higher by 1.33 g/l in all COVID-19 and significantly by 1.88 in severe patients as compared to the general population.",
