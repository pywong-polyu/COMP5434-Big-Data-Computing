Although several vaccines are available, the global supply of vaccines, particularly within developing countries, is inadequate, and this necessitates a need for the development of less expensive, accessible vaccine options. To this end, here, we used the Escherichia coli expression system to produce a recombinant fusion protein comprising the receptor binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; residues 319-541) and the fragment A domain of Cross-Reacting Material 197 (CRM197); hereafter, CRMA-RBD. We show that this CRMA-RBD fusion protein has excellent physicochemical properties and strong reactivity with COVID-19 convalescent sera and representative neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Furthermore, compared with the use of a traditional aluminum adjuvant, we find that combining the CRMA-RBD protein with a nitrogen bisphosphonate-modified zinc-aluminum hybrid adjuvant (FH-002C-Ac) leads to stronger humoral immune responses in mice, with 4-log neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, our study highlights the value of this E. coli-expressed fusion protein as an alternative vaccine candidate strategy against COVID-19.",

Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) to bind to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells for virus entry and subsequent pathogenesis (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . The SARS-CoV-2 RBD is immunodominant, containing multiple antigenic sites and accounting for 90% of serum neutralizing activity (Piccoli et al., 2020) . Indeed, it triggers the production of potent functional antibodies that play a critical role in immunoprophylaxis, thus making the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein an ideal target for the development of therapeutics against COVID-19 Liu et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020) . Currently, many different vaccine strategies are employed in the fight against SARS-CoV-2, include recombinant vectors, DNA, mRNA in lipid nanoparticles, inactivated viruses, live attenuated viruses and protein subunits (Krammer, 2020; Draft Landscape of COVID-19 Candidate Vaccines, 2022) . Recombinant protein subunit vaccines are particularly advantageous, with proven safety and compatibility and the option of using multiple booster vaccinations where necessary (Jeyanathan et al., 2020) . Furthermore, in some cases, the proteins making up the subunits can be prepared using recombinant molecular techniques.",

Improving the immunogenicity of RBD requires the use of an appropriate adjuvant or optimization of the protein sequence, fragment length or immune program . CRM197 , a non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin (DT), is widely used as a carrier protein in polysaccharide vaccines (Giannini et al., 1984; Malito et al., 2012) . Studies have shown that CRM197 increases the production of Th1and Th2-secreting T cells during the immune response, and induces B cell proliferation and the secretion of antigen-specific antibodies, thereby enhancing the immunogenicity of that to which it is conjugated (Dagan et al., 2010) . Of particular note, the well-studied C-terminal catalytic domain A (aa 1-191) of CRM197 (CRMA) alone has been shown to significantly enhance the immunogenicity of the Hepatitis E virus pORF2-E2 protein and human papillomavirus (HPV) major capsid protein L2 peptide (Wang et al., 2015 . Thus, we posited that the C-terminal catalytic domain A of CRM197 could serve as an intra-molecular adjuvant for RBD to improve its immunogenicity.",

Furthermore, the E. coli expression system allows for the rapid expression and cost-effective scale-up of recombinant proteins during manufacturing. Recent years has witnessed the appropriate use of the E. coli expression system for the production and subsequent approval of genetically engineered vaccines (e.g., hepatitis E vaccine, human papillomavirus vaccine, meningococcal vaccine; Birkett et al., 2002; Proffitt, 2012; Skibinski et al., 2013; Shirley and Taha, 2018; Masignani et al., 2019; Qiao et al., 2020) , including the VLP-based vaccine fully derived from E. coli, Hecolin, which was approved for use in humans in 2012 as the first vaccine against Hepatitis E (Proffitt, 2012) . Such VLP-based vaccines derived from E. coli are highly cost-effective as compared with vaccines derived from insect cells or yeast (Huang et al., 2017) . Indeed, insect cells and other expression systems are slower, demand higher costs, and have inherent issues with scalability for commercial purposes.

We constructed a candidate antigen by fusing the fragment A domain of CRM197 with the RBD (residues 319-541) of the spike protein using a flexible peptide linker, hereafter referred to as \"CRMA-RBD\" (Figure 1A) . Using the E. coli expression system, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 CRMA-RBD and RBD proteins were obtained ( Figure 1B) . Both of the purified proteins showed acceptable purity, with molecular weights (m.w.) of \u223c48 kDa, and 25 kDa for CRMA-RBD and RBD, respectively. The CRMA-RBD and RBD proteins reacted well with 36H6 antibodies (Zhang et al., 2021a) in immunoblotting analysis ( Figure 1B) . Due to the lack of glycosylation modifications in E. coli, as expected, the E. coli-derived RBD protein has a smaller molecular weight than the RBD protein derived from the baculovirus (Bac) insect cell expression system.",

Following week 8, the titers slightly decreased to about 4.5-log until week 16. Notably, IgG titers for mice administered with CRMA-RBD-FH-002C-Ac and RBD-FH-002C-Ac were comparable at either dosage. However, mice that received a high dosage (5 \u03bcg) of CRMA-RBD-FH-002C-Ac were afforded much higher neutralization titers than those that received the low dose; indeed, some mice in the low-dose group failed to produce neutralizing antibodies, likely due to individual differences. In addition, neutralization antibody titers in the CRMA-RBD high-dose group were maintained at higher levels at week 12 relative to that of RBD protein (Figure 5D , bottom panel). The persistence in the binding and neutralization antibody titer levels over the long-term hints to the considerable longevity of the immunity induced by vaccinating mice with CRMA-RBD combined with the FH-002C-Ac adjuvant.",

Yet, the E. coli expression system has otherwise advantages for the expression of exogenous proteins, including efficiency, time-cost saving and yield. These differences are particularly relevant in the current urgent circumstances surrounding SARS-CoV-2. However, proteins expressed with E. coli lack post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, and suffering from correct disulfide bond formation sometimes, which are often critical for proper protein folding, stability, and/or activity. Previous studies (Lan et al., 2020) have reported that eight of the nine cysteine residues in the RBD form disulfide bond pairs (Cys336-Cys361, Cys379-Cys432, Cys391-Cys525, and Cys480-Cys488) that help to stabilize the structure. In the present study, we systematically optimized the renaturation conditions of the CRMA-RBD protein, and found it to have a strong interaction with the ACE2 protein ( Figure 1E , left panel); this may indicate that the E. coli-derived CRMA-RBD maintains overall native conformation. This was further confirmed with ELISA results, as demonstrated good reactivity of CRMA-RBD against several representative nAbs (Figure 2A) and COVID-19 convalescent sera (Figures 2B-G, right panel) . Finally, the immunogenicity of CRMA-RBD protein was similar to that of the baculovirus-derived RBD protein, and we found no significant difference in neutralizing antibody titers elicited by these two kinds proteins with FH-002-Ac adjuvant ( Figure 3B ). Of note, the RBD domain (Arg319-Phe541) contains two N-glycosites (Asn331 and Asn343), which were outside the motifs that are essential for direct interaction with the ACE2 receptor (Zhang et al., 2021b) . As expected, the CRMA-RBD and RBD protein produced in E.coli reacted weakly with S309 (target N343 glycan) but well with both REGN10933, 6D6, and 7D6 antibodies despite of the lack of glycosylation (Figure 2A) , which indicated the E. coli-derived proteins maintain overall conformational probity of most neutralization epitopes except for some glycan-related one. Thus, to some extent, our results suggest that glycosylation is not critical for inducing protective immunity using the RBD. Collectively, these features provide alternative options for vaccine design and immune recognition.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that CRM197 increases the production of Th1-and Th2-secreting T cells during the immune response and subsequently induces the differentiation and maturation of B cells by heterogeneous cytokines. CRM197 has been used as a carrier protein in several licensed conjugated vaccines, including PREVNAR7, PREVNAR13, and HibTITER (Shinefield, 2010) . In these vaccines, the polysaccharide is chemically covalently linked to the CRM197 protein. Our previous study had shown that CRMA itself can serve as an intramolecular adjuvant: the truncated HEV capsid protein (E2) fused with CRMA showed 10-times more immunogenicity than the particulate p239 . As such, we chose to examine the utility of CRMA conjugation to enhance the immunogenicity of RBD. We showed CRMA-RBD combined with the Alum adjuvant induced a lower antibody titer (Figure 3) , but a slightly stronger antigen-specific T cell response compared with RBD (Figures 4A,C) , suggesting that the elicited T cell responses to CRMA may also enhance responses to the RBD. In the presence of the FH-002C-Ac adjuvant, both CRMA-RBD and RBD stimulated stronger humoral responses, however, we did not find obviously further enhancement by CRMA. Noteworthy, IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + T cells in animals receiving Alum adjuvant seems slightly higher in 1 \u03bcg dose group than that in 5 \u03bcg dose ( Figure 4A) . However, these slightly higher response of CRMA-RBD vs. RBD and 1 \u03bcg dose vs. 5 \u03bcg dose in CRMA-RBD-Alum group show no significantly statistical difference, which might be due to the measurement variation in dividual animal within a group. The FH-002C-Ac adjuvant offers obvious advantages in terms of inducing a stronger humoral immune response to the CRMA-RBD protein. High titer-specific IgG antibody levels were detected on 1 week after the third immunization. Immunization with CRMA-RBD combined with FH-002C-Ac at low doses rapidly produce anti-RBD and neutralizing antibodies in mice (Figures 3A,B) . For FH-002C-Ac adjuvant, the addition of a drug for osteoporosis nitrogen bisphosphonate (risedronate) and zinc ions to the composite alum adjuvant have showed an enhance immunostimulatory effect in our previous study (Wu et al., 2021) . Thus, various antigens combined with FH-002C-Ac adjuvant could enhance the induction of antibodies with a higher level of specific antibodies at a lower immunization dosage. We surmise the 1 and 5 \u03bcg dose is too high to show the dose dependence, which might require further test in smaller dose. In comparison, the immune stimulation effect of Alum adjuvant is weak, 5 \u03bcg CRMA-RBD and RBD induced comparable IgG titers with 1 \u03bcg dose. Nonetheless, our data showed that immunization using CRMA-RBD combined with the FH-002C-Ac adjuvant could elicit RBD-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses (Figure 4) ; this would help to establish protective immunity afforded by both arms of the immune response in vaccinated individuals. Overall, the mechanisms of action of many adjuvants, including aluminum salts, FH-002C-Ac adjuvant and CRMA, are still to be fully elucidated.",
