            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread rapidly throughout the globe. The spectrum of disease is broad but among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of mortality. There is an urgent need for an effective treatment. The current focus has been developing novel therapeutics, including antivirals, protease inhibitors, vaccines and targeting the overactive cytokine response with anti-cytokine therapy. The overproduction of early response proinflammatory cytokines results in what has been described as a \"cytokine storm\" is leading eventually to death when the cells fail to terminate the inflammatory response. Accumulating evidence shows that inflammatory cytokines induce selectin ligands that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases by mediating leukocyte migration from the blood into the tissue. Thus, the selectins and selectin ligands represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. In this paper, potential pan-selectin inhibitors were identified employing a virtual screening using a docking procedure. For this purpose, the Asinex and ZINC databases of ligands, including approved drugs, biogenic compounds and glycomimetics, altogether 923,602 compounds, were screened against the P-, Land E-selectin. At first, the experimentally confirmed inhibitors were docked into all three selectins' carbohydrate recognition domains to assess the suitability of the screening procedure. Finally, based on the evaluation of ligands binding, we propose 10 purchasable pan-selectin inhibitors to develop COVID-19 therapeutics.",

            "text": "Selectin-mediated cell migration and recognition play a crucial role in various physiological as well as pathological processes (Tvaro\u0161ka et al. 2020) . They mediate the immune response to infections or inflammation (Kansas 1996) and are involved in the trafficking of stem cells (Mazo et al. 1998; Ruster et al. 2006; Sackstein et al. 2008; Karp and Teol 2009; Merzaban et al. 2011; Sahin and Buitenhuis 2012) , but also the formation of cancer metastases (Mannori et al. 1995; Biancone et al. 1996; Kim and Varki 1997; Yang et al. 1999) . Moreover, there are indications that selectins could play a crucial role in one of the significant complications of COVID-19 disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is a large body of experimental data demonstrating the role of excessive inflammation in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and showing the connection between inflammation and the severity of the disease. Three separate stages of COVID-19 development can be identified (Reyes et al. 2020) . In the first, the virus penetrates into lung host cells. In the second, a viral spread initiates lung tissue injury and leads to the host immune system's response. In the third phase, the inflammatory cascade is activated. This activation often leads to cytokine release syndrome, also referred to as the \"cytokine storm\" (Merad and Martin 2020) . Under such conditions, leukocytes activated through receptorligand signaling release early response proinflammatory cytokines, amplifying the immune reaction through the further recruitment of leukocytes. Such a process can lead to life-threatening hyperinflammatory conditions, manifesting as pneumonia, sepsis, respiratory failure and ARDS (Ruan et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020 ) and might ultimately result in multi-organ failure and death (Meduri et al. 1995) .",

Nonetheless, accumulating evidence shows that inflammatory cytokines also induce selectin ligands' expression (Ebel et al. 2015) , which play a vital role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Numerous studies have demonstrated the essential role of selectins and their ligands in inflammatory lung diseases, including ARDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma (Romano and Slee 2001; Tvaro\u0161ka et al. 2020) , and the potential of using inhibitors of selectins in their treatment (Woodside and Vanderslice 2008; Aydt et al. 2010) .

Similarly, several studies demonstrated that Colchicine decreases the severity of the disease (Merad and Martin 2020) . A clinical trial of 6000 people with COVID-19 infection, funded by the Government of Quebec, began in March 2020 to test the potential efficacy of using Colchicine over 30 days to reduce disease symptoms (Montreal Heart Institute 2020). Colchicine is also used as an anti-inflammatory agent, which inhibits E-selectin and L-selectin expression on the surfaces of neutrophil and endothelial cells (Cronstein et al. 1995) . These results support that an anti-inflammatory strategy based on selectin antagonists may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19.",

Various strategies were used to inhibit selectin functions and were the subject of many reviews (Kaila and Thomas 2002; Kaila and Thomas 2003; Barthel et al. 2007; Ludwig et al. 2007; Ernst and Magnani 2009; Aydt et al. 2010; Bedard and Kaila 2010; Wang and Vidal 2013; Videira et al. 2017; Valverde et al. 2019; Tvaro\u0161ka et al. 2020) . Though significant efforts have been devoted to developing selectin inhibitors and numerous compounds were prepared, only a few compounds entered clinical trials.",

As discussed above, suitable selectin inhibitors that might serve as efficient therapeutic agents are still being searched for. This is caused by a partial functional redundancy of the selectins (Aydt et al. 2010 ) and a low affinity of the inhibitors to at least one of the three selectins. All three selectins have a high sequential and structural similarity of the lectin domain (Lasky 1995) , with only subtle distinctions responsible for the different binding affinities of the selectins toward their ligands. They bind to sialyl Lewis X (sLe x ) with millimolar, yet one order of different magnitude affinities (Poppe et al. 1997 ) (E-selectin: 0.72 mM; L-selectin: 3.9 mM; Pselectin: 7.8 mM). This tetrasaccharide was identified as a common epitope in various natural selectin ligands; thus, it became one of the key templates in the recent development of novel selectin inhibitors.",

The docking algorithms have been successfully used for receptors with sufficiently deep cavities to restrict ligands' orientation and geometry. Since selectins have a flat and mostly hydrophilic interaction surface, searching for suitable inhibitors can be challenging for the docking algorithms (Kranich et al. 2007) . Therefore, three different docking algorithms were used and evaluated by comparing experimental data with the predicted values. The XP algorithm that showed the best results had been selected for the final screening against selectins. Based on the evaluation of binding properties and drug-like characteristics, we have identified 10 purchasable compounds that are potential pan-selectin inhibitors and suitable candidates for further experimental investigation of their use as COVID-19 therapeutics.",

The compounds with available log(ratio) are compared with the experimental activity in Figure 1A . However, for some of the compounds with P-selectin, the values are not available. Hence, the comparison for P-selectin is shown separately in Figure 1B . Since the structures of selectins were optimized in complex with sLe x , the predicted Glide Energy of sLe x is significantly lower than the other compounds due to perfect shape complementarity. The presented correlations imply that with an appropriate set-up, the XP docking algorithm provides the results in qualitative agreement with the experiments. The comparison of the results obtained at the XP level with the experimental data will be discussed in more detail later in the text. The results obtained with the SP algorithm are provided in Figure 2 (the results are provided in Supplementary data in Table SII ). The SP algorithm shows a slightly worse correlation with experimental data than the XP algorithm. Nonetheless, the computational costs for screening at the SP level of precision are \u223c10-fold lower than the XP algorithm. Therefore, the SP algorithm seems to be more suitable for crude screening of the large databases of ligands. A much faster HTVS algorithm was also examined ( Figure 5A ). However, the algorithm failed to reproduce the experimental data. Consequently, it was not used in further docking studies in screening databases.",

However, Glide also calculates the Coulomb-van der Waals interaction energy score, referred to as \"Glide Energy.\" When applied to the selectins, we find that Glide Energy is the best of these parameters at reproducing the experimental activity. The comparison of the docking score to Eselectin's experimental data is shown in Figure 5B for illustration. The good correlation obtained with the molecular mechanic \"Glide Energy\" scoring function corresponds with the findings of Woelke et al. that the interactions between selectins and their ligands are mostly electrostatic (Woelke et al. 2013) .",

At first sight, the predicted Glide Energy values of sLex are noticeably higher than expected and come out as outliers in the presented correlation. We assume that this discrepancy reflects the perfect shape complementarity of the receptors with sLex, resulting from the optimization of the geometry of complexes with sLex. Noteworthy, the observed IC50 value of sLex toward the P-selectin was higher than 5 mM, and it was not determined precisely. Therefore, the log(ratio) of the compounds from this study cannot be calculated for P-selectin.

Overview of E-and P-selectin interactions with sLe X in the binding site (Somers et al. 2000; Woelke et al. 2013 ). The tetrasaccharide sLe X binds in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner via interactions with fucose hydroxyls. The fucose residue is shown in yellow and the Ca 2+ cation as a red sphere. This figure is available in black and white in print and in color at Glycobiology online. screening at the XP level of precision, 27 compounds were marked as PAINS. The predicted interactions of these compounds were revised, and the compounds with potentially nonspecific interactions were excluded. In the presented results, compound 7 was marked by the tool as a potentially false-positive hit due to catechol functional group characteristics for PAINS. Nonetheless, the catechol hydroxyl groups were predicted to interact with Ca 2+ cation in the required orientation. Hence, the compound was not excluded. The compounds were sorted by the average Glide energy, and the list of the top 10 compounds is presented in Table I . The structures of the compounds and their binding poses for E-selectin are shown in Table II . Since the binding poses for P-and L-selectin are very similar to those for E-selectin (see Figure 6) , they are not shown. Compounds 1, 2 and 3 are nucleotide-like molecules originating from the ZINC databases. Like the native selectin ligands, they interact with the Ca 2+ cation through two ribose hydroxyl groups. Compound 4 is a tripeptide-like compound that interacts with the Ca 2+ cation through the C-terminal amide group. Interactions of macrocyclic compound 6 with the Ca 2+ involve a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group (part of an amide group). Compound 7 exhibits the interaction of the two catechol hydroxyl groups with Ca 2+ .

Consequently, the development of selectin inhibitors is a difficult task. For example, though the sLe x is the minimal structural determinant recognized by all three selectins, the designed sLe x analog celexin (Kerr et al. 2000) or sLe x mimetics (Binder and Ernst 2011; Binder et al. 2012; Egger et al. 2013) were not developed into drug candidates. The selected compounds from Asinex and ZINC databases exhibit a good predicted pan-selectin activity and drug-like properties.

With a high mortality rate and the lack of effective COVID-19 therapy, novel approaches for developing efficient therapeutics are urgently needed. The recent clinical data highlight that COVID-19 is associated with severe acute respiratory symptoms that causes lung injury resulting from the overreactive immune system. Breaking this vicious cycle by blocking the mediators of the \"cytokine storm\" presents a possible strategy. Accumulating evidence shows that inflammatory cytokines induce selectin ligands that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases by mediating leukocyte migration from the blood into the tissue. Thus, the selectins and selectin ligands represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. The virtual screening of potential inhibitors recently became a popular method for screening the different proteins related to the spreading and virulence of COVID-19 due to its low cost and time requirements. In this paper, the Asinex and ZINC databases of compounds, altogether 923,602 compounds, were screened against the P-, L-and E-selectin to search for pan-selectin inhibitors. Since these databases contain approved drugs, biogenic compounds and glycomimetics, it may be assumed that the selected compounds have good drug-like properties.",

The selectins were reported to adopt high-affinity and low-affinity conformations (Somers et al. 2000; Preston et al. 2016) . Therefore, the corresponding residues in the L-and E-selectin structures were pulled toward their conformation in P-selectin (i.e. the high-affinity conformation) (Woelke et al. 2013) , and the structures were optimized with sLe x ligand with the use of AMBER 16 (details are provided in Supplementary data). For E-selectin, X-ray structure of high-affinity conformation is also available (PDB ID 4CSY, obtained with resolution 2.41 \u00c5) (Preston et al. 2016) ; the comparison of the E-selectin structure used for docking with the structures published by Somers et al. and Preston et al. is shown in Figure 8 . Prepared high-affinity conformation shares high structural similarity with the published high-affinity conformation. Nonetheless, the prepared structure was used for docking to ensure compatibility with our preliminary MD simulations and conformational analyses. Subsequently, the structures for docking were processed with Protein Preparation Wizard (Sastry et al. 2013) in Maestro. The grids were generated with the use of the Receptor Grid Generation tool, the dimensions of the grid box were set proportionally to sLe x and the center of the box was placed at the center of the sLe x tetrasaccharide in the optimized structures.",

The HTVS algorithm struggled to reproduce the experimental data with selectin ligands/inhibitors. Therefore, the HTVS algorithm was only tested and not used for screening the databases of ligands. When applied to the selectins, we find that Glide Energy is the best of these parameters at reproducing the experimental activity. The following scaling parameters of van der Waals radii of ligands were used: scaling factor 0.90 and partial charge cutoff 0.15 (determined by the preceding optimization). Any competitive inhibitor of interactions of a selectin must bind into the same site as the native ligand. Thus, poses that did not comply the requirement were excluded. Moreover, PAINS-Remover (Baell and Holloway 2010; Baell and Nissink 2018) was employed to ensure that maximum of potential false positive hits are excluded.",
