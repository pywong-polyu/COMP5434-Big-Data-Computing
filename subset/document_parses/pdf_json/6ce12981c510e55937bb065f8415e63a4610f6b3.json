To demonstrate the effect of disclosure of gender policies on business profitability, this study analyses the Social Responsibility Reports of 91 companies listed on the Spanish stock exchange for the period 2016-2018. Information on gender equality policies is extracted by using the content analysis technique. A positive association between disclosure of gender equality policies and the accounting profitability obtained by companies is confirmed by applying a panel data approach. Therefore, this research confirms that it is not only necessary to reduce inequalities, but it also has positive financial effects for companies and is a source of competitive advantage. The findings obtained have significant implications for business management.",

            "text": "In the academic field, there is no consensus on how to approach the analysis of gender equality: from a sociological perspective, from the perspective of equal rights or from the perspective of the benefits that this entails, among others (Kompa and Witkowska, 2018) , as in the case of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) analysis. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines gender equality as \"the roles, characteristics and opportunities defined by society that are considered appropriate for men, women, boys, girls and people with non-binary identities\" (WHO, 2021) and considers it a dynamic concept over time. What is clear is that there is a growing interest in the study of gender equality and diversity (Set o-Pamies, 2015; Kompa and Witkowska, 2018) . Gender equality is a concept that has been approached from different perspectives and theories, there is not unanimity about the definition of equality or gender diversity (Blanco-Gonz alez et al., 2020) . In addition, social changes such as wage gaps (Christofides et al., 2010; Garc\u00eda Mart\u00edn and Herrero, 2019) or barriers to the development of professional careers (Hern andez-Nicolas et al., 2016) result in disclosure of non-financial information related to gender equality acquiring a greater role (Cucari et al., 2017; Furlotti et al., 2019) . For this reason, it is necessary to establish a theoretical framework on what gender equality policies are without entering into conflict, since the objective is to demonstrate that their disclosure is not only positive because it reduces inequalities, but because it also has an impact on the company's performance. In addition, this research aims to demonstrate the impact of these policies at all hierarchical levels in the company, and not only on management positions, which the previous literature analyses to a greater extent (Ekadah and Kiweu, 2012; Baixauli-Soler et al., 2016; Cucari et al., 2017; Romano et al., 2020; Guti errez-Fern andez and Fern andez-Torres, 2020) .",

To achieve this objective, a sample of 91 companies listed on the Spanish stock market from 2016 to 2018 were selected, extracting information on disclosure of gender equality policies from the companies' sustainability reports, and the economic-financial information from SABI database. By applying a panel data approach, we test that disclosure of gender equality policies has a positive impact on Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA), demonstrating that gender equality policy disclosure contributes to accounting business performance. However, we have not found significant effects on stock market profitability. The main finding of this research is that the disclosure has no impact on the stock market profitability because it reflects the expectations of long-term income. However, disclosure generates competitive advantages that generate social value, which will indirectly impact profitability. Therefore, companies must disclose and implement gender equality policies.",

According to Goldin (2006) , 4 phases can be distinguished: the first ones are considered evolutionary and the last one, which begins at the end of the 1970s, is revolutionary as it involves a change of thought, going from mere incorporation to work to increasing women's education due to entering university. This means that women make decisions under two complementary concepts: \"time horizon and investment in human capital\" (Goldin, 2006: 2) . Despite the incorporation of women into the labour market during all this time, this has not resulted in a greater presence of women in managerial positions (Blanco-Gonz alez et al., 2020; Moreira et al., 2019) . In 2020 in Spain women held 6.1% of managerial positions and 29.3% of positions on the director board (ine.es, 2021). The establishment of the so-called glass ceiling argues that there is a low promotion of women as they are more likely to have to interrupt their professional careers for family reasons (Hern andez-Nicol as et al., 2016) .",

In this regard, in Spain this is found in the Organic Law 3/2007, of 22 March, for the effective equality of women and men. Hence, until not so long ago, studies on gender diversity and equality policies were studied within CSR, since this field of study was defined within the social dimension of the company as a form of analysis of the company's human capital (Escamilla-Solano et al., 2016; Galbreath, 2018; Sial et al., 2018) . Due to a growing interest in the governance of companies and the existing gap between men and women, both in terms of salary and access to a job or work resignation in the case of conciliation, numerous specific studies have emerged on whether gender equality and diversity affects business profitability.",

If in addition to this, we include the scandals experienced in recent years in terms of transparency and governance, and society's demand for companies to be more sustainable, efficient and transparent in their management, this resulted in the Union approving Directive 95/2014/EU regarding disclosure of non-financial information and information on diversity by specific large companies and groups, whose aim is to regulate the information that companies disclose about CSR actions and diversity management that they carry out. The transposition of the directive into Spanish legislation occurs in a first phase with Royal Decree-Law 18/2017, of November 24, and in a second phase with Law 11/2018, of December 28. Article 14 of our 1978 Constitution establishes equality between men and women and non-discrimination based on gender. Organic Law 1/2004, of December 28, on Comprehensive Protection Measures against Gender Violence was the pioneer in Europe, determining that violence is a structural problem of gender inequality. In Spain, the Institute for Women and its ongoing Plans for Equal Opportunities for Women were created, which has led to an important change in terms of equality since its creation. Organic Law 3/2007, of March 22, for the effective equality of women and men was an important turning point in our country, whose goal is to end discrimination against women and achieve equal treatment and opportunities between both genders. Royal Decree-Law 6/2019, of March 1, on urgent measures to guarantee equal treatment and opportunities between women and men in employment and occupation, from March 7, 2021 the companies that have the obligation to develop an equality plan are those that have more than 100 people in their workforce and, from March 7, 2022, it will be mandatory for all companies with a workforce of between 50 and 100 employees.",

Disclosure helps the investor to understand the management of the company and know how these policies can affect their investments (Gershoni and Low, 2021; Mart\u00edn et al., 2019) . In addition, disclosure of non-financial information increases company legitimacy (Wilmshurst and Frost, 2000; Cho and Patten, 2007; Miotto et al., 2020) .",

The aim of various studies has been to determine the possible impact of this disclosure on the profitability. Reverte (2016) examines whether companies with higher CSR disclosure ratings are more highly regarded by market participants. Their results show that CSR disclosure has a direct and indirect effect on the price of shares by modifying the relevance of the earnings and book value of shares. Nekhili et al. (2017) investigate the relationship between disclosure of CSR policies and the company's financial performance, measured by Tobin's q, considering the moderating role of family participation. Their findings show that the company's financial performance is positively related to disclosure of social responsibility policies for family businesses. However, in non-family businesses the relationship found is negative. Chen et al. (2018) examine how mandatory CSR disclosure affects the company's performance (measured by ROE and ROA) and social externalities. They find that companies that submit mandatory social responsibility reports experience a reduction in their profitability after the mandate (Garc\u00eda-S anchez et al., 2020). However, they find a positive effect on the reduction of wastewater and sulphur dioxide. Escamilla--Solano et al. (2019) examine whether CSR disclosure influences the company's profitability. Their results show that disclosure of CSR measures in their social and economic dimension improves business profitability, finding no significant effect on their environmental dimension. Buallay et al. (2020) investigate the relationship between CSR disclosure and business profitability, measured by ROA, ROE, and Tobin's q, from the perspective of stakeholders. The results obtained indicated that CSR disclosure affects operating and market performance negatively but does not affect financial performance. Bovolini Pedron et al. (2021) analyse whether the level of environmental information disclosure by companies affects their profitability and value. Their results demonstrate that environmental disclosure positively affects the value of companies and highlights the importance of the legitimacy theory and the cost of the ownership theory as part of the decision process regarding disclosure of environmental information. Faisal et al. (2020) investigate, among other issues, whether the level of disclosure of companies' social and environmental responsibility is valued by investors, finding that the market positively values the information associated with the disclosure of companies' social and environmental responsibility. Gerged et al. (2021) examine the relationship between corporate environmental disclosure and the value of the company, finding that corporate environmental disclosure is significantly and positively related to the value of the company measured by Tobin's q. Sampong et al. (2021) investigate the relationship between voluntary disclosure of social performance and long-term profitability of companies from the perspective of international standards. Their findings show a positive relationship between voluntary disclosure of social performance and long-term profitability.",

ROA has been the most widely used accounting performance measure to measure business performance because it is relatively difficult to be manipulated by the company's management (G omez-Mej\u00eda and Palich, 1997). This ratio has been used, among others, by Bhattacharyya et al. (2019) and Escamilla-Solano et al. (2019) . The ROE measure was selected to represent the accounting profitability obtained by shareholders. It is the most widely used measure of business accounting performance after ROA. ROE has been used, among others, by Kabir and Thai (2017) and Onofrei et al. (2019) . And finally, we use Tobin's q, which compared to the previous measures that are based solely on accounting measures, it reflects the market value of the company (Kabir and Thai, 2017) , allowing us to capture market perceptions about the present and future performance of companies. Tobin's q has been used as a business profitability measure, among others, by Giraldez-Puig and Berenguer (2018) and Kim and Lee (2020) .",

Within the panel data analysis, we selected multiple regression analysis with weighted least squares as an estimator to deal with the heteroscedasticity problem. Due to the fact that heteroscedasticity tends to exist in regression analysis among companies, applying weighted least squares is adequate, while it also eliminates the need to fulfil the hypothesis of constant residual of regression analysis (Kleinbaum et al., 1988) .",

However, when we consider the impact of disclosure of gender equality policies on stock market profitability by taking Tobin's q, no significant impact is found, rejecting hypothesis 1.c.

To achieve the proposed objective, we selected a sample of 91 companies listed on the Spanish stock market during the period 2016-2018. To determine whether these companies disclose information regarding the implementation of gender equality policies, a content analysis of the sustainability reports of these companies was performed (Garc\u00eda -S anchez et al., 2020) . And as representative measures of business profitability, ROA and ROE were taken to evaluate the impact of disclosure of gender Note: ***, ** and * indicate the significance at 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively. equality policies on accounting profitability, and Tobin's q was taken to analyse this impact on stock market profitability. The results obtained by applying a panel data approach show that disclosure of gender equality policies has a positive and significant impact on ROA (hypothesis 1.a) and ROE (hypothesis 1.b), showing, therefore, that disclosure of gender equality policies has benefits for companies in terms of accounting profitability. Thus, it is shown that disclosure of gender equality policies results in an increase in the profitability of companies without considering their financing and an increase in shareholder profitability. However, when considering the stock market profitability measured by Tobin's q, a significant impact of disclosure of gender equality policies has not been found on this measure. A possible explanation for the latter may lie in the fact that stock market profitability reflects long-term income expectations (hypothesis 1.c).",
