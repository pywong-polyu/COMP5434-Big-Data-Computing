Proteins whose levels increase during inflammation are called positive acute phase reactants, and proteins whose levels decrease during inflammation are called negative acute phase reactants. Proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, fibrinogen, and procalcitonin are positive acute phase reactants, while proteins such as albumin, transferrin, and transthyretin are negative acute phase reactants. CRP is synthesized by the liver in case of systemic inflammation and its level increases rapidly. It is a protein that does not have variation of age, gender and diurnal rhythm ( 6 ) . Albumin is a negative acute phase protein whose serum levels are down-regulated in response to the inflammatory state ( 7 ) . Transferrin is a blood-plasma glycoprotein that plays an important role in iron metabolism and is responsible for ferric ion distribution. Transferrin also acts as a marker for inflammation and its levels decrease during inflammation ( 8 ) . D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product resulting from the regular breakdown of thrombus by the fibrinolytic system. While the circulating D-dimer concentration is low in healthy individuals, it is elevated in conditions associated with thrombosis. It has been shown that D-dimer levels are increased due to some homeostatic abnormalities in Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and this increase is associated with disease severity and poor prognosis ( 9 , 10 ) .",

This result may lead to the conclusion that the prognosis is worse in GBS patients with a history of COVID-19. Two of our patients had GBS simultaneously while they were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19. Both of these patients' HFGSS were high, had long duration of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation and dual therapy (IVIG, plasmapheresis) was needed for these two patients ( Table 2 ) . Although HFGSS were found to be high in post-COVID-19 GBS; symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, malaise, and muscle pain can be seen frequently in COVID-19 patients and persist for a long time. This may have affected the evaluation of patients' HFGSS. Also mild cases may have refrain from going to the hospital during the pandemic. The relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with GBS continues to be discussed today. While some studies state that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with GBS and that COVID-19 causes an increase in GBS cases, there are some studies that state the opposite (16) (17) (18) (19) . Although the term of GBS associated with COVID-19 has been used frequently in the literature, the pathogenesis of GBS in COVID-19 is still unclear. However, it is thought that some different mechanisms may play a role in the neurological damage process of COVID-19. Endothelial cells, glial cells, and neurons express angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), which are essential for SARS-Cov-2 virus entry into cells. It is thought that the virus passes through the olfactory nerve or enteric nervous system to the blood circulation via retrograde axonal transport and to the central nervous system by crossing the blood-brain barrier by direct damage mechanism. A post-mortem study demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in neuroanatomical areas of the olfactory tract, which supports a direct mechanism of injury ( 22 ) . However, Finsterer J, et al. ( 17 ) stated in a review in which they evaluated 220 GBS patients associated with COVID-19, that there were no patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the CSF. In a recent case report, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 was positive in CSF for the first time in a pediatric GBS patient ( 23 ). In our study, all 12 patients in the post-COVID-19 group were SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative in CSF and we could not find data to support the direct mechanism of injury. Although it is very difficult to generalize about the direct damage mechanism in a single CSF PCR positive case, we believe that more clear information will emerge as the number of studies on this subject increases.",

            "text": "The second week of COVID-19 infection is the hyperinflammatory phase and during this period, serum levels of some inflammatory parameters such as IL-2, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 , TNF-\u03b1, CCL2, procalcitonin, CRP increase ( 24 , 25 ) . Significant cytokine increase has been reported in GBS and its subtypes in experimental autoimmune neuritis, which is an animal model of GBS ( 26 ) . Cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in the immunopathology of all GBS types, particularly AIDP ( 27 ) . Gigli GL, et al. ( 28 ) showed that IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 levels were high in the serum of SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS patients, and also, IL-8 concentration was significantly higher in CSF. Th17 cells are an important subset of T-cells characterized by IL-17 production. IL-17 is a highly inflammatory cytokine with potent effects on stromal cells in many tissues. Th17 cells are known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of various immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease ( 29 ) . In a recent bioinformatics analysis; Th17 cell differentiation and cytokine response was identified as an important process connecting COVID-19 to GBS ( 30 ) . In our study, transferrin and albumin levels, which are negative acute phase reactants, were found to be significantly lower in the post-COVID-19 GBS group compared to the non-COVID-19 GBS group; D-dimer levels were found to be high. In addition, good-excellent negative correlation was observed between transferrin and albumin levels and hospital admission-discharge HFGSS in post-COVID-19 GBS patients, and a positive correlation with CRP levels. The severity of acute inflammatory response reflected by acute phase reactants was tightly linked to the clinical outcomes. Our results supported that dysregulated hyper-inflammatory response may have an important role in the GBS-COVID-19 relationship. We found that plasma D-dimer levels, a popular parameter in assessing the prognosis of COVID-19, were not equally successful in assessing the prognosis of post-COVID-19 GBS, but instead, especially transferrin levels were negatively correlated with good-excellent admission-discharge HFGSS.",
