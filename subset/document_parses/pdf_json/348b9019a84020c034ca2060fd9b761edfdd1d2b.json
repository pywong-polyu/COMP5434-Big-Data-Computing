Therefore, introducing fog computing in economic zones (e.g., shopping malls, organization buildings) can ensure continued economic activities by alerting nearby people while mobile computing (mobile apps) can help to trace the infected and suspected cases. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no integrated fog computing framework alongside contact tracing mobile apps that allows tracing community transmission while preserving users' data privacy.

Therefore, the collected data must have usage limitations. For example, tracing data can only be used for public health and safety. Traced data cannot be used for any other purpose, e.g., law enforcement. \u2022 Data Destruction: Mobile applications or a framework should automatically delete user records after a particular period [18] (e.g., usually 14-21 days and no longer than 30 days). Otherwise, users should have manual control over data deletion from the app or the central server. \u2022 Minimal Data Collection: Several applications collect excessive, unnecessary data from its users, for example, an application named \"Aarogya Setu\" requires name, phone number, age, gender, profession, and details of countries visited in the last 30 days. Also, Geo-location tracing is unnecessary alongside Bluetooth or other similar wireless technologies [19] . \u2022 Transparency: The entire process of data collection and usage should be transparent to preserve user privacy. Application frameworks should have publicly available policies, clear and concise data flow and database, and open-source codes for transparency. Additionally, users should have full control over their data usage. Therefore, developers must follow the compliance and consent rules (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, etc.) strictly [18] , [20] .",

It ensures that the broadcast data cannot be used to trace an individual. The same hashed value will be generated in the cloud application, and it can be used to check the risk level of any individual without disclosing his or her identity with others. 2) Self-checking: Users can check if he or she was nearby any infected victim in the last 14 days using the mobile application. The application will upload the locally stored reference codes of the device it came in contact in the last 14 days. The cloud application will check if any of the uploaded RUERC is listed as an infected victim or suspected victim. The application will notify the user accordingly. 3) Minimum Mobile Computation: Our proposed framework ensures minimum computation by enabling user control to turn on or off scanning, and background services. Apart from that, the mobile application features delay broadcast by avoiding unnecessary frequency and requires minimum internet connection as users only need internet while registering and uploading data for self-check. 4) User Data Privacy: User personal data is not stored or shared in the system. We ensure minimum data collection and avoid user location tracking or digital surveillance. Fog nodes do not identify any infected victim. 5) Fog Node Alerts: To minimize community transmission, we introduce automatic risk checker in public places such as shopping malls and office buildings.

It increases the accuracy of finding contact without a rigorous need for computation. Moreover, the RUERC enhances the privacy of the user because always broadcasting the same UERC may result in wireless tracking. While registering, the mobile unit receives a UERC from the cloud, and from this UERC, it generates RUERCs using the AES algorithm on each two-hour interval for the next 14 days.

The solution takes advantage of the content delivery network and provides a cost estimation per patient. Authors discussed privacy concerns such as the social graph (social relationships between users), interaction graph (physical interaction nearby), location traceability (tracing individuals), at-risk individuals (suspected cases), positive status (infected cases), and exposed location (partial identification of places a positive case visited). They also discussed the addressable privacy concerns in terms of the three design considerations.",

The app stores encrypted user ID, time of contact, and Bluetooth signal strength and keeps this data for 21 days. The case can upload these data voluntarily [36] . The government has amended the Privacy Act 1988 to prevent the misuse of these data [37] . The user can uninstall the app to delete these data and to delete all data from the server, the user needs to wait until the pandemic is over whereas, our framework allows users to delete all data within 14 days. Table I presents the difference between existing mobile application frameworks and our integrated mobile-fog computing framework (PPMF). Here, we categorize different features in terms of privacy-preserving approaches (voluntary, data usage limitation, data destruction, minimal data collection, and transparency), fog-based integrated solutions (risk check, infected/suspected data upload), and general design approaches (temporary BLE IDs, no geo-location trace, and minimal internet requirements). We put our framework (PPMF) at the end of the list and find it ticks all these features.",

The SUDUN uploads data to the central database about infected and suspected cases that can be processed to identify a super spreader and visualize the clusters of cases based on postal codes and age groups.",
