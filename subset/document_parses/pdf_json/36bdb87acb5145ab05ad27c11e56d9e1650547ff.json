Several reports have suggested that IL-27 functions downstream of IFN-b 17 , which is a major component of the IFN-I family. Thus, we hypothesized that IFN-b facilitates the induction of co-inhibitory receptors in humans. We rst assessed the effect of IL-27 and IFN-b on induction of core co-inhibitory receptors (TIM-3, LAG-3, PD-1, and TIGIT) in vitro using human primary na\u00efve CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Supplementary Figure 1a) . Both IL-27 and IFN-b promoted signi cantly higher TIM-3 expression compared to control condition without addition of exogenous cytokines. Of note, IFN-b induced more LAG-3 and TIM-3 expression compared to IL-27 in both",

Unexpectedly, both IL-27 and IFN-b suppressed the expression of TIGIT in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Supplementary Figure 1c) . We also observed the increased production of IL-10 by IFN-b; however, IL-10 induction by IL-27 was modest in our in vitro culture settings, which may re ect the difference between mouse and human T cell responses toward IL-27 stimulation (Supplementary Figure 1d) . To determine whether these observations stemmed from the effect of IFN-b on cellular proliferation, we performed a proliferation assay using cell trace violet dye. We found there was no differences in cellular division in na\u00efve CD4 + T cells between control and the IFN-b condition. Additionally, there was even less proliferation of memory CD4 + T cells in the IFN-b condition, indicating that the induction of co-inhibitory receptors by IFN-b is not driven by a state of higher proliferation in T cells (Supplementary Figure 2) , consistent with previous studies 18, 19 . We further determined the impact of IFN-b treatment on gene expression kinetics for co-inhibitory receptors by qPCR. Gene expression dynamics for core co-inhibitory receptors (HAVCR2, LAG3, PDCD1) were upregulated by IFN-b for most time points. In contrast TIGIT was downregulated, which was con rmed by protein expression using ow cytometry (Figure 1c , d). We examined the expression of other co-inhibitory receptors, and found IFN-b induced co-expression of multiple co-inhibitory receptors (e.g. HAVCR2, PDCD1, LAG3), but inhibited expression of others (TIGIT, CD160, BTLA) ( Figure 1e ). Collectively, these data elucidate a role for IFN-b as a cytokine that can directly control multiple co-inhibitory receptors in both human CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in vitro.",

We identi ed 1,831 (for CD4 + T cells) and 1,571 (for CD8 + T cells) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across time points with IFN-b treatment, revealing a temporal shift of gene expression patterns in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Figure 2a, Supplementary Figure 3b Interestingly, OSM, which is reported to amplify IFN-b response and suppress Th17 differentiation 20 , was signi cantly induced by IFN-b from the early phase, and maintained induction in all time points (Supplementary Figure 3c) . Among DEGs, we identi ed dynamic expression of 134 TFs for CD4 + T cells and 100 TFs for CD8 + T cells, which were both up-and down-regulated over the course of differentiation (Figure 2c ).",

PC1   divided the impact of perturbation into two modules of regulators; BATF, MAF, ETS2, HOPX, SP140, BCL3,  ID3, and BATF3 constitute 'IFN-I regulator module 1', and IRF1, IRF2, IRF4, STAT1, STAT3, ARID5A, ARID5B,  TCF7, PRDM1, PRDM1L, KLF5, and TCF7L constitute a distinct 'IFN-I regulator module 2' . To visualize the contribution of the selected genes to the PCs and the directionality of the contribution, a PCA biplot analysis was adopted. We found that ISGs are divided into two groups; classical ISGs that are correlated with 'IFN-I regulator module 1' (depicted in green arrows in Figure 3e ), and ISGs that are correlated with 'IFN-I regulator module 2' (depicted in orange arrows in Figure 3e ), which is predominantly in PC1. These results suggest that ISGs are bi-directionally regulated by different modules of TFs (Supplementary To characterize the impact of differentially expressed transcription factors (DETFs) in response to IFN-b, we generated transcriptional regulatory networks describing TFs and their target genes for each of the transcriptional waves identi ed (Figure 4a , Methods). When comparing the three regulatory networks, early and late networks had similar numbers of TFs (46 and 42 TFs, respectively), while the intermediate network contained 73 TFs (Figure 4b, top) . Interestingly, the ratio between up and down-regulated TFs differs between the three regulatory waves. The early and intermediate network contained more upregulated TFs than down-regulated TFs; in contrast, the late network had more down-regulated than upregulated TFs. Thus, IFN-I induced differentiation involves dominance of up-regulated TFs in the rst 16 hours, replaced by the dominance of down-regulated TFs after 48 hours. We next ranked the TFs based on the enrichment of their target genes and their centrality in the networks (Methods), highlighting the signi cance of each TF to the network (Figure 4b , middle). In the early regulatory network, MYC and CDKN1B/KDM5B were among the most dominant up and down-regulated TFs, respectively, in this transcriptional wave. These data indicate that T cell metabolic activation, cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional activation are promoted by IFN-b treatment 29, 30 . Interestingly, FLI1, which is novel as a IFN-I downstream TF and was recently reported to control effector response in T cells 31 , also dominantly regulated the early transcriptional wave. In the intermediate regulatory network, MYC, MAF, IRF1, AFF1, ATF3, and TBX21 were among the most dominant up-regulated TFs for this transcriptional wave. In the late network, effector function related regulators are upregulated (PRDM1, RUNX2, MAF, BCL3); in contrast, the TFs associated with Treg differentiation and maintenance (STAT5A, FOXP1, MYB) were down-regulated, suggesting the skewed differentiation toward effector-like signature.",

A few examples from the early transcriptional wave hierarchical backbone include CDKN1B and MAZ, which appeared at the top of the hierarchy, whereas KLF5, MYC, and FLI1 were lower in the hierarchy. It was of interest that these TFs were also highly dominant in the regulatory network.

Examples of dominant 'Bridging TFs' between early and intermediate waves include KLF5 and STAT2. Examples of intermediate to late waves include MAF, PRDM1, and MYB. Finally, there are TFs that were upregulated throughout the entire differentiation; such as STAT1, HIF1A, and TBX21. Generally, 'Bridging TFs' tend to be more dominant than other TFs; thus, it is possible that 'Bridging TFs' play an important role in the transition between different transcriptional waves. Indeed, our perturbation experiment demonstrated the critical roles of those 'Bridging TFs' in the regulation of ISGs and coinhibitory receptors (Figure 4c ).

As acute viral infections are strongly associated with IFN-I responses, we examined a number of clinical models where viral infection is closely linked to IFN-I T cell response. We found that our analysis of single cell RNA seq (scRNA-seq) analysis of T cells in COVID-19 patients revealed an extremely high correlation between viral load and IFN-I score (r=0.8) and time difference between paired samples and the respective change in IFN-I score (r=0.97) 32 , providing a unique opportunity to generate a rich dataset to determine whether the in vitro T cell response to IFN-I can be validated during an acute viral human infection strongly associated with a IFN-I signal.",

We rst focused on total CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells and con rmed that the IFN-I response signature is higher in progressive patients who required admission to the ICU and eventually succumbed to the disease ( Figure  5b ). Expression of co-inhibitory receptors differed across disease conditions, but the trend was conserved between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. We observed a strikingly similar pattern of co-inhibitory receptor expression with IFN-I stimulation in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, we observed the upregulation of 'IFN-I up coinhibitory receptors' (LAG3/HAVCR2) and the downregulation of 'IFN-I down co-inhibitory receptors' (TIGIT/LAIR1/SLAMF6) in T cells from COVID-19 patients (Figure 5c , d). As expected, 'IFN-I up coinhibitory receptors' were positively correlated with canonical ISGs expression, but 'IFN-I down coinhibitory receptors' were not, suggesting that there are different regulatory mechanisms dictating coinhibitory receptor expression patterns ( Figure 5e ). Next, we investigated which subpopulation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells is more affected by the IFN-I response, and computed the IFN-I score across subpopulations for each T cell subtype in COVID-19 patients (Figure 5f ). Within the subpopulations that exhibited higher IFN-I scores, dividing CD4 + /CD8 + T cells and ISG + CD8 + T cells were uniquely increased in COVID-19 patients, particularly in severe patients 32, 36 . Moreover, these subpopulations and effector T cells expressed higher level of co-inhibitory receptors and 'IFN-I regulator module-1' compared to the other subpopulations ( Figure 5g, Supplementary Figure 5c ).",

Our approach unveiled two mutually antagonistic modules of ISG regulators, which, when acting concordantly, may explain how the harmonized IFN-I induced T cell response is achieved. Within the two modules, we highlighted SP140 as a potential regulator that controls LAG3 and TIGIT in an opposing manner, and STAT3 as a unique positive regulator for TIM-3. These ndings provide novel insight into the landscape of the ISG transcriptional network, and sheds light on the large contribution of the noncanonical IFN-I pathway during IFN-I response in T cells [34] [35] [36] . Although the newly identi ed regulators (e.g. SP140, BCL3) in this study are not necessarily directly downstream of the conventional JAK/STAT pathway and may act differently depending on the context, they are nevertheless attractive targets for manipulation of speci c downstream functional molecules such as co-inhibitory receptors in T cells.",

Intriguingly, the expression pattern of co-inhibitory receptors on T cells in vitro are highly replicated in severe COVID-19 cases, and classical ISGs were well correlated with one module of co-inhibitory receptors (LAG3/PDCD1/HAVCR2), but not with the other modules (TIGIT/CD160/BTLA/LAIR1). While dynamics of IFN-I on T cells from COVID-19 patients should be taken into account with higher temporal pro ling, we con rmed that the IFN-I response was clearly reduced at a later time point; thus, our data based on earlier collection of blood should re ect the active ISG transcriptomics during human acute viral response. Given the IFN-I response has been shown to contribute to chronic viral infection and cancer, the novel regulators we identi ed can be examined in these diseases. Further investigations of factors that characterize acute viral infections is likely to differ from chronic viral infections and will be of interest to explore in the context of long-term human infections not well modeled by COVID-19.",

Speci cally, three transcriptional waves were observed during 96 hours of IFN-b response: early phase (1-2h), intermediate phase (4-16h), and late phase (48-96h). As expected, we observed abundant induction of classical IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) (i.e., IFI6, MX1/2, RSAD2, STAT1/2/3, SP100/110/140), which peaked at the early-intermediate phase. IFN-I induced cytokines produced by T cells (IFNG, IL10, GZMB, PRF1) were also upregulated at intermediate-late phase (Figure 2c, Supplementary Figure 3c).",

Furthermore, these modules contributed differently to the regulation of co-inhibitory receptors; TIGIT, CD160, BTLA as one module and LAG3, HAVCR2, PDCD1 as another module(Figure 3f,Supplementary Figure 4c). Within 'IFN-I regulator module 1', STAT3 positively regulated HAVCR2 but not LAG3 and PDCD1 expression, which is predominantly contributed by PC2 in the biplot(Figure 3f). Taken together, our perturbation with Vpx-VLP system elucidated two distinct TF modules simultaneously regulating opposing IFN-I target genes, which sheds light on the central roles of non-canonical IFN-I induced regulators in human T cells.Dynamic transcriptional regulatory network of IFN-b response",

This analysis highlights the regulators that function in establishing the characteristics of the dividing CD4 + T cell population under IFN-I response in vivo (SupplementaryFigure 5d). As LAG-3 is the most upregulated coinhibitory receptor in the dividing CD4 + T cell population, we utilized the network analysis to elucidate the speci c regulation of LAG3 and TIGIT that were regulated in an opposite manner under IFN-I response both in vivo(Figure 5c, d) and in vitro(Figure 1). Analysis of the intermediate wave gene regulatory network demonstrated that SP140 is a bi-directional regulator for LAG3 and TIGIT under IFN-I response, which is supported by the observation in COVID-19 patients, where elevated SP140 and LAG3 but decreased TIGIT expression were demonstrated(Figure 5c, d, i, j,Supplementary Figure 5c). In addition, the late wave network demonstrated the complex interaction of regulators for LAG3, HAVCR2, and PDCD1, in which BCL3 and STAT3 are highlighted as validated positive regulators on LAG3 and HAVCR2 respectively (Figure 5k). Importantly, both BCL3 and STAT3 were highly elevated in T cells in COVID-19 patients(Figure 5j). This can be highly relevant to effector T cells development under acute viral infection in which those co-inhibitory receptors play critical role on regulating effector function 33 and, of note, the late wave signature was enriched in effector T cells in COVID-19 (",
