            "text": "In the study of time-to-event data (e.g. time to death or discharge), bigger sample sizes and more desired events are often preferable. Simulation studies have indicated that training multiple survival time models using traditional models with small sample size data can lead to bias in the estimation of the coefficients since the outcome events per candidate feature (OEPCF) are too few. Accordingly, the model will most probably have unstable predictions and a poor performance on new datasets [19] [20] [21] . Among the different methods to model the survival data, the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model is the most popular approach because it has fewer assumptions than parametric models [22, 23] . Based on the rule of thumb, a minimum of between five and twenty OEPCF is needed for reliable results in the Cox-adjusted PH regression model [19] [20] [21] . For small sample size data, if the number of the candidate features is relatively large, the number of the OEPCF tends to be less than expected and using traditional survival models can be misleading [20, 21] . In such cases, using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and elastic-net regularized Cox PH models through machine-learning (ML) algorithms is the better option [21, 24] .",

In such situations, using a regularized version of the likelihood function (i.e. the log partial likelihood function plus a penalty term) can generate reliable results [19, 24] . Ridge and LASSO regressions are two different types of regularization methods that shrink the regression coefficient estimates towards zero to obtain reliable estimates [24, 25] . Unlike ridge regression that will always generate a prognostic model involving all the candidate features, LASSO regression performs feature selection as well. Therefore, LASSO regression results in a sparse model, i.e. a model that involves only a small subset of the candidate features [25] . The elastic-net regularized regression is a convex combination of the ridge and LASSO algorithms [24, 25] and its log partial likelihood function (i.e. \u2113 elastic \u2212 net ) can be formulated as follows:",

In the current study, an elastic-net regularized Cox PH regression was employed to model time to in-hospital death in the reinfected COVID-19 patients. Similar to LASSO, the elastic-net algorithm performs feature selection by setting some regression coefficient estimates to zero. The features selected by the elastic-net algorithm were then entered into a standard non-regularized Cox PH regression to specify a baseline for comparison during model development. The backward elimination approach was used to reduce the number of features in the baseline model and to obtain a parsimonious one [24, 25] . In addition, the supremum test was used to check the PH assumption. Finally, we determined the optimal cut-off values of continuous variables using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The analyses were performed using the \"glmnet\" and \"survival\" packages in the R statistical software (version: 3.6.3) and \"PROC PHREG\" in SAS statistical software (version 9.2). The MedCalc software (version: 8.0.0.0) was also used to draw the ROC curve for continuous variables, as well as the area under the curve (AUC), 95% CI and p-value calculation.",

Only the systematic review conducted by SeyedAlinaghi et al. was a comprehensive study which assessed the risk of COVID-19 re-infection [6] . They found thirty-one eligible studies of which eight studies described the patients who recovered from COVID-19 re-infection and only one study reported death among them. However, the majority of the published works (26 studies) did not present any extra information about the patients' status (i.e. death or discharge) [6] . The underlying diseases, clinical conditions, use of glucocorticoids, and secondary bacterial infection were identified as the independent risk factors of COVID-19 re-infection [6, 26, 27] . In addition, although re-infection is possible, it should be noted that the re-infection or reactivation diagnosed in some patients might in fact be a false negative at the time of discharge or not meeting the discharge criteria completely. On the other hand, three main reasons including short-lived, ineffective, and strain-specific immune responses may lead to a positive PCR test result [28, 29] .",

In this study, two ML algorithms (elastic-net regularized Cox-adjusted PH model and backward stepwise elimination) were applied to the dataset of re-infected COVID-19 patients to predict the OS and the associated factors among them. The current study is unique in that it incorporates all regularized algorithms under the elastic-net umbrella. These algorithms created two models. One of them maximized parsimony and the other optimized the predictive power. The elastic-net Cox-adjusted PH regression kept 8 out of 35 candidate features of time to discharge or in-hospital death. The strongest predictors (i.e. the features with the highest magnitude of the estimated coefficients) included the type of patient transfer (using the EMS or not), SpO 2 , intubation, and triage level (level 1 vs. others). The backward elimination method further reduced the regularized model to retain four features: type of patient transfer, SpO 2 , WBC count, and serum creatinine. Table 3 The selected features of time to in-hospital death or discharge and the regularized elastic-net coefficients in the re-infected COVID-19 patients (\u03b1 optimal =0.9 and \u03bb optimal = 0.03985) Since no similar studies were found about the survival of re-infected COVID-19 patients, the results of this study were compared with those of the studies related to survival and the related risk factors in patients with COVID-19. The results of the current research showed that the empirical in-hospital mortality rate was 9.5%. Furthermore, the OS rates for days 7, 14, and 21 were obtained as 87.5, 78.3, and 52.2%, respectively, in the re-infected COVID-19 inpatients. These rates have been reported differently for COVID-19 patients in other studies [12, 15, 37] . For example, Murillo-Zamora and Hernandez-Suarez found that 7-, 15-, 21-and 30-day OS rates were respectively 72.2, 47.6, 35.0, and 23.9% which were lower than the results obtained in the current study [37] . In another study by Sousa et al., the 24-day OS rate in 2070 patients with COVID-19 was calculated as 87.7% [15] .",

As compared with the surviving re-infected COVID-19 patients, the levels of creatinine were independent predictors of abnormal kidney function at the time of admission in the non-surviving re-infected COVID-19 patients. The higher in-hospital mortality rate was related to the higher concentration levels of creatinine (>1.6 mg/dL) in the patients, suggesting a worse renal function at the time of hospital admission.

After adjustment for confounders, the results of the present study demonstrated that higher SpO 2 levels (greater than 85%) after oxygen supplementation were associated with reduced mortality. In fact, profound hypoxemia (SpO 2 \u226485%) could have a harmful effect on the OS of re-infected COVID-19 patients, increasing the risk of mortality eight-fold.

Therefore, we had to compare our results with studies which used general COVID-19 datasets for their analyses. The impossibility of examining the risk factors associated with re-infection as well as the difficulty of confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 re-infection were two other limitations of the present study. Another limitation of this study was that it was conducted during the peak period of infection especially when the virus had an active transmission chain among the populations. Hence, our findings may vary in non-pandemic conditions.",
