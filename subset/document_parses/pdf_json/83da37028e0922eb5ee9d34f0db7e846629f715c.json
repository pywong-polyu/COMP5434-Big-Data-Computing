            "text": "Disinfection is a key element in controlling infections. Fogging, also known as fumigation, is one of the most effective chemical disinfection methods. Peracetic acid (PAA) is a powerful oxidant with bactericidal and fungicidal properties. The aim of this study is to determine the type of bacteria and fungi present in educational institutions and whether disinfection by PAA fumigation in these institutions is also effective and useful, as demonstrated previously in healthcare centers. This study was carried out in five kindergartens and five primary schools in Bialystok, Poland. Three rooms have been selected in each of these educational institutions, and the disinfection was carried out in 30 rooms in total. Fogging with PAA was performed in selected rooms. Before and after disinfection, samples were collected from four surfaces: walls, tables, doors, and chair backs. Most frequently detected microorganisms in schools and kindergartens were Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus), Staphylococcus warneri (S. warneri), Paracoccus yeei (P. yeei), Staphylococcus hominis ssp. hominis (S. hominis), Kocuria rhizophila (K. rhizophila), Kocuria rosea (K. rosea). In addition, Staphylococcus haemolyticus (S. haemolyticus), Acinetobacter lwoffii (A. lwoffii), Kocuria kristinae (K. kristinae), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (L. lactis) were the most prevalent in kindergartens, whereas Kytococcus sedentarius (K. sedentarius) was the most prevalent in schools. Comparison of the bacterial flora of schools and kindergartens showed statistically significant differences in the prevalence of bacteria on different surfaces. A significant decrease in the number of colonies after disinfection was observed on all surfaces (p < 0.05). In addition, the calculated effectiveness of disinfection was 99.7% in kindergartens and 99.3% in schools. The results indicate that fogging of PAA is a highly effective method of surface disinfection in kindergartens and schools.",

The disinfectant evaporates under the influence of high temperature (60 \u2022 C) and then condenses upon contact with the cooler air in the room, forming a droplet of a diameter of approximately 0.5 \u00b5m. The resulting fog may last longer than the cold fog, and this allows the chemical agent to remain in contact with the target microorganism for a longer period. Therefore, less disinfection chemical is needed, making it safer for people and the environment. Currently, alternative disinfection technologies, such as fumigation, are used in the healthcare sector to complement manual disinfection and have proven effective in reducing the environmental pollution (1, 2) .",

Moreover, they also described a fast and broad spectrum of biocidal activity (bacteria, fungi, viruses, bacterial spores, and mycobacteria) of PAA (5) . The mechanism of action of PAA is based on the oxidation of -SH groups of proteins to disulfide bridges and oxidation of double bonds occurring in the cell membrane. The destruction mechanism of the microorganism is based on the release of active oxygen, which destroys proteins, fats, and nucleic acids (4). An additional advantage of using PAA is the fact that it is harmless to the environment and is active at low concentrations, which is very useful in conditions requiring penetration of the disinfectant into porous surfaces or crevices.",

Peracetic acid is an excellent bactericide and fungicide, used mostly in the environment of the hospital. Fogging was proven to be a good method in the removal of contamination in hospitals and healthcare-related places. Ali et al. established that the use of air-borne H 2 O 2 gives excellent results in surgical wards, single isolation rooms, and bathrooms (9) . Another study proved that decontamination by dry fogging with H 2 O 2 in dental surgery has a high potential as H 2 O 2 fogging resulted in a significant decrease in the number of bacterial and fungal colonies present in these settings (10) . Moreover, fogging demonstrated good compatibility with electronic sensors and facilities used in laboratories, therefore, there is no risk of damaging the equipment (11, 12) . Recent studies showed that fogging is also very effective in the removal of SARS-CoV-2 from various surfaces. In their study, Cutts et al. demonstrate that dry fogging with PAA completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 on test surfaces. They also suggested that with the ease of use, low cost, and overall effectiveness of a PAA, dry fogging should also be considered for decontamination in the prevention of COVID-19 (13) . Another study demonstrated the effectiveness of PAA for disinfection of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (G. stearothermophilus) spores and bacteriophage MS2 on N95 respirators, proposing a PAA room disinfection system as a solution for decontamination of a great number of N95 respirators during the outbreak of COVID-19 (14) . Peroxyacetic acid has been shown to be effective against foodborne pathogens on different produce surfaces (15, 16 (17) . Another study assessed the effect of the disinfectant fogging procedure on the air quality in the farrowing-weaning room of a piggery. It was proven that fogging improved the quality of the air by reducing ammonia and dust concentration and the number of fungal spores. Therefore, the procedure resulted in the enhancement of the health of both the workers and animals (18) . Our study adds new information to this topic, as we proved the effectiveness of fogging with PAA in schools and kindergartens-places where many children gather and spend the whole day performing various activities, such as eating, sleeping, playing.",
