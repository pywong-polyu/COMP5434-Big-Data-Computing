Nevertheless, they are static values disregarding the kinetics at sub-MIC concentrations where adaptation, growth, stationary, and death phases can be observed. The understanding of these dynamic mechanisms is crucial to designing effective disinfection strategies. In this study, we studied the 48 h kinetics of Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli cells exposed to sub-MIC concentrations of didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC). Two mathematical models were employed to reproduce the experiments: the only-growth classical logistic model and a mechanistic model including growth and death dynamics. Although both models reproduce the lag, exponential and stationary phases, only the mechanistic model is able to reproduce the death phase and reveals the concentration dependence of the bactericidal/bacteriostatic activity of DDAC. This model could potentially be extended to study other antimicrobials and reproduce changes in optical density (OD) and colony-forming units (CFUs) with the same parameters and mechanisms of action.",

The presence of these sub-MIC disinfectant concentrations on surfaces can be explained as a consequence of an incorrect calculation of the disinfectant work concentration, the employ of expired or inappropriate stored substances (with the consequent decrease in efficiency), the lack of a successful pre-disinfection cleaning to remove organic matter (responsible of inactivation of disinfectant substances) or an irregular spreading (Capita et al., 2019) .",

The case study is the evaluation of the effect of DDAC on the growth of the common foodborne pathogens E. coli and Bacillus cereus (LeeNari et al., 2014) using measurements of optical density (OD) and colony-forming units (CFUs/ml). Two models are compared, the classical logistic only-growth model, where the DDAC effect is described using the Weibull functions, and a new mechanistic model that describes explicitly the mechanisms of adaptation, growth, and death using the Hill equations for the disinfectant effect. The mechanistic model shows a better goodness-of-fit for OD growth and is analyzed and extended to reproduce growth with both usual measurements (OD and CFUs/ml) and to understand DDAC treatment.",

BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and 5 gL \u22121 NaCl (Emsure R , Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) in distilled water. DDAC (98 % purity; ABCR GmbH & Co KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added to the media to obtain the different desired concentrations for sub-MIC treatments. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 and the media was finally sterilized by autoclaving (121 \u2022 C/15 min). Dose-response assays were performed in 300 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 180 mL of MPB.

For comparative purposes, 1 mL samples from each flask were several-fold diluted in peptone-buffered solution and 0.1 mL aliquots were plated by duplicate on agarized MPB (2% w/v agar), resulting in a total of four plates per DDAC concentration tested for each strain.

Figure 2 shows how assumed mechanisms are sufficient to reproduce OD and CFUs using the same adaptation, growth, and death parameters. The mechanistic model has 14 parameters: 12 common parameters plus \u03b1, defining contribution of dead cells to OD, and \u03b2 10 10 , which represents the difference between OD (usually one order of magnitude) and CFUs (varying from 10 orders of magnitude for B. cereus and 12 for E. coli). Table 4 shows the model performance in terms of adjusted R 2 , AICc, and BIC. Note that now the model has been challenged to reproduce both OD and CFUs with the same parameters and, although indexes are acceptable for the measured experimental errors, are worse than when reproducing only OD.

This limitation was previously detected when modeling the inhibition of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus due to silver nanoparticles (Chatterjee et al., 2015) . As with sub-MIC DDAC concentrations, nanoparticles are mostly bacteriostatic but growth curves show a decline at long times. The derived model was calibrated from and did reproduce the two most common measurements of bacterial population numbers, OD and CFUs, using the same parameters for adaptation, growth, and death rate. Results show that E. coli dead cells do not affect OD, probably due to severe cell lysis and their not appreciable effect in OD measurement (Stevenson et al., 2016) . However, 32% of B. cereus dead cells contribute to OD. Two hypotheses can explain this estimation: either this contribution is due to viable but nonculturable cells or either some cells are non-lysed since B. cereus has more resistance to lysis than E. coli (Fykse et al., 2003) .",

Despite both strains showing the different magnitude of adaptation, the change of adaptation with DDAC concentration (Figures 3A,B) shows a similar trend. Whereas for both adaptation is high without DDAC, when DDAC concentration increases there is a deep decrease of adaptation, therefore, showing longer lag phases at high DDAC concentrations.",

Lack of growth after 24 h could be due to different mechanisms: either an extremely large lag phase or that the death rate is equal or larger than the growth rate [zero or negative net growth rate, also commented by Mouton and Vinks (2005) the stationary concentration]. Assuming no effect of the limiting substrate and MIC representing the concentration of zero growth rate (Coates et al., 2018) , the model can be used to calculate the MIC using the intersection of growth and death rate (k g and k d ). As shown in Figure 3C there is net growth of B. cereus for disinfectant concentrations below 1.39 mg/L and the bacteriostatic effect is greater at low concentrations of DDAC whereas the bactericidal effect is higher at larger concentrations. On the other hand Figure 3D shows a similar trend, but with less bacteriostatic effect and with a MIC of 2.86 mg/L.",

The model describes DDAC influence on adaptation, growth, stationary, and death phases and discerns if the disinfectant is bactericidal, bacteriostatic, or both, and at which concentrations. The model also considers adaptation, which is relevant to detect if the absence of growth after treatment is due to the use of supra-MIC treatments or because there is a strong delay in the lag phase and bacteria can grow hours later, as observed in E. coli experiments. The analysis of the model reveals that DDAC is both bacteriostatic and bactericidal but mainly bacteriostatic at low sub-MIC concentrations and bactericidal at large sub-MIC concentrations. Moreover, the model is able to reproduce the behavior of both OD and CFUs measurements using the same mechanisms and it is sufficiently flexible to account for different forms of the disinfectant effect and could be used to study the mechanisms of action of different types of antimicrobials, like antibiotics, at sub-MIC concentrations.",
