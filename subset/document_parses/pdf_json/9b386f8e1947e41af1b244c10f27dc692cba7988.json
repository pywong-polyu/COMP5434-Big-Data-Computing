Surveillance and short-term modeling forecasts are critical to provide timely information for decisions on control strategies. We use a model that explains the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic over time in the entire African continent, parameterized by socioeconomic and geoeconomic variations and the lagged effects of social policy and meteorological history. We observed the effect of the human development index, containment policies, testing capacity, specific humidity, temperature and landlocked status of countries on the local within-country and external betweencountry transmission. One week forecasts of case numbers from the model were driven by the quality of the reported data. Seeking equitable behavioral and social interventions, balanced with coordinated country-specific strategies in infection suppression, should be a continental priority to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.",

A recent systematic review reports agreement among published research, with cold and dry conditions contributing to . However, these results must be considered preliminary. Early studies of COVID-19 transmission focused on the emerging pandemic during the boreal spring (March through May), when the majority of cases were found in China, the US and Europe. It is difficult therefore to extrapolate meteorological results to the very different climates found in the tropics, for example from the recent outbreaks in India and Brazil. Many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), as defined by the World Bank, are located in the tropics, where many potential confounding factors which could mimic a weather signal. These factors include median age, testing and health capabilities, population density, access to sanitation and the number of new cases arriving in a country through global travel hubs (21) . It is also difficult to extract seasonality from a single outbreak that began in the boreal spring, and considerable caution has been raised regarding tropical case-load and confounding factors (22).",

            "text": "We have therefore developed a COVID-19 surveillance strategy that explores a growing spatiotemporal database on coronavirus epidemiology, meteorology, and social policy interventions. To model the spread of COVID-19 in Africa, we employ a data-driven endemic-epidemic model (33) to 1) visualize the burden of cases including the proportion of cases arising from sources local within-country and external between-country, 2) describe the factors which most correlate with spread, and 3) enable short-term forecasting of new cases. This modeling framework has been used previously to fit space-time dynamics of COVID-19 in Italy (34), Germany (35) and the United Kingdom (36) and to analyze other infectious diseases (37). The model is divided into three main parts: two epidemic components that capture sources of infections coming from within the country and from neighboring areas, and an endemic component that includes all contributions to the reported number of cases that are not taken into account by the epidemic part. The epidemic part of the model has an auto-regressive nature, this means that the past number of COVID-19 cases reported both within a specific country and in the rest of the continent will be used to forecast the present and future trend of COVID-19 cases. How much the past observations contribute to the the future disease count depends on two parameters, \u03bb for the local transmission and \u03c6 for the external transmission and will be estimated from the data. In particular, the impact of cases reported in the neighboring countries depends also on a set of weights that modulate the spatial connectivity of the countries in the continent (see Method section). These two parameters are also functions of social policy, testing availability, meteorological and demographic factors whose association with transmission we aim to determine.

This approach balances the simplicity and consequent robustness of an empirical model against the more complex, potentially more realistic but also more strongly assumption-driven kind of compartmental mechanistic models (40). A key feature of our approach is the ability to distinguish between case incidence arising from the local within-or neighbor-driven transmission of infection. Distinguishing within-and betweencountry transmission of cases allows us to identify potential strategies for social or health policy intervention. The model further enables reproducing the history of the epidemic in relationship to past policy, and producing short-term predictions of the dynamic evolution of the epidemic.",

Containment and mitigation strategies to limit the spread of the virus, including restrictions on movement, public gatherings, and schools, were implemented very early in the pandemic. In a resource-limited setting such as Africa, containment and mitigation strategies remain the most robust defense against high infection rates and mortality. However, it is anticipated that physical-distancing measures enforced to limit transmission will also restrict access to essential non-COVID-19 healthcare services, such as disruptions in the existing programs for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and vaccinepreventable diseases, causing long-lasting collateral damage on the continent (32). Although, between 29 million to 44 million individuals (2) in Africa are projected to become infected in the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, these numbers may be underestimated since the proportion of asymptomatic infections is not well established. Since detection is biased towards clinically severe disease, the attack rate of the infection is probably substantially higher than what is reported. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was estimated that up to 86% of all infections were undocumented and were the source of 79% of the documented cases (47). Such observations explain the rapid geographic spread of the infections and challenging efforts at containment.",

We attempted to mimic the longer (greater than 1 day) serial interval (48, 49), infectiousness (48, 50), and latency (48) of COVID-19 transmission, by extending the observational interval of the infectious process to several days. The Poisson autoregressive weighting method used in our modeling strategy also captures an initial increase in infectiousness and may thus be more appropriate for longer serial intervals or daily data. In their recent work, Bracher and Held show that moving beyond one day lags to higher order time lags improves predictive performance of these endemic-epidemic models (51) . For our optimization scheme we tested lags up to 14 days, and found that a lag at 7 days provided the best model fit. Short-term predictions enable the monitoring of case incidence trends but are limited by high levels of uncertainty. This is the result of the non-negligible overdispersion detected in the data and due to the several sources of unmodeled spatial and temporal heterogeneity across the continent.",

We avoided adding sinusoidal (smooth, repetitive oscillation) functions in the endemic component because of the short interval of the current pandemic not spanning a whole year.

Indeed, this heterogeneity results in substantial variability of reported case counts across countries.

We began with an intercept only model (Model 1) with a population offset in the the endemic component of the model and country's measure of connectivity based on a power law. More complicated versions of the epidemic component 7 were evaluated by sequentially adding weather, demographic, stringency index and testing policy in the formula for the within (\u03bb) and between-country (\u03c6) components of the model. We also tested whether multiple lags for cases and covariates better described the observed patterns: considering lags d = 1, . . . ,D where D = 14 days. Exploration of the higher order model with Poisson and geometric lag weights, revealed that relative to the first-order model, the largest improvement in AIC (\u2206AIC = -1560) was achieved with a model with D = 7 (Supplementary Figure S10). Therefore, the model with lag 7 days for cases, testing policy, stringency index including human development index (HDI), landlocked status and population in the between-country component, and meteorology factors, HDI, landlocked status, stringency index and testing policy in the within-country component, yielded the lowest AIC (from 48824.32 in model 1 to 48437.99 in model 5 without random effects, Supplementary",

Temperature and humidity are known factors in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus survival (41-43). Lower humidity has been consistently associated with higher cases.

This regional factor captures the human genetics (61), environment and climate (62), and sociocultural and sociodemographic variations of the African population (63). Finally, lack of direct access to the coastline may influence the flow of infections from neighboring countries as border trade remains an essential operation. For example, Uganda introduced border closures and tighter preventive measures on truck drivers' movements during the epidemic; despite this, a substantial number of new infections have been imported from truck drivers crossing the border for trade (64).
