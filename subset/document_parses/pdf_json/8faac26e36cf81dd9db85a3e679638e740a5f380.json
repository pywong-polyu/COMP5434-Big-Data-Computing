In general, self-management includes six behaviors: problemsolving, decision making, resource utilization, patient and provider communication, action planning, and self-tailoring [3] . These self-management behaviors, either alone or in combination, have improved patient clinical outcomes [3, 4] . Therefore, interventions have been developed and administered to enhance self-management behaviors. Previous interventions have typically focused on in-person educational sessions or the distribution of printed materials [1, 3, 5, 6] . For example, the Chronic Disease Self-Management Programs (CDSP) promoted physical activity, stress reduction, and a healthy diet through goal setting and action-taking [7, 8] . In recent years, with the rise of the internet and health information technology (HIT), other interventions, including mobile health (mHealth) for the self-management of chronic conditions, have been investigated [9, 10] .",

With the emergence of mHealth practice, certain selfmanagement behaviors have been reported to improve chronic disease care through mHealth apps [12, 13] . These self-management behaviors mainly include self-monitoring and action planning. For example, a mHealth app for gout management improved patient daily pain monitoring and long-term gout self-care behavior [14] . Patients with diabetes use mHealth apps for serum glucose tracking and monitoring, which have been reported to improve diabetes clinical outcomes [15] . In another diet control study, 60% of patients used mHealth apps for their diet control/monitoring [16] . In general, mHealth apps that facilitate tracking the progress of goals set (action planning and self-tailoring) by the individual have been well-studied [14, [17] [18] [19] . However, thorough analyses of using mHealth apps affecting the other four reported self-management behaviors (e.g., problemsolving, decision-making, resource utilization, and patient-provider communication) are less studied and remain largely unknown.",

The coronavirus disease pandemic has made in-person interventions for promoting self-management behaviors very challenging [20, 21] . Recognizing the role of the mHealth app in relation to the variety of self-management behaviors could serve as a foundation for future implementation of the non-in-person intervention (e.g., advocating mHealth use). Currently, Health Information National Trend Surveys (HINTS) collect nationally representative data from American adults aged 18 or older to assess the impact of the HIT, including the report of mHealth app use and the status of individual self-management behaviors [22] . To better understand the role of using the mHealth app affecting an individual's different self-management behaviors, it is ideal for analyzing the use of the mHealth app in association with each self-management behavior separately. However, one of the self-management behaviors, problem-solving, by definition, may involve multiple steps with overlapping other self-management behaviors (such as recognizing problems, finding ways to solve problems, and finally taking actions), thereby hard to investigate its direct association. Therefore, in this study, we examined the association of mHealth app use to three different patient self-management behaviors (resource utilization through the use of electronic personal health records; patient-provider communication; and decisionmaking) among adults with chronic conditions by analyzing data from this nationally representative survey.",

Although self-management education and interventions are implemented with in-person visits, self-management with mHealth apps has been widely practiced. In this study, we investigated the role of mHealth apps in facilitating three self-management behaviors. The use of mHealth apps is not new. The mHealth apps have been used to record individuals' vital signs (e.g., blood pressure) and monitor day-to-day health activities/goals (e.g., daily exercise, diet calories) [19, 31, 32] . However, the potential benefits of mHealth apps in promoting other self-management behaviors have rarely been reported. This study extended the link from mHealth apps to different self-management behaviors (i.e., resource utilization through personal health records use, communication with providers, and help decide on health management).",

In addition, multiple factors could affect individuals' self-management behaviors. In this study, we only adjusted a limited set of factors. Other factors (e.g., internet access, enrollment in lifestyle intervention programs, etc.) might potentially affect the use of the mHealth app and self-management behaviors. Therefore, future studies are warranted to investigate other potential risks affecting individuals' self-management behaviors. From this study, we cannot determine if having mHealth apps on smartphones and tablets translates into \"meaningful\" use of the apps.
