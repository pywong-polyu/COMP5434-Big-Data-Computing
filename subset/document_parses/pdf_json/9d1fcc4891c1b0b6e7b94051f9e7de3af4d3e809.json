            "text": "These authors contributed equally to this work Background: Although many works have been conducted to explore the biomarkers for diagnosing major depressive disorder (MDD), the widely accepted biomarkers are still not identified. Thus, the combined application of serum metabolomics and fecal microbial communities was used to identify gut microbiota-derived inflammation-related serum metabolites as potential biomarkers for MDD. Methods: MDD patients and healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. Both serum samples and fecal samples were collected. The liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to detect the metabolites in serum samples, and the 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota compositions in fecal samples. Results: Totally, 60 MDD patients and 60 HCs were recruited. The 24 differential serum metabolites were identified, and 10 of these were inflammation-related metabolites. Three significantly affected inflammation-related pathways were identified using differential metabolites. The 17 differential genera were identified, and 14 of these genera belonged to phyla Firmicutes. Four significantly affected inflammation-related pathways were identified using differential genera. Five inflammation-related metabolites (LysoPC(16:0), deoxycholic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, taurocholic acid and LysoPC(20:0)) were identified as potential biomarkers. These potential biomarkers had significant correlations with genera belonged to phyla Firmicutes. The panel consisting of these biomarkers could effectively distinguish MDD patients from HCs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 in training set and 0.92 in testing set. Conclusion: These findings suggested that the disturbance of phyla Firmicutes might be involved in the onset of depression by regulating host's inflammatory response, and these potential biomarkers could be useful for future investigating the objective methods for diagnosing MDD.",

However, the pathogenesis of MDD is still unclear; 2-4 the mainstream view is that the molecular brain dysfunctions are mainly responsible for this disease. 5 Unfortunately, the current first-line antidepressant therapies developed according to these prevailing theories can only alleviate depressive symptoms in about half of MDD patients. 6 Meanwhile, the clinicians still diagnose MDD according to the subjective identification of symptom clusters of patients, rather than using objective tests. Up to now, there are still no widely accepted biomarkers, although many potential biomarkers have been identified based on the existing theories. [7] [8] [9] [10] These phenomena indicate that the existing hypotheses cannot comprehensively reflect the heterogeneous pathophysiological mechanisms of MDD. Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore novel molecular mechanisms of MDD.",

Gut microbiota-derived metabolites may be involved in the pathogenesis of immune-related inflammatory diseases by leading to the release of many inflammation-related serum markers, such as interleukins (ILs), C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). 21, 22 Previous studies reported that inflammation had a close relationship with the pathogenesis of depression, and individuals with inflammatory disorders might have an increased incidence of depression. 23, 24 Zheng et al found five significantly changed gut microbiota-related urinary metabolites in MDD patients, and these metabolites had some relationships with inflammatory response. 25 Our previous study found that plasma metabolic abnormalities in lipid and amino acid metabolism might be implicated in the occurrence of suicidal behaviors in MDD patients. 26 Both gut microbiota and inflammatory response have close relationships with lipid metabolites. Meanwhile, we also found that the decreased level of alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) might lead to inflammatory response disorders, and ultimately lead to the occurrence of suicidal ideation in MDD patients. 27 The inflammatory response and immune system represent the major component of communications between gut microbiota and brain functions. Accumulating evidence supports the role of gut microbiota in regulating the host metabolic and immune functions. 28, 29 Therefore, we conducted this study to further explore the differences of gut microbiota and serum metabolites between MDD patients and HCs. Our findings will advance our understanding of how gut microbiota contributes to the onset of depression.",

Two experienced psychiatrists were in charge of participants' recruitment using the [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition] criteria (DSM-IV). MDD patients met the following criteria were included in this study: i) 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was used to assess the depression severity, and the candidates with HDRS scores >17 were included into this study; ii) without any pre-existing mental disorders, and without other DSM-IV Axis I/II disorders; iii) we did not recruit women who were pregnant or within the first year after delivery; iv) without any illicit drug use or alcohol abuse; and v) did not receive any antidepressive treatments in one month prior to sample collections. Meanwhile, two experienced psychiatrists applied DSM-IV to assess the mental state of HCs, and used the physical examination records to carefully check the other information of HCs. Finally, HCs without DSM-IV Axis I/II disorders, systemic medical illness, illicit drug use and alcohol abuse were recruited from the Medical Examination Center of our hospital.

            "text": "Gut microbiota plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of depression. Our previous studies have found the disturbance of gut microbiota in depressed mice and MDD patients. [16] [17] [18] Other researchers also reported the significant gut microbiome changes in MDD patients. 41, 42 Although these findings are not exactly the same, partly causing by the differences on inclusion/exclusion criteria of MDD patients, detection methods or analytical methods, the disturbance of phyla Firmicutes is viewed as the hallmark of depression. However, the molecular mechanisms of phyla Firmicutes in the onset of depression are still unclear. In this study, we found that the 14 of 17 differential genera belonged to phyla Firmicutes, and function prediction analysis showed that these differential genera were involved in four inflammationrelated pathways. Meanwhile, the four differential genera belonged to phyla Firmicutes were significantly correlated with the identified potential inflammation-related biomarkers. Taken together, we speculated that the disturbance of phyla Firmicutes might be involved in the onset of depression by regulating the host's inflammatory response.",

[43] [44] [45] [46] As the important part of immune system, it is viewed as a driving factor causing changes in neurocircuits and neurotransmitters, which are closely related to the onset of depressive symptoms. Mounting evidence has solidified the relationships between depression and inflammation. 47, 48 For example, a cumulative meta-analysis reported that the levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were higher in MDD patients than in non-depressed controls. 49 Our previous studies found that the level of alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) was decreased in MDD patients; 27, 50 AAT can inhibit the release of many pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL-6. In this study, we found ten inflammationrelated metabolites, and identified three inflammation-related pathways by analyzing these differential metabolites. Moreover, all the identified potential biomarkers were inflammation-related serum metabolites and significantly correlated with the disordered gut microbiota. These results suggested that it might be a good way to explore markers of inflammation for diagnosing MDD.",
