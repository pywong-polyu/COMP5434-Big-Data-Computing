Additionally, studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine immunisations in various jurisdictions provides clinicians and policy makers with information on the impact of variable strategies for maintaining continuity of vaccine programmes in different contexts, which can aid in planning for related challenges that we will likely encounter in the future.",

Some vaccines also showed a second decline in the fall, which is when additional public health restrictions were implemented in response to increased COVID-19 infections. Our finding that early childhood vaccine coverage declined after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic aligns with literature from other jurisdictions, 1 2 6 18 although the declines in Alberta were not as extreme. In the USA, Langdon-Embry et al 6 found a 62% decrease in infant immunisation during March and April 2020 in New York City, while Bramer et al 18 reported declines ranging from 5% to 20% in infant vaccine coverage in May 2020 in Michigan. One possible reason for the smaller impact in Alberta is that childhood vaccinations are provided entirely in community health centres in Alberta, so the move to virtual appointments by many physicians' offices 19 20 would have no impact on vaccine service delivery.",

Personal communication with public health managers revealed that after initial reduction of vaccine service delivery at the start of the pandemic, many community health centres were contacting parents of 6-month-old children to get them vaccinated before they aged out of rotavirus vaccine eligibility (online supplemental appendix table A1). This might also explain the increase in November to December, as increased restrictions in October may have been followed by heightened efforts to bring in children for the third dose in time.",

Accumulation of unimmunised and underimmunised children can lead to a corresponding increased risk of disease outbreaks. 3 In a 2019 outbreak of 704 measles cases in the USA, 89% of cases were in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status. 21 In a 2013 measles outbreak in Alberta, Canada, linked to a religious community from southern Alberta, of the 42 confirmed cases, all were unimmunised for measles. 22 In light of the evidence of reduced measles vaccine Open access coverage in our study, catch-up programmes to reach unimmunised/underimmunised children are critical.
