SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic infection and a mild illness to a life-threatening manifestation. The severe disease is known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a disease associated with pneumonia, manifesting the signs of shortness of breath and hypoxia [2] . Individuals with immune impairment or underlying health problems, or aged over 60 years are at greater risk for progression to respiratory failure [3] . To date, there is a shortage of approved specific therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 initially occurs through binding of the viral spike glycoprotein (S) to the host receptors (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) and cellular transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). This interaction primes the S-glycoprotein into its functional form [4, 5] . Upon exposure to host furin, S-glycoprotein is cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2 [6] . The receptor-binding domain (RBD), which serves as a viral attachment factor, is located on S1, while S2 harbors two important peptide repertoires, heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) [7, 8] . These regions play a key role in recognizing host receptors and mediating the fusion of the viral envelope and host membrane, respectively. Epitope mapping of the S-glycoprotein revealed the RBD as a major target for neutralizing antibodies, and identified many peptides on this protein as dominant T cell epitopes [9] [10] [11] [12] , suggesting that RBD may be a promising candidate for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",

The natural route of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through the respiratory tract; thus, the mucosal immune response is a first-line defense against SARS-CoV-2 [13] . Therefore, mucosal vaccination via the intranasal route may offer an advantage in inducing sterilizing and localized mucosal immunity. Despite recent efforts to apply this strategy, the efficacy of intranasal vaccines has been largely hindered by several factors, including the nature of the viral antigens and the physical barriers of the mucosa, which lead to inefficient antigen permeation and uptake. These inherent limitations can be overcome by incorporating an adjuvant that possesses an immune modulator and a delivery system. Transportation of target immunogens across the nasal epithelial barrier enhances antigen presentation to immune cells at the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALTs) of the upper respiratory tract (URT), which serve as inductive sites for the mucosal immune system [14] .",

            "text": "To this end, nanoparticle-based formulations have recently emerged as an innovative strategy for vaccine antigen delivery to mucosal sites [15] . Among the nanoparticles used in the development of intranasal vaccines, chitosan and its derivatives have gained the most attention for their applications against infectious pathogens of the respiratory system [16] [17] [18] . Compared with other mucosal adjuvants, chitosan-based nanoparticles exert their effects through various mechanisms. For instance, this NPs acts as a vehicle that protects the vaccine from degradation by tissue-specific protease and releases the vaccine antigens in a sustained manner into the nasal cavity. In addition, chitosan harboring a mucoadhesive property enhances the adherence of NPs to the mucus layer, resulting in an increased residence time of the vaccine [19] . Furthermore, the surface moieties of chitosan determine the recognition and uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [20, 21] . We previously reported that incorporation of influenza HA2/NP antigens into N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (HA2/NP TMC NPs) could increase the antigen uptake by primary human nasal epithelial cells [22] . Moreover, TMC NPs significantly improved encapsidated HA2/NP antigenicity by enhancing the secretion of innate immune mediators that promoted APC activation and exerted antiviral activity that suppressed viral multiplication in an in vitro challenge assay [22] .",

We also found that RBD protein was efficiently entrapped into TMC NPs. This was demonstrated by successful loading efficiency as high as 99% (Table 1 and Figure 1A ). The successful entrapment of RBD into NPs was also validated by immunoblotting. The results showed that encapsidated protein could be reacted with the tested antibodies ( Figure 1B) .

We tracked the prevalence of RBD-specific IgA-secreting cells in the spleen of mice intranasally immunized with the vaccine using ELISPOT. As shown in Figure 2B , RBD-specific IgA secreting cells were massively generated in mice immunized with four doses of RBD-TMC NPs, but not with three doses (data not shown).

To investigate whether intranasal immunization with RBD-TMC NPs induced local mucosal immunity, IgA and IgG levels in the lung homogenates of immunized mice were quantified via ELISAs. As shown in Figure 2C ,D, high titers of lung IgG were detected in mice after immunization with three and four doses of RBD-TMC NPs, while mice immunized with 20 \u00b5g sRBD developed significantly lower IgG titers. Similarly, increased IgA production could be detected after three vaccine doses ( Figure 2E ).

Typically, serum IgG1/IgG2a serves as an indirect marker of Th-1/Th-2 response, in which the production of IgG2a isotype is directed by Th-1 cytokines, while IgG1 production correlates with high levels of Th-2 cytokines [28, 29] . We next profiled IgG isotypes in the sera of immunized mice by performing indirect ELISA to assess the immunomodulatory effects of RBD-TMC NPs on the Th-1/Th-2 axis. As depicted in Figure 4B , mice intranasally vaccinated with sRBD or RBD-TMC NPs elicited an RBD-specific IgG1 response. Likewise, immunization with RBD-TMC NPs or sRBD also resulted in the production of serum IgG2a ( Figure 4C ).

This suggested that RBD-specific antibodies induced by RBD-TMC NP immunization may neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection. This result led us to investigate whether RBD-TMC NP-induced antibody responses can protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end, we performed an in vitro neutralization assay using PRNT. By Day 45, all mice that received either 10 or 20 \u00b5g RBD-TMC NPs immunogens produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in their sera. The average PRNT titer was 366 \u00b1 104 and 216 \u00b1 81 for 10 and 20 \u00b5g of immunogens, respectively. For mice immunized with 20 \u00b5g of sRBD, only one out of four mice exhibited neutralizing activity ( Figure 5B ).",

As illustrated in Figure 6A , RBD in its soluble and encapsidated forms both stimulated the expansion of CD4 + cells at the same level as the control groups, placebo and TMC NPs. Interestingly, sRBD and RBD-TMC NPs stimulated a significantly higher frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + cells compared with the diluent control ( Figure 6C) . Notably, mice treated with RBD-TMC NPs significantly developed a greater frequency of CD8 + cells when compared with the control groups ( Figure 6B) . A similar pattern of results was detected for IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 + cell frequency. Among the groups of immunized mice, RBD-TMC NPs administered at 20 \u00b5g/dose stimulated the highest number of IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 + cells ( Figure 6D ).

            "text": "The mucosal immune response is a powerful arm of host immunity that prevents the entry of various types of pathogens at the mucosa. Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 vaccines used in human are administered via intramuscular injections. As such, myocytes are expected to be the major target of vaccine antigens. Unfortunately, myocytes are not professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and can present antigens exclusively through the MHC Class I pathway. In addition, myocytes are unable to migrate to draining lymph nodes, where immunological activation takes place. This means that the ability of myocytes to initiate adaptive immune responses is limited. Moreover, the respiratory tract is a common route of SARS-CoV-2 infection; thus, immunization at mucosal sites mimics this interaction and induces a highly specialized local immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, there are mucosal-resident dendritic cells, which serve as the principal immune cells that take up foreign antigens and mount local immune responses within mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs) [30, 31] . The role of mucosal immunization in defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection is supported by a previous report that intranasal vaccination with an adenovirus-based vaccine offered superior mucosal immunity compared with intramuscular injection, protecting from SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts [32] . Moreover, it is widely accepted that the anatomical and physiochemical barriers of the mucosa can determine vaccine efficacy [33] . Thus, vaccines that facilitate antigen adsorption and generate a robust immune response would greatly advance the field of intranasal vaccine development.",

The generated NPs had a size of less than 500 nm and a cationic charge, optimizing uptake by APCs [34] . Furthermore, NPs that possessed a positive charge could easily be deposited on a negatively charged mucosal layer via ionic bonding.

The mucosal antibody response may be mediated by the immunostimulatory and delivery effects of TMC NPs. This type of nanoparticle has a mucoadhesive characteristic, meaning that it can prolong the residence time of antigens in the nasal cavity and, in turn, enhance uptake by nasal epithelial cells, local APCs and M-cells [22, 37] . Among the Ig isotypes elicited by intranasal vaccination, secretory IgA (sIgA) had a significant role in preventing viral infection at the mucosal surface. This is supported by the correlation between sIgA and protective efficacy against influenza virus A [38] . IgA likely mediates protection through the neutralization of free virus particles [39] and/or intracellular killing and activation of an antiviral state of infected cells [40] .

            "text": "The strength and kinetics of the humoral immune response in SARS-CoV-2 patients have been extensively explored. It has been revealed that the breadth and magnitude of antibody responses correlate with disease severity, and patients with severe disease develop more antibodies, especially to the spike protein, compared with mild/moderate cases [43, 44] . Furthermore, Seow et al. also demonstrated that neutralizing antibody titers peaked on Day 23 post-disease onset and rapidly decreased within 18-65 days [45] . A separate study revealed a rapid decline in the antibody response toward S protein within a 6-month period [46] . Consequently, the transient course of antibody response may create concern regarding the efficacy of vaccines that solely induce humoral immunity. In contrast, functional T cells robustly persisted and even increased over the time of observation [46] . Although the role of T cell responses in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear, Peng et al. found that a greater proportion of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + cells was detected in mild patients as compared with severe cases [47] . In this study, we monitored the intensity and diversity of T cells elicited in response to intranasal vaccination with RBD-TMC NPs. We found that this vaccine platform was capable of inducing both IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + as well as IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 + cell responses. In particular, for CD8 + cells, the magnitude of CTL responses was stronger in RBD-TMC NP immunized mice, when compared with sRBD administration. This is in accordance with previous studies showing that RBD protein was immunogenic to splenic T cells in murine models in which the immunodominant epitopes of RBD corresponded to S 375-394 , S 405-469 , S 495-521 and S 526-533 [11, 48] . The RBD used in our present study contained these T cell epitopes. The ability of TMC to augment the CTL response is not well understood. However, we postulate that TMC may promote endosomal escape into the cytosol, allowing the antigen to be further recognized and presented through an MHC-I-dependent pathway [49] .",

Thus, this platform of protein vaccine may be beneficial for a broad range of populations such as the elderly, children and immunocompromised individuals. Moreover, intranasal vaccination is a non-invasive procedure. Consequently, the vaccination could be performed with minimum medical resources or by less skilled personnel or even by self-immunization. This will facilitate mass immunization against SARS-CoV-2. However, the limitation of our vaccine platform is that multiple doses of immunization are required to obtain a breadth of immune responses. This can be improved by using an appropriate adjuvant.",

            "text": "In the present study, the mucoadhesive property of TMC was applied for the development of an intranasal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. RBD was used as an immunogen and was encapsidated within TMC NPs. This vaccine platform was able to stimulate not only mucosal immunity but also systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice upon intranasal immunization. The potential working mechanisms of RBD-TMC NPs in the induction of immune responses are proposed in Figure 7 . These promising results drive us to develop RBD-TMC NPs or spike-TMC NPs into a nasal spray for human vaccination. Upon entering into the respiratory tract, the cationic charges of TMC NPs facilitate the adhesion of NPs into the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. Nanoparticles may then promote delivery of RBD into nasal cell populations by enhancing the uptake of NPs by (1) microfold cells (M cells) or (2) nasal epithelial cells, or (3) by stimulating transient opening epithelial cell junctions in which RBD-TMC NPs will be directly exposed to the immune cells underneath the mucosal barrier. Mucosal epithelial cells may process and present antigens to the immature DCs, while the particles taken up by M cells will be transcytosed and exposed to immune cells underneath the mucosal layer. Upon stimulation, immature DCs differentiate and migrate to nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALTs), where they present the antigens to both na\u00efve and memory T cells, resulting in activation of the mucosal immune responses. In addition, DCs can migrate to draining lymph nodes, where stimulation of the systemic immune responses occurs. ",
