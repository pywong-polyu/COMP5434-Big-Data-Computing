Games controlled by electroencephalography (EEG), a specific case of BCI technology, benefit from both areas, since they can be played by virtually any person regardless of physical condition, can be applied in numerous serious and entertainment contexts, and are ludic by nature. However, they also share the same challenges of design and development from both fields, especially since they demand numerous specific and specialized knowledge for their development. In this sense, this work presents a model for games using EEG-based BCI controls. The proposed model is intended to help researchers describe, compare and develop new EEG-controlled games by instantiating its abstract and functional components using concepts from the fields of BCI and games. A group of EEG-controlled games from the literature was selected to demonstrate the usefulness and representativeness of the model. The demonstration showed that an overview classification and the details of the selected games were able to be described using the model and its components.",

From the perspective of games, the developer must also ensure the game flow, so that the player is immersed into the game, have fun playing it and desire to play it again, even if its purpose is not solely entertainment.

These axes represent information about when the BCI system is used (i.e., the temporal features of the BCI system, such as whether its commands are employed actively or passively by the user); for what it is used (its application and employed neural mechanism); how it is used (multi-modal aspects of the system); and where it is used (virtual, physical or mixed environments). The authors demonstrate their conceptual space by instantiating a set of BCI-based systems from the literature, and found that most systems are based on virtual environments, using eventrelated (de)synchronization as neural paradigm, and are synchronous (the user must wait for a trigger to use a BCI command).",

            "text": "The model itself is based on the classical closed-loop neurofeedback scheme for BCI-based systems (Fig. 2) . In this scheme, the BCI system is de-composed into six main steps representing its function: data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, feature classification/translation, application, and (neuro)feedback [31] . This scheme is largely seen in a number of primary works, in which the BCI system architecture is based or adapted from it (e.g., Hasan and Gan [7] , Koo et al. [10] , Lalor et al. [14] , and Tangermann et al. [25] ), and resembles other BCI-based models, such as the functional model of Mason and Birch [19] . In a general sense, the classic BCI system can be seen as a filter (or transducer), receiving and transforming an input signal (the EEG data from the user) into an output control signal (for the application to consume). The target application then feeds the results of this control signal back to the user, which in turn consciously or unconsciously alters his/her brain electro-chemical dynamics in response, and this change is then captured by the EEG acquisition device, composing the closed-loop architecture. Thus, the classic BCI closed-loop architecture scheme from Fig. 2 can be simplified into the following model: In the proposed model, based on the model presented in Fig. 3 and in the context of games, the target application is the game itself, being directly or indirectly controlled by the control signal provided by the BCI transducer. The model is derived by an even more simplified scheme (Fig. 4) , in which the game and the BCI transducer are seen as only one entity (based on principle p1 of the model): the EEG-controlled game, which receives an input from the player, and provides a feedback based on its current internal state. It is important to notice that, in this simplified scheme, the input is not restricted to an EEG signal, nor is the feedback restricted to a neurofeedback itself. The reason is that, in the context of games, the application can be controlled not only by the EEG signals, but by other forms of controls as well, such as physical ones (e.g., mouse, keyboard, joysticks and gamepads) or other physiological ones (e.g., heart rate, breathing rate and electrodermal activity) 1 . In the same context, the feedback provided by the game can not only represent the response to the EEG-based control, but it can also represent the changes in the game world (and in the objects contained in this world) that were caused both internally by game itself, and externally by the physical and/or physiological controls from the player(s).",

The control interface receives the input and translates it into control signals, which are employed as control mechanics in the game logic to alter the game world. This change in the game world reflects on the virtual interface, which presents its state to the player in the form of a feedback. This feedback can be visual, auditory or somatosensory (haptic/vibrotactile or thermal). Although the virtual feedback is always present, as it represents the game environment and the status of the game to the player (assuming that a player cannot play a game without knowing at least its status in a finite amount of time), the neurofeedback is optional, as the game can be played using a passive BCI (e.g., passively adjusting the game difficulty using the player's emotions), and thus no neurofeedback is explicitly provided. The sensory stimuli is another optional element which was introduced based on both principles p2 and p3 of the model, as specific control signals (e.g., SSVEP and P300) require an external stimulus to be generated and captured by the EEG acquisition device.",

In cases where there is no need for a classifier, in which the system translates the signal's extracted features directly to a continuous variable to be employed by the game (e.g., applying the theta/beta ratio to calculate the players' level of attention), the module transmits the processed feature translation directly to the game after the feature extraction step.

This could allow not only for a pre-defined list of classification values for such specific components, but also to a classification scheme based on these values, i.e., possibly a new taxonomy constructed upon the proposed model. This new taxonomy could separate these classification values in a more direct fashion, as opposed to the descriptive nature of the model's components, allowing for a more direct comparison of games from the literature.

The player(s) from Fig. 6 , for example, could be a component itself, representing the number of players and the target audience for the game. Although interesting, this approach was not employed in the current model as it is intended to represent EEG-controlled games, and the player is technically not a part of the game itself. However, although the model could be expanded to represent such details more precisely, it remains an open discussion whether the player should be considered a component of the model or an element that participates in its function.",
