Health practitioners face many challenges such as identify signs, diagnose the condition, and take decisions.

In current trends, AI is a rising innovation; it is close to the intellect of man. e human brain system illustrates the complex issues, but the lot of concerns increases the cost of solving that issue. AI is capable to concurrently quantify a range of issues and remedies. Many people just assume that AI is just about automation, but it is a computer that imitates human consciousness [4] .
