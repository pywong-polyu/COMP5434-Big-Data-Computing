The national internal market and territorial disparities favor the formation of subnational production networks within borders, thus increasing the potential effects of lockdown measures on regional integration production networks. Therefore, this study makes hypothetical simulations of COVID-19 mitigation policy decisions to understand the regional impacts on integration in supply chains, considering both domestic and global value chains. The generalized hypothetical extraction method is applied to a Brazilian interregional input-output model with 68 industries and 27 regions, imputing partial removals on intermediate consumption and final demand. The results suggest that richer subnational areas, mainly S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, are proportionally more impacted by COVID-19 trade shocks. However, the poorer peripheries are doubly affected, either by the foreign shock, which would damage their economic structure, or by the retraction of the subnational demand from core states. The findings highlight that economic shocks are spatially distributed through different industrial structures, thus",

Our objective is not to quantify the real changes in the regional gross domestic product (GDP) 1 but to identify the potential losses associated with the productive regional structure within Brazil. This paper is organized into five sections as follows. The next section presents the related literature.

However, systemic mitigation responses are not within the scope of our application. Notably, our empirical findings intend to identify the potential economic losses associated with the productive regional structure, but do not intend to quantify the real changes in regional GDP due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An analysis of that nature would require information on the results of changes in production and the demand-supply dynamics of companies and their relationship with foreign companies.

Particularly, the application enables us to analyze the relative importance of a region and its set of economic activities, which are fundamentally dependent on the existing linkages with the rest of the economy, thus providing relevant insights regarding the systemic impact in regional and industry-level terms (Haddad, Perobelli, Ara\u00fajo, & Bugarin, 2020) .

Notwithstanding being a relevant limitation of the analytical scope, the effects across production networks are easily captured in an IO general equilibrium. Thus, to avoid overestimations, relative changes in HH (\u0394y u\u00bcHH n ) for each region n are based on the relative variation of the following regional level data: (1) the difference in the expected wage level for the first half of 2020, calculated as a linear projection based on the wage levels of the same period between 2012 and 2019, with data from the four-monthly National Continuous Household Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Amostra Domiciliar; PNAD) compatibilized with regional and sectoral setting in IRIO table; and (2) the average change in intermediate consumption given by the matrix f a for the region of origin (note that f a is a column matrix with the average of the A matrix rows) (Giammetti et al., 2020) . The wage bill data of the first four mounts of 2020 for aggregated industries from the PNAD survey are used, as shown in Figure 2 . Concerning simulated HH shocks, it is important to clarify two relevant aspects. First, PNADC data are aggregated at the industry and national level, implying a limitation of the nature of industry-specific final demand variations. Second, PNADC sectoral aggregation has fewer sectors than the SCN, implying that the regional and subsectoral breakdown took into account the official data from the Annual Social Information Report (RAIS) of the Ministry of Economy, which considers the SCN structure. 4 Furthermore, regional structural differences are considered in the IRIO table.",

At the subnational level, the degree of concentration (and diversification) of industries in space is a relevant component for understanding the changes induced by exogenous shocks on the IRIO system.

Figure 4 shows the relationship between the values of \u03b1 and LVA, considering the entire economy. The sectors are affected by different magnitudes and are not always accompanied by different values of \u03b1. It is evident that the primary industries, such as agriculture and livestock, are highly dependent on demand from other more advanced sectors in the production chain, with the potential to be affected by both changes in DVCs and GVCs. However, in the short term, the potential for relative losses is not so high, given the lower sectorial capacity to incorporate value into production and because they have relatively high values of \u03b1 (0.9 for agriculture and livestock, and 0.8 for forest production industry), which is related to the low risk of exposure of workers in these sectors to COVID-19.",

The spatial extent of the pandemic lockdown measures is driven by trading patterns, revealing the relevant mechanisms whereby regional growth can be disturbed by removing IO linkages.

Figure 8 shows the relative interregional losses on the outflow side of the DVC inflows (interregional VA entries). Values below 1 indicate that the losses on the outflow side exceed those on the inflow side, while values above 1 indicate the opposite relationship. 7 A core-periphery pattern of the subnational supply chain is identified because poorer states have higher inflow losses than outflow losses. In these cases, changes in the productive structure imposed by the industry-level partial constraints force the peripheral regions to amplify their role of supplying inputs to the core areas within the country (Imori, 2015; Perobelli et al., 2019) . The position of Amazonas State, where the main manufacturing center Manaus Free Zone is located, is noteworthy. The state's productive dependence on interregional demand induces considerable losses on the outflow side than that of the inflow (Azzoni & Haddad, 2018; Perobelli & Haddad, 2006) . The wealthiest states, which have more complex regional systems and greater interregional linkage networks, also show higher present losses on the outflow side than the inflow side, such as Amazonas, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Distrito Federal. Regions specialized in the primary or agro-export sectors, such as Mato Grosso, Par a, and Maranh\u00e3o, tend to lose interregional ties on the side of value-added sales incorporated into the trade.",

Economic concentration implies that the Brazilian core coordinates the consolidation of domestic productive chains (Atienza, Lufin, & Soto, 2018; Iammarino & McCann, 2013) . One of the main implications of this pattern is that the national economic crisis caused by the pandemic is strongly linked to how the most prosperous regions tend to be potentially affected. Thus, peripheral states have double dependence across interregional networks. On the one hand, they depend on the economic dynamics of the central areas to be able to provide goods and services, while on the other hand, they depend on international demand. Nonetheless, when the central areas are impacted more severely, the effects on production networks tend to damage local production systems in response to a break in the business cycle that spills over to regional economies (Cuadrado-Roura & Maroto, 2016) . The main local capacities associated with regional assets, industrial structures, and a leading role in interregional relations are in the Brazilian core.",

Structural path analysis based on the hypothetical partial removals from Brazil's interregional IO system is considered, and bilateral TiVA By imposing industry-level intermediate consumption and final demand reductions, we establish two main regional impact conclusions. First, most of the GDP losses are concentrated in rich states (mainly S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) because of the diversified structure and the greatest presence of economic output related to the highest COVID-19 contamination risk industries, which considerably impact the aggregate value-added traded through multiscalar value chains. Second, regions specialized in natural resourcesmost of the northern and midwestern statesare twofold more exposed to a constraint scenario, both for restrictions on interregional demand and international demand for exports, implying considerable losses for local economic activities. These results reveal the fragility of peripheral resource-based regions to market shocks. As we have demonstrated, structural patterns impose an interplay between interregional supply and demand, concentrated in large urban centers, and the propagation of losses on TiVA. There is an economic loss in value chain flows, exposing poor regions to external demand for both DVCs and GVCs, thereby potentially reducing their capacity to generate intraregional demand.",

Moreover, as lockdown measures vary over time, understanding the consequences of contingency fluctuations, including the time effect and opening up space for the design of other methods, can be essential. Suggestions for future research include applying IO inoperative models capable of predicting spillover on the whole system (Dietzenbacher & Miller, 2015; Sugrue et al., 2021) . Additionally, it is possible to assume the temporal behavior on the Leontief production function, being able to capture time-specific impact measurements . As an extension of IO models, the application of computable general equilibrium models is increasing to impose dynamic simultaneous shocks in different markets, including labor, trade, environmental, etc. (Evans et al., 2014; Porsse et al., 2020) .

Consequently, the decrease in intermediate and final deliveries sold by each industry and region alters the coefficients. This implies changes in the TiVA across networks according to the new general equilibrium. Meanwhile, instead of assuming that the subnational region n = 1 does not trade with region n (as in the traditional HEM technique), the intermediate consumption and final demand are considered to be partially changed by \u03b1, as shown in Equation 1. Subsequently, we apply the GHEM to determine the extent to which the subnational value-added traded inside the country changes as the difference in the amount of value-added in the baseline and counterfactual COVID-19 scenario. The difference between Equations 5 and 3 results in bilateral TiVA between subnational regions 1 and n as a result of the value-added decomposition",
