However, the rapid-fire development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) makes the identification of digital literacies and the development of curriculum and instruction a moving target. In her Literacy Research Association Presidential Address, Dr. Betsy Baker asserts that digital literacies are no longer an entity separate from reading and writing instruction, they are no longer a technology issue, students live in a digital world, and digital literacies are not optional. Digital literacies have become the literacies of our culture. Baker synthesizes over 25 years of research to propose that digital literacies are persistently public, semiotic, product-oriented, and transitory. Researchers, educational leaders, and teachers can leverage these characteristics as footholds to identify ever-changing digital literacies, design curricula, and provide instruction so that all students can be autonomous as they seek to thrive in a digital world. Dr. Baker's Presidential Address is available online (see https://youtu.be/Avzup21ZnA4).",

Some schools provided worksheet packets for students to complete, some provided video conferencing between teachers and students, and some moved components of their curriculum to virtual learning. During the fall of 2020, we saw more of the same. The digital divide became more obvious as students who lacked opportunities to secure worksheet packets, join video conferences, or go online were declined access. Little is known about whether those who had online access also had the requisite digital literacies to engage in meaningful learning. I wondered whether schools were prepared and whether they had access to research that would support their efforts to prepare students for reading and writing digital texts. I speculated that digital literacies were foundational, even prerequisites, to online learning. I wondered if literacy researchers could provide answers to the daunting challenges encountered when schools were thrust online.",

I found 3 million matches. I thought this was pretty good, but I was unsure what it told me. So, I refined my search by using Google Scholar. I limited my search parameters to the years since Leu's Presidential Address, 2005 , and set the source parameters to journals. According to Google Scholar, in the past 15 years, 577,000 journal articles have been published. Next, I limited the search to \"digital literacies\" and found that .5% of these journal articles included the term, \"digital literacies.\" To be honest, I am not sure what this tells me either. I am not sure if the literacy research community is getting the job done or not. I do know that when faced with a pandemic, Leu's questions resounded in my ears. I wondered: Can literacy researchers do more to support schools and prepare all students to be proficient readers and writers of digital texts? I wonder if one roadblock is the perception that students know how to use digital forms of information and communication technologies (ICTs) better than the adults in the room. I often hear and repeat the following sentiment, \"If you don't know how to use [insert technology], ask a child or a teenager.\" Evidence suggests, however, that students are proficient with the few technologies they and their friends usebut may lack a full spectrum of other capabilities (e.g., Auxier & Anderson, 2021; Vogels & Anderson, 2019) . We cannot assume that they acquire or develop a robust range of digital literacies. To ignore a full complement of digital literacies in literacy research and schools is comparable to assuming children will develop alphabetic literacies and have no need for reading or writing instruction.",

If I got permission to read it, I read it. Otherwise I did not read their journals. These children [using computers], when they do journal writing, it is more for a reader-somebody else to read it. It is putting our thoughts down on paper, expressing ourselves, but you know . . . you are going to have an audience . . . I definitely think that they walk around and read each other's screens. (Baker, 1995, pp. 114-115) In this interview, Ms. Jones highlighted the notion that not only was literacy public but that this publicness altered what students wrote. The second graders who wrote on paper had their privacy protected. The fourth graders who composed on computers could see one another's screens from where they sat. On one hand, students learned from each other when walking by and reading each other's screens.

Fast forward 20 years: Working with a team of researchers, we parsed the literature to consider whether the public nature of literacy in our digital culture remained a viable construct (see Baker et al., 2015) . To pull this thread through time, let me first consider where we were as a digital culture in the 1990s (see Roser et al., 2015) . User data increase followed suit. It is estimated that in 1990, half of 1% of the world population was online (Roser et al., 2015) . By 2016, approximately 3.4 billion or 46% of the world's population had used the internet in the previous 3 months. In 2016, the U.S. ranking for percent of the population that had used the internet within 3 months was tied with Lebanon and the Czech Republic as 33rd in the world with 76% of the population online. By 2021, 93% of U.S. adults reported using the internet (Perrin & Atske, 2021) . It is estimated that between 2010 and 2016, on average, each day 640,000 people went online for the first time which equated to 27,000 new users each hour (Roser et al., 2015) . As of 2020, I am going to guess that on any given day, it is likely that you will pick up a digital device to communicate or find information. Clare Hardy posted her first tweet at about 8:30 p.m. Within a few seconds, someone reads Clare's post. Over the next couple of hours, Clare Hardy's tweet is picked up by others and extends even beyond the broadcast viewing time. So far, the public nature of literacy is evident by noting Clare's ability to post to Twitter and her post is read by several people. But I want to push the public nature of digital literacies a bit further. Roy takes a random sample of 1% of the TV viewing audience and traces their Tweets. Roy describes a virtual tsunami of shared experiences between the TV viewing audience and Twitter users (see Figure 1 ).",

Let me push the public nature of digital literacies even further. Roy (2014) describes Andrew Kitzenberg's experience: One evening, while watching the local news, Andrew looked out his window and realized he was witnessing the manhunt that ensued after the Boston Marathon bombing. Andrew took to Twitter to describe what he saw out his window. His Tweets were picked up and he became part of live television. Roy describes how the TV audience, became Twitter authors, who became TV participants. He describes the author/audience transaction between TV and Twitter as percolation of communication (see Figure 2 ).",

Anyone living in a country that allows open access to the internet can post to social media, give online ratings, as well as find and create collective intelligence. On the other hand, search engine algorithms arguably monopolize what we find online. At the click of a button, your site, your posts, your collaborations, your collections can be made impossible to find or even removed. Greenwald (2014) points out that simultaneously, online communication and information are democratized and monopolized by stating, \"We are nearing the point where an idea banished by Twitter, Facebook, and Google all but vanishes from public discourse entirely\" (para. 12). Such possibilities require in-depth literacy research and adroit pedagogy. Given evidence that literacy is and continues to be inherently public, there is a clarion call for ongoing research to examine corresponding implications to prepare all learners to proficiently read and write in our digital world.",

Definitions of literacy continued to expand. In 1994, Rowe leveraged semiotics to position preschoolers' scribblings as meaning-filled written expressions thus laying the groundwork for literacy scholars to embrace multimodal texts (see also Clark, 1990; Leland & Harste, 1994; Short & Kauffman, 2000) .

Among others, they featured biographies of Susan B. Anthony, Peter the Great, da Vinci, Mozart, Darwin, and Gandhi. They concluded this series by identifying Gutenberg as the most influential person of the second millennium. They argued that the ability to mass produce and distribute the written word transformed the world. Some say that we are experiencing a Gutenbergian Revolution (Patton Howell, 1990; Wheeler, 2019) . Digital texts-with the ability to encode and share alphabetic, linguistic, visual, auditory, gestural, and spatial expressions beg the question: What is literacy in our digital culture? Are literacy teachers now expected to help students develop not only alphabetic reading and writing skills but also help students proficiently communicate with digital texts that incorporate visual, auditory, spatial, and embodied sign systems? Should literacy teachers be teaching art, music, theater, and video production? Should there be a hierarchy of sign systems where we target alphabetic texts in the early grades and other sign systems in later grades? Should all sign systems, and the orchestration of all sign systems, be part of the literacy curricula K-12? I am intrigued by varied notions of time and space as they relate to literacy (e.g., Baker, 2010; Bakhtin, 1981; Compton-Lilly & Halverson, 2014; Leander & McKim, 2003) . Time travel captivates the imagination. From H.G. Wells' (1895) classic, The Time Machine, to the successful franchise, Back to the Future, our culture has been riveted by time travel. For decades, even centuries, humankind has searched for a time machine. I have seen proclamations that the time machine has been invented; it is called reading and writing (e.g., Dickinson, n.d.) . Given a time/space perspective, it can be argued that alphabetic text defies time and space. We can read the words of Socrates, Tertullian, and Confucius without living in ancient Greece, Africa, or China. When children proficiently read and write alphabetic text, they can travel through time and space.",

I highlight this audio sample to demonstrate how the ethereal, the oral word in this case, can become a product and travel through time and space for us to listen to today.

Twenty years later, my research team examined whether this construct persisted (Baker et al., 2015) . We considered Wikipedia. The basic notion is that a worldwide set of editors can generate a broader storehouse of human knowledge that is continually updated than any central organization such as World Book, Funk and Wagnall, or Encyclopedia Britannica could possibly generate. Of course, the primary feature of wikis is that approved contributors can edit the same document. The same is true of Google Docs. In other words, unlike nondigital products, digital products can be transitory. They may change. The website that I visit today may have been updated, altered, and have different content tomorrow.",

If the nature of literacy in our digital culture continues and even becomes increasingly public, semiotic, product-oriented, and transitory (PSPT), then we might have some footholds to formulate research and support schools. For example, in our digital world, What do students need to know about audience-solicited and unsolicited? What do they need to know about compositions that can go viral for good and bad reasons? What strategies can they use to remain safe while creating collaborative online communities that promote dialog and reject bullying? How can students become savvy readers who readily identify misinformation and disinformation? How can students leverage the written word, video, music, sound effects, voice-overs, illustrations, photographs, graphs, data vis, and more, to wax eloquent and convey their insights to a worldwide or singular audience? What do students need to join or even invent the collective that heretofore was nonexistent? What is needed for students to ride the time machine that is increasingly digital? How can they create digital products that traverse time and space in ways that were previously unattainable?",

I underscore the ILA bi-annual survey of hot topics which in International Literacy Association 2018b found the #1 topic was digital literacies. While I do not claim that the PSPT characteristics I have described today are the only characteristics or footholds that might capture the essence of literacies in a digital world, I propose that those who harness the potential while mitigating the challenges of digital literacies are poised to thrive in our culture.

The book became a movie which became a trailer that was posted online. To appear here, the product traversed time and space.
