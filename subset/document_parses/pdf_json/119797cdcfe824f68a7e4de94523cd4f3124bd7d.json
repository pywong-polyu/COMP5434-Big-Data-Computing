A comprehensive description of the study methodology and patient characteristics has been recently published. 23 Setting Study participants were all insurees of the Clalit Health Services, the largest HMO in Israel, which provides mandatory comprehensive health coverage to all citizens. PMV care in Jerusalem is provided either in a single specialized LTAC (Chronic Ventilator-Dependent Division, Herzog Medical Center, Jerusalem), or at home, cared for by the Jerusalem Home Hospital. 24e28 The decision concerning site of care depends on the patient's and/or custodian's agreement, sufficient informal/formal home care, and medical condition. At the time of the study, there were 120 beds in the LTAC available for adult PMV patients, of which 76 beds were occupied by PMV patients of the Clalit Health Fund. During the study period, there were 47 adult PMV patients cared for at home by the Jerusalem Home Hospital. Both settings provide comprehensive multidisciplinary team, with 24/7 on-call medical and respiratory backup at home, and on-site medical, nursing, and respiratory care in LTAC. 23 ",

Progressive neuromuscular diseases, chronic lung disease and chronic critical illness where the most common causes for PMV, and participants were typically highly functionally dependent, ventilated >18 hours daily, with a mean duration of PMV of around 3 years. Few participants reported moderate or severe distress across a wide range of symptoms, both physical (nausea, poor appetite, shortness of breath, drowsiness, tiredness, and pain) and emotional (depression and anxiety), whereas the global measure of general well-being was reported as either normal or mild impairment among 45%, moderately impaired among 40%, and severely impaired among 15% of participants. Half of those cared for at home reported their overall well-being as normal or only mildly impaired, compared with only a quarter of LTAC, and, similarly, depression was significantly less common at home vs LTAC (34% vs 44%). Whereas advance directives were completely lacking prior to initiation of ventilation, an interesting finding to emerge was the observation that if faced again with the decision to choose PMV, then 85% of patients would opt for PMV. Research into the health-related quality of life among patients receiving PMV has commonly focused on patients treated with noninvasive ventilation, with assessment based on either single-item questions or tools such as the EQ-5D (EuroQol-5 Dimensions) 35 or more recently the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency questionnaire. 36 This 49-item test has typically been used among patients with advanced lung disease, as well as those treated with noninvasive ventilation, 37 and evaluates the impact of respiratory insufficiency on several aspects of health-related quality of life including respiratory complaints, physical function, attendant symptoms, social The r-ESAS consists of 10 items, each graded 0-10, with 0 \u00bc no symptoms and 10 \u00bc maximum distress.

Findings have varied considerably depending on the patient population, with more severe symptoms described among older patients with chronic lung disease as compared to younger patient population with progressive neuromuscular disease. The r-ESAS scale used in the present study has been widely used in both clinical practice and research for more than 25 years and repeatedly shown to be a robust and validated tool in the measurement of patient-reported outcome measures. 33 Originally designed to assess the palliative needs of oncology patients, it has seen widespread use among numerous other patient groups, including, for example, nephrology, cardiac, hepatic diseases, multiple chronic comorbidities, and pulmonary diseases, 33, 38 in both inpatient and outpatient ambulatory and home care settings. Extensive research and comparative studies have validated meaningful cutoff points to define asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe symptomatology, and which we used in this study. 32, 39, 40 Accordingly, a score greater than !7/10 on any individual subitem has been defined by some researchers as a high symptom burden, and suggested to serve as a \"trigger\" in clinical practice to highlight the need for reassessment of palliative care needs. Our data help quantify the severe distress experienced by PMV patients in the study sample, among whom severe (!7/10) anxiety, drowsiness, tiredness, and impaired well-being were reported by 16%, 12%, 27%, and 15%, with the remaining symptoms reported as severe by 10% of patients. Similarly, frequency of depression was 38%, which is considerably higher than the estimates of 20% baseline rate among the local Jerusalem population aged 70 years 41 and 25% among a national sample aged !65 years. 42 Indeed, the depression rates of our sample are similar to residents of long-term care facilities. 43 A prerequisite first step toward relieving this distress is the need to increase awareness among health care workers and provide skills to proactively identify distressing symptoms shown here to affect PMV patients.",

A similar finding was also reported in a study of 32 invasive PMV patients treated either at home or nursing facility, among whom the reported health-related quality of life ranged from very good (primarily among the 14 neuromuscular disease patients) to poor (among older chronic lung disease) irrespective of place. 18 Interestingly, the only significant association to emerge from several multivariate analysis of our data was the association between chronic lung disease and an increase in the total r-ESAS score, mediated by the r-ESAS subitem of increased severity of the shortness of breath. Among the few studies that have addressed this point, this would appear to be a recurrent finding for both invasive and noninvasive PMV patients. 18, 19 Qualitative research into the impact of invasive PMV among young men with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in Denmark, 20 and patients aged between 18 and 75 years with various neuromuscular diseases from Norway 21 emphasized the recurrent themes of \"empowerment\" and the \"positive contribution to a purposeful meaningful life\" expressed by patients. Of note, in answer to one of the items in the short GDS, 80% of the patients in our study answered that \"overall they were satisfied with their life,\" which is in accordance with the assessment of overall well-being among the patients in our study. The positive perspective on overall health and well-being has also been noted in several studies of home PMV patients, 22 and although it may reflect high quality of care, it highlights the dissonance between good subjective patient-reported outcomes, on the one hand, and their extremely complex medical needs, functional impairment, and high technological dependence, on the other.",

It is noteworthy that many study participants suffered from progressive diseases for which respiratory failure was a foreseeable event, often a long time in advance. Nonetheless, all but 1 study participant were without advance directives at the time of intubation. The observation that 85% of our study participants would, if necessary, again choose ventilation, is in keeping with the few studies that have also addressed this sensitive issue. Despite different patient populations, different place of care, and different treatment models, the percentages of patients stating they would again choose ventilation were similar: 84.7% among 315 PMV patients in LTAC in the United States (of whom 54% were successfully weaned at 1 year, and the total 1-year survival rate was 66.9%); 44 90% among 77 patients with both lung and neuromuscular diseases treated with home PMV via tracheostomy in Italy, median survival 49 months; 45 85% of 19 patients with neuromuscular diseases treated at home in the United States, median survival 54 months; 46 8/14 (57.1%) of COPD patients and 9/11 (81.8%) of progressive neuromuscular disease patients with invasive PMV at home in the United States. 19 The consistency of this finding attests to its validity and affirms that the findings of our study are reproducible and thus representative of other similar patient populations. Similarly, comparisons of data describing similar patient populations from other countries, treated either in long-term care or at home, suggest that our findings can be extrapolated to other populations of PMV patients. 9, 11, 12, 16, 44 Recent work 5 that aimed to introduce algorithms to aid the informed decision-making process concerning PMV have largely failed to change the pattern of decisions, and a frequent finding to emerge has been the \"overoptimistic\" outlook of the health proxy.",
