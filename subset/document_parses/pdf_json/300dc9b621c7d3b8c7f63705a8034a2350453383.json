[1] [2] [3] Current literature identifies multiple risks and complications associated with mechanical ventilation, including frequent failure to tolerate early extubation. 4, 5 Reasons for extubation failure include: upper airway instability, poor respiratory drive, chest wall compliance, alveolar atelectasis, anemia, and ventilation lung damage. [6] [7] [8] Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), with the early application of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), decreases the rate of CLD when compared with institutions where NIV has not been commonly instituted. 4, 9 CPAP can be delivered using two types of CPAP generators-variable flow and continuous flow systems. Bubble CPAP (bCPAP) has been reported as a safe and cost-effective method for delivering CPAP, both as primary therapy, and as support for the newly extubated preterm infant. [10] [11] [12] bCPAP utilizes blended gas that is heated and humidified and then delivered through a low-resistance nasal prong. The distal end of the expiratory tubing is submerged underwater; the depth of submersion determines the CPAP pressure generated. 13, 14 bCPAP was first shown to reduce the need for supplemental oxygen at 28 days of life in an observational study conducted by Avery et al. 15 Because of that landmark study, the guidelines for the use of bCPAP have evolved, including recommendations for its use with low birth weight infants. 16 More recently, empirical studies have shown that the functional nature of bCPAP decreases the work of breathing, the incidence of intubation, and the need for medication. 17, 18 Some randomized trials have compared ventilator-derived nasal CPAP with bCPAP in treatment of Abstract Introduction: Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) is associated with a decreased risk for chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm neonates. This report examined the effectiveness of adopting bCPAP to reduce respiratory complications and medication usage in a community hospital NICU. Methods: The efficacy of bCPAP was assessed by retrospective examination and comparison of 45 neonates who received bCPAP and 87 neonates who received conventional ventilation only. Data on medication usage were also collected and analyzed. Results: After introduction of the bCPAP protocol, the median number of days on oxygen decreased in the bCPAP group compared with the conventional ventilation only group (median = 33 days, IQR = 7.5-66 vs median = 0, IQR = 0-0; P < 0.001). The exposure to conventional ventilation decreased in the bCPAP group compared with the conventional ventilation only group (median = 18 days, IQR = 5-42.5 vs median = 0, IQR = 0-7; P < 0.001). Postimplementation of bCPAP revealed decreases in CLD from 26 (30%) in the conventional ventilation only group to 2 (4%) in the bCPAP group (P = 0.002); there was also a significant decrease in the use of sedative medications in the bCPAP group compared with the conventional ventilation only group (mean = 5.20 doses, SD = 31.97 vs mean = 1.43, SD = 9.98; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The use of bCPAP results in significant decreases in the use of conventional ventilation, the risk for CLD, and the need for sedative medication.
