For people infected with HIV, AIDS is a stage when the level of their CD4 + T lymphocytes falls below acritical, for example 200 cells/\u03bcL (Cheng et al. 2009 ). By 2018, it was estimated that the global number of people living with HIV was~37.9 million and more than two-thirds of them reside in developing countries (World Health Organization 2019; Vos et al. 2016 ). There are common methods for HIV detection based on different principles Chen et al. 2016) . Using an immunoassay, HIV can be diagnosed by detecting anti-HIV antibody or HIV viral antigen. Based on molecular analysis, HIV can be diagnosed by detecting viral nucleic acids. Because HIV molecular diagnostic viral testing needs complicated sample processing for nucleic acid extraction and elaborate nucleic acid amplification, it is difficult to perform molecular diagnosis in developing countries where medical infrastructural facilities are lacking (Zhao et al. 2019) .",

Various types of lateral flow strips have been developed for HIV immunoassays (Paredes et al. 2006) . For example, anti-HIV antibody is can be detected in serum samples using lateral flow strips (Faulstich et al. 2007 ). In principle, the detection result can be observed by eyes when the gold colloid reporter lateral flow strips are used. To avoid the interference from red blood cells, the raw whole blood sample needs to be centrifuged to obtain the cell-free serum sample. Alternatively, an additional filtration pad adjacent to the sample pad can be incorporated into the lateral flow strip to block the red blood cell in lateral flow assay. HIV saliva tests can also be performed with lateral flow strip (Delaney et al. 2006 ). Compared to HIV blood testing, HIV detection can be implemented much more conveniently with saliva samples. To improve detection sensitivity, up-converting phosphor (UCP) reporter particles have been used to label the HIV antibody and avoid interfering background ). In this case, a companion optical reader is required to perform HIV saliva test with lateral flow strip when fluorescence labeling is adopted, which may partly limit its application field.",

            "text": "Urine testing is a routine examination in vitro-diagnosis. In fact, because of the superiority with noninvasive collection of samples, urinalysis is becoming a competitive format in POC diagnosis as more diagnostic biomarkers are identified in urine (Mahoney et al. 2020; Hart et al. 2011 ). For example, as an emerging application of urine analysis, in situ monitoring of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is able to provide systematical information of the body status with continuous multi-parameter measurements of urine in a home setting for POC testing (Taramasco et al. 2018 ). Traditionally, urinalysis is able to provide not only valuable clinical information for diagnosis of various urologic and renal diseases, but also evidence in asymptomatic patients, for example, with sexually transmitted infections (STI's) (Fogazzi and Perazella 2010) . In POC diagnosis, widely used urinalysis devices include dip strips or sticks for pregnancy testing, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and urine test strips for other types of analytes of urine samples, for example, Specific Gravity, Creatinine, Glucose, Ions, Ketones, Lactate, Nitrite, pH, Protein, and Uric Acid (Kingston et al. 2003; Suresh et al. 2018) . For high throughput detection, DNA microarrays can be used for simultaneous detection of different DNA markers in urine (Gaber et al. 2017) . To avoid the inconvenience with urine sample storage and transportation, POC diagnosis devices, which can be easily implemented at the clinic or even at home, are highly desired in urine testing. With simple, convenient and easyto-handle operation, POC urinalysis devices developed based on microfluidic or lab-on-chip technology are able to detect infectious diseases or monitor chronic diseases with only modest resources (Lepowsky et al. 2017; Jalal et al. 2017 ). Compared to blood testing requiring comparatively large sample volumes, POC microfluidics-based urine testing is quite promising and attractive for home use on account of the noninvasive nature of urine sample collection (Lin et al. 2011) .",

In this article, we describe a microfluidic immunoassay cassette with a companion handheld optical reader for HIV test based on urine sample analysis. Based on a recently developed gold colloid lateral flow strip available for HIV urine testing, a disposable immunoassay cassette is developed to perform self-assisted urine metering, discharging, applying and detection. A low-cost handheld optical reader is developed to detect the test result from the cassette. Once the raw, undiluted urine sample is loaded into the cassette, lateral flow immunoassay can be easily performed by the untrained operators themselves. Excess sample will be retained inside the cassette to prevent any environmental contamination. The affordable handheld optical reader with a total component cost of seventy dollars improves the detection sensitivity, and logs, displays and transmits the test result if necessary. The performance of both the cassette and the handheld optical reader is systematically evaluated. Experimental results show that successful HIV urine testing can be conveniently performed in POC settings with the test reported here.",

For each test, the applied volume of urine sample is~80 \u03bcL. Similar to existing lateral flow strips (Qian and Bau 2004) , as shown in Fig. 1a , the HIV urine test strip (60 mm \u00d7 4 mm) is comprised of a backing, sample pad, conjugate pad, nitrocellulose membrane, and absorbent pad. On the conjugate pad, staphylococcal protein A (SPA) conjugated to gold colloid nanoparticles is stored in dry form after diluted in a blocking reagent with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Witnessing the fact of low concentration of biomarkers with urine sample, instead of using the sandwiched immunoassay which normally adopted in HIV blood testing, indirect immunoassay is adopted in HIV urine testing to ensure the detection sensitivity by capturing HIV antibody from urine sample through SPA. Moreover, to improve the detection sensitivity, large sample volume, e.g., 80 \u03bcL is adopted in HIV urine testing. In the test line area of the nitrocellulose membrane, HIV antigens are immobilized to form the capture line. In the control line area, the second antibodies are immobilized to form the verification line.",

At most 15 min later, the result becomes readable by observing the test or control line with red color. As shown in Fig. 1b , in a predefined sequence based on indirect immunoassay, first the HIV antibodies in the test urine sample bind to the gold colloid particles stored on the conjugate pad through SPA, and then they move together along the strip until captured by the test line based on the specific immune bioreactivity between the immobilized HIV antigens and the detected antibodies. Finally, the remaining unbound free gold colloid particles are captured by the control line area for assay verification through the binding reaction between SPA and the second antibody. The lateral flow strip recently developed by Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co (Beijing, China) for HIV urine testing has been evaluated thoroughly and systematically using a large sample bank for clinical trials. It has demonstrated 98.4% of accuracy with the HIV positive subjects without antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 100% specificity with HIV negative subjects (Beijing Wantai 2019). Compared to HIV blood testing, as a noninvasive detection method, HIV urine testing can be performed more easily and conveniently, which is suitable for self-test in POC settings. It is well known that HIV saliva test is a commercialized noninvasive detection method. Compared to HIV salvia testing, HIV urine testing can be performed with relatively simpler procedure for sample collection and pre-treatment. However, the unfriendly smell from the urine sample could be one of the disadvantages with HIV urine testing. Nevertheless, similar to HIV saliva test, HIV urine testing provides another choice for noninvasive HIV POC test.",

As shown in Fig. 2a , the urine sample from a normal container can be directly added into the sample introduction module through the loading port. An accessory tape layer on top is used to seal the loading port after sample loading, which reduce the risk of environmental contamination. The sample metering module consists of a 30 mm \u00d7 40 mm \u00d7 8 mm PMMA storage chamber with a vent hole on top. As shown in Fig. 2a , in the center of the storage chamber, there has an independent metering chamber with a size of~80 \u03bcL. Meanwhile, the space around the metering chamber in the storage chamber is used as the overflow chamber to hold the excess urine sample. An absorbent paper layer (Nanjing Huiyuechi Electronic Technology Company Ltd.) is deposited into the overflow chamber to not only absorb any excess urine sample, but also to work as an indicator for sample loading since its color will obviously change from white to red on contact with urine. Opposite to the metering chamber, an extruded connection head is fabricated on the bottom of the sample loading chamber to allow urine sample to smoothly enter into the metering chamber. The metering chamber also has an extruded head to establish a flow path to the lateral flow strip once the device is fully assembled. Initially, the bottom of the extruded head is sealed with a thin 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm paper layer (Shenzhen Siweituoda Technology Company Ltd.). The specific thin paper layer, which is made from stretched polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with average pore sizes from 0.1 to 1.5 \u03bcm, has an average pore density larger than 80%. The specific thin paper layer is able to hold the urine sample inside the metering chamber while allowing air to pass through. The detection module consists of a lateral flow strip, a strip holder, and a sharp needle partly penetrating into the strip from the sample pad. To simplify the process of fabrication, different parts of the cassette were all cut with a laser machine (HTC-0906-W80, Jinan Hantong Digital Control Device Enterprise Co. Ltd., Jinan), and then laminated with the double-sided tape (Type #9731, 3 M). To reduce the complexity of cassette fabrication and binding, before laser cutting, the PMMA sheet was first laminated with the double-sided tape from one side to allow both of them to be cut simultaneously, which was helpful to improve the binding performance.",

For safety, two doublesided tape layers on both sides are used to combine and fix three modules together after assembling (as shown in Fig. 2a ). During assembly, the bottom needle (as shown in Fig. 2a ) sitting on the detection module will penetrate through the thin paper layer under the sample metering chamber, which allows the urine sample to be continually imbibed by the sample pad of the lateral flow strip for immunoassay.

In principle, with the handheld optical reader, more sensitive, accurate and consistent test result can be achieved compared to typical eye observation which can be affected by a couple of issues. As shown in Fig. 3a , a small-size CMOS camera module (openmv3 cam m7, OpenMV, LLC) equipped with an optical lens was used to collect image from the lateral flow strip when it was illuminated by a back light module from the top. Since the gold nanoparticles have a peak wavelength of absorbing light around 525 nm, green light from the back light module consisting of green LEDs (wavelength: 510-525 nm) was adopted to illuminate the lateral flow strip from top to improve the detection sensitivity. A circuit module consisting of a single-chip microcontroller (N76E003AT20, Nuvoton Technology Corporation) was used to control the camera module to collect and analyze image, and then the test result was sent to the LCD module for display. A Bluetooth module was connected to the single-chip microcontroller for data transmission. To reduce system power-consumption, instead of using an advanced camera, a compact camera module relying on a micro-controller based on ARM7 (STM32F407, STMicroelectronics) was adopted, which was able to perform image processing with a built-in function library based on Micro Python after image collection. Especially, for the image collection and processing module, a micro-controller with significantly low power consumption was adopted, which was critical to reduce the system total power consumption. The system currents for idle and working states are 160 mA and 90 mA, respectively. Powered by two 1.5 V batteries, the device is able to continually work up to 4 h. Figure 3c , d, respectively, depict the optical reader with a partly-and fully-inserted immunoassay cassettes. For the HIV urine test, once the urine sample is applied onto the lateral flow strip, the test result becomes detectable after 15 min. With the companion hand-hold optical reader, rapid, on-site, HIV urine testing with lateral flow immunoassay can be conveniently performed at home or in other POC settings. The total cost of components of the hand-hold optical reader is around seventy dollars, which is beneficial to POC diagnosis.",

As shown in the insert of Fig. 6 , a specific number (#) is assigned to each lateral flow strip based on a customized rule to represent the signal intensity of the test line. From #2 to #10, they respectively correspond to low-positive to high-positive. For the described handheld optical reader, low-positive detection close to #3 is the acceptable limit of detection. In fact, it is difficult for a person to locate the test line from the background for #3 low-positive detection just by eyes. Therefore, compared to traditional eye observation, the handheld optical reader is helpful to improve the detection sensitivity of HIV urine test with lateral flow strip. As shown in Fig. 6 , for both cases, instead of #2, #3 lateral flow strip with low-positive can be successfully detected. Compared to white LEDs, significantly higher signal reading with the test line can be achieved with green LEDs for different sample concentrations (#3, #5, and #10 in Fig. 6 ), which demonstrate that higher detection sensitivity can be achieved with green LEDs. Therefore, a customized back light module with green light is adopted in the handheld reader.",

The HIV immunoassay cassette consists of three different modules respectively for sample introduction, metering and detection. The sample introduction module provides a user-friendly interface for users to conveniently add urine sample into the cassette. The metering module can adequately control the test sample volume with acceptable deviation. The detection module is able to perform HIV urine detection with an integrated lateral flow strip that uses gold colloid reporter. Once the cassette is fully assembled, the metering chamber will be fluidically connected from its bottom by a sharp needle from the detection module, which allows the urine sample to be continually aspirated by the sample absorbing pad of the lateral flow strip for immunoassay. The whole operation can be performed just by hand without any instrument or special equipment. After 15-min incubation, the cassette can be inserted into a handheld optical reader to detect the test result within 5 s. A custom image processing algorithm was developed to search and locate the test and control lines of the lateral flow strip. The total cost of components of the handheld optical reader is around seventy dollars, which is suitable for POC diagnosis or home test.",

First, with the microfluidic cassette, the allowable test sample volume could be potentially increased for higher sensitivity. Second, there has no need for any sample metering tools since there has a metering chamber within the microfluidic cassette. Third, the risk of environmental contamination (including HIV sample contamination and even spread of the unfriendly smell from urine sample) can be reduced since both the lateral flow strip and the excess sample are sealed inside the cassette. Fourth, the detection sensitivity and accuracy can be improved by combining the cassette with the handheld optical reader compared to direct eye observation which could be unfavorably affected by the operator and the environment.",
