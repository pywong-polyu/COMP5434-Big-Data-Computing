Internet-delivered support in the context of posttraumatic stress is a promising solution since various barriers accessing face-to-face PTSD treatments have been recognized (5) . Nevertheless, most internetbased treatments for PTSD have been based on trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (3) . Trauma-focused treatments seem to have limitations, such as high dropout rates (6) and persistent symptoms even after successfully finalized treatment (7) . Moreover, a new diagnosis of Complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) has been included in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) (8) . For the diagnosis of CPTSD, in addition to the three core PTSD symptoms of (1) re-experiencing, (2) avoidance, and (3) sense of threat, three additional symptoms of disturbances in self-organization, particularly, (1) the affect dysregulation, (2) negative self-concept, and (3) disturbances in relationships, are a prerequisite (5) . There is still little knowledge of the effects of various treatment strategies for CPTSD (9) .",

Mindfulness is described as the awareness that emerges through purposefully paying attention to the present moment and non-judgment to the unfolding experience (18) . It is suggested that mindfulness diminishes physiological arousal, increases attentional control, and fosters acceptance of unwanted experiences; all these processes have the potential to interrupt the maintenance of PTSD (19) . The existing evidence highlights the short-term effects of both face-to-face and internet-delivered mindfulness-based treatments on posttraumatic stress (10, 12-14, 16, 17) . However, little is known about whether these effects tend to last after the intervention is over. To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have explored the long-term effects of mindfulness-based interventions in PTSD, and the results suggest that effects tend to remain from one to 5 months after intervention (15, (20) (21) (22) (23) . However, most existing evidence is based on single group studies or small study samples. In addition, research has yet only explored face-to-face mindfulness-based therapies for PTSD.",

Previously, randomized controlled trial comparing intervention group with a waiting list control group was carried out to assess short-term effects at post-treatment of 8-week mindfulnessbased internet intervention on PTSD and CPTSD in a sample of young adults exposed to traumatic experiences. We have reported short-term effects with significant reductions in disturbances in self-organization symptoms at post-treatment, as well as significant improvement in positive mental health (16) . In the current study, we sought to report the 3-month follow-up results by investigating intervention effects on PTSD and specific for CPTSD disturbances in self-organization symptoms in young adults' sample comparing the intervention group with a waiting list control group.",

We investigated the effects of an online mindfulness-based intervention on PTSD and CPTSD-specific disturbances in self-organization symptoms at a 3-month follow-up. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the waiting list control group. Those allocated to the intervention group received the intervention immediately after randomization, whereas participants allocated to the waiting list control group received the intervention 5 months later. The intervention lasted for 8 weeks. T1, T2, and T3 were carried out at the same time in both groups. The flowchart of the study is presented in Figure 1 .

The CPTSDspecific disturbances in self-organization symptoms in the past month are also assessed with the six symptom items on the three subscales (Negative Self-Concept, Affective Dysregulation, and Disturbances in Relationships symptoms) with two items for each of the disturbances in self-organization symptom clusters. Additional six functional impairment items assess how PTSD (three items) and disturbances in self-organization (three items) symptoms impaired functioning in the past month.

The findings of the current study are in line with other studies on mindfulness-based faceto-face interventions. Previous studies revealed a potential of mindfulness-based interventions as having lasting effects on posttraumatic stress (15, (20) (21) (22) (23) . Based on our findings, it seems that internet-delivered mindfulness-based intervention is a promising option with potentially sustaining effects. This could be relevant specifically for trauma-exposed individuals who cannot access professional psychological treatment due to existing barriers to face-to-face therapy (5) . Also, it is optimistic news in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has dramatically changed the understanding of providing psychological interventions by introducing the shift toward internet-delivered psychological services.",

            "text": "The key finding of the current study was that in 3 months, disturbances in self-organization symptoms, which are prerequisite to the new ICD-11 diagnosis of CPTSD, remained decreased. As the CPTSD is a new diagnosis raising a lot of debates about what the best treatment approach for this condition is (8), our findings are in line with the idea that for CPTSD, multicomponent therapies might be an approach that could improve the outcomes (9) . Our study showed that online mindfulness-based therapy could help trauma-exposed persons to see themselves more positively and connect with others in an emotionally closer manner. Previously, it has been suggested that mindfulness-based therapies could decrease psychological arousal, increase attentional control, and foster acceptance of unwanted experiences (19) . It is possible that it could be applied not only to PTSD symptoms but also could be beneficial for disturbances in self-organization symptoms in a way that practicing mindfulness could increase self-regulation capacity, which could positively impact self-concept and quality of interpersonal relationships. We assume that the same mechanisms of decreasing psychological arousal, increasing attentional control, and fostering acceptance of adverse feelings, thoughts, memories, experiences etc., could play an important role in disturbances in self-organization symptoms. And it seems that these changes tend to remain over time. However, further studies are necessary to reveal the mechanisms underlying the identified changes. Contrary to other studies in this field, our study did not show significant sustaining effects of the intervention on PTSD symptoms. We assume that the most suitable interventions for PTSD are trauma-focused therapies that address traumatic experiences and memories explicitly through trauma exposure (33, 34) whereas mindfulness-based interventions focus on purposefully paying attention to the present moment and traumatic experiences without direct addressing can remain avoided.",

            "text": "The current study has several limitations that should be addressed. First, regarding the measurement of outcomes, participants' trauma exposure, as well as PTSD and disturbances in self-organization symptoms, were assessed via self-report, which can lead to an overestimation or underestimation of PTSD and CPTSD symptomatology. In future studies, clinical interviews administered by a trained professional should be implemented to facilitate more accurate identification of PTSD and CPTSD symptomatology and its change over time. Second, we should have in mind the fact that not all participants retained in the study at the 3-month follow-up. Despite the similarities between the retained and dropped out participants, it is possible that the participants with better outcomes remained in the study. Also, both complete cases and intention to treat analyses could be considered in the future studies to represent this field even more accurately. Third, although the results of 3-month follow-up effects of online mindfulness-based intervention on PTSD and disturbances in self-organization are promising, the intervention comprised multiple components (such as psychoeducation and different types of mindfulness exercises), and due to the study design, it is impossible to identify which of the components contributed to the symptom reduction most. Further work is required to explore mechanisms of change in the current intervention. Moreover, we cannot be sure whether the observed effects were affected by other treatments the participants were receiving. Finally, the 3-month follow-up period is still too short of drawing conclusions regarding the stability of the therapeutic gains in the long term, and future trials should address this issue. Despite these limitations, our study yielded promising results showing that mindfulness-based internet intervention can be a viable option for reducing CPTSD symptoms with the stability of the intervention effects over several months after the intervention delivery.",
