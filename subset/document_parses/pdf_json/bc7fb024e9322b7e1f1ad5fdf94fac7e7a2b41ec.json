As different MLs have different R ML , no cut-off values of \u0394P define ML dysfunction and the trend should be carefully considered. A rapidly increasing \u0394P, even if not associated with reduced gas exchange efficiency, is often a harbinger of impending ML failure and should prompt consideration of ML exchange. When ML pressures are not measured, an increasing pump speed requirement to maintain a stable BFR can serve as a surrogate for increasing \u0394P, with the caveat that pump preload and afterload also affect this relationship.

Not all labs are required to diagnose coagulopathy or hemolysis. **When a ML fails, we recommend considering switching the entire circuit, rather than just the ML, if: (a) the ML and pump head are fused; (b) the ML dysfunction occurs in the setting of circuit-related coagulopathy; or (c) the ML dysfunction occurs in the setting of an older circuit (i.e., longer than 2 weeks).
