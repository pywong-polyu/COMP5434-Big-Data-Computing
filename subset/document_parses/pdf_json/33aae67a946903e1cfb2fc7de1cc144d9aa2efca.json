Encouraging team members within facilities to regularly use their own data to track, review, and measure priority quality indicators promotes the quality improvement process and can improve service delivery outcomes. n The second pivot involves shifting from focusing on repeated, external, quality assurance assessments, often from the district or subnational level, to using facility team-based internal service delivery indicator data reviews to implement quality improvement efforts based on these data. n These pivots toward health care provider and facility manager ownership of the quality improvement process also lead to the third pivot, which involves shifting from one-time, groupbased training toward workplace-based educational interventions. Team involvement in interpreting their facility data can lead to identifying targeted team-based learning needs and the potential need for individual mentoring.",

An increasing body of evidence points to the limitations of traditional training and supportive supervision to improve performance. A 2016 review of nationally representative surveys in 7 sub-Saharan Africa countries that examined the association of in-service training and supervision with provider quality in antenatal and sick child care found these traditional interventions were associated with only modest improvements. 1 Similarly, a recent update to a landmark literature review on interventions to improve health care provider performance in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) found that workplacebased mentorship, clinical practice, and training each had a more positive impact on performance compared to inservice training alone. 2 Despite this evidence, groupbased training and supportive supervision continue to serve as the default interventions to improve health care provider performance, often defined as compliance with care and treatment protocols and ability to deliver quality services that result in improved client health outcomes. 3 Based on global evidence and Jhpiego's project experience, we have identified 3 important pivots to improve health care provider performance ( Figure) . In this commentary, we share these practical pivots for countries and donors to consider for greater return on investments from efforts to improve health care provider performance.",

We recommend investing greater effort to help support teams within facilities collect, review, and use their own priority service delivery indicators to identify gaps and improve performance rather than only report up the management chain. Across several projects, we have seen the power of helping teams within facilities use a few key service delivery indicators to measure quality improvement progress and identify areas where training is needed. The Tanzania Safe Surgery 2020 project, funded by the GE Foundation and ELMA Foundation and implemented from January 2018-December 2020 in the Kagera and Mara regions of Tanzania, used a team-based approach to introduce a package of proven quality improvement and capacity building interventions for surgical teams (interprofessional teams comprised of doctors, nurses, and anesthesia providers) in health care facilities. These approaches included enhancing teamwork, communication, and clinical/surgical skills that focused on team processes to promote a culture of patient safety and introduce infection prevention bundles, safety tools (e.g., the World Health Organization's Surgical Safety Checklist), regular audit and feedback, process mapping to improve functional organization of services, and regular data review of a few priority service delivery indicators to drive quality improvement efforts. These approaches resulted in significant improvements in health care provider performance and client health outcomes. The Surgical Safety Checklist utilization rate for cesarean deliveries increased from 3.7% (5 of 136) to 95.1% (136 of 143) with P<.001. The surgical site infection rate at baseline, before the intervention, was 13.9%. After 18 months of program implementation, this rate declined significantly to 0.7% (a reduction of 94.9%; P<.001), showing that the interventions had a positive impact. The same study also found a 38.5% reduction in the perioperative mortality rate related to cesarean deliveries in participating facilities. 4 Although not statistically significant, these results suggest that the interventions reduced mortality related to surgical complications. The participants noted that the monthly process of regular review and sharing of surgical data was seen as integral to driving improvements in performance.",

This helped health facility staff and managers implement the following quality improvement measures: adequately quantifying sulfadoxinepyrimethamine with timely requisition at service delivery points to reduce stockouts, and providing pregnant women with health education on the benefits of at least IPTp3 with sulfadoxinepyrimethamine. Seven months later, DHIS2 data were analyzed to assess uptake of IPTp3. The proportion of IPTp3 uptake increased by 17% from 32% in May 2019 to 46% in November 2019 (PR=17%; 95% confidence in-terval=5%, 29%; P<.0073; z=2.6817). 5 Under the Safe Surgery 2020 project in Tanzania, continuous quality improvement supported by data review and digital technologies facilitated in-person, virtual, and e-mentoring to support teams within facilities. During the project, in-person Safe Surgery 2020 mentors prioritized data use, supported the development of clinical and nonclinical skills (such as leadership, management, communication), and strengthened the organization of services and implementation of each teams' quality improvement plan. Project ECHO, a partner on the Safe Surgery 2020 project in Tanzania, supported additional weekly virtual mentoring via videoconferencing sessions for 10 sites, with a focus on case review and didactic presentations by clinical mentors. (Project ECHO is a collaborative model of medical education and care management that helps clinicians provide expert-level care to patients wherever they live. It is housed in the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.) E-mentoring was provided through WhatsApp groups for mentors and surgical teams that were formed early in the program by region for real-time knowledge exchange, group problem solving, and data and resource sharing. As part of regular data reviews, teams applied continuous quality improvement practices. For example, in response to service delivery indicator data trending in the wrong direction (e.g., lower Safe Surgical Checklist use, increasing infections rates), teams identified the problem, performed root cause analysis, and took corrective actions. default intervention to improve health care provider performance, frequently defined as adherence to clinical treatment protocols or guidelines. 3 Shifting toward targeted, needs-based training based on health outcomes data and leveraging technology to support more efficient delivery can result in improved health care provider performance and lead to greater cost efficiencies. 2 Taking into account the evidence on effective learning techniques, including setting, frequency, and media, we found that interactive, case-based learning, with hands-on practice or simulation, delivered in the workplace can improve learning outcomes. 7 Repeated sessions can be even more effective and computer or mobiledelivered didactic instruction, if appropriately designed for user engagement, can be equally as effective as live instruction. 7 The EMS project combined the use of the facility wall charts with a 1-day workplace-based training on antenatal care and integrated malaria services and targeted facilities with lower performance, based on service delivery indicators, for site-based clinical mentorship. In both the Liberia EMS and the Safe Surgery 2020 project in Tanzania, formal training was provided on a variety of topics (e.g., clinical updates, data quality and use, quality improvement, and leadership or communication skills) and much of the learning took place in the workplace.",

This was a USAID-funded Saving Lives at Birth Grand Challenges for Development research project. The goal was to build the capacity of providers in all 125 facilities conducting births in 12 districts to deliver these interventions. A 1-day training of the entire team-comprising midwives, nurses, clinical officers, and medical doctors-was conducted at each facility on postpartum hemorrhage. This was repeated 2 months later for birth asphyxia. Facility teams were supported to offer low-dose, high-frequency repeated practice sessions for these critical skills. Across all facilities, there was a 17% reduction in postpartum hemorrhage, 47% reduction in retained placenta, 34% reduction in intrapartum stillbirth, and 62% reduction in early newborn death. 8 The Safe Surgery 2020 project in Tanzania provides an example of how digital technology expanded the provision of workplace-based clinical mentorship and training and the use of data to target training efforts. Starting in June 2020, in response to lockdowns due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the project continued to use the WhatsApp groups to share newly created instructional videos that used anatomical models and conduct videoconference sessions. Teams implemented virtual skills practice and participated in virtual mentorship sessions in their workplace. Each virtual mentoring session started with a review of facility service delivery indicator data and trends related to the selected topic for that session and then addressed challenges and quality improvement interventions the team implemented. The project's clinical mentors delivered virtual mentorship to networks of 5-6 facilities at each session; during these sessions, each network had data reviews, quality improvement discussions, and a mini-case study or a video demonstration. The instructional video demonstrations were delivered via WhatsApp. The use of video added to the quality and richness of content and allowed learners to return to the content at their own pace and schedule if desired. In addition, providers recorded their skills practice in simulation with anatomical models and shared with clinical mentors for virtual feedback. Use of virtual mentorship allowed the mentor team to have more touch points for review and discussion, while reducing the burden on them to physically travel or leave their workplace to provide support.",
