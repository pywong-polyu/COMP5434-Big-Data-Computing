            "text": "AIUM has suggested changes in the guidelines for cleaning of exam rooms, ultrasound machines, and transducers. 6 ISUOG as well has suggested guidelines, which differ whether the patient has known SARS-CoV-2 or who have Travel, Occupation, Contact, and Cluster (TOCC) risks, symptoms, or suspected or probable Covid-19. These guidelines also suggest triage of obstetric ultrasound services based on known Covid status and rescheduling or delaying testing in patients who are symptomatic and/or positive for TOCC, anatomic surveys between 18 and 23 weeks, avoiding routine growth scans in the third trimester, and performing fetal echo depending on the urgency of the test. After recovery of Covid-19, growth scans every 4 weeks are suggested. 7 ISUOG recommendations also suggest dedicated work clothes, gloves, gowns, and in some cases, goggles or face shields, N95 masks, and hair coverings. 8 While these guidelines are excellent and comprehensive in many ways, they imply that the patient's Sars-Cov-2 status is known. In addition, ultrasound units are unique and the unique circumstances of an obstetric ultrasound unit may not be appreciated by hospital administrators. While \"social distancing\" is suggested to decrease viral transmission, we cannot socially distance from our patients. Indeed, our faces may be within 24-40 inches from the patient during the scan when we employ good ergonometric practices, which include sitting close to the patient and having the table at the appropriate height. Patients often talk, laugh, and joke during obstetric ultrasound scans and they may be asked to inhale or hold their breath to complete some portions of it, which potentially results in aerosols. 9 Patients demand that their partners and sometimes multiple family members including children to be present, which creates crowded waiting rooms and exam rooms, and their requests are supported by hospital administrators. The rooms are small and often have unknown ventilation turnover. Machine surfaces are touched regularly by the sonologist. Finally, pregnant patients are often motivated to come for ultrasound appointments despite feeling ill so that they can get \"pictures\" of the baby or find out the sex. In the author's experience, patients often arrive without masks or remove or wear their masks improperly in the waiting room and in the examination rooms despite reminders to keep them on. All of these factors place the sonographer at increased risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2.",

While we may not be able to control the quality or the appropriate use of masks by patients, caregivers should use the best mask they have access to. If N95 masks are not available, options include surgical masks and homemade masks. Recent studies demonstrate that the efficiency of any mask can be improved by the addition of multiple layers of fabric and/or filters and by close fit of the mask to the face. 12 Cloth masks should be washed and N95 masks should be replaced since their efficacy decreases over time. 13 Any mask can be made more efficient by the use of a face shield. 14 Face shields are increasingly available, or can easily be made from easily available materials. 15 Face shields should be cleaned daily both inside and outside and can be reused.",

To minimize learner exposure to staff and patients, the number of learners in our unit is regulated, and learners work in a team with a single, experienced sonographer. All staff members wear eye protection and masks. The presence of learners may be reassessed based on the activity of Sars-CoV-2 in the community. 6. Take ownership of the exam room Patient history and counseling can be performed at a distance. Patients should be instructed to keep their masks on at all times, and sonographers can attempt to keep talking and laughing to a minimum. Rooms may be able to be arranged so that the patient's face points away from the sonographer if there is a separate monitor for the patient to view the scan ( Figure 1) . Ideally, only the patient is allowed in the examination room without children. If hospital policies mandate that a support person and/or children can attend the ultrasound examination, the visitor must sit in a dedicated chair more than 6 feet from the sonographer. We have found that placing tape on the floor where the visitor chair is to be positioned helps to prevent the chair from creeping closer to the sonographer (Figure 2) .",

            "text": "While the effectiveness of barriers in ultrasound rooms has not been studied, inexpensive barriers may be considered. Unfortunately, Plexiglass \u00ae or similar clear plastic barriers are quite expensive. An alternative is a barrier made of a washable corrugated plastic, which is available in home supply stores and hung from the ceiling with large zip ties ( Figure 3 ). These are available for less than 20 USD. To make them most effective and to minimize interference with the sonographer, the patient's buttocks should be positioned in the joint between the head of the exam table and the body of it, and the end of the barrier should extend to the joint in the exam table. A disadvantage is that the sonographer cannot see if the patient removes her mask. 8. Limit the number of scans Guidelines proposed by SMFM and ISUOG (see above) offer reasonable guidance for limiting the number of scans. In our unit, scans are limited to the first-trimester NT scan as well as bloodwork, or a first-trimester dating scan plus cell-free fetal DNA screening, an anatomic survey at 20-22 weeks of gestation to maximize the likelihood that the scan is able to be completed with serum screening at that time if not previously done, and a third-trimester growth scan to detect IUGR in patients where clinical sizing is not feasible. Additional scans are performed only if issues, including increased risk for growth restriction, vaginal bleeding, medical problems, and anomalies arise. We do not perform routine dating scans. Local guidelines are appropriate, and can take into consideration the burden of Covid in the population, and the feasibility of obtaining adequate scanning due to BMI constraints. If local protocols are changed, it may be helpful to keep a record of the protocols and the dates that Patients with known Covid-19 should have routine scans delayed. It is helpful to review the patient list a day prior to the appointment to see if anyone is Covid positive, or when the appointment is confirmed, ask the patient to call for further instructions if she has been diagnosed with Covid-19. This plan should also be communicated to obstetrics providers and residents who may be triaging phone calls. Ideally, these patients should be scanned at the end of the day. A protocol is helpful to determine if an individual patient really needs to be seen, and how she will be roomed with a minimum of interaction with the staff. In our unit, patients are escorted to ultrasound room when it is available, and full PPE is used for staff. The ultrasound machine, probe, and cord are covered. Clips and volumes for offline calculations should be considered to minimize scanning time and trainees should not participate in these scans. After the scan, the probes are cleaned with a high level disinfectant and the machine is cleaned according to manufacturer's recommendations. Handheld systems may be considered as they are easier to clean since only urgent cases are scanned. Donning and doffing of PPE is not easy to do, and not typically performed by sonography staff. The CDC and the WHO do offer guidance, videos, and good infographics to help with this process. 19, 20 It may be helpful to have staff specially trained in these procedures, or to have only the supervising physician or a dedicated staff member trained in donning and doffing PPE perform scans on Covid-19 positive patients. Ideally, the donning and doffing process should be witnessed by another person. As physicians and ultrasound providers, we have an obligation to provide excellent care for our patients despite challenging working conditions, including the need to be in close contact with patients for extended periods of time, constraints imposed on us by hospital administrators, variable amounts of PPE, and adherence to masking in the community. These additional suggestions may not prevent all cases of transmission of Sars-CoV-2 to ultrasound providers but they may be helpful in preventing some cases of inadvertent transmission from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients.",
