Simply, counter-stories can enable \"the listener and teller to build a world richer than either could make alone 2 .\" It is these \"pandemic counter-stories\" which we should seek to preserve and elevate. Yet, in sharing these stories, we must first acknowledge historical reasons why certain narratives have been intentionally left out or gone unrecognized. History reveals that White middle-and upper-class stories are the privileged norm, while stories from people of color or low socioeconomic groups are distorted or silenced 1 . Medical institutions have a long history of afflicting abuse, providing inadequate healthcare, or patronizing marginalized populations, including people experiencing homelessness, people with substance use disorders 6 , people who are incarcerated, and communities of color 4, 5, 7 . The status quo of structural racism and classicism upheld within society is also ingrained within our healthcare system and academic medical centers 4, 5 . If the institution of medicine seeks to be more inclusive of pandemic counter-stories, it will require intentional actions resisting these dominating exclusionary forces 2 .",

To reimagine pandemic stories to be more inclusive of marginalized voices, we must first intentionally listen to these voices. To listen means to give attention to both the storyteller and their story. We argue that there is no paucity of pandemic counter-stories, merely a lack of attention highlighting them. Secondly, we must recognize that there are limitations to what physicians can contribute to the conversation of storytelling inclusivity. Social scientists and historians of race and medicine have long grappled with these issues 7 , providing decades of research and analysis of counter-stories as a way to shift the needle towards equity. Academic medicine should turn to these experts to generate new methods to \"give voice and turn the margins into places of transformative resistance 1 .\"",

Academic medicine can counter its own history of marginalization of underrepresented groups' stories through intentional reflection and actions that elevate and honor these pandemic counterstories with the attention and audience they deserve. The ultimate goal is for society to recognize counter-stories no longer as counter to the prevailing narrative, but rather as enriching dimensions of our shared reality. Elevating these stories allows us to bear witness to our diverse collective experiences, expose our complacency, and enable us to confront power and privilege in the process.",
