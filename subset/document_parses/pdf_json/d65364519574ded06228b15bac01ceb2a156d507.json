This species exhibits very limited adult movement and restriction to soft-bottom habitats but has a moderately long pelagic larval duration. Therefore, if pelagic larval duration is correlated with gene flow between Gulf of California and Pacific populations, we expect a reduced level of genetic and morphological differentiation. However, if adult habitat and ecology have more effect on gene flow, we expect the populations in the two bodies of water to be more highly differentiated. We used logistic regression to compare morphological features and phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to compare nucleotide sequence data. Gulf of California H. guttulata are different from Pacific populations in morphology and both mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences. MtDNA shows reciprocal monophyly, and nuclear sequences from the Gulf of California formed a monophyletic group. Population genetic analyses also suggest further population subdivision within the Pacific and within the Gulf of California.

We then fixed these parameters values and performed a maximum likelihood heuristic topology search. The new topology was then used to re-estimate the model parameters, and this process was repeated until model parameters and log likelihood scores stabilized.

(Links to certain control region haplotypes could not be established in haplotype networks due to their unusually high sequence divergence from the other haplotypes. Those haplotypes were treated as separate clusters.) Closed loops in the networks were broken by preserving evolutionary relationships between haplotypes suggested by our maximum likelihood trees. Haplotypes were clustered as in Nested Clade Analysis (Templeton et al. 1995) , and Arlequin analyses were repeated at various nesting levels to examine the population subdivision for related clusters of alleles. We used LAMARC v.2.1 (Kuhner 2006) to estimate the population parameter H and the number of migrants per generation between populations. We employed Bayesian searches on combined control region and S7 1 data, since recent studies suggested these strategies produce more precise, and potentially more accurate, estimates (Beerli 2006; Kuhner and Smith 2007) . Only populations with greater than five individuals (O, L, U, C, B, Y, Fig. 1 ) were used. We set the effective population size scalar to 4 for nuclear sequences and 1 for control region sequences. We set the relative mutation rate to 1 for nuclear sequences and 7.3 for control region sequences, determined by examining relative model-corrected distances among nuclear haplotypes and among control region haplotypes. The transition/ transversion ratio for each locus was set at the values estimated by PAUP. We performed iterative analyses in LAMARC, similar to maximum likelihood tree estimation. All search parameter values were left at default levels for the initial run, except that we increased the number of long chains to 3. All additional runs used only 1 long chain, and no short chains, with 3,000 burn-in steps, 20,000 samples, and a sampling interval of 40. Parameters were averaged over five independent sub-runs. In addition, adaptive heating was used with initial temperatures set to 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, and 3.0, and a swap interval of 1. After the initial run, starting values of H and migration for run i were set to the values estimated in run i-1. We performed 3 runs, tracking the most probable estimates and confidence intervals of parameters for consistency and convergence over runs. After 3 runs, 95% confidence intervals for estimated parameters remained relatively constant between runs, so analysis was concluded. We additionally plotted the contents of the curve files produced for each parameter to determine whether the program estimated a single optimum for each parameter or whether the data suggested multiple potentially optimal values. Since we set the control region effective population size scalar to 1 and the S7 scalar to 4, LAMARC estimated H on the mitochondrial scale (H = Nl). We multiplied this value by 4 in order to report H estimates on the scale of an autosomal gene. We also multiplied the migration estimates [M(LAMARC) = m/l] by the H estimate (4 Nl) for the recipient population to report migration as M = 4 Nm. We calculated 95% confidence intervals for M by multiplying the upper and lower confidence values for H by the respective upper or lower values for M(LAMARC).

Concatenated S7 sequences revealed that some individuals with the shared S7 1 haplotype are indeed different when additional S7 gene sequence is added. There is still a single, shared haplotype between Pacific and Gulf of California populations, but that 2-intron haplotype (h1) is not as prevalent (occurring only twice in Pacific samples and 5 times in Gulf of California samples) as the shared S7 1 haplotype. The average, corrected pairwise genetic distance between Pacific and Gulf of California S7 sequences derived from Arlequin (S7 1 and 2 combined) is 0.0029.

Like some other Baja California disjunct species (Bernardi et al. 2003; Bernardi and Lape 2005) , Gulf of California and Pacific H. guttulata may be in the process of speciation. Given a 1:1 sex ratio, the effective population size for mitochondrial loci is that of autosomal loci because of maternal inheritance and effective haploidy. This means that allele sorting between allopatric populations is expected to proceed more rapidly for mitochondrial sequences (N generations on average, where N is the inbreeding effective population size) than for nuclear sequences (4 N generations) (Moore 1995) . Our data suggest that Pacific and Gulf of California populations of H. guttulata have not been separated long enough for full reciprocal monophyly for nuclear loci. Another Baja California disjunct species, A. davidsonii, has been studied using both mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data (Bernardi and Lape 2005) . Gulf of California and Pacific populations of A. davidsonii showed reciprocal monophyly for mtDNA, but a significant amount of sharing of rpS7 sequences. Additional morphological and molecular analyses support the possibility of allopatric, incipient speciation. External morphological features show statistically (Table 2) . U st and migration analyses of control region and S7 sequences both additionally detect significant restrictions in gene flow between the Pacific and the Gulf of California regions (Tables 3, 4 , 5).

In the Gulf of California, two analyses (control region U st , migration estimation) detect structure between Bah\u00eda de Los \u00c1 ngeles and Yavaros (Tables 3 and 5 ; Fig. 6 ). With only two populations sampled from the Gulf of California, we cannot assess details of within Gulf differentiation that are known for some species (Riginos 2005) . U st analyses, migration estimates, and control region F st analysis of clustered haplotypes also detect genetic structure among Pacific sites. All Pacific analyses suggest restricted gene flow between northern Pacific and southern Pacific sites. Point Conception and Punta Eugenia (Fig. 1) have traditionally been recognized as important phylogeographic barriers for marine fishes (Dawson et al. 2006) . Our data are consistent with the possibility of these general regions as phylogeographic barriers for H. guttulata. The S7 1 U st analysis (Table 3) suggests genetic structure between Oakland and Los Alamitos. Additionally, when nested control region data (data not shown) are grouped as either north or south of Point Conception, the resulting frequency-based F st is significant (F st = 0.262). Analyses also imply genetic structure in the region of central Baja California. The S7 1 U st , control region U st , and migration estimates (Tables 3,  4 , and 5; Fig. 6 ) all point to restricted gene flow between Oakland and the 2 sites south of Punta Eugenia (El Cuarenta and Cancun). The S7 1 U st analysis shows restricted gene flow between Los Alamitos and Cancun (Table 3) , and the control region F st analysis on nested haplotypes ( (Allen and Pondella 2006) . In contrast, those Baja California disjunct species associated with either soft-substratum habitats (grunion, spotted bass, diamond turbot, orangethroat pikeblenny, longjaw mudsucker) or cryptic rocky reef habitats (mussel blenny, blue banded goby) (Allen and Pondella 2006) exhibit high Gulf of California/Pacific genetic divergence (for genetic references see Intro). This matches well with the hypothesis Fig. 6 Estimates of migration rate between 4 Pacific sites (O, L, U, C), the 2 Gulf of California sites (B, Y), and between the Gulf of California and Pacific regions. Relative thickness of arrows corresponds to relative levels of migration between sites. Color differences between arrows are only to improve readability. Numbers on arrows indicate number of migrants per generation that the non-uniform distribution of soft-bottom habitat in the Gulf of California (Walker 1960) contributes to allopatry and incipient speciation in these species. A full review of the literature is in progress (Schinske in preparation). Ecological studies on some Baja California disjunct fishes additionally suggest relatively limited adult migration in species with genetic differentiation across Baja California. Adult movement appears restricted for the diamond turbot (Lane 1975; Swearer et al. 2003) , mussel blenny (Losey 1968; Stephens et al. 1970) , spotted bass (Allen et al. 1995) , blue banded goby (Steele 1997 (Steele , 1998 , orangethroat pikeblenny (Thresher 1997) , longjaw mudsucker (Barlow 1961; Bernardi et al. 2003) , and opaleye (Valle 1989) . While few studies have examined migration in the panmictic Baja California disjunct species, collection records indicate the possible occasional appearance of those species near the tip of Baja California (CICIMAR Sample 1693; SIO Sample 65-346; SIO Sample 84-73; SIO Sample 59-219; 65-230; Present 1987; Bernardi et al. 2003) . These studies and observations further support the concept that life history considerations restrict the populations of certain Baja California disjunct species to particular areas in the Baja California region, resulting in allopatric speciation between those geographically isolated populations. However, drawing firm conclusions will require additional long-term ecological studies of these species' habitat associations and adult movement (especially in panmictic species). The present study demonstrates the necessity of both ecological and genetic data when considering the forces that affect marine evolutionary divergence and speciation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 470,

As an example of a Baja California disjunct species with a low adult migratory ability and a dependence on soft-bottom habitats, H. guttulata exhibits relatively strong genetic differentiation between Gulf of California and Pacific populations. Examination of habitat associations, life history characteristics, and museum collection records for H. guttulata and other Baja California disjunct species supports the hypothesis that adult migration and ecological factors play important roles in determining whether Baja California disjunct species are genetically distinct or homogeneous across Baja California. For example, all of the presently studied Baja California disjunct species exhibiting little genetic differentiation across Baja California (zebraperch, rock wrasse, California sheephead, Mexican rockfish) are associated with conspicuous rocky habitats", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF7": {"text": "Table 5 Estimates of H. guttulata migration produced by LAMARC analysis", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>From To\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Oakland </td><td>Los Alamitos </td><td>El Cuarenta </td><td>Cancun\n</td></tr><tr><td>(a) Within regions\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Pacific Ocean\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Oakland - </td><td>1.52 (12.10) 36.45 </td><td>0.02 (4.99) 27.72 </td><td>0.32 (3.43) 17.74\n</td></tr><tr><td>Los Alamitos </td><td>0.91 (4.49) 8.40 </td><td>- </td><td>4.04 (26.46) 75.24 </td><td>3.85 (11.09) 42.24\n</td></tr><tr><td>El Cuarenta </td><td>0.01 (1.41) 6.14 </td><td>3.44 (23.38) 55.52 </td><td>- </td><td>4.75 (10.93) 41.99\n</td></tr><tr><td>Cancun </td><td>0.15 (1.92) 7.22 </td><td>4.39 (29.36) 56.83 </td><td>6.08 (34.80) 82.51 </td><td>-\n</td></tr><tr><td>From </td><td>To\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Bah\u0131\u0301a LA </td><td>Yavaros\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Gulf of California\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Bah\u0131\u0301a LA </td><td>- </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>0.22 (3.39) 12.48\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Yavaros </td><td>0.26 (4.72) 23.97 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>-\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>From </td><td>To\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Pacific </td><td>Gulf of California\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>(b) Between regions\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Pacific </td><td>- </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>0.004 (1.339) 12.286\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Gulf of California </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>0.021 (0.763) 4.721 </td><td>-\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "Acknowledgments Our research was funded through grants from the PADI Foundation (#2007-95), the AMNH Lerner-Gray Fund for Marine Research, and the SFSU IRA fund.
