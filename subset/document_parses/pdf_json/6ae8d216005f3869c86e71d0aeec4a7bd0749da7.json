Most of the infected patients present with respiratory symptoms and acute lung damage. Here, we present three cases of patients with COVID-19 disease whose main clinical manifestations are gastrointestinal symptoms. In our first case, we present a COVID-19 patient with histologic findings associated with ischemic necrosis of the small bowel. In the second and third cases, we demonstrate acute cholecystitis and histology showing microvascular thrombosis. These three cases highlight the ischemic and thrombotic changes seen in the setting of COVID-19 infection without classic respiratory symptoms, with resulting severe gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary disease requiring surgical management. Although the bile or stool viral load was not tested in these patients, the small intestine and gallbladder were infected with SARS-CoV-2, most likely via the epithelial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.",

As of today, millions of people have been infected with this virus in the United States. Most infected patients present with a fever, cough, and other respiratory symptoms. Approximately 25% of infected patients have gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with up to 39% of patients having elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels [2] . However, a few cases of COVID-19 present as acute cholecystitis. Here, we summarize findings from the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary systems of three SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, two of whom presented with acute calculous cholecystitis. The goal of this case study is to present the clinical and histologic features of infected patients with severe gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary disease manifestations.",

The most common presentation of this disease is severe pneumonia, which can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [3] . The mortality of this disease is approximately 0.25%, with the majority of cases progressing to diffuse alveolar damage [4] . Studies have also revealed that COVID-19 infection can cause a hypercoagulative environment resulting in microvascular thrombi in multiple organ systems [5] . Magro [7] . One explanation for vascular thrombi in the background of COVID-19 could be related to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and cytokine storms [8, 9] . The binding and activation of the ACE2 receptor will cause damage to endothelial cells. The disruption of the ACE2 receptor by the virus then causes an imbalance in the ACE2 axis, which induces the cytokine IL-6, TNF-a storm, and other inflammatory responses [8, 9] . Subsequentially, this activates the coagulation cascade and the platelet response, which eventually induces thrombotic effects throughout the body [10] . Ni et al. reported that SARS-CoV-2 attaches to cells via the ACE2 entry receptor, which is widely expressed on endothelial cells [10] .",

            "text": "Our paper presented gastrointestinal manifestations in a series of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. One common feature of our case series was that these patients presented with mild gastrointestinal symptoms without any respiratory manifestations. We specifically demonstrated two cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection related cholecystitis. Both patients had no underlying gallbladder disease and presented with acute calculous cholecystitis without respiratory symptoms. The histology for both cases showed vascular thrombi, consistent with findings of systemic hypercoagulability described by numerous studies. Previously, a couple of papers have been reported showing acute cholecystitis as a complication of severe COVID-19 [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Three of these cases have histologic findings compatible with ours, further supporting that microthrombi are a common COVID-19-related pathologic change. Additionally, all six cases previously reported were ICU patients with severe acute pneumonia, and two developed sepsis that required prolonged hospitalization [19, 20] . Our case series showed that acute cholecystitis can occur as an isolated clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection without any respiratory symptoms. Even in patients with mild symptoms like we presented, microthrombi was still the most common finding. Zong et al. and Hong et al. showed ACE2 receptors are also highly expressed in gallbladder epithelium [19] [20] [21] , making the gallbladder a prime target for the SARS-CoV-2 virus [21, 22] . Case 2 was managed with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy after a CT scan confirmed the diagnosis. Case 3 underwent percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage first for symptom control and then had an elective cholecystectomy after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR. Both patients fully recovered from symptoms of acute cholecystitis and SARS-CoV-2 infection without any complications. Currently, there is no consensus for the management of COVID-19-related acute cholecystitis. However, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) has recommended that cholecystectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of acute cholecystitis in COVID-19 patients [23, 24] .",

The ischemic bowel may be a consequence of compromised microvascular blood flow to the intestinal wall coupled with inflammatory activation, which can occur with or without pulmonary involvement [25] . Mesenteric vasculitis is commonly found in SARS-CoV-2 infection. A previous case report demonstrated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) caused by COVID-19 infection, where the patient's presentation mimicked acute appendicitis [26] . Histologically, acute vasculitis was found in the mesentery with abundant acute inflammatory cells infiltrating artery walls. For some patients, it is possible that GI findings could be the initial COVID-19 manifestations, antedating respiratory symptoms.",
