Minimal system requirements for downloading the application was Android 7.0 or Apple iOS12. In the application, personalized thresholds with orange for moderate or red for severe deteriorations were set. Besides, patients could give comments. Warnings for deterioration or comments were sent directly to the dashboard available via a web browser. The dashboard updated several times a minute and was controlled by the home telemonitoring team consisting of medical residents supervised by pulmonologists. All data entries were saved and graphically displayed as trend to the team and patient. Patients received daily automatic reminders to fill in the app. Besides, the team could send personal messages to the patient. Furthermore, the team actively contacted patients by phone to assist in titration of oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and control clinical follow-up.",
