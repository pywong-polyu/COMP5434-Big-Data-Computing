            "text": "There are several recent publications criticizing the failure of COVID-19 forecasting models, with swinging over predictions and underpredictions, which have made it difficult for decision and policy making. Observing the failures of several COVID-19 forecasting models and the alarming spread of the virus, we seek to use some stable response for forecasting viz., ratios of COVID-19 cases to mortalities, rather than COVID-19 cases or fatalities. A trend of low COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios calls for urgent attention: the need for vaccines, for instance. Studies have shown that there are influences of weather parameters on COVID-19; and COVID-19 may have come to stay and could manifest a seasonal outbreak profile similar to other infectious respiratory diseases. In this paper, the influences of some weather, geographical, economic and demographic covariates were evaluated on COVID-19 response based on a series of Granger-causality tests. The effect of four weather parameters, viz., temperature, rainfall, solar irradiation and relative humidity, on daily COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios of 36 countries from 5 continents of the world were determined through regression analysis. Regression studies show that these four weather factors impact ratios of COVID-19 cases-to-mortality differently. The most impactful factor is temperature which is positively correlated with COVID-19 cases-to-mortality responses in 24 out of 36 countries. Temperature minimally affects COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios in the tropical countries. The most influential weather factortemperaturewas incorporated in training random forest and deep learning models for forecasting the cases-to-mortality rate of COVID-19 in clusters of countries in the world with similar weather conditions. Evaluation of trained forecasting models incorporating temperature features show better performance compared to a similar set of models trained without temperature features. This implies that COVID-19 forecasting models will predict more accurately if temperature features are factored in, especially for temperate countries.",

From all indications, the current spread and death toll were never expected, and the situation could have been better. The fear about the virus is the high mortality versus confirmed cases. With respect to a total of 6,220,080 cases, over 380,337 had died from the virus by May 31, 2020 [1]. This is roughly a situation of 1 death per 16 cases. Absolutely, everyone fears a repeat of the same trend of mortality rate due to COVID-19, as experienced within the three months (March to May 2020).",

There are several recent publications hammering on the failure of COVID-19 forecasting models [2] [3] [4] [5] which have been misleading in decision and policy making. There are cases of drastic over predictions and underpredictions. A first premise for this research is that over a year's experience in COVID-19 pandemic reveals that the COVID-19 spread rate is influenced by more physical interaction of individuals and ease of lockdowns, irrespective of the weather conditions [6-9]. Secondly, it has also been reported that COVID-19 virus might be taken in our stride and could manifest a seasonal outbreak profile similar to other infectious respiratory diseases, therefore, with increased morbidity, virulence and mortality with weather variations [10] . Hence, in this paper, we do not solely study the influence of weather conditions on the COVID-19 cases or fatalities, rather, we study their influence on COVID-19 cases-tomortality ratios.",

A positive correlation coefficient between temperature or humidity and COVID-19 cases resulted from the studies in [37, 38] . In some instances, this positive correlation is attributed to no lockdown states, frequent movements in the summer, etc. However, a negative correlation has mostly resulted in studies relating COVID-19 mortalities to temperature or humidity in [32, 35, 39] , probably due to the devastating nature of the virus in the cold season.",

Evidently, the mortality curves are not proportionate to the cases' curves for the five continents as the year progresses, meaning that there are significant factors affecting mortality due to COVID-19. Mortalities followed a bathtub curve for North America and Europe, especially, while daily cases kept on rising with time, through January to December 2020. This makes the use of cases or mortalities as responses difficult for COVID-19 forecast.",

            "text": "Using number of COVID-19 daily cases or daily mortalities as responses for prediction for a cluster of countries with varying population pose a problem as mortality is a function of the cases which are in turn function of a country's population, thereby making them unstable responses. Also, as the mortalities are dependent on the number of cases, it is ideal to take both the cases and mortalities into consideration, hence we do this by dividing the cases by mortalities. This is termed the case-to-mortality (C:M) ratios. This serves as a common metric for comparing the impact of COVID-19 amongst nations with varying demographics. We define the COVID-19 cases-to-mortality C:M response as the ratio of the daily number of COVID-19 cases c to number of daily mortalities m delayed by 7 days. C:M is similar to case fatality rate used in epidemiology and has been studied in [42, 43] . In determining the C:M ratios, the mortalities series were offset by 7 days from the cases series, to factor in a delayed effect of cases on mortalities. A 7-days delay was used because mortality peaks around 7 days later than the cases as observed from the acquired data. However, we evaluated the best delayed effect in this Section by varying delays of (a) 7 (b) 14 (c) 21 and (d) 28 days cases on mortality ratios. We demonstrate this by showing how these four different delays manifest in C:M plots for two major continents -Europe and North America. The results are shown in Fig. 2 (a) for Europe and in Fig. 2 (b) for North America. A glance at the curves in Fig. 2 (a) and (b) shows that the peaks and troughs increase in magnitude as the delays decrease from 28 to 7 days. Therefore, the magnitude of the curve with 7-days delay in both plots is more impactful than other delays, and is chosen for the rest of the experiments. It was also reported that mortality peaks a week after COVID-19 cases peak in [42] , therefore this pre-analysis conforms with the results in [42] It can be observed that rise and fall patterns in most of the curves in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 , appear to be seasonal. Furthermore, the C:M ratio plots in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 (a) and (d), tend to peak after about a month's delayed effect during the hottest periods in summer and dip after about a month's delayed effect during the coldest periods in the winter.",

In Table 4 , the p-values of the gradients are less than 0.05 in 20 countries indicating that there is a significant relationship between temperature and the spread of COVID-19 in those countries. The regression analysis in 24 out of 36 countries in Table 4 have a positive gradient showing that temperature is directly proportional with C:M ratios in these countries. Other than New Zealand, the countries with an impactful negative slope (< -1.2) at a fixed intercept of \uf0b1100, are countries with average temperatures (tropical weather countries). In most of the temperate countries, temperature is positively correlated with C:M responses. This shows that the C:M ratio increases as temperature increases, with the exception of Russia and USA, where Tests per 1M, GDP per capita or other covariates that are not tested in this paper, might be influencing the results. The Tests per 1M from source [1] are high for both USA and Russia. Additionally, USA has one of the highest GDP per Capita [1] . It is not surprising that New Zealand has a negative slope because New Zealand has the most minimal daily cases and mortalities amongst all other 35 countries, as seen in the box plots in Fig. 1 (a) and (b) . It is, therefore, much less affected by COVID-19. In tropical countries, there is a short variation in temperature across all seasons and, hence, temperature does not impact COVID-19 in tropical countries as much as in temperate countries, resulting in mostly negative slopes in the tropical countries. For the set of intercepts fixed at a height of , the corresponding slopes are significant as well. SSR > SSE in 18 out of 36 countries in Table 4 , where 15 of them are temperate countries. This is remarkable for the temperature predictor. The results for the regression analysis of C:M responses on measurements of solar irradiation from 36 countries are shown in Table 5 . C:M responses were not repeated in Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7 , since the values are the same as those in Table 4 . The p-values for 18 of the slopes in Table 5 are less than 0.01. Solar irradiation is positively correlated with C:M in 23 countries: this includes all temperate countries other than Russia, USA and New Zealand, for the same reasons explained above. SSR > SSE in 13 out of 36 countries in Table 5 and the magnitude of the slopes when the intercepts fixed at a height of are high, signifying a high impact of solar irradiation on COVID-19 in the 13 countries. The p-values for the 13 countries in Table 5 are . Solar irradiation impacts COVID-19 in the 13 countries where the minimum solar irradiation is less than 1.90 kw-hr/m 2 /day and the difference between the average and minimum solar irradiation is greater than 2.6 kw-hr/m 2 /day in the country. Other than Norway, all the 13 countries where solar irradiation have a high SSR are temperate countries, clearly showing that a high differential in solar intensity impacts C:M responses. Norway has few cases and mortalities compared to other temperate countries and has the second highest GDP per Capita amongst the 36 countries [1] . Therefore, C:M ratios increase with significant increase in solar irradiation.",

Regression analysis was used in analyzing the impact of weather parameters, viz., temperature, solar irradiation, rainfall, and relative humidity, on filtered responses of COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios. Results show that few covariates influence COVID-19 spread, and weather parameters have varied effects on the COVID-19 cases to mortality ratios (C:M). Out of the four weather parameters, temperature has a significant effect on COVID-19 C:M ratios. Results show a great impact in temperate countries with widely varying temperature profiles, while tropical countries appear to be unaffected by the temperature parameter. COVID-19 C:M ratios decrease as it gets colder in the temperate countries and this calls for urgent attention: the need for more vaccines for COVID-19 virus, for instance. Prediction results from COVID-19 forecasting models trained with temperature features are better than those of forecasting models trained without temperature features, showing that the temperature parameter should be factored-in for accurate forecasting of COVID-19 responses.",
