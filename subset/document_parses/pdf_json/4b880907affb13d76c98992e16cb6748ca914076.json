            "text": "Observation of gravitational waves (GWs) in two different frequency bands is referred to as multiband GW astronomy. With the planned Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA) operating in the 10 \u22124 \u2212 0.1 Hz range, and third generation (3G) ground-based detectors such as the Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), operating in the 1-10 4 Hz range, multiband GW astronomy could be a reality in about a decade. In this paper we present the potential of multiband observations of intermediate mass binary black holes (IMBBHs) of component masses \u223c10 2 -10 3 M to test general relativity (GR). We show that mutiband observations of IMBBHs would permit multiparameter tests of GR-tests where more than one post-Newtonian (PN) coefficient is simultaneously measured yielding more rigorous constraints on possible modifications to GR. We also find that the improvement due to multibanding can often be much larger than the best of the bounds from either of the two observatories. The origin of this result, as we shall demonstrate, can be traced to the lifting of degeneracies among the various parameters when the information from LISA and 3G are taken together. We obtain the best multiband bounds for an IMBBH with a total redshifted mass of 200M and a mass ratio of 2. For single-parameter tests, this system at 1 Gpc would allow us to constrain the deviations on all the PN coefficients to below 10% and derive simultaneous bounds on the first seven PN coefficients to below 50% (with low spins).",

The theory has so far been consistent with each of these tests (see Refs. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] for an overview of various astrophysical tests of GR). The first observation of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary black hole (BBH) merger GW150914 [7] and several others [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] during the first and second observing runs, have permitted tests of GR in a regime of strong gravity and high curvature which were elusive till date [15] . The binary neutron star merger GW170817 [16] further facilitated tests of strong-field gravity for non-vacuum spacetimes [17] . The observation of electromagnetic emission associated with this event helped in deriving stringent constraints on the speed of the GWs [18] . All these tests have placed tighter constraints on possible deviations from GR [19] , while ruling out modified theories of gravity invoked to explain dark energy [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

These tests make the best use of the structure of the GW phase evolution from the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation to GR [31] . In the PN approximation, the phase evolution of the GW signal can be expanded as a power series in v and log v, where v denotes the velocity parameter describing the orbital motion of the binary. The different PN orders (corresponding to different powers of v) capture the diverse physics and various nonlinear effects * sdatta94@cmi.ac.in underlying the compact binary dynamics. Hence looking for deviations in the PN coefficients is equivalent to constraining different physics that goes into them [32, 33] . In this framework, deviations from GR are parametrized via deformation in the phasing formula at different PN orders [29, 30] whose values are put to test using the GW data. As these deformation parameters take the value zero in GR, this null test is devised to derive constraints on them at a fixed credible level.",

Ideally, one aims to constrain all or several of the PN deformation parameters simultaneously using the GW data [25] . This will be referred to as multiparameter tests in this paper. One may wish to further classify these multiparameter tests into two classes, depending on whether the block of PN parameters that are tested start from the lowest PN order (in the ascending order) or from the highest PN order (in the descending order). The former would make sense in terms of verifying the predictions of GR at different PN orders with increasing levels of complexities in the nonlinear interactions. The latter perspective, starting from the highest PN order and goes in the decreasing order, would be expected from modified theories such as an effective field theory where modifications to GR would start at a particular PN order and all orders above that [34, 35] . There could be other possible combinations of the PN deformation parameters that may be tested simultaneously, but we consider only these two classes of the multiparameter tests in this paper as they are the most general ones. These classes of tests, though more rigorous, yield weaker bounds, compared to single-parameter tests, due to the large correlations of the deformation parameters among themselves as well as with the intrinsic parameters of the binary such as its masses and spins [25, 36] .",

            "text": "Hence, one considers a somewhat less rigorous set of tests where only one of the many PN deformation parameters is chosen at a time as a test parameter [26, 29, 30] . This is less rigorous in the sense that, a modification to the phasing formula from a non-GR theory is likely to occur at more than one PN order. This aspect is not accounted for in the formulation of the single-parameter tests. This drawback is partially compensated by performing a set of tests by varying the PN deformation parameter systematically from 0PN till 3.5PN one-by-one (see [27] for a detailed discussion). Hence, one or more of these tests would potentially detect a deviation if the underlying theory of gravity is not GR, though a deviation seen at a particular PN order in this test does not necessarily mean the breakdown of GR occurs only at that particular order. Given the sensitivity of current generation of GW detectors, this is the method presently being employed in the analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data and will be referred to as singleparameter tests in this paper. The current constraints from the single-parameter tests, at 90% credible level, from the BBHs observed during the first and second observing runs of LIGO and Virgo detectors are reported in [15] . However, with the next generation ground-based and space-based detectors, the sensitivity would reach to levels where the multiparameter tests would be possible [37] .",

The ground-based 3G detectors are sensitive to stellar mass BBHs (up to \u223c100M ) and intermediate mass BBHs (IMBBHs) (\u223c10 2 \u2212 10 3 M ) in the frequency range \u223c1 \u2212 10 4 Hz [42, 43] , while the space-based LISA mission is most sensitive to supermassive black hole mergers (\u223c10 5\u22127 M ) in the 10 \u22124 \u2212 0.1 Hz band [44] . While CE/ET will have the advantage of around 10-40 fold improvement in strain sensitivity compared to the present generation detectors such as advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo, LISA will open up the possibility of using mHz band for GW astronomy. But neither of them may be able to set stringent enough bounds on the deformation parameters to rule in or rule out viable modified theories of gravity [37] . This is because the intrinsic degeneracies of the deformation parameters with masses and spins prevent making precise measurements of these parameters using either ground-based or space-based experiments alone [27] .",

This is often referred to as multiband GW astronomy [52] where, using a class of sources visible in both LISA and 3G, one combines the low frequency (early dynamics of compact binaries) content in the LISA band and high-frequency content (carrying an imprint of the late time dynamics of compact binaries) in the 3G band to obtain bounds on departures from GR. Various studies on multiband parameter estimation mostly used stellar-mass BBHs like GW150914, which will have a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of order unity in the LISA band but several hundreds to thousands in the 3G band. Even then, in these studies, joint observation have been argued to be able to provide bounds several orders of magnitude better than from the individual observations [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . This huge improvement has been broadly attributed to the combination of the low-frequency sensitivity of LISA with the high-frequency response of the 3G detectors. In Ref. [51] , these generic features have been confirmed, for the first time, with a treatment of the problem within the Bayesian inference framework.",

Astrophysically IMBHs can have masses as high as 10 4 M [53] and would be excellent sources of GWs for these detectors, although they are yet to be unravelled by observations. Therefore, the detection and understanding the formation of IMBBHs are among the top science priorities of present and future astronomical telescopes [54, 55] . The multiband detectability of IMBBHs is discussed in detail in Ref. [56] .

This significantly helps the process of multibanding thereby providing us precise measurements of the PN deformation parameters. Further, our detailed study reveals that the dramatic improvements from multibanding is due to large scale cancellations of correlations among different parameters in the problem, due to the mutually complementarity of the two experiments or frequency bands. We find that an intermediate mass BBH with a redshifted mass of 200M and a mass ratio of 2, at a luminosity distance of 1 Gpc will yield the best multiband, multiparameter bounds on the PN deformation parameters. Considering such a system, we find that single-parameter tests can constrain first three PN deformation parameters to an accuracy \u223c 0.1% and the rest to below 10%. Multiparameter tests up to 7-parameter case can be performed with the above system, where the first two PN deformation parameters are bounded to below 0.5% and the rest to below 50% (with low spins).",

An important subclass of them, referred to as inspiral-merger-ringdown phenomenological waveforms or IMRPhenom, are constructed starting with an ansatz about the structure of the frequency domain gravitational waveforms, which contain several free parameters that are fixed by matching with numerical relativity simulations for various mass-ratios and spins. Here we use the IMRPhenomD waveform model [62] of the IMRPhenom family, which assumes the spins of the binary constituents to be aligned or anti-aligned with respect to the orbital angular momentum vector and hence the binary is non-precessing. The amplitude of IMRPhenomD accounts for only the leading quadrupolar(l = 2, |m| = 2) mode. Schematically a frequency domain waveform would read",

This is justified as our aim is to study the error on the intrinsic parameters of the binary, including the PN deformation parameters, which are more or less uncorrelated to the extrinsic parameters (such as luminosity distance, source position and orientation) and hence have minimal effect on our estimates [75, 76] . The noise power spectral density (PSD) we employ for LISA can be found in Eq. (1) of [44] , which consists of the instrumental noise and the confusion noise due to galactic double white dwarf binaries that limits LISA sensitivity in the lower-frequency regime. The latter is accounted for only 2 years of integration time in [44] . Since we use up to five years of integration time, and as the PSD scales linearly with the observation time, we multiply the expression for S gal in [44] by 5/2. The LISA noise PSD given in [44] is averaged over the sky and polarization angles and takes into account its triangular shape [74] [75] [76] [77] as well as the two independent low frequency channels. However, to account for averaging over the inclination angle which specifies the orientation of the source with respect to the detector, it will involve an additional prefactor of \u221a 4/5 multiplying the amplitude of the IMRPhenomD waveform model [77] . The choice of the low frequency cut-off for IMBBHs in the LISA band will depend on the duration over which the signal would last in the LISA band.

It is a triangular shaped detector with 10 km arms and is effectively three V-shaped detectors with an opening angle of 60 \u2022 . Both CE and ET noise sensitivities are limited by gravity gradient noise in the low frequency regime. The lower cut-off frequencies for ET and CE are chosen to be 1 Hz and 5 Hz, respectively. The upper cutoff frequency is chosen such that the characteristic amplitude (2 f |h( f )|) of the GW signal is lower than that of CE/ET noise by 10% at maximum. Though theoretically the upper frequency limit is infinity, contributions from the high frequency part of the waveform that contribute negligibly are ignored. This choice of the cut-off helps in significantly improving the accuracy of the numerical analysis. Similar to the case of LISA, our aim is to study the parameter estimation problem using ET and CE from a test of GR standpoint. As we use single detector configurations, we multiply the amplitude with a prefactor 2/5 to account for the averaging over the antenna pattern functions [75, 76, 80] . Figure 1 shows the strain sensitivity (square root of the noise PSD) of LISA, CE and ET. It also shows the frequency domain characteristic amplitudes (which signifies the strength of the GW signal) of an IMBBH with a total mass of 500M at 1 Gpc and a GW150914-like stellar mass binary black hole system at 400 Mpc for comparison. As the binaries inspiral, the IMBBH spends about a few hours and the stellar mass BBH a few days before they leave the LISA band at 0.1 Hz and enter ET (CE) at 3 Hz (5 Hz). The strength of the GW signals at frequencies corresponding to their respective last stable orbits is marked in magenta. This shows that the inspiral phase of systems with source frame masses greater than 500M at a luminosity distance of 1 Gpc, will hardly be visible by CE/ET. The following section discusses this in more detail. ",

A typical IMBBH with total mass \u223c500M at a distance of roughly 1 Gpc will be observable for years in the LISA band when the inspiraling binary components are far apart from each other. This leads to the accumulation of considerable amount of SNR during the period of observation. In Fig. 2 , we show the SNR of IMBBHs as a function of total mass for LISA, CE, ET and for multiband observations (LISA+CE and LISA+ET).

As shown in Fig. 2 , IMBBHs would have an SNR of the order of hundreds to thousands in 3G detectors like CE and ET. This would allow estimation of their mass parameters, especially chirp mass, to incredible accuracies. Using the time of arrival of the signal in the CE band, one would hence be able to do a search for the low frequency part of the corresponding signal in the LISA band. Due to the prior detection in the ground based detectors, the threshold on SNR for a given false alarm rate could be lowered leading to the detection of sources which have SNR \u223c5 [37] . A confident detection of the IMBBH in the archival LISA data, following a search using the parameters measured by ground based detectors, forms the context for multiband parameter estimation. Indeed, more careful studies are required to quantify the detectability of these IMBBHs in the LISA band (see for instance [82] ), but we do not go into the details of this detection problem in the present work.

In our case, we use this technique to compute the 1\u03c3 uncertainty in the estimation of PN deformation parameters that characterize modifications to GR. These errors also translate into upper limits on the values of the deformation parameters for a given detector sensitivity and increase in the sensitivity would lead to tighter upper limits. As discussed in Sec. II A, our parameter space is spanned by seven GR parameters and up to eight PN deformation parameters, depending on how many deformation parameters are simultaneously estimated in the problem.

As the prior matrix is added to both LISA and CE Fisher matrices, one may suspect over-counting as the prior matrix is featured twice in the multiband Fisher matrix. But we would like to stress that from the parameter estimation view point, this simply reflects our assumption that parameter estimation with LISA and CE/ET are two independent experiments whose outcomes are combined to gain greater insights about the dynamics of IMBBHs.",

In our analysis, we employ Gaussian priors on the component spins (mean 0, variance 0.5) and \u03c6 c (mean 0, variance \u03c0). The prior on spin is a way to remain conservative about the spin magnitudes of IMBBHs while that on \u03c6 c is meant to improve the conditioning of the Fisher matrices. The maximum source frame mass for IMBBHs is considered to be 550M because beyond this mass the signal in the CE band has negligible inspiral and hence the parametrized test would not be meaningful.",

The errors from LISA almost monotonically decrease with increasing mass following the inverse of the SNR trend. Furthermore, one also observes cross-overs between the LISA, CE, and/or ET curves for most of the deformation parameters, which is simply an imprint of the similar cross-overs seen in the SNR curves in Fig. 2 . The total mass at which this cross-over happens is different for the SNR and the deformation parameters as the latter have more complicated noise moments [87] (powers of frequency weighted by the noise PSD) that constitute the Fisher matrix.

However CE and ET have more information than LISA on the high frequency PN orders and are able to constrain all of them to \u2264 O(1) accuracy. When we combine the Fisher matrices for LISA and CE (ET), the bounds on \u03b4\u03c6 0 , \u03b4\u03c6 2 and \u03b4\u03c6 3 improve approximately by a factor of 20 to 70 (10 to 30) for masses > 300M .

This two orders of magnitude improvement may seem surprising at first. However, our investigations reveal that this feature is due to the cancellation of several off diagonal terms (which correspond to degeneracies in the parameter space) when we add the Fisher matrices of LISA and CE to obtain the multiband Fisher. Due to this cancellation the inverse of this combined Fisher matrix results in errors that are significantly smaller than the ones from LISA or CE alone.",

The multiband two-dimensional confidence ellipse is in black, whose zoomed-in version is shown in the inset. The area of this ellipse is substantially smaller than that of the LISA and CE. The origin of this feature may be traced to the reduction or cancellations of several off-diagonal terms when the multiband Fisher matrix is constructed. Since the marginalization involves cross-terms in the covariances matrix, the two-dimensional plots are sensitive to such cancellations. Table I provides the areas of the two-dimensional ellipses for various parameter combinations. This is a quantitative demonstration of the complementarity of the two frequency bands very often invoked in the literature to explain the improvements due to multibanding [57] . The top-right panel of Fig. 4 shows the confidence ellipse for \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6 2 for LISA and CE. Unlike the ln M c \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6 2 case, though LISA seems to be able to measure the parameters better, CE's ability to measure these parameters are comparable though slightly worse (see Table I for the estimates of the area).

This can be understood from two features which have already been discussed: (i) the trends in the SNR as a function of total mass, and (ii) higher PN coefficients play a dominant role in the late time dynamics, close to the merger, which falls in the CE band. The effectiveness of a multiparameter test of GR, or for that matter any test of GR, depends on the optimization of these two effects, which leads to a sweet spot for these tests. In our case, this happens to be around a total redshifted mass of 200M . The errors on different deformation parameters in Fig. 3 show slightly different minima, hence there are other values around 200 M that are equally good for these tests. As this choice would have a negligible impact on the conclusions we draw, we stick to a total mass of 200 M with two different choices of component spins to show the projected bounds using multiparameter tests.",

Bounds from the lower order PN side Figure 5 shows the bounds on deformation parameters obtained from the various n-parameter tests starting from 0PN, for an IMBBH with a total redshifted mass of 200M and a mass ratio of 2 with two different spin configurations: \u03c7 1 = 0.2, \u03c7 1 = 0.1 (top panel) and \u03c7 1 = 0.8, \u03c7 2 = 0.7 (bottom panel). The binary is assumed to be at 1 Gpc. As there are seven GR parameters, for each test, we invert a Fisher matrix of dimension 7 + n to obtain the corresponding errors. We find that simultaneous measurement of only seven of the eight PN deformation parameters is possible for this binary configuration if we require the errors on all the PN deformation parameters to be less than or equal to unity. Comparing the top and the bottom panels, it is evident that the increase in spin magnitudes have varied effect on the estimation of PN coefficients, sometimes improving and other times worsening the error bounds. The lower order PN coefficients are also largely unaffected by spin magnitudes. This is a reflection of the fact that spin effects are higher order effects (starting at 1.5PN order) and hence spin dynamics plays a dominant role in the late time dynamics where, again, CE sensitivity has an important role, leading to improved bounds of the higher order PN deformation parameters.",

The worst bounds are for the 2PN and 3PN logarithmic terms which are of O(10 \u22122 ). This precision is unprecedented compared to what LISA and CE would be able to do for supermassive and stellar mass BBHs, respectively, which they are best sensitive to [37] . By increasing the number of parameters that are simultaneously measured, the bounds on all the lower order PN deformation parameters worsen due to the degeneracies present in the waveforms. The addition of the \u03b4\u03c6 5l , \u03b4\u03c6 6 , and \u03b4\u03c6 6l deformation parameters have negligible effect on the bounds on the lower order PN deformation parameters as the correlations of these lower order parameters with the higher order ones are rather weak. However, adding the 3.5PN parameter significantly worsens the bounds on all deformation parameters above 2PN, making the errors go above unity and hence are not shown. This trend is a consequence of the superior ability of LISA to measure the lower order PN coefficients and CE to measure the higher order ones. As we keep adding higher order PN coefficients, the bounds on the lower order ones, which benefit mostly from LISA, are unaffected. However, when we add more and more higher order PN parameters, such as 3.5PN, CE's ability to simultaneously measure them diminishes, leading to an overall worsening of higher order PN deformation parameters' measurement. Despite this, it is impressive to note that, with multibanding, a seven parameter test of GR can yield bounds \u2264 O(1) for all seven PN deformation parameters.",

Though CE is mostly sensitive to the higher order PN coefficients, it does not have enough ability to break the degeneracy between two consecutive PN coefficients which are strongly degenerate. In this case, LISA is also able to offer little help as its role is limited to estimate M c and \u03b7 very well and break their degeneracies with higher PN coefficients.

            "text": "In this section we discuss some of the caveats of our analysis. Uncertainties about the IMBBH population: An important caveat of the results presented here is the uncertainty in the merger rates of IMBBHs. As LIGO/Virgo detectors are yet to see an IMBBH, we have to rely on the state of the art upper limits on their merger rates reported from the first two observing runs [89] . This seems to suggest that IMBBHs with a total mass 200M may have a merger rate lower than \u223c 0.2 Gpc \u22123 yr \u22121 . Since the multiband distance reach for this system is \u223c 1Gpc, this would mean an upper limit on the detection rate of, roughly, one event per year. As we go to higher masses, the upper limits are less stringent. However, as shown earlier, the multiparameter test may become increasingly difficult to carry out for a total mass \u2265 550M . Hence a clear picture about masses of IMBBHs for which this test would perform well will be clearer only in the future with more stringent upper limits or perhaps a detection. The uncertainties in the merger rate and lack of a mass distribution model for IMBBHs also prevents us from assessing how well can a population of IMBBHs improve the test. Use of Fisher matrix based parameter estimation: We have relied on the ability of Fisher information matrix approach to predict the precision with which the PN deformation parameters can be estimated using LISA and CE/ET. The Fisher matrix based approach is expected to be reliable in the limit of high SNR [86, 90, 91] . However, the projected bounds on non-GR parameters from the Fisher matrices for GW150914 and GW151226 have shown good agreements with the results from Bayesian inference [19] reinforcing the utility of Fisher matrix to obtain order of magnitude estimates of the errors. In our case, the SNRs in the CE band are of the order of hundreds to thousands and hence is well within the domain of applicability of Fisher matrix. However, the LISA SNRs are of order \u2265 10 which theoretically falls only marginally within the domain of applicability of this method. Hence our LISA-only results are prone to have uncertainties which need to be quantified using numerical sampling techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo [92] or Nested Sampling [93] . A recent work [51] has paved the way for more work in this direction.",
