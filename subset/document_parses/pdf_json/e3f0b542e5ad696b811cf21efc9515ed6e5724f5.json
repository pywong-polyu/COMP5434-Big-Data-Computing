Combined ED observation and fee-for-service payments are comparable with the bundled diagnosis-related group reimbursement for full admission for these types of patients, and the newly freed inpatient beds can be allotted to patients who are likely to have a larger diagnosis-related group reimbursement.",

Our EDOU is considered a hybrid between a type 1 unit and a type 2 unit because limited protocols have been developed and most patients' care is directed by the EDOU providers. The unit is functional 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and is staffed by an emergency physician and advanced practice providers. Most patients in the observation unit originate from the ED; however, some patients come directly from clinics or procedure areas. By reviewing the cases before placement, case managers determine whether the patients are suitable for observation placement and ensure that the patients are placed under the appropriate level of care. Generally, EDOU placement is a viable option for patients with a medical necessity for a short (less than two-night-long) hospital stay (ie, the two-midnight rule). In our institution, case managers use the Milliman Care Guidelines (MCG) for non-Medicare beneficiaries and consider both the MCG and the two-midnight rule for Medicare beneficiaries to recommend appropriate levels of care. 12 Because the MCG might contradict the two-midnight rule, we educated our ED providers to base their final admission decisions for Medicare beneficiaries on both the medical necessity of a presumed length of stay of one midnight or more and the MCG criteria. 13, 14 Appropriate reimbursable observation placement requires a clinical assessment before placement under observation. This assessment could be performed in an ED or in the clinic.",

Pediatric patients (18 years or younger) were excluded, as these patients are typically admitted to the pediatrics service directly and forego EDOU placement. Patients who were sent for observation outside of the EDOU as a request from their primary oncologist or service were excluded. The majority of these excluded patients were patients with leukemia for whom the leukemia service in our institution requests that patients with leukemia be placed on observation under their service since the conditions of them are more complex and many of these patients are on study protocols. For patients with multiple visits during the study period, only the first visit was analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was disposition from the observation unit.

The reason for observation was assigned on the basis of the primary indication, as stated by the initiating physician. Patients undergoing active chemotherapy and radiotherapy were defined as patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 30 days before hospitalization, and patients undergoing active immunotherapy were defined as patients who received immunotherapy within the past year. Because side effects of immunotherapy can occur months after the last immunotherapy dose, 15 we choose one year as the threshold for immunotherapy. For patients with multiple cancer types, the most active cancer was considered to be the primary cancer. Hypertension, diabetes, renal failure, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and myocardial infarction were chosen for abstraction, as these are some of the most commonly cited comorbidities in the literature for patients with cancer. 16, 17 Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the sociodemographic characteristics of the study population. Continuous variables were reported as medians and interquartile ranges or means and standard deviations, and categorical valuables were analyzed as counts and percentages.

            "text": "Four different settings can be described for observation care units. Type 1 observation care is usually protocoldriven and has a dedicated location in the hospital. Type 2 observation care has a dedicated location in the hospital, but the care is more discretionary and directed by a variety of specialists. 4 The care in type 1 and type 2 units is usually provided by ED providers. Type 3 observation care is protocol-driven, but a type 3 observation unit does not have a dedicated location. Type 4 observation care is discretionary, and the patient could be in any bed on any floor in the hospital. Type 1 and type 2 observation units are more favorable because the care is delivered in a controlled environment by a specific service in charge. Type 1 observation care carries the highest evidence for a favorable outcome. 4 Since the establishment of the EDOU pilot at our institution in 2012, the number of patients with cancer placed in the EDOU has consistently and rapidly increased. From 2012 to 2014, about 30 patients per month were placed on observation, almost 1.5% of our monthly ED census at the time. 9 Over our current 1-year study period, approximately 10% of the patients presenting to the ED were placed in the EDOU, which is also much higher than the 2% previously reported in general observation units. 19, 20 As most patients presenting to our ED are patients with cancer, 5 our finding was more consistent with the 9% observation rate shown in a 2015 study that studied patients with cancer. 10 Patients with cancer presenting to the ED are believed to have more comorbidities and medical conditions, requiring complex decision making and management that ultimately leads to higher hospitalization rates than those for patients without cancer. 5 Because patients with cancer are often older and more medically complex, they often require more time and resources than are available in an ED; thus, the EDOU should be considered for these patients. 21 Our patients were older and had more comorbidities than did conventional patients in EDOUs, 19 ,20 yet we believe that observation medicine can be a viable alternative in patients with cancer. A recent study of a national geriatric patient cohort showed that observation status was becoming more accepted in older adults, even at the cost of higher admission rates from observation units than the traditional ideal 20% admission rate. 22, 23 Although cancer status was not taken into consideration in this study, it is reasonable to assume that the same principle applies to the subgroup of geriatric patients with cancer. In fact, our EDOU patients were admitted 30.4% of the time, which is similar to the findings of existing reports on patients with cancer and older adults. 10, 24, 25 Despite the available data for older adults, a 2017 study matching Medicare patients with cancer to control patients without cancer found that patients with cancer were placed on observation status at lower rates than were their counterparts without cancer. Additionally, patients who are older than 75 years, have a higher comorbidity score, and have been hospitalized previously are even less likely to be placed on observation status. 11 Our institution uses an adapted version of the ESI classification process. 26 In our center, the ESI includes consideration of systolic blood pressure and temperature to better differentiate high-risk scenarios commonly seen in patients with cancer. Furthermore, Adler et al 27 showed that the ESI is predictive of ED disposition in patients with cancer. Most of our patients had an urgent acuity level on ESI classification.",

Interestingly, this was significantly lower than the 72-hour return rate (8.2%) for the patients who were discharged directly from the ED during the same study period. Although the study was not designed to compare these groups, this finding may highlight another potential benefit of the observation unit in the management of patients with cancer, which may potentially lead to lower short-term revisits if some discharged ED patients are . We believe that this novel finding is a surrogate for the safety of the decision-making process in addition to ED revisit rates.",

Unlike our study, it did not specifically look at whether cancer observation patients with comorbidities were more likely to be admitted compared with those without comorbidities after the period of observation. 11 Comorbidities are associated with decreased long-term survival duration in patients with cancer because of alteration in cancer treatment, increase in treatment toxicity, and increased adverse drug interactions. 28, 29 Therefore, comorbidities can translate into longer hospital stays. 30, 31 Several studies have shown that comorbidities contribute not only to the length of stay but also to in-hospital mortality. 32 Still this does not mean that some patients with cancer and comorbidities cannot be safely placed on observation. More research is needed to see how the presence of comorbidities in patients with cancer should steer observation placement decision making.",

Patients with cancer frequently visit the ED for cancer-related pain. However, management of cancer-related pain continues to be challenging for ED clinicians, and many patients leave with continued pain. 33 For this reason, the EDOU should be considered for patients with cancer whose pain complaints are not fully addressed in the ED. Pain management is one of the most common reasons for EDOU placement, not only in our cohort but also as previously reported. 34 Adequately addressing pain will lead to not only decreased mortality but also decreased risk of 30-day hospital readmission and increased patient satisfaction. 33 Patients admitted to the hospital from the EDOU had more consultation requests during their observation stay than did those who were discharged, likely because of the complexity of their medical problems. This highlights that these patients were sicker, requiring further hospital care.",

            "text": "Our study has several important limitations. First, this was a retrospective chart review in a single cancer-specific hospital. Second, the variables collected were limited to what was available from the ED encounter. At our institution, the ED clinicians typically do not document staging or performance status. This is typically documented by the oncologist and may no longer be accurate by the time the patient arrives in the ED. Third, our results may not be the most generalizable. Most patients with leukemia were placed on observation under the leukemia service and not the EDOU. Therefore, they were not included in our study. Additionally, we included 92 patients without a cancer diagnosis, which could affect how these results are applied to the cancer population. However, because of the lack of currently published observation data for patients with cancer, we believe that our findings may affect the number of patients with cancer placed on observation status. Fourth, we limited our study to six comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and myocardial infarction). Other comorbidities that were not accounted for could have contributed to the increased rate of admissions in our patients. Similarly, we limited the chemotherapy-and radiotherapy-related data collection to 30 days and immunotherapy-related data collection to 1 year before the EDOU visit. Despite these time constraints, we believe that our data are representative of our patients since major acute side effects related to chemotherapy and radiation treatment are usually seen within 30 days of such therapy. Finally, the knowledge of the clinicians in the EDOU of a cancer center might differ from that of general emergency medicine practitioners. Previously, we have shown that the majority (93.4%) of the patients seen by the physicians in the ED at MD Anderson Cancer Center consists primarily of patients with cancer. 5 The extensive experience in cancer care that this ED's physicians have may differ from the experience of a general emergency physician or provider, potentially leading to better performance on the metrics measured at the ED studied versus a general ED. We acknowledge that this study was conducted in a tertiary cancer center. Thus, because of our unique setting, our results may not be generalized to other health care organizations given that our data and our medical practice may not reflect those of other noncancer institutions.",

Even so, observation in cancer has the potential to avoid admissions and reserve inpatient hospital resources for patients who can receive the most benefit without compromising care, as it has been shown to do in noncancer populations. Further study is needed to elucidate predictive factors that may further maximize efficiency of observation status by reducing observation to admission rates.
