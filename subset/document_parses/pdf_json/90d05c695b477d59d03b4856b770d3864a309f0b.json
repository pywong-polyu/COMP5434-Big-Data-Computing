Using a dataset of the citation behaviour of 262 students, we find that students who locate and cite particular sources of information receive better grades than those that do not. These findings suggest that students who know how to locate and subsequently cite these sources-which tend to be those regarded as more reliable and of higher quality-will achieve higher grades on their course work. This might sound obvious, but such assumptions are rarely checked; furthermore, such findings might convince doubtful students-and staff-to take information literacy more seriously.",

            "text": "It has long been argued that students of Political Science 1 require sophisticated levels of information literacy to make sense of the world-and to do well in their assignments (Marfleet and Dille 2005; Thornton 2006; Stevens and Campbell 2007) . Various studies have suggested that achieving these high levels of competence is difficult and becoming ever more so as increasing amounts of information are made daily available, largely in the form of online materials. Furthermore, institutions of learning such as universities are struggling to adapt their teaching models to support their students in their regular fight not to become overwhelmed by a tsunami of information. First-year university students are seen as particularly vulnerable. As Shannon and Shannon (2016) note, they face a double problem: relatively low levels of the information skills and experience allied to an over-confidence in their own abilities. \"[T]hey do not know what they do not know \" (2016: 458) . This article will further investigate the information behaviours of first-year Political Science students, at least those based at a particular university in the UK. We will demonstrate a statistically significant relationship between these students' ability to locate and cite particular types of sources and the overall quality of the students' academic work (as reflected in the grades the work receives).",

Third, qualitative methods such as surveys and/or focus groups are the most familiar methods of obtaining insight into students' information behaviours (Carlson 2006) . This study breaks free of those traditional characteristics by being conducted by two political scientists (albeit with considerable assistance from information professionals), by exploring the situation amongst a cohort of first-year students based at a British university, and by utilising a quantitative approach to the investigation. This research will be conducted using a technique known as citation analysis.",

            "text": "Citation analysis has been a tool used by librarians for nearly a century (Middleton 2005: 7) . Influential studies include those by Hovde (2000) in which a simple assessment framework was developed to analyse-in the first instance-the bibliographies of 109 first-year English students. The bibliographies, Hovde argues, provide \"a flexible, non-invasive, time efficient assessment forum for the documentation of student library use\" (2000: 5) . This analysis explored the types of sources used (broken down into the following categories: books; journals and magazines; newspapers; electronic sources; other) and the index source of the articles used (which, in those days, included standalone CD ROMS), and provided a means of measuring changes to student information behaviour that could be easily replicated. Other studies of a similar type include Hinchcliffe et al (2003) , Carlson (2006) , Datig (2016) and Lantz et al (2016) . Of the studies that are concerned with information literacy competence, the assumption throughout is that certain sources-because of attributes such as perceived reliability, academic rigour and author transparency-are regarded as being of higher quality than others, with peer reviewed articles from recognized journals, seen as the \"gold standard\", at one end, and information from websites of dubious authenticity at the other (Lantz et al. 2016: 261) . Though our work largely follows this convention, it is worth noting-as Lantz et al. acknowledge-the information contained in many peer-reviewed research articles can be too complex for many first-year assessments. In short, information generally deemed \"higher quality\" might not always be the most appropriate for a particular task.",

This analysis looked at the proportion of different types of sources but added further investigation of three further areas: the proportion of student citations of specific website domains; the identification of the most cited academic journal titles for each discipline; and the prevalence of interdisciplinary journal usage (Hendley 2012: 99-100) .",

A further 8% was made up of \"newspaper, magazine articles, and other periodical articles\", and \"other sources\" comprised the remaining 6%. In total, 56% of all the citations came from the \"non-traditional sources combined (websites, magazine and newspaper articles, and other sources)\" (Hendley 2012: 103) . Political Science papers included proportionally considerably more non-traditional sources than either History or Sociology papers. Though acknowledging the limitations of this single case-study, Hendley is correct to state that such findings do provide \"useful, preliminary information concerning students' citation patterns\" and do prompt many questions including, \"are the students citing resources that are relevant to their assignment?\" (Hendley 2012: 110) .",

A student's ability to forge this relationship should have an effect on their success in course work.

For example, responses to the question about quality control techniques deployed when using websites were remarkably similar despite the near-decade temporal distance between the cohorts surveyed. Consideration of the credibility of the author(s) and the evaluation of the reputation of the website were the most popular techniques identified each time. Author credibility was named by 35% of both the 2009 cohort and the 2017 cohort, and website reputation was named by 34% of the 2009 intake and by a very similar 36% eight years later. It also appeared that in 2017, just as much as in 2009, the responses of only a minority of students suggested the capability to deliver a coherent web evaluation strategy such as that influentially recommended by Kapoun at the end of the last century (1998; see also Cornell University 2020). In addition, responses to other questions suggested that the students surveyed were no bolder about their information choices in 2017 compared to 2009, indeed the willingness and ability of many students to interact with a variety of electronic repositories of information-bar the inevitable Google-appeared to have diminished.",

Consequently, in the 2019-2020 academic year we conducted a citation analysis of first-year student essays. We anticipated that students who employ information literacy skills to select particular sources for citation will receive better marks than those who employ a less critical approach. This would be in line with the Cardiff University Politics and International Relations undergraduate marking criteria for traditional essays. Of the four main criteria categories, two explicitly tested information literacy skills: \"range and relevance of content\", and quality of \"references and bibliography\" (the other categories are \"academic quality\" and \"style, length and presentation\"). To give one example, to reach the relevant criterion under the \"range and relevance of content\" category at the 2.1 level (60-69%), an essay would need to demonstrate \"good use of a range of relevant sources, demonstrating clear understanding of main ideas\". Yet, just because an attribute is mentioned in the marking criteria does not guarantee that all essays will be judged according to it, so it is worth checking. Moreover, the phrase \"a range of relevant sources\" is vaguefor staff as well as students-thus it is useful to explore precisely which sources provide particular weight when illustrating the achievement of the marking criterion. Ultimately, we have the citation data and the score assigned to each essay written by 262 students taking the module in 2019-2020.",

This module is intended to be taken by first-year Political Science students at Cardiff University and, as such, is one of the first courses taken as part of their degree. As part of the students' overall assessment, they were assigned an essay. The students were asked to respond to one of three essay prompts: (1) Is direct democracy superior to representative democracy? (2) What is the role of the state in the twenty-first century? (3) When, if ever, are constitutions effective? The students were given a strict word limit of 1000 words. Additionally, each student was made aware of the essay at the same point in the semester and given a strict deadline by which they needed to submit the essay. Although the students were assigned a list of required and suggested readings, they could cite any source they felt was needed to support their argument. Some weeks before submission, the students were invited to attend a study skills lecture which included advice about assessing the likely quality of information, touching on subjects such as bias, academic rigour and reputability. Approximately 50% of the students attended. Once submitted, the essays were graded by four different markers following an initial calibration exercise process and the process overseen by a single moderator.",

Moreover, despite the dire warnings occasionally heard in study skills sessions, websites often contain excellent information and some journal articles have proved to be woefully inaccurate. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this research, it was necessary to distinguish some types of information as being likely to be more or less appropriate for the task of completing a first-year Political Science essay. As such, we considered information contained within textbooks, monographs, book chapters, information from government and/or think tanks, and-despite the concerns of Lantz et al. (2016) -journal articles to be more likely to be appropriate for this particular task than the information found in websites, newspapers, and periodicals. References to the former group of sources are those we call, for shorthand, \"quality citations\". On balance, it was felt the latter group were more problematic in relation to such matters as reliability, rigour and transparent authorship. Which side of the line information from governments and, in particular, think tanks fell was a particularly difficult judgement call. Past studies have suggested some students regard information presented by any suitably professional appearing think tank to be largely factual and apolitical. For example, one student reported that the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute to be political neutral, perhaps reading too much into the claim on the organization's website that the body is independent and nonpartisan (Thornton 2012: 214) . Nevertheless, it was felt that the potential relevance of the information contained outweighed the possible issues regarding reliability and bias, at least for the essay topics under consideration.",

As mentioned before, because the coefficient is the result of an ordinary least squares model, it is directly interpretable. For every 1 unit increase in the quality ratio there is a 6.382 increase in the student's mark. Because the quality ratio variable is bounded by 0 and 1, this suggests that from the minimum to the maximum value of the quality ratio variable there is a change of 6.382 points. This finding is in line with our expectations. It suggests that the more a student relies upon sources perceived as higher quality to craft and support their argument the better they will have been judged to have performed. We also controlled for the number of sources that a student used. We find that the coefficient for this variable is positive and statistically significant. As we mentioned before, this is a categorial variable. The size of the coefficient suggests that as a student moves To ensure that we were capturing a student's information literacy skills, we also employed an independent variable that considers quality sources while excluding textbook citations in model 2. As can be seen, the coefficient for this variable is positive and statistically significant. The size of this coefficient, 7.008, suggests that from the lowest proportion of quality citations, 0, to the highest, 1, a student's mark will improve by 7.008 points. This finding adds even further evidence for our argument, namely that students able to identify and rely more heavily upon sources of information perceived as higher quality are judged to have performed better, on average, than their peers.",

We demonstrate the ability to seek out sources generally recognized as being of higher quality does have a significant positive impact on grades awarded, and that using certain types of information-such as government or think tank statistical data-can provide a particularly positive step towards the recognition of academic merit in a student's work. Thus, this work demonstrates that which is generally just assumed, namely that one of the key determinants of student success is the ability to select carefully the sources from which they draw their information. This provides further motivation for students and faculty alike to take information literacy seriously, not least as the information source that surprisingly proved to be the most effective for improving grades-think tank data-is amongst the most dangerous for the uncritical user. Further research remains to make these findings yet more robust and to find out what strategies for stimulating Political Science students' information literacy work best.",

The major problem introduced by collinearity is that it makes the regression estimates unreliable and unstable (Hair et al. 2009 ).As can be seen, the model that employs this variable badly fails this test, as any variable with over a VIF value of 10 suggesting that there are very high and problematic levels of collinearity. Ultimately, the results from this regression are Publisher's Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations. ",
