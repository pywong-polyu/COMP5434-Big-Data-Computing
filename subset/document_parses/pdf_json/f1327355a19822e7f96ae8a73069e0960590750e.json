            "text": "Although local malaria transmission has decreased substantially over the past two decades, 120 million people continue to have some risk of infection in Latin America and the Caribbean. 1 The Amazon Basin accounts for approximately 90% of the malaria cases in the Americas; 72% of them are due to Plasmodium vivax. Rural communities such as riverine villages, frontier farming settlements, gold mining enclaves, and Amerindian reserves are disproportionally affected. 2 Despite the low force of infection found across the Amazon, nearly one order of magnitude lower than that in rural Africa, 3 a minority of highly exposed individuals develops clinical immunity to malaria following infection and eventually constitutes a substantial infectious reservoir comprising asymptomatic parasite carriers that are overlooked by routine surveillance. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Importantly, blood from asymptomatic P. vivax carriers can infect local malaria vectors despite low mean parasite density. 9 The Amazon has experienced an accelerated urban growth, characterised by massive rural-to-urban migration, unplanned housing and inadequate infrastructure, that challenges its conventional representation as a densely forested territory interspersed by small and isolated human settlements. 10 Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba This is the first population-based cohort study to address the emerging risk of malaria transmission in urbanised spaces in the Amazon. \u25ba Nearly 20% of the households in town of M\u00e2ncio Lima, the main urban malaria hotspot in Brazil, were randomly drawn from census listings and 2690 participants were enrolled and followed-up since April 2018. \u25ba Sociodemographic, occupational, behavioural, and morbidity information, travel histories, and capillary blood samples were collected during five study visits; venous blood from confirmed malaria infections have been cryopreserved for genetic/genomic and phenotypic parasite characterisation. \u25ba Main potential limitations include: (1) generalisability of the study results since the cohort population comprises residents in a single malaria hotspot in the Amazon; (2) loss to follow-up due to the high mobility of the target population; and (3) risk of recall bias during interviews.",

This population-based open cohort study was set up to investigate a wide range of biological and sociodemographic factors that drive malaria endemicity in the main urban transmission hotspot of Amazonian Brazil. The long-term goal is to provide scientific evidence that can be translated into effective public health interventions for malaria control and elimination. The original study has since expanded to include SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody measurements during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in this hard-hit region and investigate possible interactions between dengue and COVID-19. 17 ",

            "text": "The M\u00e2ncio Lima cohort study aims to investigate malaria epidemiology, diagnostics, transmission dynamics and clinical pathogenesis in Amazonian Brazil. The study site, the town of M\u00e2ncio Lima (07\u00b036'51\"S, 72\u00b053'45\"W), is situated in the upper Juru\u00e1 Valley region of Acre State, westernmost Brazil, close to the border with Peru (online supplemental figure 1 ). Because urban areas in Brazil are defined according to relatively arbitrary administrative rules that do not necessarily consider population density and other internationally adopted criteria, 18 we delimitated the town of M\u00e2ncio Lima essentially as done by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics but extended the urban area to two urbanised neighbourhoods (Iracema and P\u00e9 da Terra) situated along the main road that crosses the town, following 'urbanicity' criteria developed for use in this setting. 19 At the time of the study onset, the municipality of M\u00e2ncio Lima had an annual parasite incidence (number of new laboratory-confirmed malaria cases per 1000 people per year) estimated at 422.8, the highest for a municipality in Brazil. 20 With a typical equatorial humid climate, the area receives most rainfall between November and April, but malaria transmission occurs year round. P. vivax accounts for 84% of local malaria cases and P. falciparum for 14%;<2% are coinfections with both species. 21 P. vivax infections are routinely treated with chloroquine (total dose, 25 mg of base/kg over 3 days) and primaquine (0.5 mg of base/kg/ day for 7 days) and P. falciparum infections are treated with a fixed-dose combination of artemether (2-4 mg/kg/ day) and lumefantrine (12-24 mg/kg/day) for 3 days. 22 Both treatment regimens remain highly efficacious in this area. 23 24 Study population A baseline population census was conducted in M\u00e2ncio Lima between November 2015 and April 2016. We enumerated 9124 permanent residents in the urban area, with ages ranging between <1 month and 105 years, distributed into 2329 households. 21 The cohort study sample comprises all members of randomly chosen urban households in M\u00e2ncio Lima. We used simple probability sampling to draw 534 households from the list of those enumerated during the baseline census survey. We allowed for up to 2.9% non-localised or empty houses and refusals and aimed to enrol at least 20% of all households in the town. Because the target sample size was not reached during the baseline visit, we used a list of randomly chosen substitute households during the second visit to replace households that declined participation or were not located. Because this cohort study was designed to evaluate a wide range of sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory exposures in the same population, no formal a priori sample size and power calculations were made. Figure 1 presents the study flow chart. During the first study visit, between April and May 2018, we targeted the 534 households drawn from the census listings; 1391 residents from 354 households were located and agreed to participate. To achieve the desired sample size, 147 'substitute' households were randomly selected and approached during the second visit, in October-November 2018. The ongoing cohort is dynamic and new residents joining the household (those who moved in or were born between study visits) are enrolled during the follow-up visits. Study participants leaving the sampled households are retained in the cohort as long as they can be located by the field team and their new residences, which are labelled as new households, are situated in the urban area of M\u00e2ncio Lima. As a consequence, the total number of households in the sample has increased since the second visit (figure 1). Some study participants could not be located during a follow-up visit but are later 'rescued' during the next visits, as indicated in figure 1; those who die or leave the town are withdrawn. Participants who died, moved away from the study site, and those who withdrew their consent to participate were considered lost for follow-up. Five house visits were carried out until November 2020 and two follow-up visits are planned for 2021. Subject to funding, follow-up will continue after 2021.",

A total of 2690 residents were interviewed during at least one follow-up visit and 981 (36.5%) participated in all Open access visits (online supplemental figure 2 ). Capillary blood was obtained from 77.6% to 84.4% of participants in each visit, with a total of 7781 samples collected (table 3) . Reasons for not providing blood samples included age below 3 months and inability or refusal to perform a finger puncture. Compared with the total population of M\u00e2ncio Lima enumerated during the baseline census, the study sample has a very similar distribution according to sex and age groups (online supplemental figure 3 ) and place of residence (online supplemental figure 4) . Overall malaria prevalence rates determined by microscopy during the study visits ranged between 0.1% and 1.0% for P. vivax and 0.0% and 0.6% for P. falciparum; 39 of 62 (62.9%) infections were asymptomatic within 1 week prior to blood collection (table 3) . Ongoing analyses indicate that our PCR protocol detects up to 10 times more malaria infections than microscopy in cohort participants, but further standardisation and validation are in progress. Analyses published to date combined baseline information with routinely collected malaria surveillance data. We found a marked heterogeneity in malaria risk in the study population. Adult males are at greatest risk of infection; poor housing and residence in the less urbanised periphery of the town are additional predictors of elevated malaria risk. 21 Nearly 14% of the study participants, mostly young children and the elderly, comprise a very low-risk fraction of the population who tend to remain uninfected. 21 We used compartmental susceptibleinfected-susceptible transmission models to quantify malaria risk heterogeneity at the community level. We estimate that 20% of the residents contribute 86% of the overall burden of P. vivax infection in M\u00e2ncio Lima. 3 These high-risk individuals eventually develop clinical immunity to malaria and constitute the asymptomatic infectious reservoir that fuels onwards transmission.",

Second, the incidence of clinical malaria between study visits is estimated from malaria case notifications in the study population. These are essentially symptomatic infections diagnosed by conventional microscopy. The main limitation of routine surveillance data is that blood samples are not available for further confirmatory diagnostic tests. Moreover, although surveillance comprises virtually all malaria episodes diagnosed by microscopy, Open access submicroscopic and asymptomatic malaria episodes experienced by the study population between follow-up visits are overlooked. There has been considerable cohort attrition from initial recruitment to the most recent follow-up visit, 32 months later. The study population is very mobile and many people are involved in seasonal work in surrounding rural areas. Study participants, especially those who have a second residence, often leave the town either temporally or definitively. This may reduce the statistical power to test for associations between less prevalent exposures and outcomes.
