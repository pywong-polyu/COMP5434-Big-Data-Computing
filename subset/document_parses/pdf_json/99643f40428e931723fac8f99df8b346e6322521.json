We find that the pandemic has led to a shift in housing demand away from neighborhoods with high population density. The reduced demand for density is driven partially by the diminished need for living close to telework-compatible jobs and the declining value of access to consumption amenities. Neighborhoods with high pre-COVID-19 home values also see a greater drop in housing demand. Moreover, we find a significant shift in housing demand away from large cities, though the magnitude is smaller.",

Because of the drop in visits to amenities during the pandemic, the value of living closer to premium locations could decline. 3. Dense neighborhoods tend to have higher costs of housing due to the lower housing supply elasticities (Baum-Snow and Han, 2020). As the need for living in these locations diminishes, the value of bearing such high housing costs to be in these locations could decrease. 3 We present empirical evidence that lends support to all of the conjectures. We find that home inventory growth is higher in neighborhoods with a greater share of telework-compatible jobs, a larger per-capita number of restaurants, and higher pre-COVID-19 home prices, indicating a spatial shift in demand from these neighborhoods. Home price and rent growth picks up some of the spatial variation. We also find a shift in housing demand away from large and expensive cities, although the magnitude is smaller than the shift from central cities to the suburbs. This paper contributes to the literature on how city structures change in the presence of the dispersion forces of diseases (Davis et al., 2021; Delventhal et al., 2021) . Recent papers have documented migration and bid-rent curve patterns consistent with our findings (Ramani and Bloom, 2021; Althoff et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2021) . We are the first to examine the effect of the pandemic on neighborhood-level variation in housing demand and to test the underlying driving forces.",
