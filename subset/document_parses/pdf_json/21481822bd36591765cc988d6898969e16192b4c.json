The aim is to provide an explanation for the global rise of conservative attitudes. Acknowledging that the current situation is but a snapshot in a still evolving crisis, these explanations are intended as an initial social scientific cut rather than a complete evaluation of the social consequences of the pandemic.",

Thus far, the pandemic has had the effect of strengthening national borders and concomitant anti-foreign sentiments, which the world was already witnessing on account of Brexit and as part of the US-American executive policies. Similar social and political trends were also observed in Asia, where there had been reports of rising nationalism during the first half-year of the pandemic. Given these trends, is it reasonable to ask whether the global population will eventually find itself in a politically and socially closed-off world as a consequence of COVID-19?",

The former entails a complex set of evolved cognitive and behavioural mechanisms. These psychological mechanisms work to detect visible signs of infection (e.g., signs of pustules) and accelerate adaptive responses (e.g., avoidance) to pre-empt the negative impact of pathogen stress even before an infection has struck (Schaller & Park, 2011) . While the PIS serves as the first line of defence against an infection, the BIS is activated by 'visible' cues, e.g., specific facial anomalies associated with infections (Ryan et al., 2012) . Often, these overt cues do not perfectly predict who carries a disease. As such, the BIS may 'overreact' and lead to false positive errors. Therefore, the activation of the BIS can have far-reaching implications for a host of psychological functions, including political preferences (Billingsley et al., 2018) and social relationships (Ji et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "A radical component of the BIS mechanism involves the exclusion of members of ethnic out-groups. As humans developed an exquisite immune system that is well-equipped to combat pathogens prevalent among the members of a particular social group or in-group, it proved adaptive to avoid any foreign or 'exotic' pathogens carried by out-group members. These evolved behavioural mechanisms, apt for pre-industrial, small-scale living conditions, are ill suited for dealing with the infectious threats of the modern world. This is because evolutionary forces lag behind the pace of industrialisation and have failed to fashion pathogen avoidance mechanisms that could be better suited to our contemporary connected world (e.g., Ackerman et al., 2020) . At the group or societal level, pathogens have been found to co-vary globally with authoritarianism and exclusionary attitudes towards ethnic out-group members, because people prefer authoritative leaders to orchestrate collective social action in the service of 'group survival' (refer, Fincher et al., 2008; Gelfand et al., 2011) . In line with this theorising, Hartman et al. (2020) documented a direct link between the perceived threat of COVID-19 and authoritarian and anti-immigrant attitudes based on a cross-sectional representative survey in the UK in March 2020. Previous studies show that people in the United States exhibited exclusionary attitudes towards immigrants after simply reading about the health risks associated with swine flu during the HINI pandemic (Huang et al., 2011) and the 2014 Ebola outbreak (Kim et al., 2016) .",

Whether this will lead to novel kinds of 'ethnophobia' or even 'theophobia' remains to be seen. Alternatively, we may witness new cooperation across societies concomitant with a weakening of the 'us' versus 'them' divide; a strategy that requires the inclusion of 'everyone' in a unified global attempt to fight the pathogen. Until the pandemic descends from its current global peak, we hope that this commentary serves as a 'turntable' for speculating about its political and social aftermath, and that this will involve the cooperation of researchers from a variety of disciplines.",
