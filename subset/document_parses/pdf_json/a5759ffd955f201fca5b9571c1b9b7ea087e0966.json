            "text": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are vulnerable to oxidation. Foods that contain PUFAs undergo lipid oxidation during food preparation, processing, and storage. This non-enzymatic thermal oxidation of PUFA results in the formation of primary oxidation products, which are hydroperoxy and hydroxy fatty acids of the parent fatty acid. For example, oxidation of linoleic acid, the most common fatty acid consumed in theUnited States (US) results in the formation of 13-hydroperoxy linoleic acid (13-HPODE), which is then reduced to13-hydroxy linoleic acid . With subsequent increase in time and/or temperature, these primary products of oxidation undergo scission between carbon atoms and form short, secondary products of oxidation such as aldehydes, ketones, and epoxy compounds. While the impact of oxidation, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic, of endogenous lipids has been investigated extensively [1] [2] [3] [4] , studies investigating the risk of chronic diseases by dietary oxidized lipids (DOL) (in other words, exogenous lipids), are just beginning to emerge [5] [6] [7] . While the digestibility of DOL is lower than that of unoxidized lipids [8, 9] , they are absorbed and transported in the plasma [10] and undergo cellular metabolism. Studies, primarily in animal models using heated vegetable oils as a source of DOL have demonstrated that DOL consumption is associated with hypertension [11] , atherosclerosis [12, 13] , and glucose intolerance [6, 14] . To translate the work from animals to humans, it would be necessary to know the oxidized lipid content of commonly consumed foods.",

This transcription factor is essential for adipocyte differentiation and maintenance of healthy adipose tissue [15, 16] and is a mediator of inflammation [17] . Furthermore, pharmaceutical activation of PPAR\u03b3 by thizolidienediones, agonists of PPAR\u03b3, promotes glucose tolerance. Of great interest is the demonstration that oxidized fatty acids as compared to unoxidized fatty acids are excellent ligands of PPAR\u03b3 [18, 19] , suggesting a role for oxidized fatty acids in adipose tissue and glucose homeostasis. However, it is not known if food-derived oxidized lipids are ligands of PPAR\u03b3.",

Four concentrations of each sample were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.001%. A 384-well plate was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol, and all assays were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. The plates were read at 450 nm in a Victor 3 spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Serial dilutions of the standard (rosiglitazone) and a known PPAR\u03b3 antagonist (GW9662) were read concurrently with the samples. Unheated and heated vegetable oil samples were hydrolyzed by alkaline hydrolysis (see Section 2.7) and prepared as serial dilutions, beginning with a 1% solution, and diluted by half with DMSO to yield a total of 12 concentrations.",

Furthermore, unlike the vegetable oil tested in this study, which demonstrated a continuous increase in lipid oxidation products with time and thermal stress (with the exception of lipid hydroperoxides), products of lipid oxidation did not increase significantly with time in walnuts, sunflower seeds, flax meal, and enriched infant formula. Instead, the peroxide and aldehyde values were significantly lower after three months of storage while the conjugated dienes did not change. It is possible that under the storage conditions used in this study, the decomposition of peroxides was greater than their generation. A similar explanation would support the decrease in the aldehyde content. In other words, aldehydes, due to their volatile nature, although present in foods at time of purchase, might evaporate over time.

The peroxide value of walnuts on the purchase day was higher by 43% and 330% compared to those reported by Aghdam and Chee [23, 24] , respectively. These higher levels could be attributed to the fact we used store-bought walnuts with an unknown harvest date while in both previous studies, walnuts were freshly harvested. The mean PV of the fish oil estimated in this study, 4.39 meq/kg, is similar to that purchased in Australia (range 2.77-4.63 meq/kg) [25] and the study by Zyoud and colleagues [26] , who reported a combined mean PV of 6.4 meq/kg for fish oil capsules purchased in the USA, Canada, India, and the EU. The fact that our study demonstrated that the PV stayed the same after storage for three months and was within the maximum reference limit (5 meq/kg fat) set by the Global Organization of EPA and DHA (GOED) suggests that omega rich fish oil capsules are oxidatively stable in storage. Hussain and colleagues [27] reported no significant changes in the PV, conjugated dienes, and aldehyde content of flax meal stored at 20-25 \u00b0C for 90 days. This is different from the present study where we report a significant decrease in the PV and aldehyde values in flax meal after storage. In addition, we report a much higher amount of PV on the purchase date, 9.94 meq/kg as compared to 0.15 meq/kg, and this could be explained by the fact that flax meal in the previous study was freshly made from seeds while we purchased flax meal from the ",

Instead, the peroxide and aldehyde values were significantly lower after three months of storage while the conjugated dienes did not change. It is possible that under the storage conditions used in this study, the decomposition of peroxides was greater than their generation. A similar explanation would support the decrease in the aldehyde content. In other words, aldehydes, due to their volatile nature, although present in foods at time of purchase, might evaporate over time. This suggests that the initiation of lipid oxidation is minimal under conditions that mimic storage in a food pantry.",

            "text": "The quantity of lipid oxidation products in the RTF were both similar and dissimilar to previous studies. The peroxide value of walnuts on the purchase day was higher by 43% and 330% compared to those reported by Aghdam and Chee [23, 24] , respectively. These higher levels could be attributed to the fact we used store-bought walnuts with an unknown harvest date while in both previous studies, walnuts were freshly harvested. The mean PV of the fish oil estimated in this study, 4.39 meq/kg, is similar to that purchased in Australia (range 2.77-4.63 meq/kg) [25] and the study by Zyoud and colleagues [26] , who reported a combined mean PV of 6.4 meq/kg for fish oil capsules purchased in the USA, Canada, India, and the EU. The fact that our study demonstrated that the PV stayed the same after storage for three months and was within the maximum reference limit (5 meq/kg fat) set by the Global Organization of EPA and DHA (GOED) suggests that omega rich fish oil capsules are oxidatively stable in storage. Hussain and colleagues [27] reported no significant changes in the PV, conjugated dienes, and aldehyde content of flax meal stored at 20-25 \u2022 C for 90 days. This is different from the present study where we report a significant decrease in the PV and aldehyde values in flax meal after storage. In addition, we report a much higher amount of PV on the purchase date, 9.94 meq/kg as compared to 0.15 meq/kg, and this could be explained by the fact that flax meal in the previous study was freshly made from seeds while we purchased flax meal from the grocery store. Of the RTF that were tested, enriched infant formula had the highest amount of PV on the purchase date but did not change significantly after 3-month storage. Previous studies have also demonstrated that omega 3-enriched infant formulas contain higher amounts of lipid hydroperoxides and MDA as compared to un-enriched infant formula [28] . The levels of lipid oxidation products in French fries and chicken nuggets were similar to those in the RTF and not higher as we originally hypothesized. However, since we did not know the type of oil, its reuse, or frying temperature, it is difficult to examine the results within the context of work from other laboratories. Since these results suggest that oxidized lipids are already present in foods at the time of purchase, clinical trials should be conducted to study their metabolic fate in the short term and health effects in the long term.",

For example, fish oil, which had the highest amount of vitamin E (2 IU/g PUFA), had the lowest levels of lipid oxidation products as compared to flax meal and enriched infant formula, which contained 1.46 IU and 0.01 IU of vitamin E/g PUFA, respectively. On the other hand, despite the presence of vitamin E and C, enriched infant formula had the highest PV per serving (0.1 mEq/serving) owing to the presence of the highest amount of the prooxidant iron (1.75 mg/g PUFA) as compared to all other foods. Infant formulas in the US are mandated to be enriched with iron, and the more recent trend of enriching formula with omega 3 PUFA for its purported brain health benefits needs to be revisited. This is especially relevant in light of a recent meta-analysis that demonstrated a lack of evidence of correlation between omega 3 fatty acid supplementation and infant health, especially in the areas of brain health and growth [30] . Nonetheless, addition of novel food-based antioxidants to PUFA-rich foods should become a common practice in the food industry.",

            "text": "It is well established that fatty acids and their derivatives are agonists of PPAR\u03b3, but more recent studies have demonstrated that nutrients other than fatty acids, such as polyphenols, arginine, and glutamine, are also ligands of this promiscuous receptor [18] . To our knowledge, we are the first to report on the ligand binding ability of lipids extracted from commonly consumed foods. Of the oils tested, oil extracted from French fries demonstrated decreased binding (increased affinity) to PPAR\u03b3, and this was significantly different from all other foods that were tested with the exception of flax meal and fish oil. Since only primary products of lipid oxidation such as 13-HODE, 9-HODE, and 13-oxoHODE are ligands of PPAR\u03b3, we hypothesized that foods with higher CD values (representing hydroxy, epoxy, and oxo-fatty acids) would have higher binding affinities. However, we were unable to see this connection as demonstrated by the fact even though French fries, chicken nuggets, and enriched fish oil had similar amounts of CD (15-20 E 234 1 ), only French fries demonstrated the lowest binding affinity. It is well known that when vegetable oils with a higher PUFA content are subjected to higher temperatures, as in frying, they yield more oxidized PUFAs [31, 32] . This effect is demonstrated as a decrease in un-oxidized PUFA and MUFA contents of vegetable oils with increasing time and temperature [31] . Thus, it is plausible that the fries tested in this study were prepared with an oil with a higher PUFA content as compared to the oil used to prepare the chicken nuggets. The higher PUFA content might have generated a sufficient amount of oxidized lipids to demonstrate PPAR\u03b3 binding. Furthermore, emerging studies suggest that nutrients, other than oxidized fatty acids, such as curcumin, capsaicin, and a variety of flavonoids, are agonists of PPAR\u03b3 [33] . In other words, we cannot rule out that fat extracted from this one brand of French fries contained other PPAR\u03b3 ligands. The lack of binding seen with most foods could be explained by the idea that oxidized intact triglycerides, polymers, and dimers are not ligands of PPAR\u03b3. However, it is known that lipid oxidation leads to some hydrolysis of fatty acids, thereby generating ligands for PPAR\u03b3. To test this further, we subjected unheated and heated vegetable oils to alkali hydrolysis but failed to see any improvement in the binding affinity. It is possible that the assay kit used in this study was sub-optimal for screening samples with low levels of PPAR\u03b3 ligands. We reached this conclusion because as stated in the assay kit description, the IC 50 for rosiglita-zone was in the mM range, which is much higher than other assays that demonstrate IC 50 values in the lower nM range for this PPAR\u03b3 agonist.",

While this might have been less optimal in quantifying absolute amounts of lipid peroxides, it is still an accurate reflection of the relative amounts of lipid peroxides in foods determined in this study. Another possible limitation is that we did not determine the fatty acid composition of the extracted lipids. While it is true that standard methodology such as gas chromatography exists for quantifying fatty acids, methods to determine individual oxidized fatty acids, such as hydroxy, hydroperoxy, epoxy, and keto fatty acids from a complex mixture, are methodologically challenging and were not available during the study. We are glad to report that recently we were able to determine oxidized fatty acids in fat extracted from potatoes that were either oven-fried or deep-fried using three different vegetable oils by redox-lipidomics [32] .",

Based on the foods tested in this study, storage of foods at room temperature for three months does not increase lipid oxidation. However, the fact that products of lipid oxidation were present on the date of purchase suggests that the US population consumes oxidized lipids. Oxidized lipids extracted from foods in this study, for the most part, with the exception of French fries and flax meal, did not bind to PPAR\u03b3. This lack of binding remained despite our efforts to release free fatty acids from oxidized triglycerides. One possible explanation for this could be that the concentration of the oxidized lipids was too low to be detected by this kit. We feel that employing a combination of techniques such as thermal shift assay, ANS fluorescence quenching, and food lipid-bound crystallographic studies of the PPAR\u03b3 ligand binding domain [35] might help overcome this problem. Subsequently, if future studies are able to establish that commonly consumed foods harbor oxidized lipids that act as PPAR\u03b3 ligands, then future studies can investigate the cellular/molecular mechanisms by which these dietary oxidized lipids alter adipose tissue metabolism and glucose homeostasis.
