The autonomous features of fleet elements of the delivery network are enabled by the increased throughput, improved coverage, and near-user computation capabilities of vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets). A high altitude platform station (HAPS), located around 20 km above the ground level in a quasi-stationary manner, serves as the main enabler of the vision we present. In addition to the sensing potential of the HAPS nodes, the use of communication, computing, and caching capabilities demonstrate the attainability of the ambitious goal of serving a fully autonomous aerial fleet capable of addressing instantaneous user demands and enabling supply chain management interactions with delivery services in low-latency settings.",

A steady increase in the amount of e-commerce activities has been noted in numerous reports. An analysis by ACI Worldwide states that the transaction volumes in most retail sectors saw a 74% increase in March 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic [1] . The increase in e-commerce activities also increased the load on the delivery sector. The need for viable solutions to this problem became more apparent with skyrocketing demands and prolonged delivery times. To maintain efficient operations, delivery services involving autonomous devices have emerged as a promising solution. In this view, conventional delivery services, involving cars or trucks, will be supplemented by emerging aerial delivery fleets. The autonomy of these devices will range from a fully human operated level 0 to a fully autonomous level 5.",

We present a realistic vision of a next-generation delivery network with a focus on issues pertaining to connectivity as well as computation, caching, and sensing. Among others, instantaneous navigation, traffic status, the energy level monitoring and the related prediction applications can be guided by the ML algorithms executed at the serving HAPS node. Furthermore in addition to location sensing, collection and gathering of the sensed data is possible at the HAPS node in terms of the sensing capabilities. Below, we describe the main components of providing a fully connected, high rate, and low-latency 3D network. The solution we envision makes the use of high altitude platform station (HAPS) systems as an essential component. This architecture is also in line with the emerging literature on 6G networks. In our view, the main catalyzer will be HAPS constellations, which offer an excellent synergy between evolving terrestrial networks and emerging low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations. By using HAPS for connectivity, caching, and computational offloading, we will have the opportunity to the enable all these functionalities at the network edge, hence we can significantly benefit from the expected performance improvement as clearly highlighted in [3] and quantified in [4] . With this feature, we predict that next-generation delivery networks will soon become a reality, even in densely populated metropolitan areas.",

The reason is basic geometry: the antenna patterns are sectorized and directional, which means they do not transmit signals skyward. Although under ideal conditions 3D spherical coverage can be modeled, in practice no antenna can satisfy this ideal design. 3GPP study items TR 22.926 Guidelines for Extra-territorial 5G Systems and TR 22.839 Study on vehicle-mounted relays investigate the use of drone-mounted base stations. Although these can provide coverage for a specific height, the contiguous coverage probability at all heights is not feasible for metropolitan areas. The problem is mainly due to the beam patterns of base station antennas, which results in a high number of sidelobesin a 3D pattern. This set-up also introduces another problem in the case of densely deployed devices with ultra-high mobility, such as swarms of drones, where the handoff of each node may introduce a substantial delay to the system. Considering LEO satellites, although they can provide service to the operating altitudes of drones, the high speed of the satellites (with speeds of approximately 7 km/s) introduce a high load from a mobility management perspective.

Symmetric elevation and azimuth beamwidths are considered. Even when the beam is pointing almost 10 km away from the depicted region, almost uniform gain are observed towards the ground.

A Ricean fading model has often been considered in HAPS connections [7] . These geometric advantages can compensate for the high path loss of the ground-HAPS connections as the HAPS nodes are located at 20 km above ground level. HAPS nodes have a wide line-of-sight area that rather advantageous while sensing the ground considering location sensing and sensed data collection and gathering.

For the sustainable management of these vehicles, along with corresponding regulations, proper route planning is a must. To help in planning, 3D highways are being considered by NASA and FAA under the UTM activities [5] . The guidelines and regulations aim to provide a monitored speed region for metropolitan deliveries. This solution evokes the famous 1980s cartoon series, the Jetsons. Mimicking the highway/street hierarchy of terrestrial roads, multiple regulated speed limits within these drone highways can make the operation of multiple fleet elements possible, which can provide scalable retail solutions for next generation consumer networks. The quasi-structured mobility restrictions will facilitate the operations of a drone fleet with mobile fleet elements, especially in densely populated areas due to the large coverage area that may be provided by the HAPS node thanks to its high altitude. The ubiquitous access to the optimization engine supported by AI will enable near real-time planning over these 3D highways, enabling the instantaneous reactions of the drones while operating. The availability of the navigation and the route planning data will also provide an increased level of safety and reliability. The advantageous channel characteristics of the 3D coverage provided by a HAPS are clearly shown in Fig. 5 . In line with the models in the literature, varying line-of-sight power (K parameter) values are considered for a Ricean channel, and the average outage probability values are shown for an aerial highway of the dimensions noted in Fig. 4 . The corresponding simulation parameters are given in Table I . The average outage probabilities of the volumes of the 3D aerial highway 1 , plotted in Fig. 5 , according to the changing channel conditions show that, as the K value increases an outage becomes less excepted. Yet even in the absence of a line of sight (K= 0), the average outage can be adjusted according to the desired level by changing the transmit power value. The terrestrial base stations simply cannot provide coverage at this height, as opposed to the acceptably low outage probabilities that a HAPS can provide in a 3D aerial highway.",
