Acknowledging that COVID-19 will not be the world's last pandemic, improving healthy living factors (i.e., physical activity, healthful nutrition, healthy weight), which are important in mitigating negative outcomes of future infectious disease pandemics, should be prioritized. Although well-documented, promoting healthy living factors remains challenged by a lack of scalability and sustainability due, in part, to a mismatch between intervention focus on individual behavior change as opposed to recognizing complex and multifactorial causes that prevent people from living healthy lifestyles and maintaining them long-term (such as political will, economic benefits, urban planning, etc.). To recognize this complexity in promoting healthy living, we propose the application of systems science methods for the creation of a comprehensive causal systems map of healthy living factors in the context of COVID-19 to inform future pandemic preparedness. Generating such a map would benefit researchers, practitioners, and policy makers in multi-sector collaborative efforts to improve public health preparedness in the context of future pandemics in a scalable, sustainable, and equitable manner. This effort should be facilitated by a trusted and widely respected governing body with global reach.",

For example, habitual physical activity plays a pivotal role in improving immunosurveillance against pathogens and reduces morbidity and mortality from viral infections and respiratory illnesses including influenza, pneumonia, and the common cold [2] . Preliminary data indicate that consistently meeting physical activity guidelines constitutes a significant protective factor against risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related outcomes [3] . Additionally, obesity, a health-related factor directly influenced by physical activity and diet, has shown to be a significant risk factor for adverse COVID-19 related outcomes [4] . Both COVID-19 and obesity have broad global health impacts and are recognized as causal factors in the largest decline in U.S. life expectancy since World War II [5] . Thus, promoting physical activity, healthful nutrition, and healthy living circumstances that mitigate a propensity towards obesity represent necessary actions for endemic and future pandemic preparedness, whilst acknowledging that COVID-19 will not be the world's last pandemic. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened public awareness of the need for positive health behaviors, there is an opportunity to leverage the public's attention and to integrate healthy living behaviors into the contexts of how people live their lives.

These frameworks visually represent broad but interconnected considerations such as transport, societal, sociopolitical, sector-specific, individual, and biological factors. The maps are also useful to identify and make explicit the potential mechanisms that may drive improvement in each of these factors separately. However, existing maps lack the context of multiple healthy living factors interacting with the severe shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic to systems that affect people's lives in overarching and myriad ways.
