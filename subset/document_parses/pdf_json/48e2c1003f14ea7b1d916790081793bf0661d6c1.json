The flexible conversion of strategies is helpful for improving the efficiency and success rate of treatment.

The treatment of cardiovascular disease includes anti-myocardial ischemia, high blood pressure treatment, the control of ventricular rate of atrial fibrillation, and the control of ventricular arrhythmia. The treatment of heart failure involves the following: (a) treatment of chronic heart failure: HFrEF: diuretics (up to 2000 mL in 24 hours), beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), spironolactone; HFmrEF and HFpEF: while the curative effect of beta-blockers and ARB/ACEI remains unclear, spironolactone can reduce the risk of hospitalization of patients for heart failure in HFpEF; (b) the treatment of AMI pump failure: (i) pulmonary congestion (\u2212), insufficient tissue perfusion (\u2212): adjust oral drugs only; (ii) pulmonary congestion (+), insufficient perfusion (\u2212): due diuresis, static drops of nitrate preparation; (iii) pulmonary congestion (\u2212), perfusion insufficiency (+): if the heart rate is slow, increase heart rate;",

The current diagnosis includes a positive viral nucleic acid test, highly homologous gene sequencing, and immunoglobulin positive (Ig)M/ IgG antibody test. Diastolic function is reduced in the elderly, especially those with hypertension, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy, which can cause and/or exacerbate diastolic dysfunction. The 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines 4 divide heart failure into reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; ie, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40%), mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF; ie, LVEF of 40%-49%), and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; ie, LVEF \u2265 50%). These guidelines emphasize the importance of LVEF, ratio of peak early diastolic flow velocity (E) and peak atrial diastolic flow velocity (A) (E/A), and B type natriuretic peptide. The classification of HFpEF (or diastolic heart failure) confirms the European Heart Failure Association (HFA)-PEFF rule established by the HFA in 2019, 5 and a score \u2265 5 points indicates left ventricular diastolic heart failure. A study published in Circulation in 2018 6 suggested an evaluation subsystem for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: The H 2 FPEF score ranges from 0 to 9 and differentiates HFpEF from noncardiac dyspnea. The diagnosis of ventricular premature beats requires Lown's classification.",

Assessment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI): Killip classification based on HF (Grades I-IV); Forrester classification according to hemodynamics, which can be used as a basis for evaluation and treatment. 4. Classification of acute heart failure: According to the presence of hyperemia and/or hypoperfusion, it can be divided into subtypes: warm-dry, cold-dry, warm-wet, and cold-wet. 5. Risk stratification of ventricular arrhythmias (VA): According to the existence of organic heart disease and hemodynamic abnormalities, VA can be classified into benign VA, potentially malignant VA, and malignant VA. It is reported that the risk of heart attacks increases when the load of premature ventricular contraction is more than 20%.",
