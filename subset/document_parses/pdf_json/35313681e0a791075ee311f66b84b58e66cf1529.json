Smoking, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle and drinking too much alcohol all contribute to disease: however, their contributions are small in comparison to the physiological changes that result from aging. Whether biological aging causes the many functional declines that occur with age, or just permits them, is perhaps open for debate, but there is no question that, for most of us, biological aging determines how and when we and our loved ones will get sick and die.",

Given this obvious relationship, it is somewhat surprising how slowly the biomedical research community has come to appreciate the importance of biological aging in many of the disease processes under study. It is our hope that the articles in the eLife special issue on aging, geroscience and longevity will contribute to a greater appreciation and understanding of aging biology among the broader scientific community. A number of the authors of these articles also spoke at a recent eLife symposium on this topic.",

It is still common, for example, to see research studies in cancer, neuroscience, metabolism and other fields where young animal models (such as 4-6 month old mice) are used to study disease processes that almost exclusively occur in old people. 'Mice are not people' is a standard refrain when explaining why so many preclinical therapies fail in human trials. Perhaps the mouse isn't the problem. Failing to account for the physiological changes that occur during aging, both in mice and in people, may be a much bigger reason why so much preclinical research fails to translate to the clinic.",

The growth of the geroscience concept also reflects a recognition that aging research is much closer to clinical application than it was twenty years ago. Numerous interventions have been developed that target one or more of the hallmarks of aging in order to delay, or even reverse, agerelated functional declines. In rodents, for example, it has been shown that the drug rapamycin can prevent age-related diseases and improve function in multiple aged tissues and organs. Now, in the eLife special issue on aging, An et al. report that rapamycin also works in the oral cavity and can reverse periodontal disease in mice . Other articles suggest translational strategies to target specific hallmarks of aging for intervertebral disc degeneration (Cherif et al., 2020) and age-related heart disease (Chiao et al., 2020) . At the time of writing there are two review articles and more than 20 research articles in the special issue, and more will be added over time.",
