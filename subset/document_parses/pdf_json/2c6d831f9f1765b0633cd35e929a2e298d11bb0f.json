We observe that the number of infections and deaths during the early pandemic phase were much higher in predominantly Catholic counties with arguably stronger family and social ties. The relationship was confirmed at the county level through numerous robustness checks, and after controlling for a series of characteristics and county fixed effects. At the individual level, we confirmed that Catholics, relative to non-Catholics, have tighter and more frequent interactions with their family and friends. Moreover, the intensity of social interaction was able to partially explain the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and share of Catholics at the county level. Our results highlight the number of dimensions that have to be taken into account when designing and implementing mitigation measures in the early stages of disease outbreaks.",

In Europe, Italy and Spain were the first countries to be hit the hardest in early 2020, with France following suit. Initial containment measures were relatively homogeneous across countries, e.g. school closures, local and nation-wide lockdowns, social distancing etc. However, the numbers of cases and related deaths varied substantially by country. The reasons are difficult to uncover. The timing of both the pandemic onset and the various policies to constrain it clearly played a role in March 2020; for example, in Sweden, Belgium or the UK. However, evidence suggests that the virus was present in Europe long before it was initially believed, e.g. as early as December 2019 in France (Deslandes et al., 2020) . Yet, in the first phase some countries were more severely affected compared to others, resulting in vastly overburdened health systems and excess mortality rates, before most governments were able to enact their mitigation policies.",

Dowd et al. (2020) argued that in countries like Italy and Spain, co-residence and intergenerational social interaction can partially explain variation in COVID-19 incidence. However, substantial differences in socioeconomics, demographics, health systems, testing and healthcare capacity, social distancing policies and various types of policy response at different time periods, and event data collection processes, render cross-country comparisons problematic (Georganas et al., 2021) . 1 There is also evidence on how genetic differences affect the cross-country variation of the number of cases (Delanghe et al., 2020) . Moreover, such cross-country differences did not allow for a coordinated virus mitigation and lockdown exit strategy at the EU level in the first phase (Platteau and Verardi, 2020) . Therefore, empirical research shifted towards subnational analyses in order to identify how social structures, and differences in societal and individual behaviour and attitudes are linked to within-country variations in the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. Bayer and Kuhn (2020) observed a country-level positive correlation between the number of cases and the share of people 30-49 years old living with their parents, arguing that social integration might be the factor behind the death toll in Italy. However, subsequent research by Belloc et al. (2020) using Italian regions as their units of observation revealed that the correlation has the opposite sign, suggesting policy recommendations based on cross-country results should be read with caution. In Europe, policy responses were rather similar across several countries at the onset of the pandemic, yet they resulted in varying degrees of efficiency. Even though European governments implemented nation-wide measures during the early phases of the pandemic, the number of infections and the associated death toll exhibited a great degree of variation at the local level within countries.",

Our main purpose is to examine whether the strength of social and family ties as determined by religious denomination played a role. More specifically, we focused on a religious divide within Western German counties, i.e. Catholics and non-Catholics. This setting has been widely used to explain how behaviour is affected by cultural differences related to religion (Iannaccone, 1998; Ekelund et al., 2002; Arru\u00f1ada, 2009; Spenkuch, 2017; Becker and Woessmann, 2018; Spenkuch and Tillmann, 2018;  Becker and Pascali, 2019). 2 Rather than discussing religion or Catholicism per se, we explore whether differences in specific behaviours within an otherwise very similar population could have impacted groups differently in terms of infections and related deaths. Our paper is the first one to rely on regional variation of religious group composition as a measure of cultural norms and preferences in this context. Hence, it contributes to the literature on how social preferences are linked to the virus incidence within a country.",

The relationship remained strong after partialing out the effects of socioeconomic characteristics, county fixed effects, time trends, and after ruling out explanations related to geographical proximity to Northern Italy, differences in mobility patterns, and differences to pre-pandemic total mortality trends between groups using a differencein-differences approach. Our OLS, instrumental variables and difference-in-differences estimates confirmed that Catholic counties were more affected by the virus, in terms of cases and associated fatalities during the early stages of the pandemic. Our argument behind this finding is that Catholics, compared to non-Catholics exhibit stronger family and social ties, triggering a possible mechanism behind the county-level relationship that we document. 4 Previous research in economics has established that Catholics are more bound to close social circles and networks, i.e. family and friends, and they exhibit different patterns of social interactions compared to non-Catholics (Arru\u00f1ada, 2009; Glaeser and Glendon, 1998; Ekelund et al., 2002; Satyanath et al., 2017) . To formally test our argument, we relied on individual-level information. First, we used data from the European Social Survey (ESS) and the European Values Survey (EVS) to confirm that, relative to non-Catholics, Catholics exhibit systematic differences in social preferences and behaviours that are crucial determinants for the number of COVID-19 cases. Next, we showed that the correlation between the share of Catholics and the COVID-19 incidence at the county level, can be partially explained by the intensity of social interactions, as the latter was proxied by cohabitation with parents, closeness to family and friends, frequent religious-service attendance etc.",

Western German counties with a higher share of Catholics in their total population appear more severely affected by the virus. There is a striking similarity between the prevalence of the disease in the early pandemic and the dispersion of Catholics across the country. On the sample of Western German counties, the correlation coefficient between the Catholic share over the total county population and the cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants was 0.42 and 0.32, respectively. This difference in COVID-19 incidence between Catholic counties and non-Catholic counties is also shown in Appendix Despite the observed similarity in terms of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, we inspect for differences in overall monthly mortality rates before the pandemic (Appendix Figure A. 2). This is to ensure that the observed pandemic-related mortality patterns in Western German counties are not picking up preexisting mortality differences between Catholic and non-Catholic counties. The time series run from January 2011 to December 2017. They begin considerably after the last major swine flu outbreak in 2009, with no other major public health threats that could be affected from social contacts occurring since then. Both series are quite close and they move in parallel implying that before the COVID-19 pandemic nothing noticeable caused Catholics to pass at a higher rate relative to non-Catholics. Any systematic differences in genetic predisposition, pre-existing conditions, overall health status, socioeconomic characteristics, local infrastructure, health infrastructure or behaviours such as risky attitudes would be likely reflected in systematically different past mortality rates between groups. This would also capture most of the unobserved heterogeneity that could drive mortality rates. Therefore, any divergence in mortality patterns between counties observed during the first half 2020 should be due to the incidence of COVID-19 cases and related deaths. 10 The non-existence of pre-pandemic systematic mortality differences was also validated in a regression-based framework. More specifically, we regressed (logged) annual mortality rates from all causes (2011-2017) on a set of controls to formally test the parallel trends assumption at the county level. As seen in Appendix Table A .3, there were no systematic differences in overall monthly mortality between counties before the pandemic, conditional on county observables and fixed effects.",

Finally, we add state fixed effects in column 4. In every case, the DiD parameter is positive and significant.

Therefore, parameter \u03b1 could be interpreted as an estimate of the within-county spread. All models control for the size of the local population and for a series for economic and demographic controls. 15 Models also include state-specific time trends in order to account for confounders or policies that may vary at the state level, given the country's federal system. Estimating parameter \u03b2 through these empirical models will provide a first indication about how the count of COVID-19 cases and related fatalities per 100,000 population varied with the local share of Catholics in each county during the early pandemic, conditional on past incidence, observable characteristics, state fixed effects and time trends. We test the robustness of baseline estimates by considering factors that could arguably affect the incidence of COVID-19, i.e. including more control variables, controlling for distance from places that suffered a lot during the early pandemic, excluding extreme counties and counties close to any border, and controlling for weather conditions at the county level.",

This last test also helps in excluding the large number of non-religious individuals concentrated in urban areas, reducing potential biases from non-random migration and rendering the remaining counties more comparable. Finally, we performed a placebo test by replacing the local share of Catholics in the county with the share of Protestants; as well as the dummy indicating a Catholic county with similarly constructed one indicating a Protestant county. As seen in Table A .4, the effect of Protestants was not significant and negative, providing some further reassurance about the direction and magnitude of our empirical observation.

In Panel A, the outcome is the mean residual obtained from applying a FE estimator to the total period in the first stage. The share of Catholics is positively and significantly affecting both the residual number of infections and deaths per 100,000 population, and this holds after controlling for demographic and economic characteristics. This is confirmed by both OLS and 2SLS estimates, where the local share of Catholics in each county was instrumented by the (logged) distance between each county's capital and the town of Wittenberg as suggested by Becker and Woessmann (2009) . In the case of the 2SLS estimates, the first-stage result is particularly strong, suggesting that the current religious composition is strongly related to the historical one, an observation similar to Spenkuch (2017). In Panel B, the outcome is the mean residual when the estimation sample in the first stage is restricted to the period before the lockdown, in March 22, 2020. The effect of the local Catholics share in the county remains positive and significant on both cases and deaths after controlling for the usual set of county characteristics. The same conclusions are reached when the first stage estimation is conditioned on the period during the lockdown. In the second stage, the link between COVID-19 incidence and Catholics share is positive and significant according to both OLS and 2SLS estimates. Finally, in Panels D and E, we use cases and related deaths for those below and above 60 years old, respectively, in the first stage. The RKI data report the age for each COVID-19 case or fatality, so we were able to test for age-related nonlinearities. The results in the second stage confirm a positive relationship for both age groups and, as expected, the estimated coefficients of the local Catholic share are higher for those above 60 years old, especially when considering the number of deaths per 100,000 population. This is worth mentioning, because even though non-Catholic counties have a slightly higher share of elderly, the number of infections and related deaths among the more vulnerable increases with the local share of Catholics.",

Specifically, we test whether Catholics have a higher propensity to justify cheating behaviour in avoiding taxes, accepting bribes and avoiding fares in public transport. Further, we examine for differences in their confidence towards the government; even though recent research suggests that in most European countries confidence in governments and their implemented measures have increased during the early stages of the pandemic and that individuals tend to prioritise health (Bol et al., 2020; Hargreaves Heap et al., 2020) . This test should be indicative of whether the higher number of cases and fatalities in predominantly Catholic counties was due to an overall riskier behaviour or disobedience towards the authorities and the mitigation measures they introduced.

Therefore, the higher count of COVID-19 cases during the early pandemic phase seems unlikely to have resulted from differences in risky behaviours and civil disobedience between 22 Having already shown, in Appendix Table A .4, that infections do not vary with the local share of Protestants, Appendix Table  A .5 further narrows down the comparison between Catholics and Protestants alone using individual-level data. Both the obtained OLS and unbiased parameter estimates suggest that Catholics seem to have more social interactions as compared to Catholics alone, e.g. they meet other people more than several times per week and they show greater trust towards their family members. In particular the unbiased coefficients point towards this direction in four out of six different outcomes we consider.",

When considering trust in the government as outcome, the coefficient remains remarkably stable indicating that Catholics exhibit indeed more confidence in the government relative to non-Catholics.

Originally this was not possible as both the ESS and the EVS datasets provide only state-level identifiers. After a licence agreement, county level identifiers for the 2018 EVS data were provided to us, allowing the aggregation of social interaction measures at the county level. However, surveyed individuals were sampled in a subset of 118 Western German counties. Therefore, our hypothesis was directly tested at the county level but under this restriction. To directly test whether increased social interactions among Catholics can explain (some of) the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and the local share of Catholics at the county level, we controlled for a social interaction index, in column 2. This index was constructed through a principal component analysis ( In column 2 of Table 5 , we estimated Equation (4) using OLS and controlling additionally for the predicted social interaction index (the first principal component). This reduces the magnitude of the coefficient associated with the local Catholic share at the county level, implying that the local share of Catholics is strongly correlated with our measure of social interactions. Even if other factors associated with the historic geographic dispersion may play a role, we find this strong association with social and family ties. Moreover, the relationship between the index and the number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 county population is positive and significant at the 5 percent. This is also the case in column 4 reporting the 2SLS estimates of the local Catholic share. Compared to column 3, the 2SLS estimate in column 4 is reduced by nearly 28 percent when models control for the predicted social interaction. Instead of the constructed index, columns 5-7 control for the averages of the variables that were used to construct it instead. In all cases, the estimated coefficient of the local Catholic share at the county level is reduced, and the social interaction variables have the expected sign (column 7 controls for all variables used in the principal component construction).",

Such differences are difficult to be observed between otherwise comparable individuals and groups of people. It is often the case that they are unobserved and it is burdensome to isolate their potential impact on individual or group-level outcomes and relationships (Alesina and Giuliano, 2015) . Nevertheless, as they can lead to differential outcomes it is of high importance to take them under consideration. Such heterogeneities need to be taken into account not only in epidemiological modelling and parameterisation, but also to design optimal policy responses. Moreover, they do not only exist between, but also within countries and often go beyond standard demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, e.g. age, income or health status. This is particularly important when facing crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already claimed many lives both directly and indirectly (Vandoros, 2020) . Being able to explain diverging trajectories of countries in the early stages could provide invaluable insight to policymakers to design mitigation measures and policies around pandemics (Platteau and Verardi, 2020) . Previous attempts to highlight the importance of culture and how it can determine social interactions are marred by unobserved heterogeneity and it is difficult to disentangle the number of factors that need to be taken into account. In this paper we used data from Western Germany in early 2020 to highlight the relevance of cultural differences in shaping social interactions on the incidence of the disease and the associated mortality in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The starting point of our motivation was the observation that the incidence of COVID-19 infections and associated fatalities during the early pandemic phase was strikingly similar to how Catholics are scattered throughout the Western German counties.

An important feature of such models is that they can be modified to estimate not only the within-county transmission rate, i.e. parameter \u03b1 in Equation (2), but also differences in transmission rates based on some county-level observables. The seminal work of Adda (2016) popularised this sort of model in the economics literature by examining how policies, such as school closures, and economic interactions affect virus transmission. For example, if policies to mitigate the pandemic impact were enacted in some counties but not in others, their efficiency could be assessed by testing for differences in virus transmission rates between counties. This idea can be expanded to observe the differential impact of any kind of \"treatment\". Therefore, to make this adaptation in our setting, Equation (2) was modified to include an interaction between the term capturing the within-county spread of the virus and the Catholic county binary indicator. Although our paper focuses on differences in the observed incidence between Catholic and non-Catholic counties, documenting a difference in the spread of the virus using a modification of a SIR model adds credence to our results. A positive and statistical significant estimate of the parameter associated with this interaction term would indicate that the transmission rate was significantly higher in Catholic counties during the early pandemic.",

As shown byPesaran and Zhou (2018), this twostage approach can be modified in the case where instruments are available for the explanatory variables in Equation(2). To address issues related to the endogeneity, the share of Catholics in the county was instrumented using the distance between Wittenberg and each county's capital. Because Wittenberg was the centre of the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century, this instrument has been used and extensively discussed in the literature to predict the geographic dispersion of Catholics, e.g. inBecker and Woessmann   (2009). Counties located further away from Wittenberg remained predominantly Catholic and the historical composition closely resembles the contemporary composition(Spenkuch, 2017).",

            "text": "Religiosity is rather low in contemporary Western Germany with only 12 percent of EVS respondents reporting that religion is very important in their lives and 8 percent attending church regularly. Nevertheless, it may be the case that some shared values or preferences may have become part of culture outside of religion. Historically, it has been shown that Protestants and non-Catholics have developed more market oriented and individualistic behaviours, whereas Catholics are characterised by rent-seeking behaviours through established social structures(Becker and Pascali, 2019; Ekelund et al., 2002). Catholics have been traditionally organising their social life through the Church and much less through independent institutions, which implies that Church has been a strong focal point of their social activity(Satyanath et al., 2017).Moreover, these differences mostly reflect on social dimensions rather than economic dimensions or work ethics. Furthermore, Protestants view social interaction more as an enforcement and control mechanism over peers and society(Arru\u00f1ada, 2009). Hence, more frequent social interaction, and stronger social and family ties as an intrinsic behaviour are more likely to be observed among Catholics. Our argument is that historic religious composition and the associated behaviours have manifested as a local way of life. Even though we have shown that contemporary religious composition closely resembles the historic one, religiosity in Western Germany is declining 21 . However, some of the shared values may remain and persist at the local level (Spenkuch, 2017), especially ones that are not directly related to religious activities such as the strength of social and family ties. This could imply that individuals living in these areas are likely to adapt to this local way of life regardless of religious affiliation. For these reasons we believe that social and family ties are more pronounced among Catholics and in predominantly Catholic regions. We rely on individual-level data from the 2018 ESS and the 2018 EVS waves for Western Germany to test whether these differences can partially explain the county-level relationship. The ESS contains questions on religious denomination, the frequency of social interactions, on the perceived frequency of such interaction compared to one's peers, and also questions about the number of individuals with whom one feels comfortable discussing private and individual matters, and the number of individuals each respondent confides in. The EVS also contains information on religion denomination as well as a set of questions that proxy attitudes and behaviours, i.e. importance of family and friends in an individual's life, level of trust towards members of the family, and likelihood to reside with parents (or parents-in-law) in the same household.

State and federal government response was swift (Stafford, 2020). In early March, the federal government and the Robert Koch Institute issued the National Pandemic Plan to be carried out across the country. The states (L\u00e4nder) themselves were given some autonomy in handling the pandemic, although the response was coordinated and crucial to avoid inter-state travel. All states in Western Germany enacted strict social distancing measures and closures of schools, shops, and workplaces. Based on the Coronavirus Government Response Tracker developed by the University of Oxford, these social distancing measures were implemented on February 29 (public events cancellation), March 16 (school closings), March 22 (shops and workplaces closings) and April 09 (public transport closing). 5 According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of daily cases peaked in early April and started receding from that point on.

These include population, population density, share of people over 65 years old, share of foreigners, share of males and females, share of those who completed secondary education, GDP per capita, number of hospital beds, and number of nights spend per person as an indicator for tourism-related activity. Moreover, we used Google Maps data in order to calculate the distance between the capital of each county and Wittenberg, Germany, and the fastest highway driving distance between the capital of each county and Milan, Italy. We also used the 2011 German Census in order to calculate the number of Catholics, Protestants and other/no denominations in each county and state. Information on overall mortality at the state and at the county level was taken from the Federal Statistical Office, and monthly weather data from the Climate Data Centre (CDC) of the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst). 6 The share of Catholics relative to the total population in the county will be our main variable of interest.

The estimated coefficient of the county-level share of Catholics is positive and statistically significant, confirming the empirical observation from Appendix figure A.1. According to the estimated \u03b1 parameter, past infections strongly predict the current within-county COVID-19 incidence, as expected. 17 Despite focusing on regions within a single country, there might be some room for confounders pertaining to a state-level policy making; especially in a decentralised federal state like Germany. Therefore, we included linear daily state trends, in column 2, but the results remained unaffected.

However, Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg border on Austria and are geographically closer to Northern Italy, the alleged epicentre of the pandemic in continental Europe. As this geographical proximity might raise concerns about our baseline estimates, we restricted the estimation sample only to North Rhine-Westphalia counties who exhibit a considerable variation in being predominantly Catholic or not. Columns 5-6 inTable 2report the results. Conditional on local demographics and time trends, the estimated coefficient of either the logged Catholic share or the dummy variable is positive, significant and higher in magnitude. Moreover, as the virus circulated locally at the beginning of the pandemic, we further restricted our sample by excluding extreme counties, such as Heinsberg, from our sample of North Rhine-Westphalia counties but the results are similar to those in columns 5-6 ofTable 2.18    The baseline results in columns 1-4 ofTable 2are robust to a series of sensitivity checks.
