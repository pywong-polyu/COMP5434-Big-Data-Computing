Secondary use of EHRs can promote the clinical informatics applications and the development of healthcare undertaking. EHRs have the unique characteristic where the patient visits are temporally ordered but the diagnosis codes within a visit are randomly ordered. The hierarchical structure requires a multi-layer network to explore the different relational information of EHRs. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Representation Learning method (MLRL), which is capable of learning effective patient representation by hierarchically exploring the valuable information in both diagnosis codes and patient visits. Firstly, MLRL utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to explore the potential connections in diagnosis codes, and a linear transformation is implemented to further map the code vectors to non-negative real-valued representations. The initial visit vectors are then obtained by summarizing all the code representations. Secondly, the proposed method combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with self-attention mechanism to learn the weighted visit vectors which are aggregated to form the patient representation. Finally, to evaluate the performance of MLRL, we apply it to patient's mortality prediction on real EHRs and the experimental results demonstrate that MLRL has a significant improvement in prediction performance. MLRL achieves around 0.915 in Area Under Curve which is superior to the results obtained by baseline methods. Furthermore, compared with raw data and other data representations, the learned representation with MLRL shows its outstanding results and availability on multiple different classifiers.",

However, a sequence of patient visits possess sequential relationship among them which can't be captured by simply aggregating code vectors. So the effective representations need to be derived from the hierarchical learning of diagnosis codes and patient visits. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Representation Learning method (MLRL) for patient's EHRs. MLRL is implemented from two aspects: (1) Diagnosis codelevel representation. We use the multi-head attention mechanism to explore the potential interactions and associations of the diagnosis codes. Then, the non-negative real-valued code representations are obtained by the linear transformation; (2) Visit-level representation. This part utilizes Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to explore the temporal relationships among various patient visits. Furthermore, because the patient visits are unlikely to contribute equally to the prediction of the target outcome, we combine the self-attention mechanism to learn the weighted visit vectors which are aggregated to form the patient representation.",

Besides, there are also risk prediction [4] , patient's condition prediction [24] and so on. (2) Feature representation. The purpose of feature representation is to better select the effective features, discover important phenotypes and influencing factors concerning disease risk level, etc. Du et al. [13] proposed a representation learning method for dynamic multivariate time series data, which can jointly learn the long-term temporal dependencies pattern and non-linear correlation features of multivariate temporal data. A novel framework to learn sparse longitudinal representations of patient's medical records was presented in [39] . The proposed model achieved higher predictive performance and the learned representation is interpreted and visualized to bring clinical insights. (3) Clinical image processing with the goal of data analysis, disease diagnosis, etc. Ardakani et al.

The importance of diagnosis codes should be taken seriously. A recurrent neural network based denoising autoencoder, proposed in [29] , was employed to encode in-hospital records of each patient into a low dimensional dense vector. The patient representation they learned is used to the prediction of clinical events. Nevertheless, they directly represented each patient visit as a multi-dimensional multi-hot vector composed of 0 and 1, and did not mining the important related information existing in codes. A deep learning approach for phenotyping from patient EHRs [7] was also not learned code representations by utilizing the code characteristics. Ashfaq et al. [2] leveraged the Paragraph Vector for Distributed Bag of Words (PV-DBOW) to generate simple numerical vectors of codes. Nevertheless, their process of obtaining representations did not consider the importance of the codes in current visit, that is the code weight. Besides, the patient's multiple visit sequences also plays an important and different role in the target outcome prediction. Wang et al. [34] proposed a representation learning model for patient medical records. They aimed to capture the co-occurrence information and long-term dependence between clinical events, but ignored the visit sequentiality and the differences in the contribution of patient visits to the prediction task. Miotto et al. [25] proposed an unsupervised method, called DeepPatient, which generated patient representation from the original clinical information via a stack of denoising autoencoders (SDA). In their research, the classified diagnosis codes were used as training labels to evaluate the predictive results of diseases. However, in the vector learning process of patient EHRs, they did not consider the sequentiality and temporality of patient visits.",

On the one hand, the diagnosis codes can reflect the patient's illness and conditions during the hospitalization, which plays an important role in predicting patient's mortality; On the other hand, there are valuable implicit associations between them. For example, diabetic patients may also suffer from diabetes-related complications (e.g. cardiovascular disease) to a large extent, which indicates that there may be some valuable potential correlations between diabetes and its complications. The codes follow a certain hierarchical pattern where the classification granularity of the disease gradually increases. For example, the diagnosis code 250.00 represents diabetes without mention of complications, 250.10 indicates diabetes with ketoacidosis and 250.20 indicates diabetes with hyperosmolarity. In this study, we group the codes into high-order categories by selecting the first three digits of them to reduce information overload and have a generalized specifcity level. The operation also makes the codes more generalized and hierarchical. The classified codes have also been widely practiced in multiple researches [7, 8, 10, 25, 26] .",

Med2Vec plays a certain role in exploiting the potential connections of medical concepts, and its performance metrics are slightly higher than other baselines. Furthermore, BiLSTM-based methods (including BiLSTM-Soft and BiLSTM-Att-Soft) achieve better prediction performance. They achieve an AUC close to 0.9, which is 7% higher than that obtained by the common classifiers such as LR and MLP. This is because the methods are good at processing the patient visits with chronological characteristic. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the results are improved after an attention mechanism are combined with BiLSTM, which indicates that the attention mechanism plays a significant role in improving the model quality. Finally, MLRL with multi-layer structure significantly outperforms all baseline methods, it achieves an AUC of 0.915 while baselines just get 0.8-0.9 (i.e., 1-10% improvement). In sum, MLRL does yield obvious improvements for the prediction task. Figure 4 shows the training process of MLRL and baseline methods. As shown in Fig.  4 , we can find an obvious and important aspect of the experimental results, which is the overfitting phenomenon in the methods. Constantly increasing the training epochs degrades the performance of all of the methods, as it leads to overfitting. For example, overtraining makes the results of BiLSTM-Soft show a downward trend. Similar behavior can be seen as we train BiLSTM-Att-Soft for more epochs, which suggests that appropriate model training is necessary and early stopping technique should be applied to the representation learning of the medical field.",

Specifically, the experiment is to obtain the patient representations learned by all methods, and then input them as features to different classifiers for prediction tasks and compare the results. The classifiers we used include LR, MLP, LSTM, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), and the baseline methods include BiLSTM, BiLSTM-Att (BiLSTM-Attention), Deep Patient and Med2Vec. Table 5 presents the prediction performance of different representations in terms of AUC, accuracy, recall and F1 score. From Table 5 , we can observe that compared with raw data, the performance of all the representation learning methods improves, but MLRL shows superior predictive performance, demonstrates their applicability in the prediction tasks. This experimental results also show that all the methods can capture the effective information and learn different patient representations which have different contributions to the final outcome prediction. However, because the neural network-based baseline methods do not explore the hierarchical EHRs structure, or do not focus on the valuable relational information in the sequences, the prediction performance of them is not good as that achieved by MLRL which learns the patient representation by the hierarchical learning of code and visit information. In Table 5 , the results of our learned representation are superior to those obtained by raw data. Particularly for SVM classifier, MLRL achieves an AUC of 0.837 while raw data just get 0.748, and other evaluation metrics are also improved about 7-12%. Meanwhile, MLRL consistently outperforms all other feature learning baseline methods. Taking LSTM classifier as an example, MLRL improves other baseline methods by 3.9%, 2.9%, 4.3% and 1.9% respectively in terms of AUC.

MLRL learns the patient representation by hierarchically mining the valuable and effective information existed in diagnosis codes and patient visits. Then, we apply the proposed method to patient's mortality prediction with real EHRs data. The experimental results demonstrate that MLRL is capable of achieving more accurate prediction and improving the prediction performance of the tasks. In addition, the evaluation results of the data representation learned by MLRL significantly outperform those achieved by raw EHRs data and other learned representations.",
