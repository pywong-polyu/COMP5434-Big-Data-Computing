Few studies have evaluated rapid antigen tests in real-world settings or among large populations. Beginning October 2020, Florida offered individuals presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing PCR testing if they tested positive by the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 antigen (Ag) card, were symptomatic, or required or requested PCR testing. We compared results among individuals who received both types of tests at four publicly accessible testing sites across Florida. We calculated the positive percent agreement (PPA) between the two test types by symptom status. Subsequently, we evaluated the PPA among individuals regardless of symptoms with lower cycle threshold values (,30). Overall, 18,457 individuals were tested via both methods, of which 3,153 (17.1%) were positive by PCR. The PPA for the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card using the PCR comparator was 49.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.4% to 50.9%). Among symptomatic individuals the PPA was 51.9% (95% CI, 49.7% to 54.0%). When restricted to positive PCR tests with a cycle threshold value of ,30, regardless of symptom status, the PPA was 75.3% (95% CI, 72.8% to 77.6%). The PPA of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card compared with PCR was lower than that previously reported. Our findings may reflect the performance of the BinaxNOW antigen test in real-world settings.",

Surveillance efforts currently predominantly use real-time PCR assays, which can be expensive, require significant laboratory infrastructure, and take 24 to 48 h to return results. Rapid antigen-based detection methods have been proposed as an alternative strategy, facilitating morerapid test turnaround times and reduced costs; however, results of studies evaluating the sensitivities of such assays vary considerably (2) (3) (4) (5) .",

In a follow-up community-based study among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, the sensitivity of that same assay was 93.3% when limited to individuals with a PCR cycle threshold value of less than 30 (indicating a high viral load), inclusive of asymptomatic individuals (n = 95) (3), though both studies were limited by sample size. Subsequent work has identified similarly high sensitivity of the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card, particularly when limited to individuals with lower cycle threshold values (6) . However, evaluation of the performance of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card among larger sample sizes in real-world settings is warranted in order to further understand the test performance. Some experts argue that adequate infection surveillance depends more on test turnaround time and test frequency than on test sensitivity (7, 8) . However, without large-scale validation of an assay's sensitivity, the true utility of such rapid diagnostics remains uncertain. Thus, we aimed to compare the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card with PCR among a population who received both tests in Florida.",

That finding may also be explained by differences in viral load distribution among individuals at the various testing sites, with individuals presenting to Lee County, for example, presenting more recently after infection. Further, there may have been some variation in adherence to recommended specimen collection and testing methods. It is possible, for example, that swab collection varied by testing facility (either by a trained clinician or health care worker-observed self-collection or by the duration or vigor of nasal swabbing, etc.) in a manner that impacted test positivity. A recent study showed that the sensitivity of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card may be reduced when swabs are self-collected compared to when swabs are collected by trained clinic staff (12) . However, we did not collect data on how compliant sites were with collection and testing instructions or know which specific specimens were self-collected or clincian-collected.",

Our results revealed a high negative percent agreement (98.8%), similar to that previously reported (2, 3) . A recent study, however, noted that even small imperfections in testing specificity may result in a high number of false-positive tests when implemented on a national scale in populations with a low frequency of true infection (17) , overwhelming testing infrastructure, and contact notification systems. Thus, false-positive results create major challenges and consume already limited resources in public health systems. Confirmation of rapid posttest results with PCR should be considered.",

The promise of infection surveillance using less-sensitive but significantly more-rapid assays is great; however, the sensitivity of the current iteration of such assays may be too low to use in a single-test strategy. Further work is needed to investigate the utility of rapid antigen tests in other settings and at different testing frequencies as well as the development of assays with improved sensitivity.",

Additionally, the notable proportion of individuals whose symptom status at the time of testing was unknown makes conclusions about the overall performance less certain. To address that uncertainty, the results are presented by symptom status (symptomatic, asymptomatic, and unknown). The presence or absence of symptoms likely reflects differences in viral load at the time of testing and thus might impact the performance of the antigen test. Finally, we had little clinical and exposure data and thus could not analyze the impact of factors such as recency of exposures, severity of symptoms, and others that may impact testing results. Overall, however, we feel those limitations do not negate the importance of our findings.",
