            "text": "At the time this report was written, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had infected over 10 million individuals worldwide and caused over 500,000 deaths. 1 In the United States (US), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately impacted communities of color and vulnerable populations such as the frail elderly. [2] [3] [4] Indeed, the majority of this country's nursing homes have had SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. 5 Several studies have found that nursing home outbreaks were unrelated to traditional measures of nursing home quality and were instead associated with facility size and location. 6, 7 Local SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is likely to have a strong impact on nursing home infection rates. At the same time, nursing homes may contribute to the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 for several reasons. A large fraction of nursing home residents occupy shared bedrooms and cannot be isolated from one another. In addition, most residents require physical assistance with activities of daily living and therefore frequent contact with direct care staff. Furthering the risk of transmission, low-wage direct care staff commonly hold multiple jobs, sometimes at multiple nursing homes. Additionally, in a survey of almost 1,000 nursing home workers, 70% reported feeling obligated to work while sick. 8 All of these circumstances may not only increase SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among nursing home residents, but also may accelerate SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in the communities where facilities, particularly those of larger size, are located. Communities with larger nursing homes may be more at risk simply because there is exposure between greater numbers of residents, staff, and outside visitors prior to the adoption of admission bans. However, the relationship between the presence of larger nursing homes and the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been documented.",

            "text": "A nursing home's size is perceptibly connected to local population density. However, federal and state policies are potential contributing factors. For example, in some states, Medicaid reimbursement and staffing levels are tied to bed size thresholds. Under federal law, nursing homes with 121 or more beds are required to staff a licensed social worker full time. 9 certificate of need (CON) laws, another state-level policy, also indirectly impact nursing home size through placing a ceiling on the supply of nursing home beds. As shown in previous studies, CON laws result in larger nursing homes in the long run due to the substantial fixed (capital) cost of proving long-term care. Specifically, in the presence of CON, the higher average fixed cost per bed for smaller facilities cannot be offset with the addition of some needed number of revenue-generating beds. Over time, this has resulted in the presence of fewer nursing home operators and existing nursing homes becoming larger in states with CON. 10, 11 In this study, we examined the association between the average nursing home bed sizes of counties with its SARS-CoV-2 prevalence from March 11, 2020, the date the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared a pandemic, through June 12, 2020. Importantly, the earlier portion of the study period includes the time when the majority of nursing homes were not reporting outbreak data publicly. We also compared SARS-CoV-2 prevalence between counties located in states with and without nursing home CON laws due to their indirect impact on facility size.",

We then estimated the adjusted association between average nursing home size and the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 cases on June 12, the last day of the study period, using Poisson regression. To facilitate interpretation, we presented the marginal effect of average nursing home size on the number of cases, interpreted as the adjusted difference in SARS-CoV-2 case count associated with a between-county difference in average nursing home size equal to one bed. From the Poisson model, we derived adjusted SARS-CoV-2 prevalence at the state level to compare the relationship between average nursing home size and SARS-CoV-2 prevalence for individual states with and without CON laws. In a separate model, we examined the relationship between CON law and SARS-CoV-2 case count more directly by supplanting average nursing home size with state CON law as the explanatory variable of interest. We also examined whether growth in SARS-CoV-2 cases varied with average nursing home size (classified as small, medium, or large) and CON laws by fitting separate regression models for each day of the study period.",

Counties subject to CON laws had on average 104 more SARS-CoV-2 cases than counties not subject to CON. We also found that average nursing home size was associated with SARS-CoV-2-related mortality; however, the magnitude of this association was considerably lower. While the presence of larger nursing homes may accelerate infection rates in a community, mortality rates are more likely to be related to clinical factors. Our findings are consistent with recent studies showing that nursing home size is a strong predictor of whether a facility experienced a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. 6,7 However, we conducted an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 cases in the areas nursing homes are located, which is distinctly important since larger facility size places not only nursing home residents, but also community members at risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. While the majority of SARS-CoV-2 cases is likely accounted for by the non-nursing home population, our results may indicate the potential role of larger nursing homes as accelerants of community infection rates. In addition, our study includes data from March and April, 2020, a period of time when the majority of nursing homes were not reporting outbreaks publicly. In fact, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began requiring nursing homes to submit COVID-19-related data in mid-May, and allowed facilities to optionally submit prior data.",

            "text": "Consistent with prior reports, we show that the size of nursing homes depends in part on long-term care policies, and particularly CON laws. 10 New York State, for instance, has a CON law and its nursing homes are over 1.5 times the size of those in California, a non-CON state with comparable population density. CON laws for nursing homes have been in place for several decades in 37 states and were originally established to limit state Medicaid spending on long-term care by placing a cap on the supply of nursing home beds. However, high nursing home capital costs combined with bed supply ceilings has led to fewer nursing home operators and larger facilities in states with CON. Only a few states have repealed their CON laws, potentially because on surface they may appear to be benign. However, there is evidence suggesting that CON laws were not only ineffective at controlling spending in the long run, but also that nursing home staffing levels have improved at slower rates in states with CON versus states without CON. 10, 11 Our findings indicate another potential concern regarding CON laws, which is their association with facility size and disease spread. More generally, these results highlight the potential for long-term care policy consequences outside the long-term care system. Low Medicaid reimbursement, known to be associated with poor sick leave benefits for long-term care works, is an example of another state policy that may impact COVID-19 in the community. 16 Limitations This study has important limitations. First, the analysis was ecological because individual-level COVID-19 data are not currently available. As such, individual-level inferences should not be drawn from these results. The use of aggregate data also precludes measuring the direct contribution of larger nursing homes to community spread, and it is possible that the higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2 cases in counties with larger nursing homes reflects infections among nursing home residents alone. However, it is worth noting that total nursing home bed supply was not significantly associated with the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Second, while the SARS-CoV-2 data are widely used, they have not yet been externally validated and the quality of the data submitted by public health departments may vary. Third, due to the cross-sectional design, there remains the potential for residual confounding. For example, social distancing practices, other mobility patterns, and associated local policies were not accounted for and are associated with infection rates. Relatedly, this study does not investigate potential mediating mechanisms underlying the association between nursing home size, CON laws, and SARS-CoV-2 infections. For example, smaller nursing homes may be more readily able to reduce occupancy, be higher quality, or have better access to personal protective equipment. Each of these factors may be related to lower community spread of SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, CON laws may impact attributes of nursing homes other than size, such as staffing levels, which may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 spread. Fourth, although we conducted several robustness checks, our results may be sensitive to other modeling choices. Fifth, while counties are commonly used to approximate health care markets, the size of counties and allocation of nursing homes within them may vary considerably, which introduces noise into the analyses.",
