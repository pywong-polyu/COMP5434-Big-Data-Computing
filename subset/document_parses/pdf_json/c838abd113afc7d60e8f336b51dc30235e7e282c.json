This crisis also reveals the brittleness of existing medical services, such as over-centralization of medical resources, the hysteresis of medical services digitalization, and weak security and privacy protection of medical data. The integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and blockchain is expected to be a panacea to COVID-19 attributed to the ubiquitous presence and the perception of IoMT as well as the enhanced security and immutability of the blockchain. However, the synergy of IoMT and blockchain is also faced with challenges in privacy, latency, and context-absence. The emerging edge intelligence technologies bring opportunities to tackle these issues. In this article, we present a blockchainempowered edge intelligence for IoMT in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. We first review IoMT, edge intelligence, and blockchain in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We then present an architecture of blockchain-empowered edge intelligence for IoMT after discussing the opportunities of integrating blockchain and edge intelligence. We next offer solutions to COVID-19 brought by blockchain-empowered edge intelligence from 1) monitoring and tracing COVID-19 pandemic origin, 2) traceable supply chain of injectable medicines and COVID-19 vaccines, and 3) telemedicine and remote healthcare services. Moreover, we also discuss the challenges and open issues in blockchain-empowered edge intelligence.",

Another adverse effect of outsourcing IoMT data to remote clouds is the high latency due to data transmissions across diverse networks.

The working principle behind tracing using Bluetooth is to collect and store the Bluetooth signals broadcasting by other devices in the vicinity. The contact Bluetooth signals are then uploaded and stored in the remote cloud through an application in the IoMT devices.

A contaminated environment is a key role in transmitting the disease like COVID-19 via aerosol transmission.

On the one hand, if aerosol surveillance and analysis could be performed in a real-time manner, the transmission can be quickly intervened and limited, and the relevant people in that region can be swiftly notified. The fast analysis of aerosol transmission largely depends on the edge intelligence, which provides the necessary nearby and distributed computing capability along with the required data analytics services.

Moreover, there are also rising concerns on the accidentally or intentionally privacy leaks of IoMT data. The advent of blockchain brings opportunities to address both the security and privacy concerns of AI. In particular, blockchain can offer effective authentication and authorization on the sensory data during data sharing. Any modifications can be detected on time due to the immutability of the blockchain. Moreover, authentication and authorization can be enforced on either edge devices or cloud-service providers through blockchain systems.",
