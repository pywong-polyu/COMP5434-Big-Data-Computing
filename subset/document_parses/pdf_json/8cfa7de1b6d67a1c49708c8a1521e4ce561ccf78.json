Methods The cases of 184 consecutive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients who underwent minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy (109 with RAME, 75 with VAME) performed by a single surgical group between June 2017 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Results Overall, 59.8% (110/181) patients (70 treated with RAME, 40 treated with VAME; 64.2% vs. 53.3%, respectively, p = 0.139) underwent complete LND around the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) by pathological assessment. Cumulative sum plots showed increased numbers of LND around the left RLN (3.6 \u00b1 2.0 vs. 5.4 \u00b1 2.7, p = 0.008) and a decreased incidence of recurrent nerve injury (27.9% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.037) after RAME learning curve. Despite similar overall LND results (30.6 \u00b1 10.2 vs. 28.1 \u00b1 10.2, p > 0.05), RAME yielded more LND (5.4 \u00b1 2.7 vs. 4.4 \u00b1 2.2, p = 0.016) and a greater proportion of lymph node metastases (37.0% vs. 7.5%) around the left RLN but induced a lower proportion of recurrent nerve injuries (7.4% vs. 22.5%, p = 0.178) compared with VAME. Further analysis revealed that the complete LND around the left RLN was associated with recurrent nerve injury in the RAME (20.0% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.035) and VAME (22.5% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.041) groups but did not affect other clinical outcomes including surgical duration, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and other complications. Conclusions For patients with ESCC, RAME has great advantages in LND around the left RLN and recurrent nerve protection after learning curve of robotic esophagectomy.",

Insufflation with carbon dioxide to a pressure of 6-8 mmHg was used to provide sufficient visualization. The patient's cart was docked onto the ports from behind the patient. After inspection, the esophagus was mobilized between the thoracic inlet and the diaphragmatic crura. The azygos vein was routinely transected, and lymph nodes were removed at the paratracheal, subcarinal, and paraesophageal areas, including both sides of the RLN (Fig. 1B) . The patient was then placed in the supine position. First, the cervical esophagus was removed through a 5-cm incision in the left side of the neck. Figure 1C shows the placements of ports for the abdomen. A pressure of 12-15 mmHg was used. The robot was docked from the side of patient's head. We opened the gastrohepatic ligament, and separated and clipped the left gastric vessels. The lymph nodes surrounding the celiac trunk and the left gastric, common hepatic, and splenic arteries were dissected. The gastrocolic ligament and the short gastric vessels were transected after mobilizing of the stomach. We pulled out the stomach and specimen through a 5-cm midline incision and created a 3-cm-wide gastric tube. The gastrotomy line was closed with a linear stapler. A cervical anastomosis was constructed at the high point of the stomach using a circular stapler end to side (Fig. 1D) . The distal end of the gastric tube was closed using a linear stapler approximately 1-2 cm away from the circular anastomosis. Nasogastric tubes, chest tubes, neck drains, and jejunostomy tubes were routinely inserted in all patients.",

            "text": "Robotic esophageal surgery is among the most challenging procedures in thoracic surgery. With its popularity and widespread applicability, its learning curve requires evaluation. According to Hernandez [26] , the surgical proficiency of robotic esophagectomy with Ivor Lewis can be obtained after approximately 20 cases are treated by surgeons skilled in non-robotic MIE. Sarkaria et al. [27] conducted a learning curve analysis of 100 robot-assisted MIE and noted that the median operative time decreased to approximately 370 min between the 30th and 45th cases. Zhang et al. [28] retrospectively reviewed 72 consecutive patients treated with RAME and found that experience with 26 cases is required to gain early proficiency for a surgeon experienced with open and thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy. The LND around the left RLN in ESCC cases is a surgically challenging procedure. In the present study, we evaluated the learning curve of RAME in lymphadenectomy around the left RLN to enable better comparison with VAME. For a surgeon experienced with VAME, experience of 43 cases is required to gain proficiency with robotassisted lymphadenectomy around the left RLN, which is evidenced by more completed LND and a decreased recurrent nerve injury rate. In this respect, robot-assisted surgery shows great advantages. The feasibility and safety of robotassisted lymphadenectomy along the bilateral RLN were demonstrated in a previous study. Chao et al. [29] showed that, compared with VAME, RAME resulted in a higher LND around the left RLN without increasing morbidity. In a recent study of 271 patients in each group, the number of dissected lymph nodes along RLN was significantly higher using RAME than VAME [21] . We also found that the LND number of left RLN in present study was larger than those of previous studies [11, 30] . With respect to total LDN, Park et al. [11] and Deng et al. [30] retrospectively found that robot-assisted esophagectomy yielded more dissected lymph nodes than conventional MIE. However, several recent studies together with our study demonstrated that the number of total dissected lymph nodes was comparable between the two surgical approaches [13, 21] .",

            "text": "Recurrent nerve injury remains a concern for LND around RLN. Recurrent nerve injury was the most frequently observed complication in RAME and VAME in the present study as seen in previously published data. Park et al. [9] reported a 26.5% incidence of hoarseness after robotic esophageal surgery. Park et al. [12] again reported that recurrent nerve paralysis after robot-assisted MIE was significantly reduced from 36 to 17% after 60 cases. After the learning curve of 43 cases, the incidence of recurrent nerve injury decreased from 27.9 to 7.4% in the present study. This might be attributed to the better skeletonization of the RLN, the use of a lower-energy platform, and the use of more cold instruments in recent RAME. This study has some limitations including its retrospective nature with potential selection bias. Although the sample size of this study was relatively large, the number of patients that remained after matching was relatively small. In addition, we are still following our patients to determine their long-term outcomes. One recent study found that RAME was associated with a lower rate of mediastinal lymph nodes recurrence after median follow-up of 20.2 months [21] . More thorough LND, especially in the lymph nodes along RLNs, and more precise esophageal en-bloc resection with the periesophageal tissue may enable a better oncological outcome. Furthermore, we focused on only LND around the left RLN to determine the learning curve of robotic surgery for better comparison; thus, other parameters should be used for determining the learning curve in future studies. Neoadjuvant therapy has been recommended as the standard treatment approach for patients with esophageal cancer to improve long-term survival rates. The other limitation of the present study is that only a small number of patients received neoadjuvant therapy; however, the concept of neoadjuvant therapy is gradually gaining popularity. ",
