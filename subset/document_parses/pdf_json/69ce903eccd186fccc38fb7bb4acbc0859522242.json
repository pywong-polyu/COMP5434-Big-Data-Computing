Only Venezuelan nationals were considered. In this participation criterion, those who did not have a Colombian citizenship identification card and who had less opportunity for access to various social and health services were taken into account. Those who were Colombian nationals or children of Colombians did not participate. There were no restrictions on immigration status (regular or irregular) for participating. For the selection of participants, theoretical and/or intentional sampling strategies, including snowball sampling and referrals, were used, and patients included those who consulted the emergency service of the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Antioquia, and other institutions that were in contact with the immigrant population. In each case, the voluntary nature of participation was regarded.

In Venezuelan migration, the main barrier to any type of health care is immigration status, and undocumented migrants are the most affected. Additionally, the lack of interest in health care plans for migrants who do not see oral health as a priority and the need to satisfy their other needs, such as housing and food, means that the oral health of migrants can suffer and it is only taken into account in cases of exacerbation [37] .",

However, our findings revealed that migratory grief processes were common among the migrants; thus, there seemed to be no cases of chronic stress that would have allowed us to relate to this syndrome. This pathology is largely related to feelings of nostalgia for the family. However, the Venezuelan migration was characterized by being family migration, and having relative members within the support networks was a protective factor. In contrast, those who migrate without support networks tend to have greater difficulties in adapting to the destination country [41] . Although there was no evidence of marked chronic stress among the research participants, it is common to find different griefs and acculturation processes that affect the state of mental health. These acculturation processes have been found to be related to greater impairment of mental health, with manifestations of anxiety and depressive disorders, obesity, smoking, cardiovascular risk, and a sedentary lifestyle [42, 43] . Conversely, regarding oral health, it has been shown that individuals with a high level of acculturation have fewer decayed teeth and periodontal disease and are more inclined toward the use of dental services [20] . This is an indication that in the case of Venezuelan migration in Colombia, there may be a greater impact on mental health than physical health.",

            "text": "An important risk factor for the health of migrants is the different barriers to accessing health services (primary health care, specialized services, and oral health care). Our results showed that immigration status was the main determining factor when trying to access health services, followed by the economic factor. The informality and lack of health insurance among the migrant population stood out, adding to the problems inherent to the Colombian health system. This aspect was mentioned by Abad\u00eda et al. [44] and called \"bureaucratic itineraries,\" referring to all those routes and procedures that a patient is faced with in search of medical attention to finally receiving the refusal to be provided the right to health care. Other authors, such as Tanahashi [45] , treat the concept of \"effective coverage\" as the proportion of the population that receives effective care and proposes an access model with an interaction between the provision of the service and its availability with the population. It is important to recognize the phases that pose barriers to access (availability, accessibility, acceptability, or contact with the service) in the search for effective coverage in the case of vulnerable social groups [46] . Although the Colombian health system has adequate resources and services, adequate access to health care has not been achieved. Only those migrants with the longest stay in Colombia, better support networks, dual nationality, an employment contract, or affiliation to the General Social Security System and, consequently, better self-perception of the state of oral and general health have managed to access health services. This demonstrates the conditions of inequity concerning the most vulnerable migrants, which is known in the literature as the \"inverse care law\" [47] , where those with the greatest health needs are those who have the least access to health services [48] . Finally, another important finding in our study in relation to access barriers is the high sickness presenteeism since, as has been reported in other studies, migrants avoid health consultations in order to not be absent from work; they go to work even when sick to preserve their jobs or not decrease their income [49] . Presenteeism is a public health concern and is associated with a loss of productivity, future sickness absenteeism, and other health affectations [49] . Further research focused on this aspect should include presenteeism by studying employment and working conditions and their impact on health in the Venezuelan population in Colombia [7] .",

The use of different information sources allowed for an accurate triangulation of the findings. The fieldwork was carried out throughout 2020, which allowed us to conduct the interviews before, during, and after the strict quarantine decreed by the National Government of Colombia in the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic. We obtained various perceptions and framed them within the prevailing social, economic, political, and epidemiological contexts. According to the scientific literature, there is a call for attention regarding the important burden of noncommunicable diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as oral health [50] . As it is an exploratory study, the analysis of the categories involved a descriptive scope of a specific population; hence, the findings of this study cannot be extrapolated to the entire migrant community. Furthermore, it must be thought that the social reality may be different in other regions; it is not the same in Medell\u00edn as in other regions in Colombia. It was not an objective of the study to explore the gender category in-depth, but it should be considered of interest for future studies given the indications of our results. Moreover, further studies should include Venezuelans of dual nationality who may be vulnerable.",

Medell\u00edn, Colombia (2020) *. \"[I am] seeking a better future for my family and my babies.\" (I-12, female, 23 years old) (b) \"Because in Venezuela there was no food, there was no medicine, there was nothing, looking for a better one here.\" (I-6, female, 46 years old) (c) \"Because of the situation in the country, because of the circumstances that all Venezuelans are going through, because of this government, a dictatorship.\"(I-3, male, 29 years old) In a chirrinchera [typical Venezuelan word] . . . a chirrinchera is a truck that has rails on the sides, and there, one comes standing. For all that is La Guajira [Colombian region], grabbing the trails of Maicao [Colombian municipality].\" (I-9, female, 56 years old) (e) \"Along the trails and that day, a family member drowned because it was in the rain, and a family member drowned when crossing the river. We passed . . . Well, that was horrible.\" (I-6, female, 46 years old) It is the closest place we have. Even though Brazil is also close to Venezuela, the closest is Colombia.\" (I-8, female, 37 years old) (g) \"Here in Medell\u00edn [Colombia], we had an acquaintance. He was a comadre [relative] of my wife, who was here in Medell\u00edn. She received us for three days.\" (I-7, male, 33 years old) For me, health is the physical and mental state that people have and that must be guaranteed and supported by a system.\" (I-4, male, 35 years old) (b) \"To have a better quality of life, being in health, because if one does not have good health, how can one have a better quality of life to work, to do other things, to take care of even the family.\" (I-14, female, 44 years old) Well, thank God. Since I got here, I have never had a difficulty such as telling you that I have been in bed. Thank God, no.\" (I-16, male, 34 years old) (d) \"Today, I feel a little bad, from the colon, and I don't sleep. Sometimes I don't sleep because sometimes it won't let me sleep [due to] a lot of pain.\" (I-2, male, 45 years old) (e) \"Right now, it has improved because here, at least you can get the right medicine for hypertension both for me and my dad.\" (I-13, male, 45 years old) Oral health status (f) \"I came from Venezuela. I had work done on my tooth [molar], but only halfway-that is, I could not finish it.\" (I-11, male, 40 years old) (g) \"I consider that much of this burden of diseases came from Venezuela, which obviously worsened. Yes, [due to] cavities not attended here, that come from there and are not treated here [and]the difficult access here, they became worse. That's the reason for the emergency care for them.\" (KI, dentist, female, public health professional, The most frequent, precisely that one, [is] that of problems in cultural adaptation, and that is one of those that prevail within these reasons for consultation and that there is a pattern that is repetitive and that one would not only believe that occurs in adults. No, it really occurs in all types of populations.\" (KI, psychologist, female, NGO) As we do not have passports, right now, they [the government] are taking out the PEP, unlike those people who have stamped their passports. Since we do not have passports because we cannot get it, we would have to wait for Colombian migration to take a day to get PEP.\" (I-8, female, 37 years old) (b) \"The first barrier is the link. If Venezuelans do not have the temporary or special permit, they cannot link as they want. For me, that is the first barrier. Once they have permission, they can be linked.They[Venezuelans]  are afraid of losing their jobs . . . In order not to miss their job, they don't want an appointment on a Saturday because they don't work on Sunday. So, they don't want to use the sick leave because they don't want to miss their job because if they miss job, they get fired.\" (FG-1, dentist, public and private sector) Housing (g) \"Here, to rent a house they don't allow you with a PEP; you have to have real property, you have to have a guarantor. You have to have all those kinds of documents, and if you don't have a document to support you, they don't give you anything. So, it is very difficult to be from one place to another.",
