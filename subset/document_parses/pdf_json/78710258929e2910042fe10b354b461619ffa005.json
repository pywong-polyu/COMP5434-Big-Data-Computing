The odds of transmission of respiratory infection during tracheal intubation to a healthcare professional is 6.6 times compared with those who are not exposed to tracheal intubation [1] . Recently there have been few innovations, of using an aerosol box to prevent aerosol transmission during GA [2, 3] . However, its use has not been described in regional anaesthesia (RA).",

The incidence of this photic sneeze reflex is reported in approximately 24% of the population [7] . This would result in risk of aerosol transmission to the healthcare provider. Also, in patients with chronic bronchitis and those with history of hyperactive airways there is a high chance for cough to occur during regional block and even thereafter. Hence, during administration of regional blocks, if the patient accidentally coughs or sneezes then there is risk of exposure to the aerosols. To prevent such risk of exposure to aerosol, the authors describe a new technique for performing peribulbar block in the current COVID situation.",

Routine aseptic cleaning with the cotton soaked in cetrimide solution is done and the cotton is discarded in the other cup. Using 23G needle, inferolateral injection is performed, following which sterile gauze is kept over the eye and digital massage is carried out (Fig. 1a) . Thereafter, the efficacy of the block should be assessed. If akinesia is not obtained fully, then the supplementary injection is performed by standing at the head end of the table. Both hands are passed through the two holes provided at the head end of the aerosol box (Fig. 1b) . The medial peribulbar injection is performed using 26G needle, following which digital massage is carried out once again. The needles and syringe are discarded in the cup. After the procedure is over, the aerosol box is cleaned by 70% isopropyl alcohol and dried before using it on the next patient. At the end of the day, it can be cleaned by 1% hypochlorite solution and 70% isopropyl alcohol.",
