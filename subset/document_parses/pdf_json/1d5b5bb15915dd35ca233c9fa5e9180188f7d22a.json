Hence, if negatively impacted industries have strong lead-lag interlinkages within the network, they are likely to contribute to increasing illiquidity in the market significantly (increased Out-to-Others).

Liquidity providers have a specific inventory level that is adjusted based on a normal market condition. To facilitate liquidity with their limited inventory, they increase their premium. Therefore, asset liquidity becomes negatively correlated with market volatility. This might lead to an assets' pairwise correlation (Vayanos, 2004) . There is empirical evidence of the COVID-19 effect on the market liquidity caused by the withdrawal of liquidity suppliers (Foley et al., 2020) . The authors show that this liquidity supply withdrawal is correlated with the increase in margin requirement by 400%. They also show this effect is more pronounced in indexed securities that electronic market makers provide their liquidity. Investors, on the other hand, become more risk-averse and gravitate their portfolios towards liquid assets, which in turn, put selling pressure on illiquid assets even more (Ben-Rephael, 2017) . We expect to see that the liquidity network will be influenced by the complex interplay between the liquidity demanders and suppliers in during the crisis. Our results illustrate that COVID-19 significantly influences the liquidity interconnectedness across the industry groups.",

For simplicity and ease of exposition, we define \"send\" to mean \"Granger-causes\", and \"receive\" to mean \"Granger-caused by\" and use those terms throughout the paper. Fig. 1 illustrates the dynamics of DGC and its percentage change across all the firms our sample. Aside from a few small spikes, it is relatively stable until the first week of March 2020 when it jumps 35% and then 39% the following week, suggesting a significant COVID-19 impact. We followed this up with a series of t-tests, using 2012-2019 as the base, to confirm that the abnormal DGC impact was during that time. 5 Table 1 reports descriptive statistics of the liquidity network metrics for each industry group during the pre-COVID period, and 3 We use the \"Bayesian Information Criterion\" (BIC; see Schwarz, 1978) as the model-selection criterion to determine the optimal number of lags for each security pair. Then we generalize the outcome using the mode of BIC for the entire sample period. 4 We eliminate pairs with less than 12 weeks of observations. 5 We ran a simulation, to confirm the veracity of these results.
