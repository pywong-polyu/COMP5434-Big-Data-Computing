The Italian Foundation for Research in balneotherapy (FoRST) was asked to prepare a safety protocol to be proposed to the National Health Authorities to allow the establishments to restart their activity when possible, under safe conditions (the so-called Phase-2). The group of experts proposed the following hygienic and sanitary protocols of risk management for the initial reopening of the balneology settings in Italy. The plan aims to define the operating procedures to be implemented at the balneology establishments for the beginning of Phase-2 and to keep them constantly updated in the different periods that will characterize Phase-2 in relation to the trends of the disease. To this end the procedures, defined on the basis of the scientific state-of-the-art available today, will be updated and revised from time to time whenever further scientific evidence and directives from the Health Authorities make it necessary and/or useful.

            "text": "Medical Balneology is the modern, evidence-based version of the classical European thermal medicine, one of the oldest forms of western medical therapy (4) (5) (6) . The \"Thermae\", as an integrated set of medical facilities and services based on a natural resource (the mineral water and its derivatives), offer therapy and rehabilitation, as well as maintenance of health conditions (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . At the Thermae people can learn a better lifestyle, exercise, reinforce their health conditions, recover and develop their physical capabilities, recover from injuries and disease, find relief from ailments. Depending on the type of water(s) and their specificities, skin (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , rheumatic (19) (20) (21) (22) , respiratory (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) , inflammatory (29) (30) (31) , vascular (33, 34) , digestive (35) , urinary (36) , or metabolic (37, 38) conditions can be prevented/cured. Although natural mineral (thermal) waters have long been used as treatment for various diseases, their mechanisms of action at the cellular and molecular levels are now becoming clear. With the huge progress of scientific medicine, the use of an apparently simple medium (mineral water) might seem unnecessary. In the age of personalized medicine, pharmacogenomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and highly sophisticated diagnostic and surgical techniques, the role of the Thermae may appear at least obsolete. Instead, the explosion of chronic diseases and the increase of elderly peopleurgently pose to contemporary medicine the issue of reinforcing primary and secondary prevention, contrasting chronicity and facing polypathology that -altogether -represent nowadays the key words of the welfare systems. It is a true revolution that hits on the healthcare organization models, with the hospitals of the future exclusively focused on acute patients, and a well-organized network of not-hospitalized medical healthcare facilities that guarantee the necessary integrated approach to the patient, from prevention to rehabilitation. A great number of people in the word are taking the issues of health into their own control, at least in terms of proactive recovery and health programs, and one of the places they can do this is the contemporary Thermae. Medical Balneology, when done correctly under medical prescription, provide the benefit of integrated health maintenance, therapy and recovery. There is a huge overlap between proactive health maintenance and reactive sickness care. Contemporary balneology creates programs that combine proactive and reactive components of health. Often contraindicated in the acute phases of several diseases, balneological treatments -in their different applications, from hydrokinesis to aerosol and muds, integrated with classical physiotherapy, rehabilitation procedures and diet -can face several needs of low or medium intensity care of non-acute patients. Medical balneology leverages on the technical and classical know-how of medical hydrology combined, whenever necessary, with standard therapeutic treatments prescribed by medical staff and administered by appropriately trained professional and qualified operators. In line with this view for the future of the welfare systems, the World Health Organization (WHO) deemed it appropriate to include Medical Hydrology in the strategic lines for the 2014-2023 period. Reference standards for Medical Balneology can be found in the Italian Foundation for Thermal Medicine Research (FoRST), the French Association Francaise pour la Recherche Thermale (Afreth), the International Society of Medical Hydrology (ISMH), the World Federation of Hydrotherapy and Climatology (FEMTEC), and in the Hydroglobe Report (WHO).",
