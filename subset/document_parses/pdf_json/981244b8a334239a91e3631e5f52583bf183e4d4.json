Its pathogenesis is complex and involves multiple systems and organs, and it requires comprehensive management. In particular, the immune system plays a core role through an early cytokine storm and late immunosuppression. However, no specific drug can effectively balance the uncontrolled immune reaction associated with sepsis .

We believe that the research papers described below provide a new direction for investigations into drugs for the treatment of sepsis.",

The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein family, an epigenetic regulator of gene transcription, has recently been recognized as a significant regulator of inflammation and immune response in sepsis. Wang et al. opined that BETs not only function as scaffolds to recruit different transcription factors and transcription elongation complexes, but also serve as switches to initiate gene transcription machinery in response to the interaction of BDs with acetylated chromatin either at gene promoters or in long-range cis regulatory elements.

Accordingly, the systematic review by Wang et al. showed that the anti-cytokine antibodies tocilizumab, sarilumab, and anakinra could reduce mortality in patients with COVID-19; in particular, tocilizumab was not significantly associated with any serious adverse events or secondary infections. Further, Yuan et al. have also reviewed the potential of immune-related therapy in COVID-19 treatment and shed light on the current status of and advances in immune-related therapy for COVID-19 worldwide. In contrast to the promising effect of anti-cytokine therapy in COVID-19 treatment, in sepsis treatment, many clinical studies have found that antibodies have no therapeutic effect and may even increase mortality .
