            "text": "New vaccines are urgently needed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which kills more than 1.4 million people each year. CD4 T cell differentiation is a key determinant of protective immunity against Mtb, but it is not fully understood how host-pathogen interactions shape individual antigen-specific T cell populations and their protective capacity. Here, we investigated the immunodominant Mtb antigen, MPT70, which is upregulated in response to gamma interferon (IFN-g) or nutrient/ oxygen deprivation of in vitro-infected macrophages. Using a murine aerosol infection model, we compared the in vivo expression kinetics of MPT70 to a constitutively expressed antigen, ESAT-6, and analyzed their corresponding CD4 T cell phenotype and vaccine protection. For wild-type Mtb, we found that in vivo expression of MPT70 was delayed compared to ESAT-6. This delayed expression was associated with induction of less differentiated MPT70-specific CD4 T cells but, compared to ESAT-6, also reduced protection after vaccination. In contrast, infection with an MPT70-overexpressing Mtb strain promoted highly differentiated KLRG1 1 CX3CR1 1 CD4 T cells with limited lung-homing capacity. Importantly, this differentiated phenotype could be prevented by vaccination, and against the overexpressing strain, vaccination with MPT70 conferred protection similar to vaccination with ESAT-6. Together, our data indicate that high in vivo antigen expression drives T cells toward terminal differentiation and that targeted vaccination with adjuvanted protein can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining T cells in a protective less differentiated state. These observations shed new light on host-pathogen interactions and provide guidance on how future Mtb vaccines can be designed to tip the immune balance in favor of the host.",

Formation of the granuloma is associated with the containment of infection, as the environment within the granuloma suppresses Mtb growth in multiple ways, including oxygen and nutrient deprivation, exposure to acidic pH, and production of endogenous nitric oxide. In response to this, Mtb adapts by shifting between metabolic states often characterized by alterations in gene expression and thus changes in protein secretion and antigenic repertoire (2) (3) (4) (5) .",

The development of effector CD4 T cells is linked to sustained expression of markers and chemokine receptors associated with terminal Th1 differentiation and poor lung homing (24, 25) . Less differentiated CXCR3 1 T-bet dim CD4 T cells are able to enter the lung parenchyma and inhibit Mtb growth (25, 26) , while terminally differentiated CD4 T cells coexpressing CX3CR1 and KLRG1 accumulate in the lung vasculature and provide no pulmonary control of Mtb infection (27, 28) .

Using the well-described 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6) as a prototypic immunodominant model antigen (22, (29) (30) (31) , we show that MPT70 displays delayed in vivo antigen expression as well as delayed immune recognition. This is associated with the induction of less differentiated CD4 T cells but also lower protection in mice vaccinated with MPT70. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that high constitutive antigen expression is associated with increased T cell differentiation but also improved vaccine capacity. In support of this, we demonstrate that artificial overexpression of MPT70 leads to accelerated CD4 T cell differentiation and diminished lung-homing capacity. However, vaccination with MPT70 counteracts this by stabilizing a low degree of T cell differentiation and increases protection substantially in the MPT70overexpressing strain compared to wild-type (WT) Mtb. Our study therefore reveals that antigen expression kinetics regulates CD4 T cell differentiation during infection and establishes a link between in vivo antigen expression, T cell differentiation, and vaccine protective capacity. This has implications for rational vaccine design, and future efforts in TB antigen discovery might use antigen-specific T cell differentiation as a readily measurable proxy for high in vivo antigen expression and increased vaccine potential.",

An FDS score of .1 is therefore indicative of a response with more highly differentiated T cells than less differentiated T cells. During the first 2 weeks of infection, MPT70-and ESAT-6-specific CD4 T cells displayed similar FDSs in the range of 2. From week 2 to 4, the FDS of both T cell subsets increased to 3.8 and 5.9, respectively. From week 4 and onwards, the FDS of ESAT-6 T cells continuously increased to reach 18, while the FDS of MPT70 T cells remained constant around 4, denoting that MPT70 CD4 T cells are not driven toward terminal differentiation to the same extent as ESAT-6 ( Fig. 2a) . In Mtb-infected mice, CXCR3 1 KLRG1 2 Tbet dim T cells migrate into the lung parenchyma and control the infection (26, 28) , while intravascular (iv) T cells have a high expression of KLRG1, CX3CR1, and T-bet (24) . In accordance with the FDS data, we observed a substantially lower proportion of cytokine-expressing KLRG1 1 CD4 T cells after MPT70 stimulation compared to ESAT-6, and this difference was sustained throughout the infection (Fig. 2b) . Investigating the ability of these CD4 T cell subsets to enter the infected lung tissue by CD45 iv staining further supported that a smaller fraction of MPT70-specific CD4 T cells were retained in the lung-associated vasculature (CD45 iv 1 ) compared to ESAT-6 CD4 T cells (Fig. 2c) . . The FDS is defined as the ratio of all IFN-g-producing CD4 T cell subsets divided by subsets producing other cytokines (IL-2, TNF-a), but not IFN-g (high FDS = high IFN-g production). Multiple t tests with correction for multiple testing using the Holm-Sidak method were used to assess statistical differences. Values shown are means 6 SEM. Flow cytometry gating is shown as depicted in Fig. S1a in the supplemental material, using the antibodies shown in Table 4 We next wanted to confirm these observations using a major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) tetramer. In contrast to ICS, tetramers identify antigen-specific T cells without the risk of affecting the expression of certain markers due to ex vivo stimulation. We therefore epitope mapped the MPT70 protein (29) and developed a murine MHC-II tetramer specific for I-A b :MPT70 [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] (see Materials and Methods, Fig. 2d , and Fig. S2 ). In the lungs of mice infected with Mtb for 12 to 16 weeks, we found an average of 2.02% tetramer-positive I-A b :ESAT-6 4-17 and 0.44% I-A b :MPT70 38-52 -specific CD4 T cells (Fig. 2e) . Exploring the expression of CXCR3, KLRG1, CX3CR1, and T-bet showed that MPT70 38-52 -specific CD4 T cells expressed significantly higher levels of CXCR3 (P = 0.0039) and significantly lower levels of KLRG1 (P = 0.024) and T-bet (P = 0.00030) compared to ESAT-6 4-17 -specific T cells (Fig. 2e ). In line with the literature, the vast majority of KLRG1 1 T cells coexpressed CX3CR1, which is associated with vascular T cells (24, 25) (Fig. 2f) , and therefore in agreement with the data obtained by CD45 iv staining.",

The previous data showed that T cells specific for MPT70 were less differentiated than those specific for ESAT-6 during experimental infection. We next investigated the significance of this in the context of vaccine efficacy. Mice were immunized three times with MPT70 or ESAT-6 in the cationic adjuvant formulation 1 (CAF01) adjuvant (35) , and immune responses were characterized 2 weeks after the final vaccination. ICS of stimulated splenocytes detected 0.79% MPT70-specific CD4 T cells compared to 0.42% for ESAT-6, showing that both antigens were immunogenic and, if anything, MPT70 induced higher responses than ESAT-6 ( Fig. 3a) . However, 3 weeks after Mtb Erdman challenge, there was a bigger proportion of ESAT-6-specific T cells in the lung compared to MPT70 T cells, indicating earlier expansion/recruitment of ESAT-6-specific T cells (although this was not statistically significant) (Fig. 3b) . A characterization of the MPT70-and ESAT-6-specific CD4 T cells showed that there was no difference in T cell differentiation preinfection (Fig. 3c) , indicating that there was no intrinsic antigen effect on this parameter. In contrast, a similar analysis postinfection revealed that vaccination with ESAT-6 had a greater impact on lowering the antigen-specific T cell differentiation in this setting (Fig. 3d ). Similar to the observation in Fig. 2a , MPT70-specific T cells had an FDS of around 2.7 during early infection, and vaccination did not change this noticeably. In unvaccinated animals, this level was sustained at week 20, while vaccination with MPT70 lowered this to 1.1. In contrast, the FDS of ESAT-6-specific T cells remained high throughout infection (6.9 at week 3 and 5.8 at week 20), while vaccination with ESAT-6 resulted in a substantially lower differentiation level around 0.8 to 1.8 throughout the infection (Fig. 3d) . These observations were confirmed by KLRG1 staining, which showed a similar pattern to FDS (Fig. S4a) . Finally, we determined the protective efficacy by plating lung homogenates. Of note, at weeks 3 to 4, we observed significant protection of both ESAT-6 (P , 0.0001) and MPT70 (P = 0.0001), demonstrating the vaccine potential of both antigens (Fig. 3e) . However, over the course of four independent experiments, bacterial burdens were lower in ESAT-6-vaccinated animals than MPT70-vaccinated animals (P = 0.047 at 3 to 4 weeks postinfection [p.i.]) ( Fig. 3e and Fig. S4b ).",

            "text": "Constitutive expression of MPT70 accelerates T cell differentiation and improve vaccine protection. To investigate whether T cell differentiation and vaccine protection is directly linked to in vivo antigen transcription, we utilized a recently engineered H37Rv strain (36) (herein called H37Rv::mpt70 high ) with significantly increased in vitro expression of MPT70 due to insertion of sigK (Rv0445c) and rskA (Rv0444c) from Mycobacterium orygis (6, 36) . In line with the previous report (36), we observed that this strain upregulated in vitro expression of MPT70 compared to wild-type (WT) H37Rv, while very little change was observed for the regulators of MPT70 transcription (SigK and RskA) (Fig. 4a) . From this, we anticipated that the H37Rv::mpt70 high strain would have an increased early in vivo expression of MPT70. Transcription analysis of mRNA from lungs of mice 3 weeks after aerosol infection confirmed this, as MPT70 was 6.7-fold higher expressed by mice infected with H37Rv::mpt70 high than in mice infected with WT H37Rv (Fig. 4b ). This analysis also confirmed the observations with Mtb Erdman in Fig. 1a , showing that expression of MPT70 in WT H37Rv was very low at week 3 in contrast to ESAT-6 ( Fig. S5a ). Of note, complementation of H37Rv did seem to affect the bacterial fitness in vitro (Fig. S5b) , which was also associated with a small, but detectable, difference in CFU at day 1 (Fig. 4c) . Interestingly, H37Rv::mpt70 high and WT H37Rv had similar in vivo growth up until week 3, but overexpression of MPT70 seemed to impact long-term persistence negatively (Fig. 4c) . We next analyzed the impact on T cell responses in two independent experiments. Since bacterial load is expected to influence T cell differentiation (21-23), we focused our analysis around week 3 postinfection, where the number of bacteria was the same for WT H37Rv and Table 4 . (e) The bacterial burden was determined in the lungs of mice injected with saline or mice vaccinated with MPT70 and ESAT-6 3 to 4 weeks after Mtb infection (n = 26 to 28). The graph shows the results of four individual experiments (experiment 4 has already been published in reference 29). One-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple-comparison test was used to assess statistical differences.",

The first experiment demonstrated that the CD4 T cell response against MPT70 was significantly increased in mice infected with H37Rv::mpt70 high compared to WT H37Rv (Fig. 4d) . For comparison, ESAT-6 responses did not differ between the two strains (Fig. 4d ). In agreement with this observation, a second experiment showed that the response to MPT70 vaccination was increased in mice infected with H37Rv::mpt70 high (P = 0.0064) compared to WT-infected mice (Fig. 4e) . We then asked whether the early expression and elevated MPT70 immune response accelerated CD4 T cell differentiation and altered expression of markers associated with lung homing. CXCR3 is primarily expressed on lung-homing T cells (25, 26) , whereas CX3CR1 is associated with T cells in the vasculature (37) . Studying these surface markers on MPT70specific CD4 T cells revealed a substantially higher proportion of CX3CR1 1 KLRG1 1 T cells after H37Rv::mpt70 high infection (20.6%) compared to H37Rv infection (11.8%), indicating increased differentiation and decreased lung homing capacity for H37Rv:: mpt70 high -primed MPT70 CD4 T cells (Fig. 4f) . This was also evident in a vaccination setting, as MPT70 immunization induced the biggest reduction of CX3CR1 1 KLRG1 1 T cells FIG 4 Overexpression of MPT70 accelerates T cell differentiation and increases bacterial susceptibility to MPT70 vaccination. (a) In vitro fold gene expression of sigK, rskA, and MPT70 in H37Rv::mpt70 high compared to WT H37Rv.

(b) In vivo fold gene expression of MPT70 and ESAT-6 in the lungs of H37Rv::mpt70 high -infected mice compared to WT H37Rv-infected mice 3 weeks after Mtb challenge (n = 4). Genes were analyzed in technical duplicates using primers and probes in Table 2 , normalized to 16S rRNA expression, and shown as fold increase from WT H37Rv.

One mouse was excluded from the week 12 time point (H37Rv::mpt70 high , MPT70 vaccinated), as the mouse was very sick, had high weight loss, and met the study's predefined humane endpoints (P value = 0.67, if included).

In contrast, the frequency of CX3CR1 1 KLRG1 1 ESAT-6 T cells was not different between the strains, demonstrating that the increased T cell differentiation was a specific effect of MPT70 overexpression (Fig. S5d ). In line with increased MPT70-specific T cell differentiation, a lower frequency of CXCR3-expressing CD4 T cells was found in H37Rv::mpt70 high -infected animals (14.0%) compared to H37Rvinfected animals (20.1%), which also correlated with a higher proportion of CD45-labeled MPT70 CD4 T cells located in the lung-associated vasculature (23.4% to 10.2%) (Fig. 4f) . Together, the immune data showed that increased early in vivo expression altered the MPT70-specific immune responses to resemble those of ESAT-6 after WT Mtb infection. We finally addressed whether vaccine-induced protection of MPT70 was increased if mice were challenged with the H37Rv::mpt70 high strain. Immunized mice were challenged with either WT H37Rv or H37Rv::mpt70 high , and bacterial numbers were determined in the lungs at weeks 3, 12, and 22. Consistent with data from Mtb Erdman (Fig. 3e) , MPT70 vaccination conferred less protection than ESAT-6 against challenge with WT H37Rv (Fig. 4g ). In contrast, MPT70 vaccination induced a substantial reduction in bacterial load at all time points in mice challenged with H37Rv::mpt70 high , providing protection that was comparable to protection by ESAT-6.",

Importantly, during the course of infection, Mtb adapts to the changing environment of the host, and it is poorly described how differential in vivo antigen expression influences CD4 T cell responses and vaccine potential. In this study, we compared ESAT-6, which is a well-known constitutively expressed antigen (32, 33) , to MPT70 that is expressed at negligible amounts in vitro but inducible upon IFN-g activation (5, 6) or nutrient deprivation (8) in infected macrophages. After murine aerosol infection, we observed that MPT70 immune recognition was delayed compared to ESAT-6, which correlated with lower initial antigen expression of MPT70. This is in line with a previous genome-wide microarray study after H37Rv infection in BALB/c mice, where MPT70 expression gradually increases from day 7 to 28, where it is similar to ESAT-6 (40). Based on this, it can be speculated that in vivo expression of MPT70 is upregulated in response to host adaptive immune responses, which occur around weeks 2 to 3 in mice (41, 42) . This likely places MPT70 in the same functional category as the stressinduced genes encoded by the dormancy survival regulon (DosR) that likewise are upregulated in chronically infected mice and IFN-g-treated macrophages (5, 43) .",

            "text": "Given that antigen availability influences T cell quality, we asked how the delayed antigen recognition of MPT70 would impact the CD4 T cell response. In mice infected with WT Mtb Erdman, we observed that MPT70-specific CD4 T cells had a significantly lower differentiation status than ESAT-6 based on the expression of KLRG1, CXCR3, CX3CR1, and T-bet as well as cytokine expression pattern. This is in line with our most recent results, showing that MPT70 is highly immunogenic during late chronic infection, but with an altered T cell phenotype compared to ESAT-6 (29) . Having established associations between antigen expression and T cell quality, we investigated whether there was a causal relationship. For this, we utilized a newly described H37Rv strain, which has high in vitro expression of MPT70 due to a gene insert of the regulators sigK (Rv0445c) and rskA (Rv0444c) from M. orygis (36) . Importantly, we observed that infection with this strain significantly increased the differentiation state of the MPT70-specific CD4 T cells and diminished their ability to enter the infected lung tissue. No differences were observed for ESAT-6-specific CD4 T cells, demonstrating that this was a specific consequence of overexpressing MPT70. These data therefore indicate that the quality of infection-driven T cells is dictated by the in vivo antigen expression profile. This is in line with the study by A. Moguche et al., demonstrating that in vivo overexpression of Ag85B significantly increased CD4 T cell differentiation (22) . Given that Ag85B expression is downregulated early during infection (32) , in contrast to MPT70, these studies collectively suggest that CD4 T cell differentiation is a result of the cumulative antigen exposure, and that highly and constitutively expressed antigens would have the highest degree of T cell differentiation.",

            "text": "We finally examined the link between antigen expression and protective capacity in a vaccination setting. Antigens expressed during late-stage Mtb infection have been the focus of multistage TB vaccines as they may specifically target bacteria during latency (16, (44) (45) (46) , and the expression profile of MPT70 could make this an interesting candidate. After vaccination, both MPT70 and ESAT-6 induced robust protection against Mtb Erdman infection, which is in line with other studies reporting high vaccine potential of these two antigens (13, 15, 29, 30) . However, despite lower immunogenicity, ESAT-6 vaccination induced the highest protection. Although ESAT-6 and MPT70 are different in both size, epitope pattern, and immunogenicity, this observation prompted us to hypothesize that constitutive in vivo antigen expression is optimal for vaccine protection. To investigate this more directly, we compared the effect of immunization with MPT70 against WT H37Rv or H37Rv::mpt70 high where MPT70 is overexpressed. Here we observed that the MPT70-mediated protection was significantly increased against the H37Rv::mpt70 high strain, where ESAT-6 and MPT70 performed similarly, compared to the WT H37Rv strain. Together with the T cell analysis, these data suggest that constitutively expressed antigens are superior vaccine antigens, supposedly because of increased antigen \"visibility\" by the infected macrophages, but due to continuously high antigen presence, the infection-driven T cells are also pushed toward terminal differentiation and decreased functionality. We speculate that this could be a survival strategy by Mtb (47) and show how targeted vaccination with adjuvanted proteins can compensate for this by priming (and maintaining) less differentiated T cells (29) . Although the mechanisms behind this are unknown, previous data confirm that immunization with Mtb proteins in the CAF01 adjuvant induces CD4 T cells of low differentiation as well as Th17/Th17-like T cells that are maintained during Mtb infection (41, 48, 49) . Although this somewhat contrasts with data for memory CD8 T cells (50) , CD4 T cell plasticity is maximal at early stages of differentiation, and it has been shown that Th17 cells and less differentiated Th17-like T cells share many features with stem cells and have the capacity to persist over longer periods of time (48, (51) (52) (53) . Together, these features could potentially explain the observed ability of CAF01induced CD4 T cells to resist infection-driven T cell differentiation, which will be an important research topic of the future.",

In fact, in nonhuman primates (NHPs), it has been reported that very few of the Mtb-specific CD4 T cells are terminally differentiated, and in contrast to mice, almost all of the Mtb-specific cells are found in the lung parenchyma (55) . This could lead to the interpretation that T cell differentiation is of less importance in NHPs compared to mice. However, it has been shown that a vaccine induction of less differentiated central memory T cells is associated with increased protection in NHPs (56) , and so far, it has not been studied whether terminal T cell differentiation occur in NHPs after long-term infection (i.e., after day 49). Indeed, in humans, the degree of CD4 T cell differentiation is increased in people with active disease compared to latent tuberculosis infection (57) (58) (59) , indicating that progression of infection drives T cell differentiation. Furthermore, increased Mtb-specific CD4 T cell differentiation has been associated with increased tissue pathology in TB patients (60) . Together, these studies support that T cell differentiation is an important feature of the protective response in humans, even if defective T cell homing is not part of the explanation.

Splenocytes of MPT70-vaccinated mice were restimulated in the presence of overlapping 15-mer peptides, and two murine epitopes were identified (29) . The recognized peptides corresponded to amino acid (aa) positions 37 to 53 and 93 to 109 in MPT70. These epitopes were further epitope mapped in vaccinated mice with peptides varying 1 aa in length to identify the minimal core epitope which is the minimal number of amino acids necessary for T cell recognition (see Fig. S2a in the supplemental material). We found EYAAANPTGPA and FAPTNAAF as the core epitopes, but as FAPTNAAF was not highly recognized by Mtb-infected mice (data not shown), it was not further characterized. As the optimal peptide length for an MHC-II tetramer may vary between 11 and 16 aa, different peptide lengths extending the core epitope were tested with no big difference in response magnitude as long as the sequence \"YAAANPTGP\" was present (Fig. S2b) .
