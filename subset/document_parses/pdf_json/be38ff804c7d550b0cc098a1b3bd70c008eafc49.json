            "text": "Big data has remarkably evolved over the last few years to realize an enormous volume of data generated from newly emerging services and applications and a massive number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The potential of big data can be realized via analytic and learning techniques, in which the data from various sources is transferred to a central cloud for central storage, processing, and training. However, this conventional approach faces critical issues in terms of data privacy as the data may include sensitive data such as personal information, governments, banking accounts. To overcome this challenge, federated learning (FL) appeared to be a promising learning technique. However, a gap exists in the literature that a comprehensive survey on FL for big data services and applications is yet to be conducted. In this article, we present a survey on the use of FL for big data services and applications, aiming to provide general readers with an overview of FL, big data, and the motivations behind the use of FL for big data. In particular, we extensively review the use of FL for key big data services, including big data acquisition, big data storage, big data analytics, and big data privacy preservation. Subsequently, we review the potential of FL for big data applications, such as smart city, smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart grid, and social media. Further, we summarize a number of important projects on FL-big data and discuss key challenges of this interesting topic along with several promising solutions and directions. 2 where, instead of transferring of the raw data captures from several sources to the central model located at the server and then training the ML algorithms, the global ML algorithm itself is offloaded to the devices [11] . In FL, only the parameters from the local devices are transferred to the central ML algorithm for global training and predictions [12] . This property of FL has a great potential to solve the aforementioned issues in big data. It is proven in [13] , [14] that FL can be used as an efficient solution to address the challenges of big data.",

In particular, the work in [15] reviews FL-enabled solutions for resource allocations, reducing communications, mitigating privacy and security issues at mobile edge networks. A comprehensive survey of FL for IoT is presented in [16] , where FL is used to enable IoT services such as data sharing, data offloading, attack detection, localization, and mobile crowdsensing, and IoT applications such as smart city, smart industry, smart healthcare, and smart transportation. Similar to [16] , the work in [17] reviews the integration of FL with industrial IoT (IIoT) from three perspectives, including security, data management, and IIoT applications. There are several surveys that discuss the security, privacy, and threat issues of FL, for example, security and privacy issues in [18] and threats of FL in [19] . The use of FL is also reviewed for other applications such as healthcare [20], vehicular networks [21] , and open banking [22] . Although these surveys on FL are extensive and can provide various lessons and future directives for the use of FL, they are very limited from the big data perspective, where big data services and applications are important.",

Even though big data is used prominently in today's world, there is still a vagueness in the definition of \"big data\". According to European Commission, big data is large quantity of several types of data generated from different sources like machines, people, or sensors. The data generated may be related to videos, posts in social media, digital images, satellite imagery, and climate information [3] . Big data datasets are of tremendously large sizes with huge dimensions, that cannot be captured, stored, managed, or processed by traditional database technologies [4] .

ML algorithms can be categorized as supervised ML and unsupervised ML. In supervised ML, the algorithms know both the inputs as well as outputs in prior and the ML algorithms learn how to map inputs to the outputs. Classification and regression are examples of supervised ML. In unsupervised ML, the outputs are not known to the ML algorithms but they discover the patterns within the data on their own. Clustering is an example for unsupervised ML [7] . Traditionally, the data gathered from several big data sources is transferred to a central cloud, where the ML algorithms are trained to understand the patterns from the stored data. This approach of training the big data in a central cloud faces several challenges such as exposing of sensitive information (privacy preservation), incurring additional costs in terms of communication and resources, data management and increased latency which make the real-time analytics very difficult [8] , [9] . Among these challenges privacy and security are considered to be very important as sensitive data related to people, vehicles, governments, and organizations can be exposed [10] .",

Besides, each data type characterized by various attributes will demand a specific computing infrastructure to achieve best performance of target services and applications. With FL, each devices and clients may take into consideration a specific data type locally, thus reducing the complexity of local data management at the FL server. \u2022 Analysis: In many centralized computing systems, learning classification and regression models with the multimodality data can be accomplished using advanced methods (e.g., data-based, feature-based, and decisionbased fusing mechanism), but its processing framework will be much more complicated. Whereas FL can offer a universal DL model to different data modalities of a same learning task. \u2022 Scalability: In conventional centralized systems, the scalability of storage and computing infrastructures at the server is problematic because of the complex nature of big data with 5Vs. In the FL platforms, the server only performs an aggregation function with multiple locally trained models to modernize the global model, hence system scalability is capable of performing at edge devices. Intuitively, the scalability of FL is more flexible and convenient than that of centralized learning in the server.",

Due to the rapid growth of the applications, large volumes of data are being generated at an exponential rate, encouraging the applications to generate the data at a rapid pace. Moreover, some companies and organisations employ advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approaches and big data analytics to quickly identify consumer behaviour in order to increase productivity, sales, and profits. Data sharing is a key problem in AL and ML to fulfil these requirements. Acquiring public data and performing data analytics, is not a perfect solution since public data has constraints such as poor data quality, inconsistency, and unstructured. Most of the companies prefer not to share their data for a variety of reasons and concerns, such data privacy, data sharing rules, and a lack of information.Some times the companies may occasionally share information with third parties in order to facilitate growth and mutual data cooperation agreements. The primary goal of FL is to train ML algorithms across other distributed devices using its own private and local data. The locally trained models are first transmitted to the server, and then all of the shared models are combined with other updates to build a better global model, which is then shared with all devices. The main advantage of FL is that the training data is held on the device, with no individual updates sent to the cloud.",

Although the data scientists and researchers use similar model to train the data, the use of FL eliminates the need to upload private data to the cloud or the exchanging of data with other members in the scientific community. In case of traditional machine learning approaches wherein the data resides on a single server, FL reduces the challenges associated with achievement of data security and privacy by maintaining the storage of local data. FL has been extremely successful in handling the various challenges relevant to user privacy protection thereby achieving data security. In FL, the data provisioned at the end-user systems is decoupled and the machine learning models are aggregated ensuring involvement of network parameters in the implementation of deep learning at the centralized server. The primary objective of FL is to understand and learn the global model without compromising with the data privacy. IT has unique abilities to achieve data privacy while training the data in a dataset. In case of \"anonymized\" dataset stored in a server, there are possibilities of client privacy getting compromised if the dataset is linked to other datasets in the framework. On the contrary, in case of FL the information transmitted using FL has minimum updates which contributes in improvement of accuracy in a machine learning model. One of the studies conducted by [14] used a Verifiable FL (VFL) to enable preservation of privacy for Big Data in an Industrial IoT setting. Although the traditional deep learning techniques have been quite successful, but in case of privacy preservation, the traditional data gathering based centralized learning fails to achieve privacy and security in industrial scenarios for the training of data. In a VFL setup, instead of gradient aggregation, Lagrange interpolation is used to set the interpolation points which helps to validate the accuracy of the aggregated gradients. The verification overhead of VFL thus remains constant inspite the number of participants which help in getting optimum level of accuracy. Another example of FL implementation in big data security is found in [34] . It is a known fact that the credit card transaction datasets are generally skewed and the number of data relevant to fraudulant activities are quite less. Hence it becomes extremely difficult to understand and analyse patterns of frauds and later detect actual frauds. The study proposed a FL for Fraud Detection (FFD) framework which enabled the banks to learn the fraud detection model by training the data distributed in their localised database. The FDS is constructed by the aggregation of local computational updates of the fraud detection model. The banks thus can achieve data privacy without having to share the data or sensitive information of the card holders.",

The study in [35] discusses a integrated data sharing model implemented for industrial IoT systems. The data owners and requestors in the study are able to achieve fast and secure exchange of data within the involved decentralized parties. The FL scheme also addresses considers resource constraint issues of IoT systems. The study in [36] implemented a framework for a scenario based on industrial IoT, in which FL is used to achieve optimal level of security. In this work, various factories collaborate with the tensor mining to share their data which are encrypted using homomorphic encryption technique in the centralized server. FL can also be implemented to achieve distributed data sharing in vehicular networks. Towards this direction, the authors in [37] presented an asynchronous federated data sharing architecture for internet of vehicles. In this case, the vehicle is an FL client used to share data with the aggregation server located at macro base station (MBS). The vehicles with various service requests pertinent to prediction of traffic or path detection post their requests to the MBS. The MBS implements computing tasks to resolve these requests using an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework.

Conventional network infrastructures are unsuitable for Industry 4.0 applications due to communication delays and transmission media costs. One of the major enablers of Industry 4.0 is Industrial IoT [39] . Several Industrial IoT applications like driverless cars, intelligent robots, smart medical systems, and smart grid are based on wireless networks that generate big data [40] . Many researchers are working on efficient storage, usage, and management of big data generated from Industrial IoT [41] . The big data generated from Industrial IoT often contains private and sensitive information that should not be exposed as it is vulnerable to attacks from malware, heterogeneous equipments or heterogeneous networks [42] . FL can address the aforementioned challenges in the management of big data generated from Industrial IoT devices as it preserves privacy of the users' data by not allowing the global ML model to have access to the sensitive information [43] . FL can also maintain the heterogeneity of the data, hence reducing the deviation of training in ML model. To reduce the training rate of ML model on big data from Industrial IoT and to reduce the model aggregation's communication cost, Zhang et al. [44] proposed a framework based on FL assisted by deep reinforcement learning. In a similar work, Kim Sungwoork [45] proposed an incentive mechanism for attracting several owners of data for joining in the process of FL to preserve privacy and efficient management of data. The proposed approach adopts two concepts: mechanism design for designing incentives to achieve the objectives, and differential privacy for privacy preservation. Data management in real time is essential in remote monitoring of patients. To take the decisions in a timely manner, the processed data from the patients big data has to be provided to the care providers. Several issues, such as patient mobility and computational complexity may arise in processing the data in real time. FL can be used effectively in collaboration with technologies such as cloud computing and fog computing, ML based approaches to solve these issues [46] .",

In a similar work, to address the problem of leaking of sensitive information of the participants to the untrusted servers in big data analytics, Zhang et al.

This is achieved by encrypting the local gradients of the participants by using paillier homomorphic cryptosystem. For reducing the cryptosystem's costs of communication of the the authors have used a distributed selective stochastic gradient descent approach for achieving distributed encryption during the training phase. The encrypted gradients enable secured aggregation in server. Hence, the untrustred server can learn only the statistics of the participants that are aggregated, while preserving the privacy of the individuals. In another work, Doku et al.

Even the retailers can be benefited by big data analytics performed on the data generated by smart meters to have more transparency of consumer's behavior in consuming electricity, through which personalized services can be provided to them. In the retail market, several retailers own the data from smart meters. They may not share the data to the central cloud for big data analytics due to privacy concerns. Hence, the identification of the characteristics of the consumers is difficult as full dataset can be accessed by the global ML models. To address this issue, Wang et al. [52] proposed a FL based approach to train the learning model on the local data residing at diversified clients without sharing the raw data to the global Ml model, thereby preserving the privacy of the data. In this work, principal component analysis is executed to extract the significant features form the consumer data. Artificial neural networks based ML algorithms are trained on the consumer data using FL approach for big data analytics. In a similar work, Zhai et al. [53] proposed an FL framework, constrained by delay deadline that overcomes long delays due to training of big data generated in smart grids.",

Due to these reasons, conventional AI and ML based approaches are becoming impractical in several data-sensitive and mission critical scenarios, like health, government, finance sectors,etc. FL has received wide attention recently because of its ability to preserve privacy of users as it doesn't send the raw data of the users to update the parameters of the global model. But, FL can still be vulnerable to several privacy and security threats as the attackers can use the shared gradients to derive the privacy of the participants.

These devices include wearables, autonomous vehicles, mobile devices which require ever growing computational power and also has privacy concerns while storing or processing of the same. This pushes the storage mechanisms towards edge computing leaving cloud. Edge computing thus acts as a new paradigm used for the deployment of computationally intense applications and operation of the same. FL in such scenario is an emerging technique that enables privacy preservation while training the Deep Neural Network Model when data gets generated from multiple clients. It is a combination of distributed machine learning, cryptography, security and other incentive based techniques following the basic principles of economy and game theory. In FL, the machine learning based framework consists of many clients who collaboratively train a model with the support of a centralized server ensuring that the training data is decentralized. The machine learning algorithms in such case gets trained at various local datasets located in the local edge nodes. The FL based system keeps the raw data distributed in the client devices instead of aggregating the same to the centralized cloud data center to perform training. The shared model is trained on the server by the aggregating the computed updates present locally [12] , [57] - [59] .",

In traditional systems, all the data generated from the vehicles will be transferred to the cloud and the machine learning or other predictive techniques are applied on the data stored centrally in the cloud. However, as the the cloud will be making decisions from the global information, large volumes of data from vehicles distributed across several locations have to be acquired and transferred to the cloud. This process needs a high bandwidth and also high delay will be incurred. Also, the decisions should me made based on the local scenarios rather than the global scenarios to take appropriate actions in specific locations. To address the aforementioned issues, FL can be a promising solution as depicted in Fig. 6 . FL can be used to train the data from vehicles in a particular area collected and stored at edge devices in near proximity to analyze and extract the patterns from the local area to take immediate actions, preserving the privacy related to sensitive information of the vehicles such as driver details, location of the vehicle, etc. [85] . Road surveillance is an essential application of ITS, where large number of videos generated at fast pace have to be analyzed in real time for the appropriate authorities to take necessary action regarding tasks such as traffic congestion prevention, immediate response to accidents, burglaries on highways, etc. Even though edge computing is promising, new challenges emerge with it like fragmenting the decision models and coordination between the edge nodes distributed in different locations. To address the issues of edge based frameworks when dealing with real time video analytics of ITS, Sada et al. [86] presented a FL based architecture for video analytics which is distributed. The proposed architecture enables distributed and real-time object detection apart from preserving the privacy of the model updates. In a similar work, Xu et al.

FL helps in preserving the privacy of sensitive data related to the vehicles, drivers, etc. In another work, Qi et al.

Even though FL helps in preserving the privacy, it has some serious security issues such as single point of failure of centralized model coordinator.",

            "text": "FL trains machine learning models with devices or relevant data centers and at the same time maintains these training datasets locally in the system avoiding the possibility of sharing raw data. This procedure of FL implementation is usually divided into three phases. The first phase is the initialization phase wherein the central aggregator represents the global model which is pre-trained on a public dataset to each of the devices. Then the devices use the 5G network to train and further improvise the global model on the dataset for each iteration. The local model updates get aggregated by the central aggregator in the aggregation phase followed by the update phase wherein a new global model gets generated to be used in the next iterations. This process is iterated until the optimum accuracy and convergence level is achieved by the global model. The model proves to be much secured with lesser risk of privacy leaks due the decoupling of the training of the model from access to raw data used during the training phase. It is due to the advent of fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks that the number of wireless devices will increase stupendously reaching the scale of trillions by the next decade. The advantages of 5G includes enhanced coverage, transmission bandwidth along with reduction in communication latency in versatile applications of smart homes, autonomous vehicles,UAVs and various others. The average 5G speed will soon be much higher than the average mobile connectivity and this has resulted in the announcement of over 81 billion dollar bidding for 280MHz licenses of aforementioned frequency. In order to use this valuable spectrum resource, the third generation partnership projects (3GPP) have been trying to standardize and enable 5G new radio services in unlicensed spectrum being part of LTE which is a Licensed Assisted Access intiative (LAA). FL acts as a hybrid technique involving centralized and decentralized learning. The model training is done using the decentralized technique and the data gets stored at its source. The raw data is stopped from being transferred to prevent communication overhead thereby optimizing performance and security [72] , [104] , [105] .",

Federated Learning enabled Big Data for Industry 4.0/5.0 FL has evolved as an extremely successful solution for the development of cost effective and secured IIoT applications.

This improves the quality of IIoT training data which may not be possible to be achieved using the traditional AI approaches. The integration of FL with IIoT have various advantages. Firstly, as already discussed, in an FL system the local updates are only accessed by the central server but the local data are kept safe in the local devices. Hence as per the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the FL successfully develops secured, sustainable and safe IIoT systems. Also, since offloading of stupendous data volumes to the server is avoided in FL, the communication gets significantly reduced thereby saving network spectrum resources in the IIoT networks. This motivates the use of FL in applications for mobile devices, manufacturing robots, industrial automation and various others [17] , [106] .",

Machine learning algorithms, particularly deep neural networks get trained using multiple datasets being part of local edge nodes. The raw data in a traditional system gets aggregated to a centralized data centre for the purpose of training. But in case of FL the raw data is left distributed on the client devices being further trained as a shared model on the server through aggregation of local computed updates. There exists several research challenges associated with FL in big data applications. These challenges can be broadly dichotomized into two categories namely the training related challenges and security related challenges. The data training related challenges include communication overhead while performing multiple training iterations. It also includes issues relevant to heterogeneity of the devices used in learning and heterogeneity of the data used in training. On the other hand, security challenges include threats to privacy and security caused by adversaries starting from malicious clients in the local device to malicious users who has black-box access to a model. In case of FL the private data remains inside the device instead of leaving and thus makes it easier for an unauthorized user to learn about the existence of data point used for the training in the local models. Security attacks are often introduced due to the manifestation of targeted or non-targeted malicious attacks in the learning process. In case of the targeted attacks, the adversary manipulates the labels of specific tasks. In case of non-targeted attacks, the attacker primarily intends to compromise the accuracy of the global model [122] . Some of the core challenges in the implementation of FL in big data applications are discussed in the next sections as illustrated in Fig. 8 .",

Secondly model compression mechanisms namely sparsification, subsampling and quantizations also helps to reduce the message sizes that get communicated at each update round. Thirdly, in case of FL the server connects to all remote devices in the setting. Hence decentralized topologies act as an alternative solution during the instances of bottlenecks while operating with low bandwidth and high latency networks. Federated Optimization:There exists various questions relevant to federated optimization in dealing with IID data. There are research gaps between the upper and lower bounds of optimization in FL settings when using intermittent communication graphs which capture the local SGD approaches. But the convergence rates of these approaches do not tally with the relevant lower bounds. Although, majority of the schemes are able to successfully achieve the asymptotically dominant statistical term, but all of them fail to achieve the convergence rate of the accelerated mini-batch SGD. Hence there lies scope of research that would enable federated averaging algorithms to eliminate the gap between the optimization bounds [122] - [124] . ",

Here each device has the possibility of being unreliable because it is quite common for edge computing devices from the network due to connectivity or energy based limitations. The non -identically distributed data collected from the various devices have significant effect on the performance of FL systems. The issues pertinent to system heterogeneity can be achieved implementing the following strategies. Firstly, the use of asynchronous communication to parallelize the functioning of iterative optimization algorithms. This also helps to eliminate straggles in heterogeneous environment. Active sampling of devices at each round while aggregating device updates within pre-defined window is a plausible solution to deal with heterogeneity.

But sharing of various other information included in the training process has the potential to disclose sensitive information to the third party of the centralized server. The secure multiparty computation (SMC) or differential privacy techniques contributes towards achieving privacy in FL. But there are associated challenges of deteriorated performance and efficiency in the model. The management of balancing all of these security tradeoffs act as a significant challenge in achieving privacy in FL systems. In case of FL, the model updates alone namely the gradient information is shared which ensures data protection on each device. But in spite of such attempt, there are open possibilities of sensitive information being shared with third parties or the centralized server while processing the updates of the communication model. Most of the development in this regard emphasizes on the use of cryptography techniques or implementation of differential privacy. But these techniques also have their individual challenges which motivates further development of innovative methodologies to achieve data privacy. As an example, some studies include strategy in which all possible information about counter party's data is acquired abiding to all the necessary protocols. There also exist techniques which allow involvement of malicious parties where they can tamper the system by feeding falsified input [12] , [122] - [124] .",

The defence technique actually focuses on achieving differential privacy in this regard. The most common approach adopted are focused on ensuring secured computation, differential privacy and development of a trusted execution environment. In the process of achieving secure computation, two main techniques are adopted namely -Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) and Homomorphic Encryption. In case of SMC, it is agreed to perform the inputs by two or more number of parties and the output is revealed to only a subset of the participants. On the contrary, in case of homomorphic encryption, the computations are implemented on encrypted inputs before they getting them decrypted. In the process of implementing differential privacy scheme, the user's contribution is masked. Noise is added to the clipped model parameters before integrating the model although it leads to compromising of the model accuracy. The trusted execution environment presents a secured platform to run the FL process in low computation overhead which is presently suitable only for CPU devices [12] , [57] - [59] , [122] - [124] .",

Thus the attackers escape payment of usage fees to the ML experts of the original model or while selling the model to the third parties [12] , [57] , [122] - [124] . Possible Solutions and Future Direction of Research: One of the possible mitigation steps to security concerns is the implementation of differential privacy schemes. In this case, the user's contribution before aggregating, is masked by the addition of noise to the clipped model parameters. Although the accuracy of the model gets negatively affected due to the noise, but it acts as a mathematical guarantee of achieving algorithmic output even when a particular data gets used for the training process [12] , [57] , [122] - [124] . The use of Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) function allows multiple participants to derive a process mutually similar to the ML training procedure. In such case, only the outcome of the function gets disclosed to the participating members but not the relevant training information. The gradients and the parameters gets computed, updated and encrypted through a decentralized process. The custody of each data item are spit into shares that are sustained by the relevant participating entities. The SMPC although helps in achieving privacy during training period but remains vulnerable during the testing phase [12] , [57] , [122] - [124] . Homomorphic Encryption also acts as a mitigation technique wherein a complex cryptographic protocol is implemented that ensures mathematical derivation of the encrypted data and the generated outcome also remains encrypted. HE has the potential to ensure security in both training and testing phase. The possible future direction of research lies in making this intensive computation technique economical to be fit for application in real world scenarios [12] , [57] , [122] - [124] .",

There is also a possibility of FL exposing intermediate results namely the parameter updates from the optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The transmission of these gradients could also lead to leaking of private information when it gets exposed with image pixel data structure. Hence protection of parameters still remains to be an area of concern while striking a balance between privacy-security and achievement of system performance [12] , [57] , [122] - [124] . Possible Solutions and Future Direction of Research: The potential solution to the aforementioned trust issues could be the implementation of secure aggregator. Studies could be done in the development of automated middleware procedure or program which would aggregate all the trained models and send the updates to the ML model owners acting as a robust model against various trust compromising attacks [12] , [57] , [122] - [124] .",

            "text": "The traditional approaches do not work well in the FL paradigm which triggers the proposition of new algorithms such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Federated Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (FSVRG) and the Co-Operative machine learning model. In FedAvg the entire training process is controlled by the centralised server which encompasses the shared global model enabling overall communication. Stochastic Gradient Decent Method is used for optimization to be done on the clients locally. In case of the FSVRG technique, the full gradient computation is performed centrally and the other distribution updates are done at each client by performing random permutation on local data iteratively. The FedAvg and FSVRG approach both focus on updating the model undergoing a synchronized approach for model updation. On the contrary, the Co-operative machine learning model takes an asynchronous approach which integrates the received client model with the global model. Although all the three techniques mentioned work well in case of IID and non -IID but their potential in case of unevenly distributed data in real time environment is still unsure [12] , [57] , [122] - [124] . Possible Solution and Direction of Future Research Development of Innovative Models of Asynchrony: The two predominant communication schemes explored in distributed optimization are the bulk synchronous and asynchronous techniques. On the contrary, in case of federated networks, the devices often remain unassigned to the tasks in process hence most devices remain inactive during any of the iterations. Hence as part of future research there lies opportunity to develop device-centric communication models. These models work beyond the synchronous or asynchronous training schemes and individually each device decides on the time to interact with the server rather than being subjected to the workload [12] , [57] , [122] - [124] . Threshold level Communication Schemes:The knowledge on optimum level or threshold level of communication required in FL is still unexplored. There lies opportunities of research to acquire detailed theoretical and empirical idea relevant to oneshot and few-shot communication schemes in the implementations of massive statistically heterogeneous networks [12] , [57] , [122] - [124] .",

In this regard, Association Autonomy deals with the autonomy and willingness of the devices to join or drop out of the network and also provide independence to participate in one or more networks. In case of Communication Autonomy, the device has the freedom to decide on communicating with other participant devices and also the scale of data participation. Although FL is quite robust when communicating with any device while joining or leaving a system, but the devices may also choose to make agreements to seamlessly enter or exit from an FL system. The Google FL system and blockchain are examples that contribute to the same purpose [12] , [57] , [122] - [124] . Possible Solutions and Directions of Future Research: Adaptation of Centralized Training Workflows:The inclusion of centralized training workflows such hyper-parameter tuning, neural architectures, debugging and interpretability in the FL setting acts as a bottleneck in extensive adoption of FL in real time setting.

In this context, FL is an AI breakthrough in the implementation of big data services and applications. As a result, this paper sets to provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL for various big data services and applications. We have started by providing the fundamentals of big data and FL, and the motivations of the integration of FL into big data. Then, we have reviewed that FL is a promising AI technique to overcome the challenges in big data services and applications. Finally, from the extensive review, we have highlighted several key challenges of this topic and discussed a number of interesting directions.",

Horizontal FL: In HFL frameworks, the edge devices local train statistical models using their own datasets having the same feature space, but different sample space. Due to this property of input training data, all devices should utilize a same AI model (e.g., support vector machine and deep neural networks). For an example of HFL applications, the hospitals collect the health data of different patients with the electronic medical records having the same attributes. \u2022 Vertical FL: Different from HFL, VFL is introduced for the scenarios, in which the local datasets share the same samples but differ in features. To collect overlapping data samples in different edge devices, an entity alignment mechanism is utilized. For an example of VFL scenarios, different hospitals collect the health data of the same patient but differ in attributes, such as diabetic retinopathy in hospital A, cardiovascular disease in hospital B, and diabetic nephropathy in hospital C. \u2022 Federated transfer learning: FTL is proposed for the unrelated learning scenarios, in which the local datasets totally differ in sample space and feature space. In this framework, the knowledge of local models is transferred across domains by the FTL server. For example, in the healthcare domains, disease diagnosis can be collaborated by multiple hospitals in different countries, where the electronic medical records of various tests are collected from different patients. Network topology: Based on the network topology of model communications, this category can be divided into two",
