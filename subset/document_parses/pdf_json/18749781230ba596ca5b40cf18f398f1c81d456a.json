In particular, we focus on social media platforms where we see the possibility of counteracting the spread of misinformation by providing users with more proficiency through our approaches. We argue that the omnipresent trend to abstract away and hide information from users via UI/UX design opposes their ability to selflearn. This leads us to propose a different framework in which we unify elegant and simple interfaces with nudges that promote a look behind the curtain. Such designs serve to foster a deeper understanding of employed technologies and aim to increase the critical assessment of content encountered on social platforms. Furthermore, we consider users with an intermediary skill level to be largely ignored in current approaches, as they are given no tools to broaden their knowledge without consultation of expert material.",

We want to propose the argument that this represents just a very visible tip of the iceberg. Ever since home computing became ubiquitous, the main target of interface design has been to initially make computers, then the internet, and by proxy a vast amount of information easily digestible. Yet, as became apparent in the debate on the term digital native, mere exposure to digital systems does not imply a deep understanding of the technology at hand [2] . Nevertheless, especially since the widespread introduction of smartphones and social media, computer usage and interconnectedness is on a stable path to become globally ubiquitous. In 2018 for the first time more than half of the global population were using the internet in a continuously rising trend [19] . But this development is not accompanied by a simultaneous in-depth education on digital systems. As a matter of fact, it is mainly driven by the introduction of systems that keep their internals hidden.",

Manuscript submitted to ACM One visible manifestation of the problems posed by this fact is found in online spaces where users are provided with a seemingly endless influx of information that is highly personalized [5] . Within the context of the attention economy [6] this serves to increase the time spent lingering on each platform in order to maximize exposure to advertisements. A negative side-effect arises due to the relative ease with which content can be shared and one's own material can be circulated. The lack of information about each platforms' inner workings therefore runs the risk of leading users to draw wrong conclusions about why content recommendation systems expose them to certain media pieces [3] .",

            "text": "With these previous assumptions in mind, we see the problem of lacking critical media literacy to be twofold. For one, rewarding sensationalized news and opinion pieces disincentives unopinionated factual statements, which then leads to a lack of fact checking as it solely reinforces and strengthens previously held viewpoints. But secondly, users are given nearly no agency to assess and explore different opinions once they are part of a filter bubble. One of the few places where exposure to other segregated communities might occur is in globally trending topics, where-once again-sensationalized content is rewarded by being exposed to a larger set of people. Such circumstances are hardly beneficial for healthy and factual discussion, because the most visible opinions are strongly influenced by the prevalent sentiments found in their respective communities and express often incompatible viewpoints. This serves to create environments in which factual evidence is given lesser weight than non-factual content, as it is surrounded by other highly charged statements if it is expressed by another social group. This area is often neglected when it comes to solving the problem of fake news. We see a chance in giving users more agency about exploring opinions and giving more visibility to the factors that contribute to their selection of content. As a first step, we address the increasing opaqueness of user interfaces found on social media platforms. For this reason we explore examples of designs that-while user-friendly-prevent any engagement with the layers below them.",

Some of the problems thus stem from recommender systems, which present users with content that is vast in scale, high in velocity 1 and automatically selected to cause long periods of interaction with the platform. Visible indications explaining the reasoning behind recommendations are often missing, which is especially concerning given that a main factor for pre-selecting content is the user's predicted interaction with it. Thus, unbeknownst to users, they are presented with controversial information in order to elicit interaction with the content [4] . As this property is not communicated by designs, users who are missing this insight have been found to assume that they are simply presented a balanced selection of the content they are subscribed to [16] .",

Thus, while simplifying the initial process of learning how to interact with such systems, any mental models and experiences are strictly coerced into the set of tasks provided by the UI. No elements indicate that deeper knowledge could be acquired, possibly engendering a mental state similar to the Dunning-Kruger effect [10, 12] , as it is impossible to perform an offhand assessment of one's own expertise. This bears the risk of contributing to factors that make users more susceptible to misinformation campaigns, especially concerning the content encountered on social platforms.

Additionally, comments with a high rating stand out visually, guiding users towards them, while an overview of the diversity in opinions is maintained.

Additionally, participants could either interactively adjust the input parameters to learn their contribution to the result or were presented with only static values. A user study showed that, while participants did not selfreport a heightened understanding of the system, the increased verbosity did have a positive impact when objectively measured. This fact may stem from the aforementioned Dunning-Kruger effect. People are only able to truly reflect on their knowledge once confronted with the system's internals.

Furthermore, selective hiding or ranking of such bubbles should not occur, as existing research suggests exposure to opposing viewpoints to be an aide in fostering accurate beliefs [11] .",

Behavioural analysis should be applied to pinpoint moments during which users are not actively performing a task, but in which they are available to interact with a knowledge gathering application for a short time. While research supporting such systems exists [7] , an additional dimension to support such applications could be the users' level of knowledge about the system. In such cases, the system could monitor whether intermediary users operate on a suboptimal plateau of performance. If they do, new interactions or concepts could be introduced step-by-step. However, further research is required to assess if-and to what degree-such information can be gathered automatically.",

In the first two examples we consider designs that would-beyond a prototyping stage-require cooperation with social platforms themselves. The other two designs allow to relax this requirement, as their basic functionality stems from locally analysing user behaviour and serving an assisting purpose. We thus assume those examples to present a valid starting point, with their prototypical evaluation being feasible for first studies and evaluations, due to their concepts being similar in scope to existing related work.",

We see the chance that such developments can provide users with enough agency to overcome adversarial practices that prey on their lack of critical knowledge. For social platforms this should, at best, manifest in an awareness for the existence of social bubbles, the aim of automated recommendation systems and the impact these factors have on the selection of content. All aspects combined have the potential to counteract increasing segregation into sub-communities within platforms and thus factors that play a significant role in susceptibility to fake news. Going further, other areas of personal computing can benefit from an increased awareness as well. For example, an increased resistance of users towards data harvesting practices or premature obsolescence of otherwise functional systems.",

Rather, we see part of the reason for the success of online misinformation campaigns in a manifestation of learned helplessness [13] due to increasingly concise interface designs in which users are taught to act passively. We theorize that users extend newly gained critical thinking skills concerning platforms and devices towards the content presented in them. In the same manner, we argue against automated methods of confronting users with content sourced from outside their filter bubble. However, exposure to only partisan sources reinstating one's own world-view and increased polarization accompany each other [17] and fostering communication between boundaries of in-groups has been proposed as beneficial [20] . In this, we see an excellent example where increasing the visibility of such groups and providing tools for people to broaden their scope themselves is more beneficial compared to the automated counterpart, in which we see a hazard of users assuming malice. We see the possibility of passively making people aware of their bubble's scope and its true size to be a viable option in preventing social segregation in online spaces worthy of further research, whereas relying solely on automated techniques merely shifts the problem space. In particular we see aspects of inoculation theory already being used to instil beliefs in conspiracy theories, such as nurturing a distrust in reputable sources or preemptively giving non-factual counterarguments to any statement that would disprove the theory 3 .",
