Several studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor that increases mortality and other adverse outcomes of coronavirus disease-19 . Studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may bind dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) for entering cells of the respiratory tract. Besides, DPP4 takes part in immune system regulation. Thus, DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) may play a role against COVID-19. Methods We focused on the impact of DPP4i treatment on COVID-19-related outcomes in people with DM. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence on this topic. Results Retrospective observational studies provide inconsistent results on the association between use of DPP4i and outcomes of COVID-19. While two studies reported significantly lower mortality rates among patients with DM who received DPP4i versus those who did not, a series of other studies showed no effect of DPP4i or even worse outcomes. A meta-analysis of 7 studies yielded a neutral estimate of the risk ratio of COVID-19-related mortality among users of DPP4i (0.81; 95% CI 0.57-1.15). Conclusion In the absence of randomized controlled trials, observational research available so far provides inconclusive results and insufficient evidence to recommend use of DPP4i against COVID-19.",

DPP4 plays an essential role in immune system regulation by promoting T cell activation and proliferation, modulating the function of other immune cells, and stimulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines [7] . DPP4 exists also as soluble form in the circulation, where it maintains its enzymatic activity [8] . DPP4 physiologically degrades glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) playing a role in glucose metabolism. DPP4 has many other substrates including cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. It also acts as a binding protein and a ligand of extracellular factors [8] . Evidence suggested that human DPP4 is a functional receptor for the spike glycoprotein of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which is phylogenetically correlated to SARS-CoV-2 [9] . Viral binding is important for cell adhesion, entry into host cells and developing virulence. Thus, DPP4 inhibition might block the entering of the virus in host cells. However, to date, no data firmly support that DPP4 is also a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [10, 11] . DPP4i has been identified as a potential candidate by structural studies [12, 13] which so far await confirmation in human cells [10] . Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that DPP4 inhibition may antagonize SARS-CoV-2 virulence through a reduction of the cytokine storm [7] and lung inflammation [14] .",

The study was performed to evaluate factors that predicted adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 in patients with diabetes.

However, contrary to what observed in many other studies, such association was lost after adjustment for confounders. Use of DPP4i was associated with a lower mortality rate independently from confounders (adjusted HR 0.13; 95% CI 0.02-0.92).

            "text": "Several potential biases should be considered to interpret the inconsistently reported positive outcomes among people with DM who received DPP4i during SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization for COVID-19. These are summarised in Fig. 3 . In general, comparative effectiveness research on GLMs is biased by the so-called confounding by indication [32] , whereby the reasons why patients received DPP4i or not may have driven differential outcomes more than the drugs themselves. For example, it should be noted that, in Italy, where two positive studies were performed, DPP4i can be prescribed only by diabetes specialists. Therefore, it is possible that pre-hospital or in-hospital use of DPP4i was linked to the patient being seen by a diabetes specialist, which can be per se associated with better outcomes. Indeed, epidemiological studies clearly suggest that outpatients attending specialist diabetes clinics have much better global outcomes than those not attending diabetes clinics [33] . Methods have been designed to reduce the impact of so-called channelling bias, including propensity score matching. Yet, quality of the studies available so far It has been recognized that inflammation plays a key role in the development and severity of COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory state and cytokine storm, which can lead to multi-organ damage [34, 35] . DPP4i has been proposed to reduce the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators, such as IL-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), C-reactive protein (CRP), possibly mitigating the clinical course of COVID-19. In several human studies, a treatment with sitagliptin significantly decreased plasma concentrations of IL-6 [36] and CRP [37] . In another study, a treatment with vildagliptin was associated with a significant reduction in IL-6 levels [38] . Saxagliptin attenuated the activation of the inflammasome and reduce the serum levels of CRP, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and IL-6 [39] . However, other studies failed to demonstrate any effect of DPP4i on levels of inflammatory biomarkers [40] [41] [42] . It should also be noted that treatment with DPP4i in patients with DM exerted no protective effects against cardiovascular disease, which is based on a chronic low-grade inflammation. Furthermore, the effects of DPP4 inhibition on the concentrations of active intact cytokines and chemokines can be paradoxical. By protecting inflammatory factors from enzymatic degradation by DPP-4, DPP4i could even potentiate some inflammatory network [43] . This is the mechanism postulated to form the basis for the development of arthritis during treatment with DPP4i [44, 45] , although this issue is still controversial [46] . Conflicting results were also detected in the observational studies included in this review. In Solerte et al., patients treated with sitagliptin showed a significant reduction in inflammatory parameters such as procalcitonin and CRP at follow-up [27] . On the contrary, in the study conducted by Chen and colleagues, DPP4i users showed similar levels of CRP, IL-6 and procalcitonin compared to nonuser [6] . In other studies, no data were available for laboratory analysis.",

The results of these studies might help reveal implications of the use of DPP4i in such patients or DPP4i might finally add to the list of failed drugs against COVID-19. Fig. 3 Interpretation of a possible spurious association between use of DPP4i and better outcomes of COVID-19. Specific clinical characteristics are typically associated with the probability of receiving a DPP4i. In addition, having attended diabetes clinics before COVID-19 or being seen by a diabetes specialist during hospitalization increases the likelihood of receiving a DPP4i. In both cases, the observed outcome can be confounded by different clinical characteristics or by indirect effect of diabetes specialist care. Thus, the direct link between use of DPP4i and lower mortality is highlighted with a question mark Ethical approval This article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.",
