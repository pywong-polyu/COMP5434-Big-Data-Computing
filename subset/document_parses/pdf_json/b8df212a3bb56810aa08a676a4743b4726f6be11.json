For SARS-CoV-2 the reproductive value, R0, is around 2.2 according to WHO (R0 is an indication of the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a totally na\u00efve population). The incubation period 2-14 days. Amongst those who contracted COVID-19, 15-20% require hospitalization, with around 15% of cases presenting with severe symptoms and 5% requiring intensive care [2] . ICU mortality differs between studies but seems to be around 26% [3] . The overall Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is around 4% but differs significantly between populations [4] .",

Oxygen should be administered through a conventional bi-nasal cannula or a high-flow nasal cannula in patients with a need for a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) <40%. Humidification should be avoided to minimize environmental aerosols and thereby minimize the risk of spreading the disease. With a need of FiO 2 > 40% (equivalent to approx. 5 L/min on ordinary bi-nasal cannula), flow can be increased, still without humidification, to 6 to 15 L/ min by using a high-flow nasal cannula, thus achieving a FiO2 of approximately 40 to 60%. For achieving higher FiO2, please consult the paragraph below on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC).",

Pressures of 10-12 cm H 2 O or higher should be used. Please note that use of cCPAP in a general ward requires close monitoring of the patients, who should be awake and circulatory stable. The effect of cCPAP should be noticeable immediately with a decrease in respiratory rate and decrease in required oxygen therapy; otherwise, ICU should be consulted. If oxygen requirements should increase again after they initially reduced, intubation should also be considered.

Most prevalent were renal failure (48%), heart failure (42%), COPD and diabetes (33%), and OSA (28%). It is also noticeable that time-to-intubation among hospitalized patients was only 1.5 days. It may both reflect prehospital routines, but also reflect a significant vulnerability to the disease in patients with the abovementioned chronic diseases. It has been hypothesized that a cause of the vulnerability was treatment with ACE-inhibitors [56] as one of the virus-receptors' is ACE2 [57] ; however, patients are, for now, not advised to pause treatment. A retrospective study of fatal cases in a population from Wuhan showed that 23% of patients had renal failure and 29% had heart failure [58] .
