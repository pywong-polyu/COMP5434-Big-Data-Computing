For example, methylation of the N 6 position of adenosine gives rise to m 6 A, the most common epitranscriptomic modification of cellular mRNAs, representing ~0.4% of all adenosines (Meyer and Jaffrey 2014; Yue et al. 2015) . Interestingly, m 6 A is detected at even higher levels on viral mRNAs, where it has been proposed to enhance viral mRNA function resulting in increased virus replication (Courtney et al. 2019a; Courtney et al. 2019c; . Another common epitranscriptomic RNA modification, called pseudouridine and abbreviated as \u03a8, is an isomer of uridine found on a wide range of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) classes, including tRNAs, snRNAs and rRNAs (Borchardt et al. 2020) . While \u03a8 is the most common non-canonical base detected in eukaryotic cells, representing 7-9% of all uridine residues in total cellular RNA, \u03c8 is detected at more modest levels on cellular mRNAs, where it has been reported to represent ~0.2-0.3% of all uridines (Hughes and Maden 1978; Li et al. 2015) . However, \u03c8 is of considerable virological interest as \u03c8 has been reported to inhibit the detection of exogenous RNA molecules by host innate immune factors including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (Kariko et al. 2005; Karik\u00f3 et al. 2008; Anderson et al. 2010; Durbin et al. 2016) .",

As a result, synthetic mRNAs designed for use in vivo have \u03c8, or more accurately N 1 -methylpseudouridine-exclusively in place of uridine, as seen for example in both the Moderna mRNA 1273 and the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 RNA vaccines for COVID-19 (Nance and Meier 2021) . The reduced immunogenicity of mRNAs containing \u03c8 suggests that viruses might have co-opted cellular mechanisms that deposit \u03c8 on their mRNAs in order to avoid host innate immune responses and facilitate viral gene expression and replication. However, to our knowledge this question has not been previously addressed.",

            "text": "\u03a8 residues are deposited on RNAs via two distinct mechanisms. \u03a8 residues on rRNAs and some snRNAs, representing the majority of cellular \u03a8, are deposited by small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) guided by base pairing between a box H/ACA snoRNA and the RNA target (Borchardt et al. 2020) . Currently, no mRNA targets for \u03c8 addition via snoRNPs are known. The second mechanism for addition of \u03c8 to RNA transcripts depends on so-called stand-alone pseudouridine synthase (PUS) enzymes, of which 12 are known to exist in human cells (Rintala-Dempsey and Kothe 2017; Borchardt et al. 2020) . Most PUS enzymes are localized either to mitochondria or nuclei and, in the latter case, are thought to modify RNAs co-transcriptionally . Of the various PUS enzymes, PUS1 and PUS7 have been reported to be the predominant PUS enzymes for addition of \u03c8 to specific locations on mRNAs in yeast (Carlile et al. 2014; Schwartz et al. 2014) while in humans, \u03c8 has been reported to be added to mRNAs by not only PUS1 and PUS7 but also by TRUB1 (Li et al. 2015; Safra et al. 5 2017; Borchardt et al. 2020) . However, at this point, few \u03c8 residues have been mapped on mRNAs expressed in human cells and for the majority of these, the responsible PUS enzyme remains undefined.",

            "text": "We therefore decided to develop a simpler, alternative technique based on antibody recognition of \u03c8 residues that, while not as precise as CMC-based techniques, nevertheless would allow the mapping of \u03c8 residues with high, ~30nt precision using a much lower level of input mRNA. We and others have described the use of photo-assisted crosslinking of specific residues on mRNAs to a cognate antibody, followed by deep sequencing (PA-mod-seq), to precisely map the locations of m 6 A, m 5 C and ac4C residues on viral and cellular RNAs (Chen et al. 2015; Kennedy et al. 2016; Courtney et al. 2019c; ) and we therefore asked whether a commercial \u03a8-specific antibody could be used to map \u03a8 residues. We first tested the accuracy of this novel technique, here referred to as PA-\u03a8-seq, by using it to detect known \u03a8 residues on cellular ncRNAs and mRNAs. Human CEM T cells or 293T cells were pulsed overnight with a photoactivatable ribonucleoside, either 4-thiouridine (4SU) or 6-thioguanosine (6SG), and total RNA harvested (Hafner et al. 2010) . Total RNA was then subjected to a single round of poly(A)+ RNA isolation using oligo-dT beads and the partially purified mRNA then mixed with an RNA modificationspecific antibody and crosslinked using UV light. RNA-protein complexes were then isolated and incubated with RNAse T1. Protected RNA fragments were recovered by proteinase K treatment, ligated to adapters, reverse transcribed and subjected to deep sequencing. A valuable aspect of this technique is that 7 crosslinked 4SU and 6SG both induce the specific misincorporation of residues during reverse transcription, G in the case of 4SU and T in the case of 6SG, thus allowing non-crosslinked reads to be selectively removed during bioinformatic analysis (Hafner et al. 2010) . We initially used the PA-\u03c8-seq technique to map known \u03a8 residues on cellular 28S rRNA (Fig. 1A) , on the cellular mRNAs encoding RPL15 (Fig. 1B) or SRSF1 (Fig. 1C ) as well as on tRNAs (represented by tRNA-Glu(CTC) in Fig. 1D ) and U5 snRNA (Fig. 1E) . Interestingly, this technology worked equally well using either 4SU or 6SG as the photoactivatable ribonucleoside, a result which is consistent with the finding that 4SU retains the ability to undergo isomerization by PUS enzymes (Zhou et al. 2010) . Previously, \u03c8 residues on cellular mRNAs have been mapped predominantly to the coding sequence (CDS) as well as to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) using the above referenced CMC mapping technique (Carlile et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015) . In our hands, we found that the majority of \u03c8 residues actually mapped to the 3'UTR, including proximal to the translation termination codon (Supp. Fig. 1 ). While \u03c8 residues would not therefore be expected to have a major effect on codon usage, they could potentially affect the efficiency of translation termination, as has been previously suggested (Karijolich and Yu 2011) .",

We therefore decided to focus instead on identifying the cellular PUS enzyme(s) responsible for the modification of HIV-1 transcripts using a gene editing approach, as our analysis did not reveal any significant homology of the region flanking the mapped \u03c8 residues to known H/ACA snoRNAs (not shown).",

Poly-adenylated mRNA was isolated by two rounds of oligo-dT affinity purification using oligo-dT, followed by a RiboZero to eliminate any residual rRNA, since rRNA is highly enriched for snoRNA-dependent \u03a8 modifications. mRNA purity was assessed by bioanalyzer and measurements of both m 6,6 A and t 6 A (which are thought to be present only on rRNA and tRNA respectively); both of these adenosine modifications were present at >100 fold the limit of detection in total RNA but undetectable in our mRNA samples (Supp. Fig. 4 ). As shown in Figure 3 , none of the KO cell lines showed a significant loss of overall \u03a8 content in either total cellular RNA ( Fig. 3D ) or highly purified mRNA (Fig. 3E ). Of note, the amount of \u03a8 content detected on highly purified mRNA from our cell lines (~0.1%) was somewhat lower than previously reported by Li et al. (0.21%) (Li et al. 2015) , but our method differs in that it incorporates two stable-isotope-labeled spike-in nucleoside standards, and our results may therefore represent a more accurate estimation of the true \u03a8 content. Moreover, we note that Li et al. reported a level of 0.0017% m 6,6 A in their purified mRNA samples, which is >4 fold higher that seen in our mRNA preparations (Supp. Fig. 4) and implies a level of contamination of ~1% rRNA, which would be sufficient to increase the level of \u03a8 detected in their preparation by ~0.07%",

In fact, we were able to identify 16 high confidence PUS1-dependent \u03a8 sites, 41 high confidence PUS7-dependent \u03a8 sites and 9 high confidence TRUB1 dependent sites on a range of cellular mRNAs (Supp. The unexpected finding that none of the mapped \u03a8 residues on the HIV-1 genome were lost in any of the three PUS KO cell lines meant that we could not use these cell lines to look at the effect in cis of \u03a8 residues on HIV-1 gene expression. Nevertheless, we reasoned that loss of one or more of these PUS enzymes might affect HIV-1 gene expression indirectly, for example by interfering with the expression of cellular RNAs. This hypothesis is tested in Figs. 5A and B, which show that loss of PUS1 expression does indeed result in a modest but highly significant ~30% decline in HIV-1 Gag protein expression, while loss of either PUS7 or TRUB1 had no detectable effect.",

We were in fact able to develop an antibody based \u03a8 mapping technique, called PA-\u03a8-seq, and could show that this not only allowed us to confirm the location of known \u03a8 residues on a range of ncRNAs and mRNAs ( Fig.1) but also reproducibly map \u03a8 residues on HIV-1 transcripts (Fig. 2) . We were also able to derive human cell lines in which the three PUS enzymes previously reported (Li et al. 2015; Safra et al. 2017; Borchardt et al. 2020) to add \u03a8 residues to human mRNAs, PUS1, PUS7 and TRUB1, were individually knocked out using CRISPR/Cas (Fig. 3A -C and Supp. Fig. 2) . However, analysis of highly purified mRNA samples isolated from these knock-out clones (Supp. Fig. 4 ) failed to reveal a significant drop in the \u03a8 level on mRNA below the ~0.1% level seen in WT cells (Fig. 3D ) and we also did not detect the loss of any of the \u03a8 residues mapped on HIV-1 RNA (Fig. 2) , though a small number of PUS1, PUS7 or TRUB1dependent sites on cellular mRNAs could be identified (Fig. 4 and Supp. Table 1) .",

It also is possible that no single PUS enzyme is responsible for adding the majority of \u03a8 residues to mRNAs in human cells and that this in fact results from the combined efforts of several of the 12 known human PUS enzymes, including PUS1, PUS7 and TRUB1.",

Discovery of Pus-dependent sites was done by subtracting the \u03c8 sites present in the KO data set from a paired WT control data set. To minimize the possibility of wrongly calling \u03c8 sites, where the local read depth was diminished but not gone in the Pus KO data set, as Pus-dependent, we took a conservative approach, using a higher peak calling threshold for the WT data sets than the KO data sets. To ensure a comparison of equal read depth between WT and KO data sets, the read depths of WT-KO pairs (IP'ed side by side) were normalized by downsampling the one with the higher total read depth to the same as the one with a lower read depth using the \"randsample\" function of MACS2. All peak calling was done using MACS2 allowing a Q value (minimum false discovery rate cutoff) of 0.0005 (macs2 callpeak --nomodel -q 0.0005 --extsize 32 --shift 0 --keep-dup 5 -g hs), while allowing a Q value of 0.05 for all KO data sets. The MACS2 called site lists were then passed through a filter while converting the xls file to a bam file (awk '{if($1!=\"#\" && $1!=\"chr\" && $6>=3 && $8>=5) {print $1 \"\\t\" $2-1 \"\\t\" $3 \"\\t\" $10 \"\\t\" $6 \"\\t.\"}}'",

These repeatable sites were then again screened for KO-absent sites using Bedtools intersect. All \u03c8 site overlaps defined as at least 33% overlap. Lastly, the PUS/TRUB-dependent site list was manually curated by the following criteria: PUS7 dependent sites were listed only if there were 0 reads in the KO. PUS1/TRUB1 dependent sites were listed only if the read depth normalized read count KO/WT ratio of both repeats (4SU&6SG) was < 0.2",
