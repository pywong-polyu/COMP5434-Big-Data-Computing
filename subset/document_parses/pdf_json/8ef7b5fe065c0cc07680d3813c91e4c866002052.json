In recent years, with the superposition and coupling of various risk factors, natural hazards have presented more obvious chain, compound, and derivative characteristics. These characteristics suggest that natural disasters generate a \"cascade\" of damaging factors, which require the cooperation of multiple departments [3] . In order to effectively deal with natural hazards, implement emergency rescue operations, and reduce the losses of natural hazards, emergency organizations have formed an institutional and spontaneous cooperation mechanism in response to natural hazards in China [4] . Specifically, the external manifestations of the emergency cooperation mechanism in China are crossorganizational, cross-regional, and cross-sectoral [5, 6] .",

Making full use of the heterogeneous information and external resources of social organizations is helpful for improving the natural hazard emergency response level, a fact that has been recognized by theoretical scholars and government leaders. Therefore, both academic circles and government agencies in China have explored how to improve the emergency response efficiency of social organizations, standardize the participation process of social organizations, and establish a long-term mechanism for social organizations to participate in emergency responses [11, 12] . However, it can be known from the emergency practice of the Wenchuan earthquake that occurred in Sichuan Province on 12 May 2008, the Ludian earthquake that occurred in Yunnan Province on 3 August 2014, and the Lushan earthquake that occurred in Sichuan Province on 20 April 2013, there are still some problems that arise when social organizations participate in the emergency response to natural hazards, such as a disorganized response and insufficient guarantee of resources. At the same time, existing research focuses on the participation mode of social organizations and neglects explaining the participation mechanisms of social organizations. Even though some studies have paid attention to the cooperation mechanism between government departments and social organizations, they have not focused on the dynamic characteristics of the cooperation mechanism, to a certain extent. In this context, this research attempted to solve the following three problems:",

By analyzing the possible strategic combination of the local government and social organizations, the dynamic decision-making mechanism of two game subjects was analyzed. On this basis, a numerical simulation was used to describe the evolution model of the game system in which social organizations participate in the emergency response to natural hazards. At the same time, we explored the influence mechanism of strategy parameters on the strategy selection of game subjects and summarized the interactions between the local government and social organizations in emergency cooperation on natural hazards. Furthermore, according to the research results and the practice of natural hazard emergency responses, countermeasures and suggestions are proposed. In general, the theoretical and practical contributions of this article are organized as follows. This study extends the strategy of the government guiding the social organizations to participate in natural hazard emergency response to incentive and linkage. An evolutionary game model to discuss the interaction between the government and the social organizations is established. At the same time, the key factors affecting the strategy selection of the government and the social organizations are identified. This article gives a more direct and accurate description of the strategy selection behavior of the observed game subjects. Furthermore, the article discusses the evolutionary path of the combination of the government and the social organizations to attain a positive strategy through dynamic perspective and numerical simulation analysis.",

On the contrary, it is also possible for them to choose a negative participation strategy because of the high costs and low incentive benefits for emergency operations.",

As shown in Figure 4a , when \u00b5 = 0.1 or \u00b5 = 0.9, the negative emergency strategy is the evolutionarily stable strategy of the local government. In other words, with the increase in incentive intensity \u00b5, the strategy evolution of the local government goes from \"negative\" to \"positive\" and then to \"negative\". When the incentive intensity is low, the local government shows a weak incentive effect on social organizations. At this time, the emergency benefits obtained from social organizations' participation in an emergency are low, so the local government chooses a negative emergency strategy. Meanwhile, although the increase in incentive intensity may temporarily encourage the local government to choose a positive emergency strategy, the local government reduces the initiative of implementing the positive emergency strategy due to having to cover more incentive costs, given the high value of incentive intensity. This shows that, for the emergency incentive game system, whether the incentive intensity is too high or too low is not conducive to the formation of a positive strategy combination. On the contrary, an appropriate incentive intensity is required to improve the level of emergency coordination between the local government and social organizations. Figure 4b shows that, with the increase in incentive intensity, social organizations have higher perception of compensation, rewards, and reputation benefits from the local government and the public. Therefore, social organizations show a shift from a negative participation strategy to a positive participation strategy.

In conclusion, this shows that the promotion of G 2 has little influence on the change in social organizations' strategies. ",

With the increase in simulation time, the participation strategy of social organizations converges to y = 1. When R 2 is set to 5, 7, and 9, social organizations tend to choose a positive participation strategy because they obtain higher social reputation benefits due to the local government's recognition and publicity. However, by comparing Figures 5-7 , it can be seen that the influence mechanism of R 2 's promotion on social organizations' strategy selection is different from that of G 1 and G 2 . The influence effect of social reputation benefits on social organizations' strategy selection is lagging behind. At the same time, in the early stage of evolution, there is a delay in the strategy evolution of social organizations-a temporary stall. This shows that the compensation and reward given by the local government have a more direct impact on the enthusiasm of social organizations to participate in the emergency response to natural hazards.

            "text": "Setting 2. In this study, we designed the local government's emergency linkage strategy based on two aspects: preparedness linkage and response linkage. On the one hand, the local government and social organizations implement the linkage of emergency preparedness in the aspects of emergency plan preparation, emergency rescue drills, and emergency dispatching platform application. At this point, the local government and social organizations form emergency capital stock A 1 and A 2 , respectively, based on institutional norms and cooperative trust. When the emergency capital stock is greater, the emergency costs paid by the local government and social organizations in the practice of natural hazard emergency responses decrease. On the other hand, the local government and social organizations form emergency linkage tasks based on disaster situation, disaster type, and emergency demand during the implementation of emergency responses and disposal. We defined the coefficient of emergency dispatching \u03b5 and the degree of emergency cooperation \u03b8 to describe the practice of the emergency response linkage between the local government and social organizations. In addition, in the linkage of emergency preparation and emergency disposal, the local government needs to pay for the emergency linkage costs M, which include drills, plans, platform construction, command, and dispatching. Setting 3. In the emergency linkage game model, the emergency intensity of the local government \u03b1 is introduced to describe the level of the local government's emergency operations. At the same time, the participation intensity of social organizations \u03b2 is retained to measure the initiative of social organizations to participate in emergency responses. When the local government chooses a negative emergency strategy, the emergency operation costs and the emergency linkage costs of the local government are \u03b1C 1 and \u03b1M, respectively. The emergency benefits obtained by the local government for implementing emergency responses are \u03b1T 1 . Meanwhile, the emergency capital stock available to the local government and social organizations are \u03b1A 1 and \u03b1A 2 , respectively. Similarly, when social organizations choose a negative participation strategy, the emergency linkage benefits available to the local government are \u03b2T 2 . The emergency capital stock available to local government and social organizations are \u03b2A 1 and \u03b2A 2 , respectively. Setting 4. In order to represent the local government's emergency command level in the process of natural hazard emergency responses, we defined the coefficient of emergency dispatching \u03b5. When the coefficient of emergency dispatching \u03b5 is high, the local government obtains more emergency linkage benefits. Therefore, in the emergency linkage game model, the emergency benefits obtained by the local government due to its own emergency operations and the participation of social organizations are \u03b5T 1 and \u03b5T 2 , respectively. Setting 5. In order to measure the implementation effect of natural hazard emergency responses, the degree of emergency cooperation \u03b8 was defined. When the local government and social organizations choose positive emergency strategies, the matching degree of the local government and social organizations in emergency rescue implementation, equipment, and material coordination is high, given a high value of \u03b8. At the same time, with the increase in the degree of emergency cooperation \u03b8, the perception of natural hazard losses of the local government and social organizations decreases to (1 \u2212 \u03b8) \u00d7 L 1 , and (1 \u2212 \u03b8) \u00d7 L 2 , respectively.",

When the degree of emergency cooperation \u03b8 is high, the local government and social organizations achieve a higher level of information exchange and resource sharing. The evolution trajectories of the emergency linkage game system under different degrees of emergency cooperation \u03b8 are shown in Figure 11 . With the increase in the degree of emergency cooperation \u03b8, the perception of losses caused by natural hazards and derivative disasters by the local government and social organizations gradually decreases. For the local government, the probability of selecting a positive emergency strategy gradually increases, and the evolution speed of stable strategy accelerates accordingly. For social organizations, the strategy selection gradually shifts from negative to positive participation. To sum up, in the emergency linkage game system, the strategy combinations of the local government and social organizations change from (1, 0) to (1, 1) . Meanwhile, by comparing Figure 11a ,b, it can be seen that, when the system moves to (1, 1) , the local government reaches a stable state more quickly than social organizations. This indicates that the local government is more direct in strategy selection under different degrees of emergency cooperation \u03b8. The results of the impact of emergency capital stock A 1 on the strategy evolution of the local government are shown in Figure 12 . When A 1 is high, the local government more effectively implements the preparation of emergency plans and emergency rescue drills in the linkage of emergency preparedness. At this point, higher institutional capital stock and trust capital stock are formed. With the increase in emergency capital stock A 1 , the costs for the local government in natural hazard emergency responses and operations decrease accordingly. When A 1 is 8, 11, and 14, the local government's emergency strategy converges to p = 1. At the same time, when A 1 = 2 or A 1 = 5, the emergency capital stock formed by the local government in the linkage of emergency preparedness is insufficient. Although the local government chooses a positive emergency strategy due to the emergency needs and the responsibility requirements in the early stage of evolution, this eventually changes to negative emergency strategy due to the high costs of emergency operations. Under different values of emergency capital stock A 2 , the evolution results of social organizations' participation strategies are shown in Figure 13 . When A 2 = 1 or A 2 = 3, the evolutionarily stable strategy of social organizations is negative participation. With the increase in A 2 , the costs of social organizations' participation in natural hazard emergency responses gradually decrease. The enthusiasm and initiative of social organizations to participate in natural hazard emergency responses effectively improves, and the shift of social organizations to positive participation strategies is further promoted. At the same time, it can be seen that, when A 1 = 5, the evolutionarily stabile strategy of the local government is the negative emergency strategy. However, when A 2 is equal to 5, social organizations shift to the strategy of positive participation. This is because the costs of social organizations' participation in emergency operations are relatively low. Therefore, a greater proportion of the emergency capital stock formed between the local government and social organizations can cover and offset the costs of emergency operations. It is more straightforward for social organizations to choose positive participation strategies. ",

The local government and social organizations, as the core organizations in the process of natural hazard emergency responses, have multiple levels and various types of cooperation and interaction. The emergency game model of the social organizations participating in natural hazard responses constructed in this paper effectively describes this problem. At the same time, based on the complementary strategy combination of incentive and linkage, the emergency incentive game model and the emergency linkage game model were set up from the perspective of the local government's decision making. The influence mechanism of different strategies on the cooperative relationship between the local government and social organizations was discussed, and the practical path to improve the enthusiasm of social organizations for participating in natural hazard emergency responses was explored.",

Meanwhile, the scope of recognition for social organizations should also be expanded.

The linkage of emergency preparedness and emergency response is to realize the positive participation of social organizations in natural hazard emergency responses by reducing the cost expenditure of emergency operations and disaster loss perception. In the process of emergency preparedness, when the local government and social organizations form an emergency capital stock based on institutional norms and cooperative trust, the emergency costs in emergency operations will effectively reduce, and the tacit cooperation will improve. Therefore, the emergency linkage game system promotes the formation of a positive strategy combination. In the process of emergency response, the local government and the social organizations need to reduce the perception of loss caused by natural hazard and derivative disasters. At this point, the local government and the social organizations improve the matching degree of emergency cooperation to achieve rapid and efficient emergency operations. To some extent, it can reduce the time of emergency disposal and avoid the loss of derivative disasters. Therefore, the emergency linkage strategy reduces the perception of losses between the local government and the social organizations. The lower the perceptions of losses incurred by natural hazards are, the more likely the local government and the social organization choose positive strategies.",

That is, the convergence rate of the local government to positive emergency strategies is faster. In other words, when social organizations choose positive participation strategies, the strategy selection is relatively lagging behind. Therefore, it is concluded that the local government's selection of positive emergency strategies is the driving force for the evolution of social organizations to positive participation strategies.",

The will of social organizations choosing positive participation strategies is stronger with a high value of \u00b5, but the same is not true for the local government. A larger \u00b5 value signifies that the incentive costs \u00b5W are high, costs that the local government needs to pay when implementing various incentive measures. When the incentive cost expenditure cannot bring sufficient benefits of emergency operations and emergency cooperation for the local government, the probability of the local government choosing a positive emergency strategy decreases accordingly.

The different levels of governments and regional governments and different types of social organizations show different behavioral preferences in natural hazard emergency cooperation. The discussion on the heterogeneity of game subjects deserves further study. The strategy selection of the government and social organizations in emergency response is a complex dynamic process. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize and improve the model according to internal and external factors. On the other, numerical simulation is used to analyze the influence mechanism of different parameters on the emergency incentive game system and emergency linkage game system. The initial setting of parameters in the model need to be further optimized.

First, governments should improve the reward and compensation mechanisms for social organizations participating in emergency responses. Social organizations participating in emergency operations should be compensated with funds in terms of human costs, organizational costs, and equipment wastage, and compensation clauses of emergency requisition should be formulated. Meanwhile, social organizations that actively participate in emergency operations and perform outstanding tasks should be rewarded. Second, typical deeds of social organizations participating in emergency responses should be widely publicized by means of emergency response summary, public service recognition, and emergency response documentary. Social organizations that play a key role in emergency management should be commended, so as to form a positive public opinion orientation for emergency responses and create a positive atmosphere for the social organizations participating in emergency management. Third, in daily emergency preparedness, the local government should enhance the public's crisis awareness through activities such as emergency science popularization, emergency publicity and education, and natural hazard census, so as to enhance the participation intensity of social organizations in natural hazard emergency responses. (2) Forming a coordinated cooperation mechanism for emergency preparedness and responses to improve the efficiency of natural hazard emergency responses. First, governments and their relevant departments should be fully aware of characteristics (i.e., personnel composition, professional characteristics, and modes of action) of the social organizations within their jurisdiction that are willing and able to participate in natural hazard emergency responses. Furthermore, governments and their relevant departments can carry out the daily business guidance and emergency task assignment of social organizations smoothly. Second, specific matters concerning the participation of social organizations in natural hazard emergency responses should be included in the formulation of emergency plans. Meanwhile, governments and social organizations should be integrated to carry out various forms of emergency preparedness, such as emergency drills and joint training, so as to ensure close cooperation and rapid response between governments and social organizations in a natural hazard emergency. Third, it is necessary to strengthen the overall deployment of governments and social organizations in emergency responses. To realize the coordination and unification of various emergency forces is beneficial for reducing the costs of the manpower, organization, and coordination of emergency operations. Then, ineffective emergency command information, incomplete order execution, and other prominent problems can be avoided. (3) Encouraging the driving role of the local government in a natural hazard emergency and guiding social organizations to actively participate in emergency response operations. First, it is necessary to guide social organizations to participate in emergency responses in an orderly manner, i.e., ensure coordinated action in an organized, divided, and orderly manner and maintain order at the scene of the disaster. Governments should, in light of the actual situation of natural hazards, encourage social organizations to participate in the patrolling of key targets, screening of risks and hidden dangers, evacuation of people, search and rescue of personnel, transportation of supplies, dredging of roads, and voluntary services. Second, governments should strengthen the management of the receipt, allocation, and transshipment of emergency support materials. It is necessary not only to coordinate all kinds of materials raised and provided by foundations, public welfare associations, and other social organizations but also to provide necessary transportation, communications, logistics, equipment, and other support measures to social organizations. Third, relevant functional departments need to improve the policy guarantee system for social organizations to participate in natural hazard emergency responses. On the basis of fully considering the coordination relationship between social organizations and emergency response tasks, the role of social organizations in the emergency response to natural hazards should be clarified. On this basis, the management methods, implementation procedures, and implementation measures for social organizations to participate in natural hazard emergency responses need to be further improved.",

Correspondingly, compensation, reward, reputation, and emergency capital stock have positive effects on social organizations' choice of positive participation strategies. Therefore, the incentive or linkage strategy adopted by the local government can significantly improve the enthusiasm of social organizations to participate in a natural hazard emergency and can encourage social organizations to choose positive participation strategies. (2) In an emergency incentive game model, when the incentive intensity of the local government is too high, the local government shifts from a positive to a negative emergency strategy. This shows that overreliance on incentive measures reduces the probability that the local government will choose a positive emergency strategy and will inhibit the formation of a positive strategy combination of the game model. (3) In the game model of social organizations participating in natural hazard emergency responses, the evolution rate of the local government to a positive emergency strategy is generally faster than that of social organizations. This indicates that the strategy selection of the local government drives that of social organizations.",

The government can improve the efficiency of emergency cooperation with social organizations by improving funding and material compensation, economic rewards, reputation benefits, incentive intensity, the coefficient of emergency dispatching, and the degree of emergency cooperation and emergency capital stock. The research conclusion effectively solved the three research problems raised in the introduction. The countermeasures and suggestions put forward have positive reference value for the government's practice of natural hazard emergency response. Meanwhile, there is still room for further work and improvement on these research results. On the one hand, when analyzing the emergency cooperation between the local government and social organizations in natural hazards, in this paper, we did not subdivide the types of the local government and social organizations. Governments can be divided into emergency forces and security institutions, while social organizations can be divided into professional types, hub types, and public welfare associations. Therefore, the interaction and game relationship between different types of emergency organizations are complex, and it is necessary to further explore the problem in future studies. On the other hand, in this paper, we only considered the game interaction between the local government and social organizations. However, there are still other emergency organizations involved in natural hazard emergency responses. The interaction and game with other emergency organizations may affect the strategy selection of the local government and social organizations; therefore, this aspect needs to be further clarified in future studies.
