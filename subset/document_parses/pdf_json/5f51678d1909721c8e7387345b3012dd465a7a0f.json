Reckless driving, incompetent preventive measures, and the reliance on slow and incompetent assistance systems are attributed to the increasing rates of traffic accidents. This survey aims to review and scrutinize the literature related to sensor-based driver behaviour domain and to answer questions that are not covered so far by existing reviews. It covers the factors that are required in improving the understanding of various appropriate characteristics of this domain and outlines the common incentives, open confrontations, and imminent commendations from former researchers. Systematic scanning of the literature, from January 2014 to December 2020, mainly from four main databases, namely, IEEEXplore, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of Science to locate highly credible peer-reviewed articles. Amongst the 5,962 articles found, a total of 83 articles are selected based on the author's predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, a taxonomy of existing literature is presented to recognize the various aspects of this relevant research area. Common issues, motivations, and recommendations of previous studies are identified and discussed. Moreover, substantial analysis is performed to identify gaps and weaknesses in current literature and guide future researchers into planning their experiments appropriately. Finally, future directions are provided for researchers interested in driver profiling and recognition. This survey is expected to aid in emphasizing existing research prospects and create further research directions in the near future.",

The presented taxonomy confirms three main categories, the first category is named 'overall behaviour', which contains articles that aim to study the overall behaviour of drivers instead of focusing on one particular behavioural aspect.

To help reduce synchronization errors of sensors' data, an automated method that relies on offline and online synchronization of data streams is proposed in Fridman et al. (2016) . Moreover, Xiao et al. (2020) propose a data fusionbased approach, which integrated GPS data with OBDII readings, to build a model that adapts to data fluctuations and errors in real-time experiments. Kim & Baek (2020) also propose a system that automatically extracts data from sensor-based vehicles for behavioural analysis.

The first three articles (Cai et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; B\u00fcy\u00fckyildiz et al., 2017) propose methods to identify drivers based on their driving data, i.e. personal 'fingerprint'; the first two studies, Cai et al. (2018) and Li et al. (2018) use machine learning methods, while the third study (B\u00fcy\u00fckyildiz et al., 2017) use statistical methods to identify, and draw conclusions on, various driving patterns. Similarly, Liu et al. (2017) proposed a visualization method, called deep sparse autoencoder (DSAE), to recognize of distinctive driving behavioural patterns in continuous driving data. Moreover, a graphical modeling method that can illustrate individuals' driving habits by extracting and ranking their typical driving patterns is proposed in Chen et al. (2019) .",

            "text": "The third subgroup, aggressive driving recognition, is related to studies that analyze driver behaviour to identify and differentiate aggressive driving patterns from normal driving patterns. Zylius (2017) proposed a machine learning approach to identify the aggressive and safe driving pattern by using features extracted from inertial signals (3-axis acceleration sensor); two levels of driving patterns are proposed (safe driving, aggressive driving). A driving behaviour-based event data recorder (DBEDR), which recognizes seven different driving behaviours and a danger level, is proposed in Wu, Chen & Yeh (2013) . Similarly, G\u00fcnd\u00fcz et al. (2017) present a risk assessment model that differentiates various driving patterns. The model categorizes aggressiveness into three groups (low risk, medium risk, and high risk), the study relies on legal authority reports that identified risks based on possible collision damages. Also, a clustering-based grading method that evaluated driving performances of novice drivers against an experienced driver baseline, producing a GPA on a 0-4 scale, is proposed in Liu & Hansen (2019) . Moreover, Zheng et al. (2017) assessed how driver type and driver behaviour are related in an environment of high levels of pedestrian-vehicle interactions; this is done via the use of a 1 to 10 scale; with 10 corresponding to the most aggressive style and 1 corresponding to the least aggressive style. Furthermore, four major risky driving behaviours, are given a score of 1 to 10, and their associated risk levels are identified and evaluated in Yuksel & Atmaca (2020); a fuzzy logic-based risk assessment model is established based on the study findings. Silva & Eugenio Naranjo (2020) introduced a data-driven machine learning methodology for classifying driving patterns into three types (calm, normal, and aggressive). Also, Lee & Jang (2017) developed a framework for identifying potentially aggressive driving behaviours and provided drivers with feedbacks that guide them towards adopting less aggressive driving; drivers are categorized into three levels of aggressive behaviours (high, medium, low). Moreover, Li et al. (2015) allowed risk consulting experts to assign risk scores to participate drivers (from 1 to 5, where 1 being least aggressive and 5 being the most aggressive). Furthermore, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2014) model the effect of aggressiveness on driving parameters, such as speed, longitudinal and sideways accelerations, which cause a scaling transformation on their recorded files. A methodology to track acceptable and non-acceptable driving behaviour and calculate risk model using the envelope of the data and nota prior thresholds, is proposed in Joubert, Beer & Koker (2016) . Zardosht, Beauchemin & Bauer (2018) proposed a method that analyzes statistical features of CAN signals to explore two distinct driving patters (aggressive and moderate). An algorithm that evaluates the driver aggressiveness using scores, called handling risk factors (HRF), to characterize driver behaviour is presented in Hong et al. (2016a) ; high HRF values imply aggressive driving pattern, while low HRF values imply safe driving pattern. Finally, a method that adapts dynamic time wrapping (DTW) and hidden Markov model (HMM) to classify drivers into five different behavioural patterns (timid, cautious, aggressive, best, assertive) is proposed in Yao et al. (2020) .",

Also, Errampalli, Mallela & Chandra (2020) developed a modified car-following model for heterogeneous traffic conditions in India, based on the general motors (GM) model and Hidas model, using data collected on urban and non-urban corridors. Moreover, a coupla-based methodological framework is presented in Das et al. (2019) for the safety evaluation of car-following behaviour in non-lane-based traffic. Furthermore, Qi et al. (2015) identified common and individual driving patterns (moderate, cautious, and aggressive patterns) between drivers in car-following scenarios by developing an ensemble clustering method (ECM) for data mining; based on fuzzy c-mean algorithm (KFCM) and modified latent dirichlet allocation (LDA).

Furthermore, drivers over the age of 76 have the highest fatal crash rates per mile of driving. A major factor that contributes to crashes is distractions, and it is becoming paramount; at this point, to analyze the effects of distractions on driving performance, especially in scenarios where drivers are talking while driving, such studies can provide insight on how to limit the use of secondary tasks while driving (Khandakar et al., 2019) . Researchers need to pursue this domain, to better understand the human factors that contribute to crashes, with the hopes of reducing future traffic accidents and improving pedestrians' and passengers' well-being, because drivers' behaviour has a strong impact on traffic safety (Silva & Eugenio Naranjo, 2020) . Moreover, analyzing specific behaviours, such as car-following, or analyzing drivers' behaviour concerning specific geometric locations, such as intersections, would help understand how certain behaviours contribute more than others to crashes, and why crashes occur more often on particular locations Gadepally, Krishnamurthy & Ozguner (2013) and Silva et al. (2014) . Also, identifying different driving styles and patterns would help make tailored policies and regulations for drivers of certain ages and driving experiences, and guidelines for correcting dangerous behaviours. Researchers should also study the impact of geometric roadway design on driver behaviour, which would help build more suitable road constructions for safe driving (Cerni & Bassani, 2017).",

Because such systems interact with drivers, it is possible to study the effects of existing assistance systems on their behaviour, such as, understanding the effect of ACC activation/ deactivation on traffic congestion and measuring the influence of ACC on the efficiency of traffic flow (Schakel et al., 2017) . Furthermore, researchers can introduce enhancements for the current assistance systems, such as developing a prediction system that is dedicated to measuring drivers' intention at specific locations, such as non-signalized T-intersections (Yi et al., 2018) or determining the effects of integrated collision warning systems on teenage drivers (Jermakian et al., 2017) . Researchers can also measure the impact of introducing new assistance systems on drivers' behaviour, such as measuring the impact of using steer-by-wire systems as a concept for driver de-/ recoupling in automatic evasive maneuvers (Heesen et al., 2014) . Furthermore, researchers can propose a novel algorithm, that employs a new index in its evaluation of risky driving, in collision warning systems (Wang et al., 2016) . Researchers should also aim to develop a conceptual model that clarifies driver decisions when interacting with collision and control systems.",

The study of the effect of certain diseases on driving is of prime importance for advancing the medical sector and the safety of patients. For instance, MS attacks the protective sheath (myelin) covering the nerve fibers, thus, causing problems in communication between the brain and the remaining parts of the body. Researchers compare MS patients who succeeded versus those who failed on-road assessment in Krasniuk et al. (2019) . Similarly, sleep apnea, affects patients' alertness and performance, so researchers have used topic modeling to identify patterns from drivers with OSA during driving trips (McLaurin et al., 2018) . More studies on how other diseases affect driving behaviour should be investigated as well to provide more insight for medical practitioners on how to find better treatments for their patients.",

Moreover, ACC systems have an opposing effect on traffic flow efficiency (Schakel et al., 2017) . Also, most ADAS are preconfigured to be used by average drivers while dismissing the individual characteristics of particular drivers, i.e. no personalization features because they use simplistic algorithms (Wang et al., 2016) . Furthermore, forward collision warning (FCW) systems suffer from a high rate of false-positive alarms (Lyu et al., 2019) .

Most of these systems use a simple sensor to monitor the drivers' behaviour, such as a GPS. They are mostly used for tracking drivers in fleet management. Those systems are not effective in preventing accidents, and they are used for monitoring purposes only. Currently, there are no sophisticated commercial systems, that utilize multiple sensors, such as lidars, accelerometers, and OBDII, to reliably collect data and measure driving behaviour. However, researchers that have introduced DAS in their studies, reported complications in using some of the sensors. Those issues are reported in the section \"issues related to data acquisition and handling\". Other vehicular systems, such as ADAS and FCW have issues of their own and can impact negatively on drivers' behaviour, those challenges are reported in section \"issues related to assistance and navigation systems\". One of the areas that future researchers can work on, is building a reliable driver behaviour evaluation system that consists of two subsystems. The first subsystem is a DAS that utilizes multiple sensors to collects driving data. The sensors of the DAS subsystem should be able to operate on most vehicle brands, thus making the system platform-independent. The second subsystem is an AI-based recognition system that analyzes the collected data to evaluate drivers' performances and help prevent accidents. Manufacturers should aim to develop such a system and make it available on the market.",

Here are the issues researchers need to consider when choosing a method for data collection. The use of simulators, throughout the literature, is mentioned as a limitation (Katzourakis et al., 2013) . Shortcomings in simulation use, include physical limitations and realism, simulator sickness, and data accuracy. Questionnaires provide subjective and biased judgments of drivers (Qi et al., 2015) . It is preferable to collect data in real-time experiments. However, there are challenges that researchers need to consider when deciding to collect data in a naturalistic manner. For example, a smartphone's accelerometer requires high-performance computational capability (Khandakar et al., 2019) . Physiological/biomedical sensors add complexity because of the additional instrumentation required and their effect on driver's comfort and performance (Galarza & Paradells, 2018) . There are also other factors that researchers need to consider when selecting the sensors for their proposed DAS, such as transmission overhead, complexity, reliability, and cost. GPS poses an unaffordable burden for transmission overhead and data storage (Xiao et al., 2020) . Smartphone sensors have overestimation issues when compared with fixed devices (Joubert, Beer & Koker, 2016) . Researchers also need to think about the synchronization of incoming data streams and the exclusion of irrelevant data that sensors usually record. Such issues make the analysis of experimental data timeconsuming and costly (Satzoda & Trivedi, 2014) . Moreover, it is challenging to use computer vision techniques while maintaining accurate and robust results because the line of sight must be aligned with the camera's field of view and cannot be blocked (Gao, Murphey & Zhu, 2018) . Furthermore, there are few distance sensors, such as 3D lidars, that are considered very costly (Zhao et al., 2016) . Another issue is that some experiments require the presence of the researcher in the vehicle along with the driver, which could influence the results (Schorr, Hamdar & Silverstein, 2014) . Therefore, researchers should carefully plan and select the sensors of their proposed DAS with the aforementioned factors in mind.",

Existing surveys mostly focus on reviewing specific topics in the driver behaviour domain, rather than the entire domain, such as investigating drivers' anger (Demir, Demir & \u00d6zkan, 2016) . Some articles review specific behaviours, such as car-following behaviour (Saifuzzaman & Zheng, 2014) , lane changing behaviour (Koesdwiady et al., 2016) , and intersection behaviour (Shirazi & Morris, 2016) , while others review specific driver traits such as impulsiveness (B\u0131\u00e7aks\u0131z & \u00d6zkan, 2016) , sensation seeking (Zhang et al., 2019), and aggressive driving behaviour (Alkinani, Khan & Arshad, 2020) . and Babi\u0107 et al. (2020) respectively. Furthermore, one article reviews the importance of big data and its analysis in the driver behaviour domain (Terzi, Sagiroglu & Demirezen, 2018) . It is important to note, only a few survey articles aim to cover various topics in this domain, such as examining various driving patterns to identify links between driving styles and road safety (Sagberg et al., 2015) , examining driver behaviour in mixed traffic conditions Munigety & Mathew (2016) and Asaithambi, Kanagaraj & Toledo (2016), looking into trends and developments in road user behaviour and traffic safety (Van Haperen et al., 2019) and systematically reviewing articles based on knowledge graph to identify trends in driver behaviour domain (Liu et al., 2020) . However, this complete survey is prepared to provide material on the major driver behaviour research topics that are covered in part or not covered in the above surveys. This present survey covers most topics related to driver behaviour domain and suggests new directions for research and development in the future. It creates a new classification system for recently completed works on the basis of data analysis obtained from various studies. It also embodies what the present literature lacks, which is a substantial analysis that provides guidelines for researchers on how to set their experiments appropriately. Moreover, it explores the current trends' challenges, motivations of those trends and suggests recommendations for researchers. Furthermore, it proposes future research directions for driver profiling and recognition.",

Studies that have not specified the sensors used in their experiments are excluded from Table 4 . Ideally, researchers use devices/sensors such as CAN-bus and OBDII to record vehicle speed; IMU, gyroscopes, and accelerometers to record steering behaviour; GPS to record vehicle position; lidar and radar to record distances between the experimental vehicles and the preceding vehicle. Some researchers, however, use some sensors for more than one purpose, such as using GPS not only to record vehicle position but also to record vehicle's speed and steering behaviour. Such a technique is sometimes adopted by researchers to reduce the number of sensors/devices used in their proposed DAS, thus reducing its cost. The literature analysis indicates the need for a reliable low-cost DAS. Currently, there is no study, in the current literature, that provides clear guidelines on how to build a reliable cost-efficient DAS, nor a study that specifies which combination of sensors is most suitable to use than others when building DAS. Table 3 lists the number of participating drivers, reported in the articles reviewed. The articles that have not reported the number of participating drivers are excluded from this analysis. Due to the variable number of sample sizes reported, the authors categorize them into 11 groups as seen in Fig. 8 . A total of 72 studies have reported the number of drivers employed in their experiments. About 39% use a sample size of no more than 10 drivers. Almost 53% of studies use a sample size of 20 drivers at the most. This analysis concludes that when researchers do real-time experiments, most of them use very limited sample sizes. The authors recommend that future researchers utilize a sample size of at least 30 drivers to generalize their findings and ensure their results are not 'sample size dependent'.",

The authors are careful not to assume the number of utilized vehicles unless it is stated in the articles. Table 3 lists the number of vehicles utilized in the reviewed articles. A total of 58 studies reported the number of vehicles utilized in their research, and out of those studies, 70% (41 studies) use a single vehicle. This limited number of vehicles can lead to limited representation of data, given that one vehicle cannot represent the complete picture of driving behaviours. Furthermore, the use of a limited number of vehicles prolongs the experiments' duration, hence drivers must await their turn in a queue. However, increasing the number of vehicles is also challenging, because it increases the cost of experiments' design and DAS installation. Also, installing the DAS in participants' vehicles, to include more vehicles during experiments, makes the collected data susceptible to biases because not all drivers drive the same vehicles. Figure 9 presents the number of vehicles used in the reported experiment of the reviewed articles. The authors recommend that future researchers allow all participating drivers to drive at least two vehicles, to enable more representation of vehicles and to answer a gap in the current literature. This gap is presented in the form of two questions: does changing the vehicle affect driver's behaviour? and if it does, does the effect of changing vehicles become statistically significant on drivers' behaviour?",

However, it is safe to say that experiments are conducted on driving areas that can be described as urban, suburban, rural, expressway, freeway, and highway. Some researchers stated only the length of the road. Some researchers stated only the shape of the road, such as circuit road, ring road, minor arterial road, and major arterial road. Some experiments are conducted at parking lots and university campuses. There is a limited number of studies conducted in rural areas, as seen in Table 3 , which could serve as a motivation for future researchers. Also, results accumulated from experiments that are performed on private fields and university campuses may have disputed validity when applied to other routes. Researchers should aim to conduct experiments on various roads. However, this would increase the overall cost and duration of experiments, which could be challenging for researchers with limited funds.

Also, in lane changing context, the rotational movement of the vehicle is crucial, therefore, the use of an accelerometer, a gyroscope, or both (IMU) is essential. For studies that aim to capture overall driver behaviour, multiple sensors should be used to record the speed, distance, and steerings, such as OBDII, lidar or radar, and gyroscope or IMU. The choice of which sensors to assemble in the DAS can be affected by factors, such as cost and performance. For example, some researchers prefer to use smartphone sensors and GPS to record driving data; however, smartphone sensors usually require high-performance computational capabilities (Khandakar et al., 2019) and have overestimation issues (Joubert, Beer & Koker, 2016) and GPS has similar issues. Also, 3D lidars are considered highly accurate, but they are considerably costly (Zhao et al., 2016) .

For instance, collecting NDS data from Malaysian drivers in Kuala Lumpur and then label them according to publications from the US presents many issues; as traffic laws and regulations are different in these two countries, and what is considered as \"aggressive behaviour\" in Malaysia could be different from the US. Therefore, researchers should aim to profile drivers based on the traffic laws and regulations of their respective countries, to avoid labeling drivers as safe when they are aggressive in the eyes of the law and vice versa. The authors recommend the labeling process be done by experts who have considerable knowledge of the laws and traffic regulations in the country in which the experiments are conducted. Such a technique would establish driver profiles associated with the country/state traffic laws and regulations. Very few studies aim to do this technique. For example, in reference (Zylius, 2017), in which Lithuanian experts label the drivers into two categories (aggressive and safe). Another example is in reference (G\u00fcnd\u00fcz et al., 2017) , which categorizes aggressiveness into three groups, low risk, medium risk, and high risk, based on legal authority reports in Turkey. Also, in another study in Turkey, in reference (Yuksel & Atmaca, 2020), where traffic officers evaluate risky driving behaviours, the risky behaviours are given a score between 1 and 10. Also, in reference (Lee & Jang, 2017) , which categorizes drivers into three levels of aggressiveness (high, medium, low) according to the Korean roadway operation guidelines. Moreover, in reference (Silva & Eugenio Naranjo, 2020) , where experts from Spain evaluate driving tests by categorizing each driver as calm, normal, or aggressive. Furthermore, in reference (Li et al., 2015) , where risk consulting experts in Japan assign aggressiveness scores, and through these different scores (from 1 to 5, where 1 being least aggressive and 5 being the most aggressive), the driver behaviour aggressive scale is constructed. The authors recommend that future researchers follow experts' guidance and directions when labeling and profiling drivers. Table 5 summarizes the aforementioned studies.",

            "text": "In previous phases, the researchers have developed DAS, collected experimental data from participating drivers, and profiled the drivers. This phase aims to develop and modulate a driver behaviour recognition system that would classify drivers, according to the driver behaviour aggressive scale, using deep learning methods. The reason for using this approach instead of other approaches (like rule-based approaches) is because deep learning is an alternative approach that can help address some of the issues with traditional methods. Rather than attempting to fully emulate the decision process of the experts, deep learning algorithms typically only take the outcomes from the experts. For example, the expert may review several driving scenarios and decide which are aggressive and which are not. Exactly how the expert arrives at his decision is not important for the deep learning algorithm, only what his decision is. Focusing on the outcomes rather than the entire decision-making process can make deep learning methods more flexible and less susceptible to some of the problems encountered with rules-based systems. The authors recommend using deep learning-based algorithms, instead of machine learning algorithms, because they provide deeper analysis, and structure algorithms in layers, to create a neural network that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own. Moreover, it is more efficient when the resultant dataset is huge, which can be challenging to train and model using traditional machine learning algorithms. Before training the classifier, it is important to use a method that can select or combine variables into features, to effectively reduce the amount of data that must be processed, while still accurately describing the original dataset. This is called data cleansing and feature extraction, and it is important because, during experiments, sensors may record data that are irrelevant to the research. For example, a DAS built to record steering data from an IMU sensor and speed data from an OBDII sensor may also record information related to engine and air temperature, which are most likely irrelevant to the research. This is why this phase is important, especially if DAS contains multiple sensors, as such irrelevant data would get immense and subsequently affect the performance of the recognition system. After data cleansing and feature extraction, researchers should train the recognition system and evaluate its performance. Various classifiers should be used during the development of the recognition system, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), deep neural networks (DNN), artificial neural networks (ANN) and recurrent neural network (RNN).

Also, driving behaviour awareness (DBA) model, on a dynamic Bayesian network and distributed GA, to estimate driver's behaviour in lane changing scenarios is proposed in Xie et al. (2018). Moreover, Hill, Elefteriadou & Kondyli (2014) measured distributions of duration and gap acceptance in lane-changing scenarios and examine the characteristics of conservative and aggressive drivers, according to their lane-changing behaviour. Zhao et al. (2016) and Yao et al. (2016) studied lane changing behaviour at the tactical level with on-road perspective. The first publication (Zhao et al., 2016) addresses vehicle trajectory collection, while the second one (Yao et al., 2016) proposes an automatic method for extracting lane change segments from continuous driving. A fusion approach that utilizes multiple differing modality data for detecting driver's lane change behaviour via the use of a dimensionality reduction model, is proposed in Gao, Murphey & Zhu (2019). Moreover, Wang et al. (2019) proposed a theoretical lane change warning model, that determines warning thresholds for dangerous lane changing behaviours. Also, researchers have examined the effect of integrated collision, on teenage drivers, in lane-changing maneuvers, in Jermakian et al. (2017). Finally, researchers compute left lane occupation time, by performing calibration of overtaking acceleration models, in Llorca, Moreno & Garcia (2016).",
