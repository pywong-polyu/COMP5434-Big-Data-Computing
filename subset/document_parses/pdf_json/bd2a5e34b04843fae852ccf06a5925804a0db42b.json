Stability of agricultural imports directly affects domestic food availability, and hence influences national food security. This study is important to gauge effects of uncertainty resulting from global and domestic economic policy changes on the stability component of food security in China. Though many studies have explored the determinants and consequences of Chinese agricultural trade, research focusing on stability of agricultural imports is lacking. To fill the gap, this study calculates duration length and survival probability of China's agri-food imports, and estimates effects of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on the stability. Results show that trade duration of the agri-food imports is 12.07 months in China. However, 51.69% of disrupted trade relationships would resume after 2 months and 92.68% of temporarily interrupted trade relationships return to the market after 12 months. Empirical estimations show that global EPU has a larger impact on the stability of agricultural imports than Chinese EPU. Although Chinese EPU has heterogeneous effects on imports of different agri-food products in China, global EPU does not. Stabilized domestic food price and improved domestic agricultural productivity would improve stability of the imports significantly. The study concludes that China's agricultural imports are less dynamic than previous studies claimed. However, EPU significantly erodes the trade stability. To offset negative effects of EPU on the stability, government should pay more attention on stabilizing domestic food price volatility and increasing food productivity, and therefore improve food security in China.",

Firstly, China has had to increase food imports to feed 1. 44 population) with only limited cultivated land (10% of world's cultivated land) [2] . Secondly, the growing disposable household income, rapidly urbanization, and changes of consumers' preference have led to more demand for agri-food imports in China. The ratio of food imports over merchandise imports has fluctuated in China, rising from 4.6% in 2010 to 6 .6% in 2019 [3] and this trend is projected to continue in the future [1, 2, 4] . Consequently, the nature of food security is changing as China's agricultural imports overtake its agricultural exports.",

Huang et al. have argued that trade flow of agricultural imports depends heavily on government's policy [4] .

The increasing trade volume implies that China plays a more important role in the world agricultural market, potentially influencing prices of the global market and stakeholders' profit. Studies have validated the importance of agricultural imports to increase domestic agri-food availability and ensure food security [1, 5, 6] . However, a successful trade pattern or trade growth depends not only on exploring new markets and building new trade relationships, but also on the survival and growth of existing trade activities [7] . Previous studies were mainly focused on the impacts of agricultural trade on economic development in China [8, 9] , but ignored the stability of agricultural imports. This study therefore aims to examine stability of China's agri-food imports and quantify effects of EPU on the stability.",

Responding to the pandemic, most countries imposed strict city-, state-and nation-wide lockdown which dramatically interrupted international trade and global supply chain [14] .

However, these studies ignored stability or failure probability of a trade activity. In their pioneering work, Besede\u0161 and Prusa [10] surprisingly discovered that an average trade duration of aggregate US imports only lasted for one to four years. More empirical investigations in other developed countries have been done. For example, Sabuhoro et al. [22] investigated export duration of Canadian products and found that the median survival time was only 20 months. Subsequently, following the same analysis technique, extensive research has been done to examine duration of merchandise or service trade in European countries. Nitsch [23] discovered that the mean trade duration for German aggregate imports was about three years. Similarly, for the EU, the mean trade duration for their aggregate imports from 140 non-EU exporters was also about three years [24] . Trade pattern has been more sustainable in Asian countries than other western developed ones. Obashi [25] reported that the trade duration was about 7.7 years for intra-Asian machinery trade. Brenton et al. [7] claimed that disruption to a trade activity was very perilous in low-income countries and suggested that learning-by-doing was an effective way to increase the chance of export.",

Trade pattern for agri-food products, therefore, is believed to be different from other commercial products, and deserve a separate study other than the analysis of aggregate commodity. Peterson et al. [26] analyzed the trade relationship of fresh fruit and vegetables between the U.S. and exporters. They reported that 55% of the trade relationships lasted less than three years, and about one third of them survived only for one year. Focusing on dairy exports duration and survival probability in New Zealand, Luo and Bano [27] found that around 50% of trade relationships survived only for about 2 years. Some research has been conducted on trade duration of agri-food products in developing countries. Wang et al. [28] studied trade duration of ASEAN's seafood exports, and concluded that the average trade duration was 4.4 years over the study period. While the mean duration of Zambia's agricultural products was only 1.7 years between 1996 and 2019 [29] . Idris et al. [30] found that, from 2000 to 2017, the median export survival time of processed food in Malaysia was two years. While a large body of literature examined agricultural trade pattern for different countries, few of them investigated the trade dynamics of China's agri-food products imports.",

Government policy changes certainly would affect market behavior and trade flow [4] . The EPU, which measures market risks induced from economic policies, would clearly alarm sustainable economic and social development, including international trade activities [33, 34] .

            "text": "Effects of EPU have gained much more attention recently due to its sharp increase in both magnitude and volatility. Several studies have confirmed that EPU has negative effects on firms' research and investment, employment, consumer behavior, stock market performance, crude oil price, exchange rate, global trade growth, etc. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . The on-going COVID-19 pandemic raises global economic uncertainty, leading to agricultural trade disruption which raises food prices and reduces food security globally [43, 44] . Abaidoo [45] concluded that EPU arising from the U.S. and the Chinese economies have significant constraining impact on international trade. As China is taking more market share of the global market, researchers and policy makers are curious about whether China's influence on international market will grow as well. Tam [46] showed that EPU of both the U.S. and China significantly affected global trade flow, however, they affected global market in different ways. Specifically, the impacts of the U.S. were largely attributed to its indirect trade linkages with other economies, while China influences global trade flow through direct integration into the global value chain. Moreover, Zhang et al. [47] applied EPU of the U.S. and EPU of China separately to estimate their effects on international economy markets, including stock performance, credit, energy, and commodity market. They reported that, although China had a growing influence on international market, the U.S. had a dominant power in all markets. Handley and Lim\u00e3o [48] studied the effects of China as a WTO member on both China's economic performance and other markets. They concluded that joining the WTO reduced market uncertainty for China dramatically, increased China's exports to the U.S. but not to the other markets, and raised the U.S. consumers' income by an equivalent of a 13-percentage-point permanent tariff decrease. Importantly, some research has analyzed effects of EPU on agricultural trade. Xiao et al. [49] concluded that China's EPU affected agricultural products' markets differently. Specifically, China's EPU has a greater influence on future prices of maize and soybean than that of wheat. Based on a Time-Varying Parameter Stochastic Volatility Vector Autoregression model, Li and Li [50] confirmed that China's EPU has a significant negative impact on sustainability of its net grain imports. However, they failed to quantify the effects.",

The duration of trade spell (trade duration) is defined as the consecutive number of months with positive imports [11, 26] . A trade activity with a longer duration is considered more stable and sustainable.",

The EPU of China (China_EPU) reflects a scaled frequency count of articles about policy-related economic uncertainty in two mainland newspapers: Renmin Daily and Guangming Daily. The Remin Daily is the largest newspaper in China and Guangming Daily is a national daily newspaper targeting the higher educated groups. Davis [16] calculated a global EPU index to measure global market uncertainty (Global_EPU). These two indices reflect different sources of market uncertainty that alerts China's agricultural imports. As China became the largest agricultural importer, it is important to examine whether China has an increasing market influence as well. This study applies the China_EPU and Global_EPU respectively, to distinguish and compare domestic and international influences. Table 3 presents statistic summary of the EPU indexes. Over given period, from January 2005 to July 2020, the mean of China_EPU is 153.31, while the mean of Global_EPU is 148.21. The China_EPU has always been higher than Global_EPU over the given period, and the maximum of China_EPU (649.07) is more than 50% larger than that of Global_EPU (429.46). Standard deviation of China_EPU is larger than that of Globa-l_EPU as well, indicating that China_EPU has a higher volatility. Substantial volatility of EPU Table 3 presents other determinants of agri-food product imports in China. Larger trade volume indicates a bigger market and larger initial investment. Any termination of trade relationship with a larger trade volume would cause more loss. The variable L_tradevalue is logarithm of bilateral trade value. The average L_tradevalue is 12.49 over the study period. Other demand and supply shifters of agri-food products also influence trade pattern of agricultural imports.",

Similarly, whether the active trade spell in July 2020 would continue to exist in the following month (August 2020) is not known. Therefore, left censored issue occurs when trade spells started before January 2005, and right censored issue happens as trade spells continue past July 2020. Compared to annual data, monthly data have less censored observations. For example, there are 20% censored observations in Besede\u0161 and Prusa [10] and about 40% censored observations in Peterson et al. [26] , while this study only has 0.4% left censored observations and 0.67% right censored observations. Hess and Persson [24] claimed that the right censored observations did not affect estimation efficiency while left censored observations might cause estimation bias, and therefore suggested that all left censored observation should be dropped. Following previous practice [24, 28] , this study drops all left censored observations. To examine how left censored observations affect KM estimator, results of both left censored dropped sub-sample and whole sample are presented in Table 4 .",

The protein sources products have the longest trade duration (13.46 months), followed by prepared products (12.58 months), cereals (10.89 months), and fruit and vegetable (10.66 months). Though protein products have the highest survival rate at any given specific time, only the prepared products have active trade activity in the 19 th month. Researchers and policy makers consistently agree that the WTO has made a great contribution to eliminate trade barriers. The WTO regulations are assumed to affect trade duration and survival rate of China's agricultural imports as well. Table 4 presents China's agricultural imports' trade duration and survival probability at a specific time considering whether the exporter is a WTO member. Bilateral trade relationships with WTO members clearly increase trade duration length. The trade duration is 12.38 months if the exporter is a member of WTO. On the other hand, with a non-WTO member the trade duration is only 8.24 months. Building a trade relationship with a member of WTO increases trade duration length by at least 50%.",

The study showed that global EPU index has a larger impact on Chinese agri-food imports than China's EPU, indicating that China does not have enough market power and therefore cannot influence agricultural trade market. China's agri-food imports can be easily affected by economic uncertainty induced from international market. With increasing dependency on international market for agri-food products supply, lack of market power might erode China's food security and sustainable development in future. China government should pay more attention on mitigating agri-food price shocks from international market. The China_EPU has heterogeneity impacts on different agri-food products, while effects of Global_EPU do not have significant differences among all groups. The results suggest that, to stabilize agri-food imports, China government could launch product-targeted policy. Effects of both China_EPU and Global_EPU on protein sourced products are significantly different from the whole sample. Kaplan-Meier indicates protein-sourced food has a different trade pattern from others with a longer survival rate. As consumers' preference changes and dietary habit shifts from traditional staples and vegetables to high protein products, the importance of protein products for food security increases in China. Considering the production restrictions of high protein products, especially animal sources protein, government needs to pay more attention on stabilizing protein products imports.",

Domestic food productivity has a positive effect on the failure probability. Hence, if China improves its agricultural productivity, the likelihood of the imports stops would increase.

This study considers multiple spells as an individual trade spell. Let us take China's soybean imports in 2005 as an example. If the imports relationship was consecutively active from January 2005 to May 2005, but in June 2005 the trade activity stopped, and the trade activity resumed in July 2005 and continually lasted to December 2005, this study considers that there are two trade spells in 2005 with 5 months' and 6 months' trade duration, respectively. Fig 1 presents distribution of trade spells for this study. The number of trade spells per trade relationship varies remarkably during the research period. The number of trade spells has a mean of 17.22, and the median is 14. Only 383 (0.23%) trade activities have one trade spell, while 100 (0.06%) trade activities have 55 Fig 1.

Intervals between trade spells are very short. 51.69% of failed trade relationship would resume after two months, 84.22% of stopped trade relationship revives within six months (half a year), and 92.68% of temporarily interrupted trade relationships are back to market after 12 months (one year). Combining trade duration length and short intervals between two trade spells, this study concludes that agri-food imports are relative stable in China. The other conclusions are shown as followings:1. Both Chinese EPU and global EPU decreases stability of the existing agricultural trade relationship significantly, while the global EPU index has a larger impact on Chinese agri-food imports than China's EPU.2. Effects of EPU indices on the stability vary among agri-food products. Protein-sourced food has a different trade pattern from others with a longer survival rate. The China_EPU has heterogeneity impacts on different agri-food products, while effects of Global_EPU do not have significant differences among all groups.",
