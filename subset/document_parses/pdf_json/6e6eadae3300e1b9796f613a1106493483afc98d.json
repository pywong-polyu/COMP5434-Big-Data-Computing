Conclusions based on healthcare records rather than self-report (as in our study) are less clear, with vaccination associated with reduced rates of only specific symptoms [5] and diagnoses [9] , though under-presentation, under-diagnosis, and under-recording are all possible [10] .

Participants are routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 at follow-up visits, therefore our study includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, as well as self-reported tests. We adjusted for multiple factors related to vaccination uptake [7] and long-term symptoms [13] . However, as with any observational study, some unmeasured confounding may remain. In particular, because the question on Long Covid was not introduced until 3 February 2021, shortly after mass COVID-19 vaccination started in the UK on 8 December 2020, one key limitation is that it was not possible to match double-vaccinated and unvaccinated participants on calendar time of infection (Supplementary Figure 1) . Differences in the likelihood of developing Long Covid symptoms between exposure groups may therefore partly reflect changes in the dominant COVID-19 variant or other period effects. Our key exposure was double vaccination, despite third and booster doses now being available, and the study period was before the Omicron variant became widespread. We were not able to investigate participants who were single-vaccinated when infected because nearly all of these received their second dose within the 12-week follow-up period, confounding any relationship between one dose at infection and Long Covid symptoms.",

Density estimated from 3,333 double-vaccinated participants and 9,854 unvaccinated participants before matching. Supplementary Figure 1 demonstrates that there was almost no common support in the distribution of calendar time of infection stratified by vaccination status when infected. This means that it was not possible to match double-vaccinated and unvaccinated participants on calendar time of infection. Furthermore, the position of the red vertical line in Supplementary Figure 1, denoting the introduction of the survey question on Long Covid on 3 February 2021, illustrates why time from infection to follow-up for Long Covid",
