As such, medication dispensing functions must be maintained, and available automation resources should be a focus of optimization. For institutions with ADCs, more rapid turnover of supply and higher incidences of stock-outs can be expected; thus, it is prudent to monitor drug utilization and make real-time adjustments, such as modifying par levels and adding delivery/restocking runs when resources allow. Similarly, the high clinical acuity of some patients with COVID-19 may result in more rapid turnover of emergency supplies, including crash carts, airway/intubation trays, and other institution-specific boxes and kits. Turnover and usage can be tracked manually or with automated kit tracking solutions, if available. The department of pharmacy may need to assess the number of carts and kits that are deployed to patient care areas in conjunction with providers and adjust quantities accordingly. Additional pharmacist, pharmacy intern, and pharmacy technician resources may be required to ensure adequate restocking of depleted emergency equipment items, followed by accurate verification. For institutions that involve multiple departments in restocking crash carts (eg, pharmacy, materials management, and central sterile departments), it may be worth initiating a conversation to agree on the most efficient workflow during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For institutions that are increasing bed capacity for critically ill and step-down patients with COVID-19, the need for compounded sterile preparations (CSPs) such as continuous-infusion and piggyback medications will likely grow. Inpatients with documented or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia may potentially be instructed to take nothing by mouth for a variety of clinical reasons, further increasing the demand for CSPs. Depending on the sterile compounding workflow and available resources and technology, increasing the batching frequency for nonpatient-specific doses of CSPs may be an option to minimize wastage and improve operational efficiency. 11, 12 Candidates to consider include commonly used critical care medications (eg, vasopressors, sedatives, neuromuscular blocking agents) and antiinfective drugs. Under normal conditions, operational pharmacy personnel are often present on patient care units and nursing stations to deliver, restock, and retrieve medications and medicationrelated equipment. In order to minimize potential exposures and movement throughout patient care areas, institutions with pneumatic tube delivery systems can capitalize on the system to decrease the number of physical deliveries by sending supply either directly to nursing stations or to the nearest inpatient satellite pharmacy, if applicable; acquisition of additional empty carriers may be considered, depending on the system's maximum capacity.",

For medications and medication trays returned from COVID-19 isolation areas, a separate secure location for quarantining of those items for an appropriate period of time before recirculation back into active inventory can be identified. Crash carts returned to the department of pharmacy should be cleaned with approved disinfectants. It may be prudent to agree upon an accepted disinfecting process with individuals who handle and transport crash carts (eg, nursing, security, transport team personnel) and to determine where carts should be located to minimize contamination of carts and their contents, including detailed discussion of cart storage in patient care areas and specific cart placement during an active resuscitation. Resourcewise, it may not be possible for every medical team or service to have dedicated clinical pharmacy coverage; this highlights the importance of collaboratively discussing which targeted services (eg, antimicrobial stewardship, medication profile review, review of high-risk medications, therapeutic drug monitoring) can be feasibly delivered. An additional approach could be to leverage \"pharmacy acuity\" (medication regimen complexity) scoring tools to prioritize patient care needs, if the institution's electronic medical record (EMR) and/or clinical decision support software possess those capabilities. 18 This process of multidisciplinary evaluation, discussion, and decision-making is of extreme importance to maintain and promote safe and cost-conscious medication usage. 20 Drug shortage management. As the demand for experimental COVID-19 treatments and medications necessary to support life-sustaining therapies skyrockets, drug supply chains will become strained. 21 This disruption may include suppliers, manufacturers, and wholesale distributors. Drug shortages add further layers of complexity to medication management during a public health crisis. 22 Critical drugs that have already been impacted include opioids, sedatives, vasopressors, neuromuscular blocking agents, respiratory agents and inhalers, and numerous antiinfectives; experimental COVID-19-targeted agents have also been impacted. On an institutional level, the department of pharmacy should collaborate with the pharmacy and therapeutics committee, providers, clinical content experts, and other stakeholders to disseminate timely drug shortage communications. For example, use of oral opioids and adjunct sedative-analgesic agents can be promoted to potentially minimize the need for intravenous rescue therapy. Intermittent bolus dosing of opioids, sedatives, and neuromuscular blocking agents can be considered in preference to continuous infusion drips as a conservation strategy, if clinically appropriate. Guidelines for critical drug shortage recommendations may include approved restrictions and/or alternative pharmacotherapy options, if applicable. 23 Inventory and supply chain managers should remain in constant contact with wholesale distributors to determine product availability, product allocation, and the status of incoming shipments. The department of pharmacy may also consider contacting manufacturers to obtain personalized availability reports and to directly place emergency purchase orders. Keeping a running vendor list with names of representatives and contact information for internal use may prove to be beneficial when additional drug shortages arise or in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Another approach is to collaborate with state and local healthcare organizations and advocacy groups to contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency's state coordinating officers to request immediate release of available quantities of critical medications from the Strategic National Stockpile to a state's department of health. While seeking additional procurement options, the supply chain team and/or other designated individuals should be tasked with keeping accurate inventory counts of critical medications on at least a daily basis. In doing so they should remain cognizant of any closed patient care or procedural areas, as well as any specialty services with a significantly reduced census, as those areas and services may have supplies of necessary drugs that can be centralized and subsequently redistributed to higher-need areas.",

Pharmacotherapy assessments, patient counseling and education, medication therapy management, and collaborative drug therapy management (if applicable) can be performed via telehealth. New treatments may have been initiated during an admission for COVID-19, and a postdischarge telehealth visit will allow pharmacists to also follow up to ensure appropriate duration of therapy and detection of adverse effects. Many telehealth platforms are already compliant with HIPAA requirements, and the HHS Office for Civil Rights has issued a notification of enforcement discretion regarding provision of telehealth services using noncompliant platforms during the public health emergency. 29 Pharmacists participating in the aforementioned telehealth services should determine proper billing and reimbursement procedures as necessary.",

One of the most prominent issues was the national shortage of PPE supplies, specifically those used by clinical pharmacists in critical care areas, operational pharmacists in sterile and hazardous product compounding, and pharmacy technicians performing ADC restocking and crash cart exchanges. By proactively projecting daily and weekly numbers for expected staff PPE usage, we were able to communicate frequently with our central sterile supply distribution team for allocation purposes. These estimates were based on in-person staffing schedules and shifts; the expected numbers of trips needed for medication restocking, crash cart exchanges, and emergency responses; and guidance from the institution regarding PPE conservation strategies. We also collaborated with clinicians to modify standard medication administration times for various drugs to minimize nursing staff virus exposure and to preserve PPE supplies.",

A major challenge was being able to field and triage these patient-specific requests in a timely manner. Thus, we created guidelines for use of common critical care medications, including guidance on dose titration of continuous-infusion medications (ie, vasopressors, sedatives, opioids, neuromuscular blocking agents) and anticoagulation therapy in critically ill patients in the setting of COVID-19. Intensive care areas were impacted the most by critical drug shortages.",

The scenario was complicated by the absence of numerous staff on sick leave for mandatory self-quarantines due to SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Several mitigation strategies were immediately enacted. First, with the closing of various outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, and infusion suites, staff were redeployed to the inpatient pharmacy or reassigned to clinical COVID-19 teams. Second, operational pharmacists agreed to step into pharmacy technician roles as needed during technician staffing shortages. Third, clinical pharmacists assumed a significant portion of order verification responsibilities through reassignment to decentralized services or remote work, allowing operational staff more time to attend to labor-intensive tasks. Finally, we coordinated with our human resources colleagues and the credentialing office to fast-track and onboard volunteers, who proved to be of great assistance during the peak of the pandemic.",

Comprehensive pharmacy and medication management services are still needed to promote safe and costeffective drug utilization during the public health crisis. Areas of focus include provision of operational services, clinical services, drug shortage strategies, informatics support, and team management. Opportunities for expansion of services during the pandemic include pharmacistinitiated point-of-care testing and telehealth services. Although it may be difficult to predict the exact time and extent of a COVID-19 surge in different areas of the United States, departments of pharmacy may implement preparedness plans and best practices in conjunction with providers, hospital leaderships, and other departments to serve the needs of their patients and healthcare colleagues.",

            "text": "Clinical pharmacy services. Clinical pharmacists promote safe and effective medication management in patients with COVID-19, who often have comorbidities in addition to their presenting illness. The pharmacy leadership should collaboratively assess patient care needs with providers and the hospital leadership to develop a plan for continued delivery, allocation, and/or modification of clinical services. 14 For example, select specialty services (eg, ambulatory care, hematology/oncology, solid organ transplantation services) may temporarily decrease their census or not be accepting new patients. If eligible, clinical pharmacists specializing in those areas may be reassigned to inpatient teams caring for patients with COVID-19 but should still maintain involvement and open communication with providers from their specialty-specific service lines. Expansion of critical care and emergency medicine treatment areas may warrant additional clinical pharmacy services to assist in managing increased patient volume and/or acuity to positively impact clinical outcomes. 15,16 Clinical pharmacists in other specialties who may have prior critical care or emergency medicine training or experience can be called upon to provide extra coverage and support. Pharmacy extenders can play an important role in ensuring continuity of pharmacy services. Pharmacy residents who do not yet have a pharmacist license can function as licensed pharmacists and assume clinical and operational responsibilities in tandem with their preceptors, allowing more widespread coverage and pharmacotherapy oversight for a greater number of patients. Residency program leaders can consider switching residents out of or postponing non-direct patient care learning experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Program directors and credentialed preceptors should still remain cognizant of requirements and competency areas, goals, and objectives to ensure pharmacy residents remain on track for timely residency completion. Another important area of consideration for a residency program leadership is the potential impact of disaster management on resident stress levels, burnout risk, and other professional and personal obligations. 17 Tactics such as improved planning, scheduling, communication, and utilization of resources should be discussed. If the experiential site and affiliated college of pharmacy have allowed for ongoing student experiences, pharmacy students can be incorporated into the department of pharmacy and provide supplementary services. With proper oversight from preceptors, pharmacy students may assist in executing clinical activities such as obtaining best possible medication histories, managing drug information inquiries, conducting follow-up telephone calls with discharged patients, and delivering educational presentations regarding treatment options and supportive care for COVID-19.",

            "text": ",19 Depending on the institution's pharmacy practice model, clinical pharmacists and pharmacy residents can participate in decentralized order verification to provide comprehensive pharmaceutical care and to facilitate operations of the department of pharmacy. In regards to emergency response, there is expected to be an increased number of cardiac arrests, respiratory arrests, code stroke alerts, and other rapid response calls during a COVID-19 case surge. Regardless of whether the institution already deploys pharmacists to participate in these events, it is worthwhile to discuss or revisit expectations with resuscitation committees and teams. Points of discussion may include feasibility and consistency of pharmacist emergency response coverage, staffing requirements, concomitant operational and clinical patient care responsibilities, staff protection and exposure, and preservation of PPE. Clinical pharmacists should be participating in guideline development in partnership with providers and content experts for management of COVID-19 and associated manifestations, as well as development of guidelines for use of therapeutic alternatives and usage restrictions during critical drug shortages. A major challenge is being able to manage the amount of knowledge and literature released regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and pharmacotherapies, including novel treatment approaches and repurposing of older medications. Since the beginning of the pandemic, emerging clinical manifestations and additional disease complications have been discovered in pediatric and adult patients, which will affect treatment options. Moreover, in the highest-acuity patients various other factors, such as multiorgan dysfunction, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, use of extracorporeal therapies, and underlying comorbidities need to be considered, further impacting treatment criteria and complicating drug selection. A proactive approach involves staying abreast of newly released literature, assessing evidence with a hospital-designated multidisciplinary team or workgroup, forming new or modifying existing treatment recommendations, developing consultation and/or approval processes for specific pharmacologic agents, and disseminating timely information and education to healthcare staff.",

The departmental leadership can track dashboard metrics and documentation to ensure that productivity and the quality of comprehensive pharmacy services are not negatively impacted by remote work.During crises, staffing shortages may be expected, and the department of pharmacy may have to operate with reduced personnel levels. The pharmacy leadership and staff should secure a mutual agreement and understanding that any member may be pulled from routine responsibilities to fulfill necessary operating requirements. Promoting flexibility and adaptability of staff members is vital during the COVID-19 pandemic; this may involve a decentralized pharmacist performing centralized pharmacist duties (or vice versa), a pharmacy administrator stepping in to perform direct patient care duties, a pharmacist substituting for a pharmacy technician, etc. These discussions may include policies and procedures as they relate to essential staff, overtime, and paid time off during the public health emergency. Major changes in staffing plans and departmental functions that indirectly or directly affect patient care should be immediately communicated to providers on affected services. The department of pharmacy may work with human resources personnel to seek volunteers from various national and local networks, such as the Medical Reserve Corps or state pharmacy organizations. Selected volunteers should undergo required credentialing processes, training, and other compliance measures, as outlined by institutional policies. Normal onboarding procedures may not be feasible, but condensed orientations conducted with targeted checklists can be considered on the basis of departmental and hospital leadership assessments. Expansion of pharmacy services. Health-system pharmacists can be positioned to provide additional services to improve patient care as part of the COVID-19 response. The federal Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health issued guidance from the US Department ofHealth and Human Services (HHS) to authorize pharmacists to order and administer point-ofcare testing for SARS-CoV-2 for the duration of the public health emergency.28 The department of pharmacy may collaborate with providers, nurses, and the hospital leadership to discuss deployment of available pharmacists to on-site, affiliated off-site, or drive-through testing stations to bolster community testing efforts. Pharmacists should be educated on proper testing and PPE procedures through institution-approved training sessions or documents.Before proceeding, sites should confirm state-specific laws or regulations surrounding point-ofcare testing by licensed pharmacists. Pharmacists, and pharmacy interns with proper oversight, can also assist with communication of SARS-CoV-2 culture results to patients.",
