Limited access to the dynamical states is generally expected to hinder the correct estimation of this observable. Here we show how memoryless jump processes can be coarse-grained exactly preserving its average and fluctuations at stationarity. This supports univocal applicability of fluctuation theorems for entropy and allows inference of the genuine thermodynamics together with inaccessible process details.",

When dealing with active matter, this production may be the only possible indicator of out of equilibrium conditions [7, 8] . Fluctuations of the rate of produced entropy are expected to obey symmetry properties which allow to estimate free energy differences or binding energies at molecular level [1, [9] [10] [11] . Theorems validating such properties have been proved for specific models [12] [13] [14] [15] , but do not hold if only part of the states of the mesoscopic system is experimentally accessible. Indeed, applicability of these theorems requires that all slow transitions between mesostates are detectable, and that transitions inside each mesostate are very fast [16, 17] . Under these conditions entropy production can be recovered from a description without memory in the framework of stochastic thermodynamics [18] .",

These are the times spent by trajectories starting from an even state i before reaching either state i + 2, or i \u2212 2. Distributions of such and related times are often recorded in experiments [19] [20] [21] . To perform this calculation we introduce a normalized jump rate w ji = W ji / k W ki .

The Fourier transform\u03c0 ji allows to express as a series of convolutions the characteristic function of the probability density p r (t) of jump times from an even state i to the state i + 2 without visiting i \u2212 2. To this purpose we consider the 3 \u00d7 3 matrix T k k (\u03c9) =\u03c0 k k (\u03c9), restricted to the states {i \u2212 1, i, i + 1}. In this way the characteristic function of p r (t) can be written as p r (\u03c9) = dt e i\u03c9t p r (t) =\u03c0 i+2,i+1 (\u03c9)(I + T(\u03c9)) \u22121 i+1,i . This expression sums the contributions of all trajectories performing that jump [33] . Analogously one obtainsp l (\u03c9). Even if the P i 's in Eqs. 6 are constructed by recording the presence of the system exclusively in the even states, one can count the whole times of jump as residence times in state i. With this assumption the sum p r (t) + p l (t) = p(t) becomes equivalent to a non Markovian (non-exponential) distribution of residence time in a generic even state. This distribution is reported in Fig. 2a . The process resulting from this interpretation of the jump times qualifies as semi-Markov with timedirection independence, since p r (t) \u221d p l (t) [34] [35] [36] . The entropy production rate of such models has been determined recently [35, 36] and is remarkably consistent with our results for the linear chain [33] . As we show below, in more general cases such consistency does not hold. However, the densities p r,l (t), regarded as empirical data, can be exploited to identify the underlying Markov dynamics. Upon matching these densities with analytic results like those just derived, one can determine the rates of the undecimated model and infer the full entropy production with its fluctuations.",

Thanks to them, contrary to previous expectations [17, 28] , our decimation can keep track of the full entropy production. Decimation of the process trajectories, carried on along lines similar to those illustrated for the linear chain, allows to obtain non-exponential p r (t) and p l (t) for the jumps between neighboring X states [33] .

Also procedures setting lower bounds to the average entropy production rate [7] could not improve the estimate of this average, due to the timedirection independence of the process. However, even though coarse-graining gives access only to the densities p r (t) and p l (t), the calculations leading to these functions still allow to determine the full entropy production. This can be done by matching the empirical probability densities of jump times with those of the candidate model for the fine-grained process. Its Markovian dynamics can be precisely determined together with the full spectrum of entropy production. The marked difference between the residence time distributions reported in panel a and b of Fig. 2 , exemplifies a useful hint helping in an attempt to guess the underlying hidden Markov network.",

On the other hand, if the jump time probability densities are extracted from some empirical time series, one can recover the rates of the original Markov model by matching them with the results from a decimation of trajectories letting only X states survive.

While an extension of the type of exact results presented here to other mod-els is an open program, our findings suggest that future investigations in this field, both theoretical and experimental, should focus on the memory effects associated with coarse-graining, which revealed essential to guarantee entropy production invariance. These effects, when analyzed for coarse-grained trajectories, were also crucial for realizing the fine-graining transformations at the basis of our inference strategy. Indeed, after detecting non-Markovian probability densities for the times of jump in an experimentally studied process, one can try to match them with those of a guessed underlying Markov process. If successful, this enables to determine the correct full entropy production, while uncovering hidden states and mechanisms. An assumption at the basis of this strategy is that Markov jump dynamics is adequate to describe what underlies the coarse-grained level. Such dynamics should in principle result from coarse-graining of a more microscopic description, and the choice of rates may reveal crucial for the very possibility of describing certain phenomena [38] .",
