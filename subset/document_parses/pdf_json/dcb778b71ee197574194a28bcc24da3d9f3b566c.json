This virus was first isolated in December 2019 after many patients in Wuhan, China, were diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown etiology (1) (2) (3) . Following its global dispersion, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus as a pandemic due to its rapidly transmissible nature, increasing mortality rate, and limited treatment options. Currently, there is an ongoing outbreak as the number of COVID-19 cases exponentially increases with a reported low to moderate mortality rate internationally.

This notable proportion of cases presents a question on what neurological symptoms are manifested along with how the virus manages to present them. As of May 1st, 2020, remdesivir has been approved for some emergency treatment usage. However, no other clinically approved vaccine or specific antiviral treatments has provided conclusive relief to COVID-19 and its physiological manifestations.

Increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to occur in places with ongoing community spread, such as between healthcare workers, close contacts of persons with COVID-19, and travelers from affected international locations. Of those infected, increased severity of illness can be seen more commonly in people aged 65 years and older, those living in a nursing home or long-term care facility, and in people with underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, chronic lung disease, moderate to severe asthma, cardiac disease, immunocompromised states (i.e., cancer, smoking, HIV or AIDS, steroids), BMI > 40, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and liver disease (11-16). Moreover, The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention similarly reported from one of their largest studies of 72,314 cases that high case-fatality rates came from those with similar comorbidities: cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%), hypertension (6%), and cancer (5.6%) (17) . In addition, those with cerebrovascular disease alongside coronary artery disease had a higher relative risk of acquiring the pathogen more severely than those without this comorbidity (18) . Finally, and most applicable to the area of interest, those with chronic neurological pathologies present an added risk of developing a more severe case of COVID-19 (19) . Neurological or neurodevelopment conditions (such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, stroke, intellectual disabilities, spinal cord injury, or muscular dystrophy), present additional risk factors that increase susceptibility to a severe course of COVID-19 through mechanisms that add physiological stress (19) .

It is widely understood that the mode of transmission of COVID-19 is through direct contact or respiratory droplets from an infected individual. However, indirect contact through fomites can also act as a vehicle of transmission. Fomites are inanimate surfaces that contain the virus (through direct contact), and based on the viability of the virus on to an inanimate surface, it can lead to the rampant spread onto another host. As soon as the virus enters the body, its effects are highly dependent on its viral structure. The viral structure of COVID-19 is contained within the nucleocapsid which is surrounded by a nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope is derived from the host cell's membrane and embedded within that membrane are glycoprotein spikes, known as S-proteins (20) . It is these S-protein spikes that allow the cell to attach to a new cell and infect it (20) . To carry through its function, Sproteins contain an S1/S2 activation cleavage site that is activated by the serine endoprotease, furin (21) . Furin is a key protein that can cause normal and abnormal physiological conditions. It is important neurologically because it is responsible for activating neural growth factors that are key to homeostasis (22) . However, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, furin plays the role of a viral activator. This activation occurs through furin's enzymatic activity, which allows for the irreversible cleavage of precursor proteins to enter their biologically active state (21) . With regards to SARS-CoV-2, furin autocleavage helps the S-protein's subunits to separate, and allow for the virus to break open and enter host cells (21) . This is done after the S-proteins have interacted with the cell surface receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2 (21) . The ACE2 receptor is present along multiple cell organs such as the heart, kidney, lunges, while also being found in both the central and peripheral nervous system. This makes it a valuable target in understanding the neural-potential of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1005, "end": 1009, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1103, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1245, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1454, "end": 1458, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1709, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1862, "end": 1866, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1992, "end": 1996, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NEUROLOGICAL IMPACT Central Nervous System"}, {"text": "The pathophysiology of neural infections in the CNS from COVID-19 is a phenomenon that is still being characterized. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 may reach ACE2 receptors on neuronal tissue through mode of the general circulation. Viremia causes the virus to pass into the cerebral circulation and reach the brain to induce neurotropic effects. The virus may also reach the brain through routes of the nasal cavity, specifically as the virus passes through the cribriform plate. Upon entry into the neural cavity, the virus will encounter ACE2 receptors located on the endothelial lining between the blood capillaries and the brain (23) . The virus may also encounter the expression of ACE2 receptors over glial cells and neurons, allowing for multiple sites of invasion. The interaction of the glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor can cause subsequent cycles of viral budding, allowing for neuronal damage to manifest in neural tissues and the blood-brainbarrier (BBB) (23) . The breaking of the BBB may allow for cerebral edema, subsequently compressing the brainstem and compromising involuntary respiratory activity (24) . This cerebral edema may also be caused by apoptosis of brain cells following elevated intracranial pressure and therefore remains a theoretical concern of the virus. Evidently, patients exhibiting acute SARS-CoV illnesses have presented the virus in cerebrospinal fluid analyses (23) . The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a bodily fluid that surrounds the brain and serves an array of functions ranging from acting as a shock absorber from neurological trauma to circulating nutrients around the CNS. Its role in homeostasis and neurological metabolism has made it a great reporter of the neurological environment; therefore, it can be clinically used to detect infectious agents and diseases (25) . Furthermore, viral implications on the immune system could induce indirect effects on the CNS. The breakage in the blood-brain barrier could leave an immune response of cytokines (particularly IL-6) becoming overly abundant along infected tissue of the brain (26) . This leads to a hypercoagulable state in what is known as a \"cytokine storm.\" Depending on the severity of the case, this could leave COVID-19 patients at risk of developing acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) and hemorrhages (27) . Most recently, a third theory discusses how neural injury is manifested from COVID-19 as a result of a cascade effect following respiratory stress. A loss of oxygen due to lung damage can subsequently result in multisystem organ failure leading to a cascade effect that results in neural injury (28) . Ultimately, what these three theories provide are multiple mechanisms through which neural manifestations of COVID-19 can result. These theories also highlight the limitations in addressing neurological manifestations in COVID-19, as research remains ongoing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 647, "end": 651, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 997, "end": 1001, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1151, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1437, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1848, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2110, "end": 2114, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2346, "end": 2350, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2648, "end": 2652, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NEUROLOGICAL IMPACT Central Nervous System"}, {"text": "A recent case of a female patient in Detroit, Michigan showed the possible long-term impact of neurological manifestations of COVID-19 (27) while also presenting some histological significance.

CT scans of her brain revealed symmetrical tissue damage of the thalamus while her MRI also showed damage to the thalamus along with the cerebral cortex and the brain tissue beneath its gyri (folds within the cerebral cortex) (27) . Histological significance is evident in her CT image as hypodense areas are present, indicating tissue damage had occurred.

In addition, other severe cases aside from ANE and hemorrhage are prevalent, as the first case of meningitis has been associated with COVID-19 (29) . A male patient was found to have this condition after his MRI showed hypersensitivity along the right lateral ventricle, as well as hyperintesnse signal changes in the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus (29) . He was confirmed to have COVID-19 after SARS-CoV-2 was found in his CSF, however, there was no evidence of cerebral edema like the previous case mentioned (29) . Thus, the variability in histological evidence could link theories of pathophysiology regarding COVID-19's impact on the CNS. While the more severe symptomatic manifestations of the CNS may include ANE, meningitis, and hemorrhage, the more commonly reported CNS symptoms are vertigo, cephalgia, impaired consciousness, seizures, ataxia, and acute cerebrovascular disease (30) ( Table 1) . In a study published to JAMA Neurology, patients with CNS manifestations most commonly exhibited headache and dizziness (30) as the major symptoms. These manifestations have been reviewed and confirmed by trained neurologists, with most neurological symptoms occurring during the early stages of the illness (30) . Laboratory findings of these patients reported lower lymphocyte and platelet counts and higher blood urea nitrogen levels. However, in more mild cases, no significance was found between patients with or without CNS manifestations of COVID-19 (4). Therefore, it was concluded that patients with severe cases were more susceptible to neurological symptoms. Moreover, the more severe cases had higher fibrin degradation product levels (D-dimer), linking these cases to a higher likelihood of cerebrovascular disease (4). Furthermore, recent findings have reported that a portion of patients are developing symptoms of stroke. Specifically, reports coming out of New York health systems have reported that large vessel strokes can be manifested, even in individuals under the age of 50 (31) . A large vessel stroke is an interruption of blood flow in one of the larger arteries in the brain. The suspected cause of these strokes are investigated as an immunohematological issue in allowing for blood clotting throughout a patient's body (31) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 267, "end": 271, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 485, "end": 489, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 647, "end": 651, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1355, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2140, "end": 2144, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2391, "end": 2395, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1032, "end": 1040, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "NEUROLOGICAL IMPACT Central Nervous System"}, {"text": "Treatment of COVID-19 and its CNS manifestations are still ongoing. However, if the coronavirus is breaching the bloodbrain barrier, this could complicate the recovery process (32) . The role of the BBB is to serve as the gatekeeper in cerebral passage, therefore medication delivery to the BBB would be difficult because medications are considered as antigens to it, thereby preventing their therapeutic effects (32) . Since differences in genetic makeup can increase susceptibility to viral invasion of the BBB, technologies such as CRISPER/CAS9 presents a possible way to target these adverse genetic differences. By targeting specific sequences to engineer candidate risk genes in the BBB, one can assess if BBB permeability is strengthened (33) . With regards to the symptomatic prevalence of the disease, hydroxychloroquine has been notably investigated as a possible therapeutic avenue. However, in certain patients, this antimalarial drug may induce adverse neuropsychiatric effects, such as worsening of CNS symptoms like headaches, vertigo, and increased anxiety (30) . This makes hydroxychloroquine a less viable treatment for symptoms pertaining to the CNS, and alternative therapies should be considered for patients suffering from these symptoms or from chronic mental instability (22) . Furthermore, the NHS recommends paracetamol for CNS-like symptoms such as fevers and headaches due to its reported symptom relief and low likelihood of complications. However, ibuprofen and other NSAIDs are still being evaluated after being ruled out as a therapeutic option (34) . They were initially ruled out due to reports that anti-inflammatory drugs may exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms, due to possibly causing a dampened immune response to viral attack (35) . These reports have since been rejected by the World Health Organization due to a lack of evidence suggesting that anti-inflammatory treatments are a direct threat to a patient's immunity (34) . However, this does not present NSAIDs as a potential therapy, especially when symptoms become more complicated. With regards to blocking viral activity and ultimately CNS manifestations, furin inhibitors have also been investigated as a possible treatment by preventing the activation of the S-proteins on the viral surface (30) . However, with furin's important role in normal physiology, researchers are evaluating whether a molecule could be secreted to separate its activity from the virus.

Ciliated cells aid in mucus transport and stopping foreign bacteria from reaching the lunges (39) . These two cell types are related in the sense that they both contain high concentrations of the ACE2 receptor that allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells (38) . In addition, they contain high concentrations of another protease called TMPRSS2 (38) . TMPRSS2 is a cell surface protease that can have cumulative effects with furin to promote SARS-CoV-2 activation and entry (40) . To understand what types of cells are infected following initial viral entry, it is important to understand that the sense of smell and taste are closely associated with one another. Both rely on the same type of sensory cells, called chemoreceptors, which are activated when they meet certain types of chemical stimuli. SARS-CoV-2 could disrupt these chemoreceptors by reaching the olfactory mucosa (which contains epithelium cells, blood vessels, and axons from olfactory neurons) and initiate an inflammatory response (24) . This area is joined with the olfactory bulb by the cribriform plate, which allows for the transmission of olfaction senses at the base of the frontal lobe (41) . Here, neurons can be infected while endangering deeper cerebral tissue (24) . This highlights the linkage between the CNS and PNS during the viral invasion through the nasal cavity (Figure 2) . Moreover, should defects in respiration be considerable, then PNS chemoreceptic dysfunction may be presented due to the proximity of sensory neurons in the olfactory bulb to deeper brain tissue (42) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 202, "text": "(37)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 380, "end": 384, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 586, "end": 590, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 857, "end": 861, "text": "(39)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1021, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1109, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1238, "text": "(40)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1766, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1924, "end": 1928, "text": "(41)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2006, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2319, "end": 2323, "text": "(42)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2112, "end": 2122, "text": "(Figure 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Peripheral Nervous System Involvement"}, {"text": "Histological significance pertaining to the PNS involvement was found following analysis of infected olfactory tissue.

This is a byproduct of the virus interacting with the chemoreceptors in the mucosal membrane and compromising neural sensations. Further histological evidence on peripheral tissue and other mucosal membranes have not been actively reported, thus highlighting limitations to understanding peripheral involvement following viral activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 416, "end": 420, "text": "(43)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Peripheral Nervous System Involvement"}, {"text": "According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, otolaryngologists in the U.K have reported that more than two-thirds of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Germany had anosmia (loss of smell) (44) . While in South Korea, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their primary symptom in otherwise mild cases (44) . Similar reports have been found globally, as anosmia and ageusia are highly reported as primary symptoms of COVID-19. In another study, patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 were recruited from 12 European hospitals to investigate olfactory and gaustory dysfunctions (45) . Out of the 417 patients studied, between 85.6 and 88% of patients reported these dysfunctions, with significantly more cases in females (45) . 44% of the participants also reported their symptoms early in their pathology (45) . Physicians state that it's not surprising that the olfactory system might be heavily influenced, given that loss of smell and changes in taste are a rather common complaint of people who get influenza as well (46) . Other symptoms may include hyposmia, neuralgia, and skeletal muscular symptoms, however, these symptoms are not considered primary peripheral manifestations due to a lack of supporting evidence. Additionally, a single case suggests a possible association between Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) and SARS-CoV-2 infection (47, 48) . A female patient who returned from Wuhan, China, underwent neurologic examination and was diagnosed with GBS while also testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (48). This was followed with five more cases also displaying COVID-19 with GBS complications (49) . GBS is a rare autoimmune disorder that attacks nerves in the PNS and can lead to paresthesia, areflexia, ataxia, and muscle and facial weakness, or paralysis (49) . Despite being a unique condition, viral infections can be triggers of GBS, especially when these infections reach a severe state. Primary symptoms of GBS, such as tingling, leg weakness, and facial weakness, were noticed in COVID-19 patients around 5-10 days after the initial common COVID symptoms (49) . After a few days, more adverse symptoms such as quadraparesis and paralysis were recognized (49) . Moreover, a variant of GBS, known as Miller Fisher Syndrome, has also been reported in two cases of COVID-19 from Madrid, Spain (50) . Miller-Fisher Syndrome is characterized by areflexia and paralysis of the eyes and may also be proceeded by a viral agent's neurological activity (51) . While still being a rare condition, the association between COVID-19, GBS, and Miller-Fisher Syndrome warrants further epidemiological data to support a causal relationship between them (47) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 215, "text": "(44)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 339, "end": 343, "text": "(44)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 617, "end": 621, "text": "(45)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 760, "end": 764, "text": "(45)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 845, "end": 849, "text": "(45)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1065, "text": "(46)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1390, "text": "(47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1391, "end": 1394, "text": "48)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1646, "text": "(49)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1811, "text": "(49)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2113, "end": 2117, "text": "(49)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2212, "end": 2216, "text": "(49)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2347, "end": 2351, "text": "(50)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2500, "end": 2504, "text": "(51)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2693, "end": 2697, "text": "(47)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Peripheral Nervous System Involvement"}, {"text": "As far as treatment, research is ongoing with clinical trials still being administered to determine the most viable form of care. Once the virus has started impacting neuronal activity, it becomes very difficult to treat, meaning the best mode of treatment is by preventing or reducing the viral entry. However, The Center of Disease Control recently stated: \"There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19\" (52) . This adds further limitations to addressing PNS neural manifestations of COVID-19. The British Rhinological Society has advised against the use of oral steroids in the treatment of anosmia in COVID-19 patients (53) . This precaution comes with the concern that corticosteroid use may increase severity of the pathogen. However, due to the concentrated presence of the coronavirus in the nasal tissues, a nasal spray has been suspected as the best mode in medication delivery (54) . Recent reports from Utah have started addressing the efficacy of chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM) combined into a nasal spray to study cultures with SARS-CoV-2 (54) . CPM is an antihistamine with previous studies suggesting that it acts well in the antiviral treatment against strains of influenza (54) . The initial trials have showed relative success with reduced amounts of the virus being reported in vivo following CPM administration (54) . However, this requires further testing in order to accurately and effectively treat COVID patients. With more severe patients who may have acquired GBS with COVID-19, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) have been known as the most common treatment for these patients (49) . IVIG treatment allows for the administration of healthy antibodies and has been suggested to be taken with antivirals to further combat the COVID like symptoms (49) . Plasmapheresis with antiviral treatment has also been suggested as another treatment option to enhance the autoimmune system while reducing viral activity (49) . With regards to the two cases with Miller-Fisher Syndrome, the first was treated with IVIG while the second with acetaminophen. After two weeks, it was seen that both patients made a complete neurological recovery, except for primary symptoms of anosmia and ageusia from their COVID-19 diagnosis (50) .
