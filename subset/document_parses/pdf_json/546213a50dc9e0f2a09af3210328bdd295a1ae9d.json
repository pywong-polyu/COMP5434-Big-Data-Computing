Preliminary evidence has shown that what we eat may influence different cognitive processes [2] . For example, obesity and poor diet can lead to negative health implications including cognitive and emotional dysfunctions [2] . Furthermore, dietary problems can disrupt cognitive functions long-term. Specifically, maternal gestational diabetes may cause changes in a baby's food reward processing [3] [4] [5] [6] . On the other hand, a diet rich in omega-3 seems to improve cognition [7] , and high consumption of fruits and vegetables has long-term benefits on cognitive function in adults [8, 9] . However, the majority of research so far on diet and cognition has focused on learning and memory [2] . Given the essential role of food in the determination of brain organization [10] , it is worth speculating whether the process of eating, as the ultimate multisensory activity [11, 12] , might also influence higher-order cognitive functions such as creativity.",

However, psychometric tests have been used to test creative thinking [34] . These tests measure either convergent thinking or divergent thinking [35] . In a standard convergent thinking task, problem-solving strategies are used to reach a single solution to the problem [36] . On the other hand, in standard divergent thinking tasks, there are multiple potential solutions to a problem requiring problemsolving fluency (number of responses), flexibility (range of responses per individual), and originality (novelty of responses) in idea generation [36] . Divergent thinking (DT) involves \"the retrieval of existing knowledge from memory and the combination of various aspects of existing knowledge into novel ideas\" [37] . Some authors suggest the importance of both strategies in creative thinking [34] , but divergent-thinking tasks remain the most commonly used for measuring creative thought [38] . For example, a recent review found that 51.1% of the neuroscience studies used divergent thinking (DT); 19 .1% of the studies used convergent thinking (CT); and 29.8% tested creative performances such as drawing, writing, or musical improvisation [21] . Furthermore, researchers have shown that divergent-thinking tasks can predict expert ratings of creative performance [39] and creative accomplishments in longitudinal research [40] .",

To address this gap in knowledge, the following section presents an overview of research detailing how creativity is influenced by sensory cues both individually and, where applicable, in combination. Building on this overview, we develop future perspectives on how the (multi)sensory aspects involved in what we eat, where we eat, and how we eat could positively enhance creative thinking.",

For instance, a relationship between illuminance and creativity has been reported by Wang et al. [47] , who in a series of four studies examined the impact of ambient lighting on creativity. Illuminance was measured in lux (lx), which is the luminous flux of one lumen per square meter. The authors placed participants in either a dim (150 lx) or bright (1500 lx) room and used an aggregate of tasks to test both convergent (remote associates test) and divergent (originality and appropriateness of problem-solving ideas) thinking. They observed that people in the dimmer condition created more novel (but less appropriate) ideas than people in the brighter condition, ascribing this effect to the reduced inhibition resulting from being in a darker room [47] . In a similar vein, Steidle and Werth [48] investigated the effects of brightness and darkness on the creative problem-solving capabilities of their participants and found that dimmer lighting improved creative performance. Specifically, in one experiment, 114 participants were tasked with four creative insight problems and subsequently reported how free from constraints they felt. The lux/illumination level (150, 500, and 1500) varied across three sessions. The authors found that darkness increased freedom from constraints and elicited a feeling of freedom, self-determination, and reduced inhibition, which improved innovative thinking and creative performance [48] .",

In terms of color, evidence seems to suggest that color in the surrounding environment (e.g., in an office space) as well as color presented on computer screens influence task performance, mood, motivation, etc. [46, 70, 71] . In a series of studies by Mehta and Zhu [46] , participants' performance was evaluated on detail-oriented and creative tasks conducted on computers on which the background screen color was manipulated. The researchers found that warm colors (i.e., red) enhanced performance on detail-oriented tasks whereas cool colors (i.e., blue) enhanced performance on creative tasks [46] . The authors argued that this was due to the type of motivation activated by color. Specifically, red (vs. blue) is often associated with warning or danger and thus can activate avoidance motivation alongside attention to detail, accounting for the enhanced performance on the detail-oriented memory recall task. Conversely, blue is typically associated with openness, peace, and tranquillity and is more likely to activate approach behaviors, to encourage innovative, and to promote more risky strategies to problem-solving [46] .",

For instance, in a study by Meyers-Levy and Zhu [44] , ceiling height was found to affect freedom-related (vs. confinement-related) thinking. Specifically, when the room ceiling was perceived as higher, it prompted concepts of freedom versus confinement. Somewhat contradictorily, when looking at the degree of restriction in a physical space, Levav and Zhu [72] found that individuals in a relatively confined physical space (i.e., a narrow aisle) were more likely to make more varied snack choices than people in a wide aisle. While neither study tested creativity per se, they demonstrated that participants exhibited more relational rather than item-specific thinking, when the ceiling was perceived as high (vs. low) which could enhance creativity. In addition, spatial constraints seemed to evoke reactance against an incursion to peoples' personal space, prompting individuals to seek more variety and uniqueness in their choices [72] , which could also be indicative of more creative behavior. Researchers have shown that exposure to nature, or even to natural materials, increases creative thinking [43] . The reason was that restorative environments may foster creativity and that nature has a cognitive restorative capacity.",

Following this pilot study, 341 participants were subliminally exposed to images of either the Apple or IBM logos during a visual acuity task, after which they had to complete the unusual uses task. People exposed to the Apple logo generated a significantly higher number of unusual uses, and their uses were evaluated as more creative than those exposed to the IBM logo.

Likewise, Kasof [51] explored how background noise impacts creative thinking. He investigated the effect of loudness when background noise was predictable (vs. unpredictable), and intelligible (vs. unintelligible). The author found that loud noise negatively impacted creativity. However, an unpredictable noise had an even higher negative impact on creativity when compared to predictable noise. More recently, Mehta and colleagues [53] examined the extent to which different levels (low: 50 dB; moderate: 70 dB; and high: 85 dB) of everyday background noise (such as combined multi-talker noise in a cafeteria, roadside traffic, and distant construction noise) affected creativity performance on the Remote Associates Test.

The researchers observed that 7-min exposure to music resulted in changes in mood, arousal, and performance on cognitive tasks.

Participants sat in either a hard-surface or a cushioned stool, and they were tasked with solving a series of Chinese riddles requiring flexible/creative thinking skills as well as a series of analogical reasoning tests. The authors found that those participants who sat in the cushioned stool performed significantly better than those sitting in the hard-surface stool in the Chinese riddles test but not on the analogical reasoning tests. The authors suggested that the bodily stimulations related to material softness triggered metaphorical associations between softness and flexibility, which in turn enhanced flexible thinking. Similarly, Kim [56] found that squeezing a soft (vs. a hard) ball increased divergent thinking in 50 participants, as measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT). On the other hand, squeezing a hard (vs. a soft ball) increased convergent thinking in 32 participants, as measured by the Remote Associates Test (RAT).

Experimental studies have started to investigate the effect of alcohol on creative performance. For example, one study used a vodka cranberry drink to investigate the effects of moderate alcohol intoxication on a creative problem solving task (convergent thinking). The authors found that participants who drank alcohol (blood alcohol content equal to 0.075) showed an improvement in RAT accuracy and also solved the RAT items quicker than a sober control group [61] . Benedek and colleagues used beer with and without different percentages of alcohol (0, 0.03, and 0.06) to investigate how drinking alcohol influence different measures of creativity (convergent thinking and divergent thinking) [63, 75] . The authors found that lower alcohol content (BAC = 0.03) facilitated convergent thinking (RAT) performance but did not affect divergent thinking (AUT) when compared to beer without alcohol content [63] . In a later study, when increasing the number of participants, the author did not find any effects of drinking alcohol on creativity [75] .",

The authors found that participants listed a higher number of ideas when drinking a sweet beverage, but it was the sour taste that enhanced creative performance (i.e., participants generated more creative ideas).

In the area of creativity support tools, Goncalves and Campos [68] demonstrated that a creative writing support software with both audio (inspirational soundtrack) and visual (dynamic landscape) stimuli promoted greater self-reported creativity compared to using a baseline text processor without any audiovisual accompaniments. Interestingly, the authors found that a \"just enough\" approach providing audiovisual stimuli within the software itself was at least as good, if not better, at promoting creativity than a full-on virtual reality environment. However, it should be kept in mind that the authors did not study the auditory or visual stimuli in isolation. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude whether the audiovisual combination would have worked better than either sense by itself. That said, there is evidence suggesting that fewer might be better when it comes to stimulating creativity. In a study with elementary school children, Greenfield et al. [67] found that children who listened to a partial story in radio format were able to come up with more imaginative story completions compared to when they listened to the story in television format. The researchers hypothesized that radio, by lacking visual content, stimulated the children's visual imagery, whereas television inhibited it (see [77] for a review on how television reduces creative imagination).",

Given the broad spectrum of evidence regarding how different types of sense input support creativity, we now outline ways in which the multisensory rich environment of eating might promote flexible thinking. We break down the process of eating to focus on how intrinsic food properties, the extrinsic eating environment, and the mindset of the eater can all separately promote creativity.

In a related area, even sensory stimuli that prime concepts related to creativity, such as freedom [44] or flexibility [57] , has shown similar enhancement effects. Moreover, creativity appears to depend on one being in a relaxed and positive emotional state. Therefore, sensory stimuli that promote a positive mental state also enhance creativity, whether it is from relaxing colors [46] , happy music [54] , familiar foods [60] , or the combination of relaxing odors and music [69] .",

Certainly, environments high in visual complexity are considered to demonstrate higher creative potential [43] . Many foods, such as coffee, tea, and wine, are known to possess potentially high levels of complexity [83] . While complexity in the chemical senses can be defined in a variety of ways, one commonly accepted interpretation refers to the number of flavors perceived by the taster [84] . Therefore, one wonders whether the myriad of studies [60, 62, 65] showing improved cognitive performance from drinking tea can be explained by caffeine alone or whether the sensory aspects of consuming a complex beverage additionally boosts creative thinking. Further studies could investigate the perceived complexity as a variable. For instance, could more complex single-origin specialty coffee confer more creative benefits than the standard carafe of discount coffee so often found in workplaces?",

While at first glance, familiarity, with its common-place associations with routine and boredom, would seem to be detrimental to creativity, there is evidence that consuming a familiar branded iced tea improved performance on a convergent thinking task [60] . In this case, perhaps the more familiar beverage helped participants feel more relaxed in an otherwise stressful laboratory setting. On the other hand, it is easy to imagine that, in a real-world setting, workplace or school canteens may want to serve novel foods once in a while to avoid employees and students falling into a routine.

This would especially be the case if one believes in the power of ingestion to transfer metaphorical powers [91] .

These concepts might be related to where the food comes from (e.g., free-range eggs) to the properties of the food itself (e.g., flexible foods such as jello).

The nature of our surroundings plays an important role not only in how we feel but also on how we perform tasks [92] , be it for work or leisure or, as in this case, for eating. Research has shown that the eating environment can influence what the food tastes like and how much we like it [12] . In other words, extrinsic contextual factors play an important role in the eating experience. In the context of creativity, it is first worth considering how a well-designed dining environment might passively encourage creativity just from the incidental combination of sensory stimuli present in the environment. If so, eating in an environment that combines creativity-promoting attributes ( Table 1) should induce creativity. For instance, eating in a blue-colored dining room with soft seats and happy music should make one more creative compared to, say, a red-colored room with hard seats and loud noise. Work by McCoy and Evans [43] , who asked participants to evaluate the creative potential of visual spaces, revealed that environments with high creativity potential featured exposure to nature or natural elements, spatial complexity, visual detail, and opportunities for social interaction. In general, when designing a creative eating environment, one should aim to induce a positive, nurturing, and social mindset and/or to introduce design elements with a clear association to creativity or related elements (e.g., tall ceilings to convey freedom or dim lighting to reduce inhibition). One potential area of future research involves investigating how multisensory combinations of creativity boosting factors can be combined in the eating environment while avoiding giving diners sensory overload [69] .",

All the participants were sent a brew-yourself coldbrew kit and prepared the same coffee before activating the online survey. All the participants first answered a convergent thinking (RAT) and divergent thinking task (AUT) and, then, tasted and evaluated a coffee sample before answering another set of convergent and divergent thinking tasks. Half the participants evaluated the coffee based on the Specialty Coffee Association's cupping protocol (https://sca.coffee/research/protocolsbest-practices, accessed on 15 January 2021), while the other half evaluated the coffee with the cupping guide as well as rated how the coffee matched nine pairs of metaphors on a seven-point semantic differential scale (Figure 1 ). We hypothesized that the activation of all the senses in the novel metaphor condition would further boost creativity, compared to those who only rated the coffee according to the cupping guide. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in convergent thinking before and after tasting in the metaphor group (F(1, 113) = 10.43, p = 0.002), while no significant group-based differences were found in divergent thinking (F(1, 95) = 0.05, p = 0.827). In other words, the process of coming up with multisensory metaphors for the coffee one happened to drink improved convergent thinking. ",

As a passive approach, firms can change specific elements of physical spaces. For instance, firms can change the color schemes of offices, common areas, and meeting rooms to incorporate more blue tonalities. Moreover, the material of chairs across the workplace can be changed with softer textures. Sonic environments with happy music can be implemented in select places. A more active approach may leverage complex food and tastings in different scenarios, from food at canteens to dedicated tasting events. Strategies such as these would allow employees to actively engage with the multisensory elements of the food and the environment and to socialize with their colleagues.",

Since the mid-sixteenth-century, coffee shops have provided a social space for creative discourse and activities [101] . Nowadays, coffee shops continue to play a myriad of roles for businesses and communities, including creative organized activities as well as working and networking spaces [102] . The share of people working and studying remotely in these types of spaces has grown rapidly [103, 104] . Therefore, these businesses have a unique opportunity to leverage the influence of multisensory integration on creativity to increase visits, engagement, and profits. Coffee shops may develop special environments that stimulate multiple senses and make people mindful of these inputs and their interactions. For instance, coffee shops can manipulate environmental colors and lighting as well as the sonic background and the textures of the seats and tables. Besides the environment, coffee shops can offer complex beverages and can nudge consumers to be mindful of their flavor and textural complexity. Potential inspiration for the latter strategy can be drawn from many specialty coffee roasters that present their coffee with stories about the terroir and the farmers, tasting notes, and often metaphorical associations. Co-working spaces can adopt blended strategies for regular office spaces and coffee shops and can add complex foods and beverages to their list of amenities.",
