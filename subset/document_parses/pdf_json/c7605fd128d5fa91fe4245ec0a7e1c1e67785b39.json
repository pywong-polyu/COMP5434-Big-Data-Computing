Since there are no convincing symptoms and no clear diagnostic criteria of PRIS, the diagnosis may be challenging. Details of the pathogenesis of PRIS are unknown, but enhanced lipolysis, impaired fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction have been suggested. PRIS presents with various organ disorders, including impairment of the cardiovascular, hepatic, and skeletal muscular systems, renal damage, and metabolic acidosis. In addition, the overall mortality of PRIS is reported to be 18% in these situations [6, 7] . In the literature, a multivariate analysis showed that, after adjusting for covariates, there are only a few independent predictors of death. The most important predictor seems to be the cumulative dose of propofol, being represented by both the mean infusion rate and the duration of infusion. On the other hand, cytotoxicity has been reported to occur at clinically relevant concentrations of propofol, and clinical studies have reported that PRIS may occur even at low doses and short durations of administration [8] . In the present case, the recommended dosage of propofol using a TCI pump was used during the surgery, and the total amount of propofol used during surgery was 1000 mg. A total of 2900 mg of propofol was used in the intensive care unit during the 5-day stay. The cumulative dose of propofol and the duration of infusion were rather high but still within the recommended usage range (0.3-3.0 mg/kg/h or less, usually for less than 7 days for sedation of adult patients [9, 10] ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 273, "end": 276, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 800, "end": 803, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 804, "end": 806, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1325, "end": 1328, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1798, "end": 1801, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1802, "end": 1805, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "PRIS in the present patient affected the cardiovascular system and induced cardiogenic shock.

Malignant hyperthermia causes hypercontraction of the skeletal muscle due to an inherited disorder of calcium metabolism triggered by volatile anesthetic agents, especially halothane, and depolarizing muscle relaxants, such as succinylcholine. Our case was not administered any volatile anesthetic agents and had no such familial history, and no hypercapnia and muscular rigidity, which commonly occur during malignant hyperthermia, were observed. Furthermore, the present event did not resemble the typical course of malignant hyperthermia, since it occurred in the intensive care unit after surgery; however, the occurrence of malignant hyperthermia due to propofol has also been reported and cannot be completely denied. Therefore, the administration of dantrolene sodium might have been considered as a diagnostic treatment. The possibility of malignant syndrome, by contrast, was negative, as she had no history of antipsychotics or psychotropic medication [11] [12] [13] .
