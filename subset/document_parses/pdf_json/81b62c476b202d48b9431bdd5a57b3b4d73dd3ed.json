On 14 March 2020, the government declared a state of emergency and the period of generalized confinement began. Whereas adults were allowed to leave their homes to carry out certain essential activities such as shopping, in the case of the population under 14 years of age the confinement was total. This situation lasted for six weeks until 25 April, when new legislation was passed to allow children to go out at certain times of day, albeit still under significant restrictions [2] .",

The lockdown occurred in a context of pre-existing socioeconomic and health inequalities, in which the inequalities generated by the epidemic exacerbate pre-existing socioeconomic and health inequalities, in what some authors have termed syndemic pandemic [13] . In this sense, the greatest impact of lockdown would have been felt among the most socially disadvantaged population, given that housing conditions affect many aspects of children's development [14] , and that substandard housing can negatively impact their physical, psychological and social well-being [15] . In this regard, the quality and characteristics of the home are key drivers of inequalities [16] , which in Spain presents a marked socioeconomic gradient [17] . According to the national Living Conditions Survey, children in poverty are four times more likely to experience extreme heat or cold in their homes, and are more likely to live in buildings with leaking roofs and pipes, with excessive noise and without adequate light [18] . Thus, confinement for those who live in poor quality homes implies greater exposure to dampness and mold, which in turn increase rates of respiratory diseases and allergies [15] , as well as noise, scarce natural light and overcrowding, which are all associated with greater risks of depression, anxiety and isolation [15, 19] . Living in limited space or in overcrowded conditions has a direct impact on children's physical and mental health [15] , and may also have an indirect impact on other aspects of their lives as well, for example, their performance at school [20] .",

There are also differences according to sex, since the prevalence of physical exercise is higher in boys than in girls, and varies more depending on socioeconomic level among girls; screen time is higher in boys, and is also more dependent on socioeconomic level in boys than in girls [26] . In fact, some studies have already shown the unequal impact of measures such as confinement on physical activity and screen time in the child and adolescent population [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, few studies have addressed inequalities in the living conditions of the child population during lockdown and their impact on social inequalities in health, and those that are available have tended to focus on specific determinants or populations.",

Slightly more than 40% of the sample were aged between 3 and 5 years, around 31% between 6 and 8 around 27-28% between 9 and 12. In all, 3.1% of boys and 2.2% of girls lived in households with severe financial difficulties, slightly more than one in four in households with some financial difficulties, more than 60% in relatively affluent families and 8-9% in wealthy families. More than 51% of parents had completed secondary school, around 44.5% were university graduates and between 3.7% and 4.5% had only completed primary school. Regarding the housing conditions in which the children lived during lockdown, 26% had no access to outdoor spaces such as balconies, terraces, patios or gardens, around 12% lived in damp conditions, and around 9% had scarce natural light. More than 4% lived in excessively noisy environments and more than 30% were exposed to tobacco smoke. As regards health-related behaviors, 18.4% of the girls and 21.8% of the boys rarely or never took physical activity, 17.6% of the girls and 20.1% of the boys had insufficient fruit intake, a figure that rose above 41% in both sexes in the case of vegetables, and 31.4% of boys and 29% of girls presented excessive consumption of processed or ultra-processed foods. Around 25% of the children spent more than six hours a day in front of screens, and 44.5% of boys and 38.7% of girls had infrequent contact with relatives not living in their household and/or friends. Table 2 shows the prevalence of health determinants according to the household's financial situation and parents' level of education. Notable inequalities according to parents' level of education emerged in all the variables analyzed in both boys and girls, with the exception of the consumption of processed or ultra-processed foods and the lack of outdoor space. The social gradient is clear; inequalities were recorded along the entire social scale, not only between the extremes. The prevalence of determinants such as lack of natural light, presence of dampness, exposure to tobacco smoke in the home, lack of physical activity or insufficient consumption of fruit was more than twice as high in disadvantaged families than in their socioeconomically favored peers. For instance, 48.2% of boys who live in homes undergoing financial hardship were exposed to tobacco smoke, compared to 21.8% of those from families without financial difficulties, and 41.7% of girls whose parents had primary studies were exposed to tobacco smoke compared with 22.3% of those born to university graduates. Screen exposure also presented major differences of almost 19 percentage points for boys and 15 points for girls depending on parents' financial situation, and of almost 17 points for boys and 24 points for girls in relation to parents' level of education. Table 3 shows the prevalence ratios of the determinants of children's health according to their parents' financial situation. With regard to housing conditions, households with greater financial difficulties were more likely to live in homes with poor structural characteristics, two or even three times more likely to suffer excessive noise or damp, 50% more likely to have no access to outdoor spaces, and 94% more likely to be exposed to tobacco smoke. As for health-related behaviors, in boys there was a clear social gradient to the detriment of households with fewer resources in terms of insufficient physical activity and fruit intake, and the probability of prolonged screen exposure was 44% higher in homes with severe financial hardship. These patterns of physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake were reproduced among girls. Lastly, boys and girls from households with difficulties or severe financial difficulties were around 40% more likely to have low levels of contact with family and friends than their financially better-off peers. Reference: Very easy to make ends meet. \"*\" p < 0.05. Turning now to parents' level of education (Table 4 ), a clear social gradient was observed in both boys and girls in practically all the variables studied. The most pronounced inequalities between educational extremes were observed in the presence of high levels of noise in the home, which was greater than four times more frequent in boys and three times more frequent in girls with less educated parents, and in the presence of damp, twice as likely in boys and 50% more likely in girls; this inequality was also observed between children of parents who completed secondary school and those whose parents were university graduates. Similarly, there was a greater risk of exposure to tobacco smoke in the home in less educated families. In the case of health-related behaviors, the children of less educated parents were between two and three times more likely to consume insufficient amounts of fruit and vegetables, and were more likely to spend more than six hours in front of screens and to have little contact with family and/or friends. No statistically significant differences were found in the availability of outdoor space and consumption of processed or ultra-processed foods between the most and the least educated families. ",

Although few of these studies have specifically analyzed whether this impact is affected by socioeconomic status, their results broadly coincide with ours. A study carried out in Navarre in Spain [30] demonstrated the impact of confinement in reducing physical activity in the population aged 8 to 16 years, and stressed that this reduction was greater if the child's mother was of foreign origin and had not studied at university. However, perhaps due to its small sample size, the Navarre study did not find significant differences in certain habits in which our study observed an impact of socioeconomic status, such as screen time and diet. Although without specifically addressing lockdown, another study carried out in Canada showed changes in physical activity, sedentary habits and sleep during the pandemic: the study found that, in lower-income households, a greater proportion of children and adolescents reduced their physical activity and increased their screen time and their use of social networks, while those from high-income households were more likely to increase their physical activity both inside and outside the home (e.g., walking or biking) [27] . Using data from the same study, Moore et al. [28] found that parents' low educational attainment was associated with a decrease in exercise outside the home and an increase in sedentary habits. Similarly, a study in Bosnia-Herzegovina indicated that adolescents with more educated parents were more likely to take physical exercise during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-April) than those whose parents had a lower level of studies [29] .",

Noisy environments and the scarcity of natural light have been associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression [15] , and the insufficient provision of space may affect children's physical and mental health [15, 19] .

The unequal impact of lockdown on health in distinct sectors of society is also due to the structural characteristics of our economic and political system and its macroeconomic, labor and welfare policies. This implies that families with lower educational attainment have more limited access to housing, poorer working conditions and lower income, which, together with other factors, have caused the unequal impact of confinement on the social determinants of children's health described in our study.",

However, the study sought to address the problem of the lower participation of the most vulnerable families by providing telephone support for this population in the data collection and by using a specific weighting system. Another possible source of bias is the use of key informants, i.e., the father, mother or legal guardian of the population under 13 years of age, rather than with the child him/herself, but the questions were designed accordingly. Among the study's strengths are the sample size (n = 10,765), larger than most studies of this type, and the timing of the field work and the circumstances in which it was carried out; in a complex research context, we were able to measure an entirely new phenomenon which has had a major impact on social and health inequalities in a highly vulnerable population.",

Taking account of issues of equity is essential in order to improve the design of prevention measures to face similar situations in the future without compromising other aspects of public health.",

            "text": "In this sense, the measures to control the pandemic must be accompanied by measures that allow and promote physical activity for children and the maintenance of spaces for sociability among peers, such as the conditioning of parks and public spaces aimed at this group. Likewise, the maintenance of face-to-face school activity should be prioritized, which favors healthy food intake, as well as physical exercise and social relationships, and reduces the time spent on screens. In addition, from a more structural approach, improving the housing conditions of families, especially with young children, is an essential public health measure, especially in times of restricted mobility outdoors. Our results, which show the need to incorporate equity in the adoption of universal policies so that they do not generate greater inequality, goes beyond the framework of COVID-19 management and shows the importance of this perspective in setting public health policies.",
