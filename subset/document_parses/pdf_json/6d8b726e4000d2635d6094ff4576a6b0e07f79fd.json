For HCWs this involves use of personal protective equipment (PPE) when treating suspected or confirmed cases, following international guidelines (3, 4) . PPE is a physical barrier preventing viral contamination, however it also reduces evaporative and radiative heat loss leading to potential uncompensable heat load, thermal strain and discomfort (5) . Acknowledging this, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have all produced guidelines to ensure workers' safety in thermal extremes (6) (7) (8) . However even if these guidelines are known about and adhered to, recent studies have questioned whether the measures are sufficient in tropical climates (9, 10) .",

For example in The Gambia, West Africa, average daily temperatures range from 29 to 34 \u2022 C with annual average levels of relative humidity at 68%, significantly higher than recommended temperature and humidity for indoor surgical operating theaters (25 \u2022 C and 60%) (11) . Additionally, in most healthcare facilities in resource-limited tropical settings, natural ventilation systems alone are often relied upon, with limited availability of air-conditioning (12) . Wall-mounted airconditioning units, where available, recirculate air without a HEPA filter and are advised against by the WHO (13) . Ceiling or standing fans are not recommended in any but single occupancy rooms. Therefore, there is a high environmental heat load that is difficult to mitigate. Concerns regarding shortages of PPE mean that healthcare workers often wear PPE for prolonged periods. The length of time in PPE increases the risk of dehydration, thermal strain, physical exhaustion and may compromise decision making (14) (15) (16) . During this current pandemic, many HCW are wearing PPE for 4 or more hours (17).",

ISE is more effective than water ingestion at absorbing heat and can therefore have a greater impact on reducing body temperature (28) . It also improves perception of effort, cognitive function and fatigue (29) . However, the effects of ISE are time-limited (30) . Ice-vests have been shown to improve endurance performance and thermal comfort via changes in skin temperature, although they do not lower core temperature as ISE does (18, 21) . Mixed methods of cooling, including pre and per (during)-cooling methods have been found to be the most effective (18) . Studies of ice-vests with PPE to date have placed the ice-vests under PPE (18, 21) , however after several hours the ice packs will melt and will then add to physical discomfort and energy cost. A simple effective cooling mechanism for HCW in PPE has not been established.",

This is particularly relevant to HCWs who are often caring for multiple patients, need to be able to prioritize tasks effectively and perform accurate calculations, all under stress. There is little literature on the impact of heat stress on HCWs' ability to perform routine tasks in tropical conditions (11) . Studies from temperature-controlled settings give conflicting evidence of the effect of PPE on HCW emergency tasks performance, where clinical tasks performed by specialists appear to be preserved from the impact of the physical effects of PPE (i.e., anesthetists vs. clinicians on intubation) (35, 36) . One study on surgeons' ability to perform laparoscopic operative tasks at 26 vs. 19 \u2022 C found a significant increase in both physical demand and distractibility at higher temperatures (37) . Another study evaluating different PPE suits at 22 and 28 \u2022 C did not show any impact on simulated HCW tasks (38) .",

Several recent studies have explored personal cooling options whilst wearing PPE and although our findings are similar to these, this study is novel in that it evaluated a mixed-method cooling approach (using both internal and external, and pre and per-cooling) and the effect of external cooling was prolonged by replacing ice-packs. The study by De Korte et al. explored 21 \u2022 C phase change vests under PPE and significantly improved thermal comfort and sensation, although it had no impact on thermal strain (49) . However, the transferability of this vest for cooling in the tropics is questionable due to differences in ambient conditions and potential resource limitation. Another study of PPE used for Ebola treatment, based in a heat-chamber, found a reduction in heat strain with several different types of cooling vest (40) . Although this study was performed in similar ambient conditions, the PPE requirements for Ebola are different to COVID and the exposure was only for 1 h and so not directly transferrable to current practice in treating COVID.",

This may in part be due to the characteristics of the PPE requirements for Ebola vs. COVID, since external conditions were similar, but may in part be due to heat acclimation. Our study's participants were West African nationals, who had been residing in the region for at least 6 months prior to the study and therefore had likely acclimated (a series of phenotypic changes resulting in physiological alterations that act to protect against heat stress) and the other studies participants were French and American nationals.

The sample size calculation was based on previous studies of heat alleviation in PPE, and so although we did not meet the target of sixteen, twelve was within our minimal sample required. At baseline, the tympanic temperature of the Cool group was 0.2C higher than the Control and although this is likely due to chance and was not a statistically significant difference, it may have impacted on the findings. Additionally, although the temperature and humidity remained relatively constant during the session, it did vary more than if the study had been run in a heat-chamber, but there was no significant difference between Cool and Control sessions. The advantage of the study being run on a hospital ward was that although the ambient conditions were not controlled, they were exactly what HCWs experience and so directly generalizable. The gold standard for core temperature is rectal or esophageal temperature. These were not practical whilst in PPE and cost constraints prevented the use of a telemetry pill. Core temperature may thus have under-recorded, however we monitored both the change in temperature as well as the absolute temperature to reduce the impact of this limitation on data interpretation. Additionally, most physiological studies use continuous heart rate monitoring, which was not available in this study. The cognitive battery test used was designed and validated in America and assumes a degree of computer or tablet literacy resulting in certain language and technological aptitude barriers. Finally, the study used simulation to model real-life ward experience, to ensure standardization, but in reality, clinical work can be highly variable, and this may not have been captured. Additionally, shift durations vary dramatically depending on staffing, clinical workload and availability of PPE and therefore the applicability of these solutions will be locally dependent. However, direct comparison of Control and Cool would have been very challenging in a real-world setting.",

There was no statistically significant difference in climate exposure between Cool and Control sessions (p = 0.42). Baseline Baseline physiology of participants at the start of each session were similar: heart rate (Control = 79.1; Cool = 80.8 bpm), t (11) = \u22120.2, p = 0.82 and urine osmolality (Control = 695; Cool = 628 mOsm/kg), t (11) = 0.6, p = 0.54 and Wilcox Signed-Rank test for tympanic temperature (Control = 36.8; Cool 37.0 \u2022 C), Z = 10.5, p = 0.17 and urine specific gravity (Control = 1.03; Cool = 1.03), Z = 16, p = 0.79.PhysiologyMean tympanic temperature change are presented inFigure 2.There was a significant increase in tympanic temperature in the Control group from baseline to 1 h in PPE (p = 0.01) and 2 h in PPE (p = 0.01), but no significant increase in Cool (p = 0.06, p = 0.21 at hour 1 & 2, respectively).
