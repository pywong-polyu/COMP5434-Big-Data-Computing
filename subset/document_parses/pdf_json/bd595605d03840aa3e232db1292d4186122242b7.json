Anxiety is dimensional and across a population is characterized by individual differences, and when extreme is disabling. Considerable research has identified heritable and non-heritable factors underlying the development of anxiety disorders (Eley et al., 2003; Fox et al., 2015a; Sawyers et al., 2019; Stein et al., 1999) , and in childhood these can manifest as the trait-like disposition, anxious temperament (AT). Like anxiety, AT is dimensional and is characterized by individual differences in inhibitory responses to novel and social situations (Biederman et al., 2001; Davidson and Rickman, 1999; Fox et al., 2008; Hirshfeld et al., 1992) as well as threat-related pituitary-adrenal activation (Fox et al., 2008; Kagan et al., 1987) . Because AT reflects a combination of behavioral and physiological responses associated with stress, this construct reflects the interplay between emotions, behavior and physiology that is emblematic of anxiety responses. When extreme and stable over time, childhood AT markedly increases the risk for the development of anxiety disorders, depression, and co-morbid substance use disorder later in life (Biederman et al., 2001; Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2009; Davidson and Rickman, 1999; Essex et al., 2010; Fox et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 371, "text": "(Eley et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 372, "end": 390, "text": "Fox et al., 2015a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 391, "end": 412, "text": "Sawyers et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 413, "end": 432, "text": "Stein et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 662, "end": 686, "text": "(Biederman et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 687, "end": 714, "text": "Davidson and Rickman, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 715, "end": 732, "text": "Fox et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 733, "end": 756, "text": "Hirshfeld et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 812, "end": 830, "text": "(Fox et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 831, "end": 850, "text": "Kagan et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1279, "text": "(Biederman et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1309, "text": "Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1337, "text": "Davidson and Rickman, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1357, "text": "Essex et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1375, "text": "Fox et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "To understand the mechanisms underlying AT, we developed a young rhesus monkey model that is based on individual differences in the expression of dispositional anxiety and is analogous to the anxious phenotype exhibited by at-risk children Kalin and Shelton, 2003) .

The entire Ce projects to the BST to further coordinate threat-related responding, where the CeL's projections are largely restricted to laterodorsal BST (BSTLd), (Ahrens et al., 2018; Asok et al., 2018; Oler et al., 2017; Pomrenze et al., 2019) . In addition to other areas of the basal forebrain, the CeL, CeM, and the BSTLd have been conceptualized as the central extended amygdala, in contrast to what is considered the medial extended amygdala which is comprised of the medial nucleus of the amygdala and the medial divisions of the BST (Alheid and Heimer, 1988) . While these subdivisions are conserved across rodent and primate species, studies elucidating the selective role of these subdivisions in mediating fear and anxiety have been predominately performed in rodents Tye et al., 2011) . In this study, we focus on the primate CeL because studies in rodents demonstrate that it integrates information from the basolateral amygdala complex and acts as an interface between the basolateral amygdala complex and the CeM and BSTLd (Dong et al., 2001; LeDoux et al., 1990; Petrovich and Swanson, 1997; Yu et al., 2017) .

For example, PRKCD expressing neurons have short range projections to the CeM and both PRKCD and SST expressing neurons project to the laterodorsal BST (BSTLd; which corresponds to the oval nucleus of the BST in mice; Figure 4D ; (Ahrens et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2014; Haubensak et al., 2010; Ye and Veinante, 2019) .
