The women were grouped into the following categories in accordance with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9): (a) CAD, (b) \"anxiety only,\" (c) \"depression only,\" and (d) \"no depression or anxiety.\" After estimating the prevalence of CAD, \"anxiety only,\" and \"depression only,\" we carried out chi-squared tests and multiple logistic regression analysis to examine the related factors between these groups of pregnant and postpartum Chinese women.",

Since then, it has spread worldwide and has become a global pandemic. Quarantining and social distancing precautions implemented by countries around the world, and the uncertainty associated with the virus have reduced the quality of life of pregnant and postpartum women, who have less physical activity and more sitting time (Bivi\u00e1-Roig et al., 2020) . The repercussions of this have also been associated with increased mental health problems (Lebel et al., 2020; Zanardo et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2021) . Pregnant and postpartum women have reported more depression or anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic (Berthelot et al., 2020; Lebel et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zanardo et al., 2020; Chmielewska et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2021) . However, it has also been reported that women who delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic had lower rates of depression than women who delivered before the COVID-19 pandemic (Pariente et al., 2020) . Jiang et al. (2021) found that between February 5, 2020, and February 28, 2020, 18.1% of pregnant women in China suffered from anxiety and 45.9% suffered from depression (Jiang et al., 2021) . Likewise, Bo et al. (2021) found that 27.43% of pregnant and postpartum women in China experienced depression between February 22, 2020, and March 10, 2020. In the United States, 43.3% of the pregnant women reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms at the end of April 2020 (Preis et al., 2020) , while in Italy, 44.2% of postpartum women experienced depression between March 8, 2020, and June 15, 2020 (Ostacoli et al., 2020) . A meta-analysis of 23 studies conducted with 20,569 pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic found that the prevalence rates of anxiety and depression among the pregnant women were 37% (95% CI: 25-49%) and 31% (95% CI: 20-42%), respectively and the prevalence rate of depression among the postpartum women was 22% (95% CI: 15-29%) (Yan et al., 2020) .",

Additionally, CAD is commonly correlated with lower socioeconomic status (SES) and lower levels of education in a community sample (Fichter et al., 2010) . Obstetric-related factors include adverse pregnancy outcomes and not having had a live birth in the past (Ali et al., 2012) . The sociodemographic risk factors associated with CAD during the postpartum period include low income, young maternal age, a lower level of education (Skipstein et al., 2010; Ramakrishna et al., 2019) , inadequate partner support, and inadequate social support (Falah-Hassani et al., 2016; Ramakrishna et al., 2019) . The obstetric factors associated with CAD during the postpartum period include delivering an infant at a gestation \u2264 27 weeks (Farr et al., 2014) . Additionally, \"maternal vulnerable personality\" and \"perceived stress\" predicted a higher risk of comorbidity (Farr et al., 2014; Falah-Hassani et al., 2016; Ramakrishna et al., 2019) .",

The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles were 7, 10, and 14, respectively. The mean value of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores for CAD was 14.55 (SD = 3.79, range = 10 -27), and the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles were 11, 14, and 17, respectively. The mean values of the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores of the \"anxietyonly\" group were 7.75 (SD = 1.44, range = 7-16) and 6.95 (SD = 1.96, range = 0-9), respectively. In the \"depression only\" group, the mean values were 3.79 (SD = 1.98, range = 0-6) and 12.61 (SD = 3.15, range = 10-27); in the \"no anxiety or depression\" group, the mean values were 1.43 (SD = 1.80, range = 0-6) and 3.41 (SD = 2.73, range = 0-9). Univariate ANOVAs showed significant differences between the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores of the groups (F GAD\u22127 [3, 2233] = 1314.82, p < 0.001, \u03b7 2 = 0.64; F PHQ\u22129 [3, 2233] = 1297.63, p < 0.001, \u03b7 2 = 0.64). The Bonferroni's post-hoc tests revealed significant differences in the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores among all groups. In general, the CAD group had the highest GAD-7 score, followed by the \"anxiety only, \" the \"depression only, \" and the \"no anxiety or depression\" groups. The CAD group had the highest PHQ-9 score, followed by the \"depression only, \" the \"anxiety only, \" and the \"no anxiety or depression\" groups. The prevalence of CAD, \"anxiety only, \" and \"depression only, \" was 6.3% (n = 142), 5.8% (n = 130), and 3.9% (n = 87), respectively. Chi-squared tests showed that the three groups had significant differences in prevalence (\u03c7 2 = 13.98, p < 0.05). Bonferroni's multiple comparison test revealed that the prevalence of CAD was higher than expected, and that of the \"depression only, \" group was lower than expected. The prevalence rates of CAD, \"anxiety only, \" and \"depression only, \" during the first, second, third trimesters of pregnancy and the postpartum period were 7.4, 6.5, 5.7, 8.2%; 3.4, 5.6, 6.6, 9.3%; and 7.0, 5.2, 2.2, 2.1%, respectively. Chi-squared tests showed significant rate differences in CAD, anxiety only, and depression only among the four time points (\u03c7 2 CAD = 46.00, p < 0.001; \u03c7 2 anxiety = 82.06, p < 0.001; \u03c7 2 depression = 24.77, p < 0.001). Bonferroni's multiple comparison test revealed that the prevalence of \"anxiety only\" in the first trimester of pregnancy was lower than expected and that in the third trimester was higher than expected. The prevalence of \"depression only, \" in the first trimester of pregnancy was higher than expected, and that in the third trimester was lower than expected. Table 2 summarizes the frequency differences of age, marital status, level of education, annual family income, household cohabitants, family support, total live births, and pregnancy or postpartum among the CAD, the \"anxiety only, \" the \"depression only, \" and the \"no anxiety or depression\" groups. Chi-squared tests showed that the four groups had significant frequency differences in age (p < 0.05), marital status (p < 0.001), level of education (p < 0.05), family support (p < 0.001), and total live births (p < 0.001).The Bonferroni's multiple comparison test revealed that the proportion of women under 25 years of age in the \"depression only\" group, the rates of single and no birth in the CAD and the \"depression only\" group, and the rates of poor family support in the CAD, the \"anxiety only, \" and the \"depression only\" groups were higher than those in the \"no anxiety or depression\" group. Bonferroni's multiple comparison test did not reveal significant frequency differences in the level of education among the four groups.",

The prevalence of CAD during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum period were 7.4, 6.5, 5.7, and 8.2%, respectively. Our results are similar to those reported in previous non-COVID-19 studies. For example, Thiagayson et al. (2013) found a 5% prevalence rate of CAD among high-risk pregnant Singaporean women. A meta-analysis by Falah-Hassani et al. (2017) found that the prevalence of comorbid anxiety symptoms and mild to severe depressive symptoms was 9.5% during pregnancy and 8.2% after delivery in normal situations. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may have no specific impact on perinatal CAD in China. One possible explanation may be that extended families are common in China. Pregnant and postpartum women are generally valued and cared for by their families. Another possible reason is that a significant number of people may work from home and have the opportunity to better support their partners. Quarantining during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a limited effect on pregnant and postpartum women. Furthermore, compared to the prevalence of anxiety and depression in pregnant and postpartum Chinese women during the COVID-19 pandemic in previous studies (e.g., Bo TABLE 2 | Sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics of participants in comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD), \"anxiety only,\" \"depression only,\" and \"no anxiety or depression\" groups.",

One reason for this difference may be the time difference in data collection. Two previous studies (Bo et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2021) were carried out from February 2020 to early March 2020, when the COVID-19 epidemic peaked in China. Our study was conducted between February 28, 2020, and April 26, 2020. In particular, 98.5% of the participants were surveyed after March 10, 2020. At that time, the situation in the Chinese Mainland had been stabilized and controlled and the daily figure of new cases had remained in single digit since mid-March. Another reason may be the different measurement tools and cutoff values used. For example, Bo et al. (2021) used the same scale (PHQ-9) to measure depression, as in our study; however, Bo et al. used a lower cutoff score. Meanwhile, the present study found that the prevalence of CAD remained unchanged during the perinatal period. The prevalence of \"anxiety only\" in the first trimester of pregnancy was lower, and that in the third trimester, it was higher. These findings differ from those of earlier studies. For example, a metaanalysis by Falah-Hassani et al. (2017) showed that the prevalence of comorbid anxiety symptoms and mild to severe depressive symptoms decreased between the first and third trimesters of pregnancy. Skouteris et al. (2009) found that anxiety was the lowest in late pregnancy compared to the middle pregnancy and postpartum. Our findings may be due to the COVID-19 pandemic since this is a period of high stress. Additional research is required to better understand CAD changes over time in pregnant and postpartum women. Meanwhile, the study found that the prevalence of \"depression only, \" in the first trimester of pregnancy was higher and that in the third trimester, it was lower, which was consistent with previous findings; that is, the depressive symptoms decreased between the first and third trimesters of pregnancy (Dipietro et al., 2008; Bunevicius et al., 2009; Figueiredo and Conde, 2011) .",

            "text": "Factors associated with CAD include marital status, family support, and total live births. We also found that these factors were associated with \"\"depression only\" and \"anxiety only\"\" groups which may reflect many similarities among them. Actually, many researchers believe that anxiety and depression are overlapping syndromes (Hranov, 2007) , and anxiety, depression, and comorbidity represent sequential stages of the same disorder (Liebowitz et al., 1990; Schoevers et al., 2005) . According to the results of the multiple logistic regression analysis, only family support and total live births were related to CAD among pregnant and postpartum Chinese women during Ramakrishna et al., 2019; Gonz\u00e1lez-Mesa et al., 2020) . Family support can serve as an interpersonal resource for pregnant and postpartum women, helping them cope with multiple additional physical and psychological stresses during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the buffering model, interpersonal resources can act as a buffer to reduce the harm of stressful events in individuals (Cohen and Wills, 1985) . Pregnant and postpartum women with sufficient family support had more resources available to respond to their own needs and help them navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. They received support and care from their husbands or mothers-in-law, which helped them meet their need for affiliation, develop a calm attitude, and remain positive. Therefore, pregnant and postpartum women with family support had lower odds of developing CAD and \"depression only.\" Conversely, women with less family support had higher odds of developing CAD and \"depression only.\" Moreover, consistent with Ali et al. (2012) , women without a history of live births were at an increased risk of CAD. The first pregnancy is a stressful period (Morse et al., 2000) because the mother has to adjust not only to her role transition, but also faces multiple stressors, including the need to ensure her health and safety and that of her fetus, and coping with the physical fatigue and the changing body shape. Primiparas may lack coping skills. Therefore, \"no birth\" was found to be a predictor of CAD among pregnant and postpartum Chinese women during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Meanwhile, the number of postpartum women was relatively small. Third, our study used a cross-sectional design and lacked a control group representing the general population or pregnant and postpartum women before the pandemic, which limited our ability to assess the specific or actual influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on CAD in pregnant and postpartum women. Fourth, we did not have control for the general medical conditions of women and fetuses/newborns. Fifth, the data were collected via self-report, which may have affected the validity of the study.
