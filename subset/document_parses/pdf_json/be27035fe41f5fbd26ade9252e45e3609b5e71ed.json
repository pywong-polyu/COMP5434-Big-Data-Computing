            "text": "The recently emerging coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Since its discovery in the city of Wahan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly to invade all countries. In addition to its rapid transmission rate, it is characterized by high genetic mutation rates. The aim of this study is to provide an effective method for the isolation and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines without any induction of genetic variations. In this study, we isolated SARS-CoV-2 from oro-nasopharyngeal swabs collected from Egyptian patients who were clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. Molecular identification of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). The isolated virus was propagated on Vero E6 cells without applying serial viral passages to avoid any variation of the viral genome. The replication and propagation were confirmed by the results of both RT-qPCR and the cytopathic effect (CPE). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was completely inactivated chemically using beta-propiolactone (\u03b2PL). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the propagated virus was performed in order to investigate mutational patterns. The genome sequences recovered in 2020 (n = 18) were similar to the reference strain, Wuhan-Hu-1, and were clustered as clade 20A. However, the genomic sequences recovered in 2021 (n = 2) were clustered as clade 21J. These two sequences are considered the first Delta (B.1.617.2) variants detected in Egypt. This study provides a reference for researchers in Egypt to isolate and propagate SARS-CoV-2 easily and efficiently. Furthermore, the prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in Egypt necessitates continuous monitoring of the efficacy of the applied treatment protocol and the effectiveness of current vaccines against such variants of concern (VOC).",

They cause variable clinical features in the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems of a variety of hosts, such as birds and mammals (Cui et al., 2019; Monchatre-Leroy et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2020) . Coronaviruses have a genome of 27-32 kb, which encodes nonstructural proteins involved in replication, structural proteins, and viral transcription, which include nucleocapsids, membranes, envelopes, and spike proteins. In addition, the genome contains speciesspecific accessory genes. Coronaviruses are divided into four genera: the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae which comprises two sub-families (Orthocoronavirinae and Letovirinae), 5 genera, 26 sub-genera, and 46 species (Cui et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Brian and Baric, 2005) . Of coronaviruses, seven members are known to cause human infection. Four of these seven coronaviruses, namely, NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43, cause mild symptoms. On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 may cause severe symptoms Corman et al., 2018; De Wit et al., 2016; Ta\u015e tan et al., 2020; Andersen et al., 2020) . The etiologic agent of COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2 which belongs to the betacoronaviruses and was first identified as the causative agent of the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, in 2019 that expanded worldwide to cause a pandemic Ta\u015e tan et al., 2020; Holshue et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020; Harcourt et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020) .",

Different RT-PCR protocols were designed to amplify variable SARS-CoV-2 genes, such as RdRp, E, N, S, and ORF1a/b genes (Cui and Zhou, 2020; Bai et al., 2020) . Of note, ORF1ab and N genes are commonly used for COVID-19 determination in China, while N1, N2 and N3 genes are targeted in US CDC (Bai et al., 2020; Sheikhzadeh et al., 2020) . For molecular identification of SARS-CoV-2 in the collected specimens, we used Viasure\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR Detection Kit which targets ORF1ab and N genes for amplification.

We observed CPE beginning from day 1 postinoculation, which became more prominent at 48 h post-inoculation. In agreement with our findings, a previous study reported that CPE was nearly complete in Vero E6 at 48 h post-infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Jureka et al., 2020) , while Case et al. reported that the CPE appears in Vero cells by day 3 post-inoculation (Case et al., 2020) . Furthermore, we used the same RT-qPCR kit employed to identify SARS-CoV-2 in the original swabs to identify the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 virus. We found that Ct values for ORF1ab and N genes in the propagated samples markedly decreased compared to the corresponding values in the original swabs before inoculation. Taken together, CPE and RT-qPCR findings confirm successful propagation of SARS-CoV-2. Of note, we did not conduct sequential propagation of virus in Vero E6, which has been demonstrated to cause rapid development of genetic variants (Funnell et al., 2021; Ogando et al., 2020) .",

Our findings regarding the whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 recovered in 2020 showed that all strains belong to the 20A clade and were mutated and carried D614G, V5F, Q57H and G823S mutations. In agreement with this finding, several studies conducted to track the distribution of viral clades in Egypt reported the higher prevalence of all clades with D614G mutation in 2020 (Hamed et al., 2021; Alotaibi et al., 2022; Zekri et al., 2021; Kandeil et al., 2020) . Two isolates were recovered from COVID-19 patients, in September 2021, (accession codes: EPI_ISL_4748272 and EPI_-ISL_4748283) were AY.119.2 and AY.44 Pango Lineage, respectively. Both of them were delta (B.1.617.2) variants. They were related to variant of concern (VOC) Delta GK/478 K.V1 (B.1.617.2) first discovered in India. The first official case of the delta variant was recorded in Egypt in July 2021 (Enterprise, 2021). The recovered Delta variants carried several amino acid mutations in spike protein including D614G, D950N, L452R, P681R, T19, T95I and T478K. The spike protein mutations (T478K, P681R and L452R) have a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and its neutralization by antibodies for earlier variants (Starr et al., 2021) .",

The established protocol of isolation, propagation, and inactivation was utilized in order to perform further molecular characterization studies such as whole genome sequencing (WGS) and morphological analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by transmission electron microscopy. The phylogenetic analysis of isolated SARS-CoV-2 in Egypt showed that the virus has exhibited a dramatic evolution since the first case registered in Egypt. The isolates recovered in 2020 were similar to the reference strain, Wuhan-Hu-1. The two recovered isolates in 2021 have been clustered into the 21J subclade. These variants are the first isolates with the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant ever recorded in Egypt. This study will help researchers with their ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research, evolutionary studies, and the development of antiviral drugs.",
