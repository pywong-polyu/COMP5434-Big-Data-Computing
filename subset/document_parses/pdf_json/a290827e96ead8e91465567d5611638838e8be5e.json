            "text": "Phylogenetic analysis is used to analyze the evolution of species according to the characteristics of biological sequences. The analytical results are generally represented by phylogenetic trees. NJ (neighbor joining) is a frequently used algorithm for constructing phylogenetic trees because of its few assumptions, fast operation, and high accuracy, and is based on the distance between taxa. It is known that NJ usually constructs different phylogenetic trees for the same dataset with differences in input order, which are known as \"tied trees.\" This article proposes an improved method of NJ, called ENJ (extended neighbor joining). The ENJ can join several (currently limited to three) nodes with the same minimum distance into a new node, rather than joining two nodes in one iteration, so it can construct triple phylogenetic trees. We have inferred the formulas for updating the distance values and calculating the branch lengths for the ENJ algorithm. We have tested the ENJ with simulated and real data. The experimental results show that, compared with other methods, the trees constructed by the ENJ have greater similarity to the initial trees, and the ENJ is much faster than the NJ algorithm. Moreover, we have constructed a phylogenetic tree for the novel coronavirus and related coronaviruses by ENJ, which shows that COVID-19 and SARS-CoV are closer than other coronaviruses. Because it differs from the existing phylogenetic trees for those coronaviruses, we constructed a phylogenetic network for them. The network shows those species have had a reticulate evolution.",

            "text": "The NJ (neighbor joining) algorithm is a widely used method for constructing phylogenetic trees, based on the distance between species. NJ is a greedy algorithm, which endeavors to minimize the sum of all the branch lengths of the resulting tree. 7, 8 Researchers have, for a long time, made improvements in the NJ algorithm, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] especially in the speed with which it constructs phylogenetic trees. For example, the RNJ (relaxed neighbor-joining) algorithm 15, 16 joins any pair of plausible neighbor nodes and is faster and more suitable for inferring large trees. The Rapid NJ algorithm 17 proposes a new search strategy for selecting the next pair of neighbor nodes, and experiments have shown that it accelerates the construction of a phylogenetic tree compared with the NJ algorithm. The ERapid NJ algorithm 18 improves on the performance of Rapid NJ with external memory and reduces the memory requirement for reconstructing the phylogenetic tree for large datasets. The INJ (improved neighbor joining) algorithm 19 constructs phylogenetic trees by iteratively joining two pairs of neighbor nodes and joining them as two new nodes, which accelerates the construction process. FastJoin combines the INJ algorithm with the upper-bound computation optimizations of the Rapid NJ and the external storage of the ERapid NJ to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. The Neighbor Joining Method Plus 20 reconstructs phylogenetic trees by taking the sequence with children as the internal node and the sequence without children as the leaf node. There is no limit to the number of neighbor nodes in the tree obtained, which means that the resulting tree is not solely a binary tree. The FastNJ 21 is a fast implementation of the RNJ and the FastJoin and has shown a significant increase in the speed with a minimal loss in accuracy. The LNJ (live neighbor joining) algorithm 22 extends the numeric rationale of the NJ algorithm and introduces live ancestors to flexibly join taxa with minimum branch lengths.",

China, has touched people around the world and has been named by the World Health Organization as \"2019-nCoV.\" With joint effort from many scientists, the related research on the novel coronavirus has made great progress. [25] [26] [27] [28] Throughout history, there were previously six kinds of coronaviruses known to infect humans; among which, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-229E can cause cold symptoms, and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can cause a severe respiratory syndrome. Understanding the evolutionary relationships among coronaviruses is the basis for further study of the novel coronavirus. In the latest study, Lu et al. 29 compared the complete genome of the COVID-19 with the other known coronaviruses and found that the similarity between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV was 79%, whereas that of COVID-19 and MERS-CoV was 50%. In the following results, the ENJ algorithm was used to construct a phylogenetic tree for all seven coronaviruses.",

Considering the evolutionary direction of natural selection, the JCV algorithm finds all possible DNA sequences for a given species and codes them in order into a feature vector, which is then used to calculate the evolutionary distance between different species.

The two phylogenetic trees in Figures 6 and 7 were used as input data, and the Frin algorithm was used to construct a level-2 network with r = 2 and c = 4, as shown in Figure 8 . The resulting network shows that COVID-19 and SARS-CoV share a direct common ancestor, which is far from MERS-CoV, and two reticular events occurred during the evolution of the seven coronaviruses. As shown, HCoV-NL63 was derived from reticular evolutionary events, as was the parent of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV.

In the construction process, the ENJ can simultaneously deal with the two smallest values in the same row or column of the sum matrix and can join three nodes to construct a triple phylogenetic tree. Experiments with simulated data show that the phylogenetic trees constructed by the ENJ have greater similarity with the initial trees than the other methods, and the ENJ greatly accelerates the speed of the NJ algorithm in constructing the phylogenetic trees. In addition, the experiment with real data shows that the ENJ can effectively avoid the problem of \"tied trees,\" and the resulting trees are more consistent. Application of the ENJ algorithm on the novel coronavirus shows that it can effectively reflect the evolutionary relationships among coronaviruses. Furthermore, we constructed the phylogenetic network for COVID-19 and the related coronaviruses, which indicates the reticular relationships among the coronaviruses. Experimental results show that the ENJ algorithm is an efficient and effective method. First, the trees reconstructed with the ENJ better represent the information of the initial trees. Second, the ENJ constructs phylogenetic trees swiftly. Third, the ENJ effectively constructs phylogenetic trees to solve the problem in which the resulting tree is not unique. These facts indicate that the ENJ algorithm can better describe biological evolution.",
