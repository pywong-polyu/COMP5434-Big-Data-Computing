            "text": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) infectious cycle starts with the viral adsorption and entry into the host cell. Then, the virus is internalized via clathrin/dynamin mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. Similar to other viruses, ASF virion is then internalized and incorporated into the endocytic pathway. While the endosomal maturation entails luminal acidification, the decrease in pH acts on the multilayer structure of the virion dissolving the outer capsid. Upon decapsidation, the inner viral membrane is exposed to interact with the limiting membrane of the late endosome for fusion. Viral fusion is then necessary for the egress of incoming virions from endosomes into the cytoplasm, however this remains an intriguing and yet essential process for infection, specifically for the egress of viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm for replication. ASFV proteins E248R and E199L, located at the exposed inner viral membrane, might be implicated in the fusion step. An interaction between these viral proteins and cellular endosomal proteins such as the Niemann-Pick C type 1 (NPC1) and lysosomal membrane proteins (Lamp-1 and -2) was shown. Furthermore, the silencing of these proteins impaired ASFV infection. It was also observed that NPC1 knock-out cells using CRISPR jeopardized ASFV infection and that the progression and endosomal exit of viral cores was arrested within endosomes at viral entry. These results suggest that the interactions of ASFV proteins with some endosomal proteins might be important for the membrane fusion step. In addition to this, reductions on ASFV infectivity and replication in NPC1 KO cells were accompanied by fewer and smaller viral factories. Our findings pave the way to understanding the role of proteins of the endosomal membrane in ASFV infection.",

Cholesterol efflux at the LE is relevant at this stage and, its pharmacological blockade at this level can cause retention of virions inside endosomes, and inhibits infection progression [14] . Endosomal cholesterol efflux is mainly regulated by the coordinated action of the NPC1, an endolysosomal membrane protein; and NPC2, a single domain protein located in the lumen of the vesicle [15] [16] [17] .

An example is Ebola virus (EBOV), in which NPC1 has a pivotal role at infection, given that the EBOV Glycoprotein (GP) interacts with NPC1 [33] to achieve endosomal fusion and cytoplasmic penetration. The disruption of this interaction by drugs that are known to interact with NPC1, causes a reduction in the viral replication, and it is currently accepted that NPC1 is pivotal for a successful infection in several virus models [34, 35] . Another example is Lassa virus, an Arenavirus, which interacts with another endolysosomal protein, Lamp1 [36] . In addition to this, NPC1 has been recently shown to be important for SARS-CoV-2 [32, 37] . All these studies suggest the importance of the NPC1 protein for several distant viruses.",

            "text": "To determine the influence of cholesterol flux on ASFV infection, the chemical U18666A, a compound that blocks the cholesterol transporter NPC1 [14] was used. This compound reduces cholesterol efflux from the endosome; thus, cholesterol is retained within these vesicles and its accumulation resulted in the formation of large, dilated endosomes. To further study the effect of this on ASFV infection, we explored whether there was a correlation between cholesterol retention and reduced ASFV infectivity at the same drug concentrations. For this purpose, Vero cells were pre-treated with increasing concentrations of the drug U18666A and cholesterol was labelled with Filipin, a compound that binds to cholesterol. As can be seen in Fig 1A, a characteristic accumulation of cholesterol in large vesicle-like clusters around the perinuclear zone was observed from a drug concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM. Similar results were observed when Vero cells were pre-treated with similar concentrations of drug U18666A and infected with ASFV BPP30 GFP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 pfu/ml for 16 hpi. After this time, GFP expression was measured using a plate reader. It was observed that infection started to be impaired at the same drug concentrations that cholesterol accumulation started, suggesting that there might be a correlation between the two events ( Fig 1B) . To further confirm that this was not a side effect of the drug U18666A on acidification; the effect of acidification under various conditions, including the cholesterol efflux blocking drug U18666A, was analysed using the Lysotracker acid pH probe [12] . As controls, Vero cells were pre-treated with the lysosomotropic drugs Bafilomycin-A1 ( Fig 1C) and NH 4 Cl (not shown). Acidic vesicles stained clearly in controls and in cells treated with drug U18666A, whereas no signal from acidic vesicles was detected with the lysosomotropic drugs. This confirmed that compound U18666A acted specifically as an inhibitor of cholesterol export in this context ( Fig 1C) .",

Therefore, we wondered whether NPC1 might exert a role in the egress of the viral cores into the cytoplasm at the fusion step. To this end, we infected Vero WT, empty control and NPC1KO cells and fixed the cells after 3 hpi, as it is known that at this time point most viral cores exit LE to the cytoplasm proceeding with infection [12, 13] . Next, virion trafficking through the LE was studied by immunofluorescence, in which viral cores and LE were detected using antibodies against viral protein p150 and the cellular protein Rab7 respectively. A remarkable accumulation of ASFV viral cores was observed within LE compared to controls, where, as expected for fluid endosomal traffic, only a discrete association of viral cores and LE could be observed (Fig 5A and 5B ). Colocalization between viral cores and Rab7 (labelled LE) increased in NPC1 KO cells early after infection ( Fig 5C) . However, the numerous LE-trapped virions observed in confocal images (events) suggested that colocalization values likely underestimated the number of events (Figs 5B and S10). To test this, we created and ran a Plugin for Image J as a method to quantify viral cores retained in endosomes following the procedure described in detail in Materials and Methods (S9 Fig). A high number of viral cores retained within the LE was observed in NPC1 KO cells compared to the controls ( Fig 5D) . These results showed the impact of the absence of NPC1 in the process of viral fusion and egress into the cytoplasm at early stages of the infection.",

These two highly conserved ASFV proteins, located in the internal membrane of the virion, would be exposed after decapsidation in the LE. Indeed, E248R has been suggested to be involved in viral membrane fusion and core delivery but not in viral disassembly within endosomes. Similarly, E199L was required for viral core penetration and was reported to be unrelated to downstream processes [13, 39, 53] . This suggests that their functions might be complementary but not identical. Likewise, proteins belonging to the VACV fusion complex are crucial for DNA replication but not for morphogenesis [41, 54] .",

This could indicate that being a large complex virus, ASFV might have developed alternative cellular pathways to achieve viral fusion to escape the endosome. Indeed, we found that E199L was able to interact with NPC1, Lamp1 and Lamp2. From this perspective, it is plausible that due to its genome size, ASFV could have evolved alternative solutions within its more than 150 ORFs, that allow it to overcome this cellular gene abrogation. Therefore, we hypothesized that other LE membrane-localized cholesterol transporters, such as Lamp1 and Lamp2, may also be exploited by ASFV. In fact, these molecules cooperate with NPC proteins in a slower mechanism for endosomal export of cholesterol [19] .

At this point, the processing of viral cores started. First, the segmentation was done to isolate each viral core as a single-particle. To do that, \"Auto-Threshold\" plugin is called to binarize images through the MaxEntropy method. Then the \"Analyze Particles\" command was run to count, measure and extract features (morphological, geometrical and descriptive statistics) for each binary viral core. Thereupon, viral cores that meet the filtering conditions were selected for further analysis. Initial filtering isolate masks within an area bigger than four times the pixel size in microns. Next, we only kept masks whose shift on the x-y axis along the slices does not exceed 0.100 microns. From this subset, the mask with the highest mean intensity value was selected. Then, having defined viral cores candidates, we combined them, slice by slice, using the exclusive OR operator to create a composite selection of viral cores.",
