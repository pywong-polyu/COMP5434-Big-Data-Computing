Using culture methods, infectious viruses can be identified through their ability to produce changes in inoculated cells (cytopathic effects or CPE) or through expression of viral antigens that may be detected serologically. The advantage of culture-based methodology is that it can be either quantitative or qualitative and produces unambiguous results with respect to virus presence and infectivity.",

The SPIEM is more sensitive than direct EM because, in the presence of specific antibodies, the virus particles are coated with specific antibody and aggregated together, making them more easily distinguishable from the background matrix. Many of the \"small round viruses,\" which include astroviruses, noroviruses, sapoviruses, and parvoviruses, were first discovered through the use of EM.",

It is not clear whether pasteurization at 60\u00b0C for 30 min inactivates all enteric viruses. Many enteric viruses show resistance to ultrahigh hydrostatic pressure, which is now being widely used as a novel food-processing treatment for shellfish, jams, jellies, and dairy products (Wilkinson et al., 2001; Kingsley et al., 2002) . The resistance of enteric viruses to environmental stressors allows them to resist both the acidic environment of the mammalian gut and also the proteolytic and alkaline activity of the duodenum so that they are able to pass through these regions and colonize the lower digestive tract. These properties also allow survival of enteric viruses in acidic, marinated, and pickled foods; frozen foods; and lightly cooked foods such as shellfish. Most enteric viruses are believed to have a low infectious dose of 10-100 particles or possibly even less. Hence, although they do not multiply in food, enough infectious virions may survive in food, be consumed, and cause disease.",

Preharvest virus contamination occurs when filter-feeding bivalve shellfish grow in waters contaminated with sewage or fecal material. Shellfish filter between 4 and 20 L of water every hour, sieving out and accumulating food particles, including bacteria, viruses, and heavy metals. Feeding rates depend on water temperature and salinity and availability of food and particulate matter. Bacteria and viruses become trapped in the mucus of the gills, which is then pushed into the digestive gland where viruses appear to concentrate. Shellfish can accumulate high concentrations of viruses within a few hours when surrounding waters contain sufficient levels of virus, so that concentrations in shellfish may be 100 to 1,000 times greater than the surrounding waters.",

Foods at risk from contamination by food handlers include a wide range of foods that are subjected to much handling and are subsequently consumed cold or uncooked. These include bread and bakery goods, lightly cooked or raw shellfish, sandwiches, salads, herbs, fresh fruits, cold meats, and cold desserts. It is probable that the current trend for the consumption of raw or lightly cooked ready-to-eat (RTE) foods, especially salads and sandwiches, has increased the risk of food-borne viral disease. Poor food handling was shown to be a key risk factor in the transmission of noroviruses and rotaviruses in The Netherlands (de Wit et al., 2003) .",

Under normal conditions, the virus requires 3 weeks for in vitro growth. Laboratory-adapted strains such as HM 175 are able to produce CPE and so have been used extensively in research studies. These viruses require less time for in vitro growth and produce visible CPE or plaques. Molecular techniques, including culture-PCR, have become the method of choice for detection of virus in nonhuman samples, whereas clinical diagnosis is usually based on the patient's immune response. HAV antigens are conserved and antibodies are generated against a single antigenic site composed of amino acid residues of VP3 and VP1 proteins on the virus surface. HAV is very stable, showing high resistance to chemical and physical agents such as drying, heat, low pH, and solvents, and has been shown to survive in the environment, including seawater and marine sediments, for more than 3 months (Sobsey et al., 1988) . The virus retains integrity and infectivity after 60-min incubation at 60\u00b0C and is only partially inactivated after 10-12 hr at 56\u00b0C. The heat resistance of HAV is reported to be greater in foods and shellfish. After heating in a can for 19 min at 60\u00b0C, HAV inoculated into oysters was not fully inactivated. Under refrigeration and freezing conditions, the virus remains intact and infectious for several years. It is also resistant to drying, remaining infectious for more than 1 month at 25\u00b0C and 42% humidity, and shows even greater resistance at low humidity and low temperatures.",

The capsid symmetry is icosahedral, and the buoyant density in potassium tartrate-glycerol gradient is 1.29 g/ml. HEV was originally classified in the Caliciviridae because of similarities in structural morphology and genome organization. The virus was then reclassified in the family Togaviridae because of similarities between the replicative enzymes of HEV and the togaviruses. However, the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classification places HEV under a new family, Hepeviridae, genus Hepevirus (van Regenmortel et al., 2000) . Two HEV serotypes and four major HEV genotypes have been identified based on nucleotide and protein sequencing. Genotype 1 includes Asian and African strains, genotype 2 includes a Mexican strain, genotype 3 includes United States swine and human strains, and genotype 4 includes strains from China, Japan, and Taiwan (Emerson and Purcell, 2003) .",

Although the disease can be quite severe in some cases, it is usually self-limiting and does not progress to a carrier or chronic state. The virus infects the liver and produces symptoms of hepatitis after a 22-60 day incubation period. Symptoms may include viremia, nausea, dark urine, and general malaise. The virus is excreted in bile and feces from 2 weeks before the elevation of liver enzymes and continues until the enzyme levels return to normal. Identification and diagnosis is generally by detection of IgM and IgG responses in patients' sera to recombinant HEV protein antigens or by molecular assays to identify the virus in feces or sera. In general, the mortality rate from hepatitis E infections is about 1% but may reach as high as 17-30% in pregnant women (Cromeans et al., 2001; Emerson and Purcell, 2003) . The major mode of transmission appears to be contaminated water. Secondary person-to-person transmission has been estimated at 0.7-8.0% and is relatively uncommon (Cromeans et al., 2001) .",

Simultaneously, the virus was also identified in domestic swine (Meng et al., 1997; Schlauder et al., 1998) and has now been documented in humans and swine in many other countries including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Greece, Japan, Korea, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, and Taiwan (Clemente-Casares et al., 2003) .

Recent reports from Japan show that the virus may be transmitted to humans by close contact with infected swine or from the consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked pork, wild boar liver, and deer meat (Tei et al., 2003; Yazaki et al., 2003) . The most convincing evidence of zoonotic transmission to date is a recent report in which consumption of raw deer meat by a Japanese family was implicated in the transmission of HEV (Tei et al., 2003) . In another study, Tei et al. (2004) investigated the risks associated with consumption of uncooked deer meat in a case control study and found that, in the area studied, eating uncooked deer meat was a risk factor. Meng et al. (2002) found that veterinarians and people working with pigs were more likely to have antibodies to HEV. The isolation of a swine HEV that cross-reacts with an antibody to the capsid antigen of human HEV provides additional evidence for a zoonotic transmission route (Meng et al., 1997) . Nonhuman primates can also be infected by swine HEV; inoculation of rhesus monkeys with swine HEV led to seroconversion, fecal shedding of virus, viremia, and development of a mild acute hepatitis with slight elevation in liver enzymes. Similar studies in chimpanzees also resulted in seroconversion and fecal shedding of virus but not viremia or hepatitis (Meng et al., 1998) . These findings suggest that swine HEV may infect humans and that swine could be a zoonotic reservoir for HEV.",

These viruses cause epidemic viral gastroenteritis resulting in large outbreaks. The prototype norovirus, Norwalk virus, was first discovered by Kapikian et al. (1972) after an outbreak of gastroenteritis in a school in Norwalk, Ohio. Immune electron microscopy was used to examine feces from volunteers who consumed fecal filtrates from infected cases (Dolin et al., 1971; Kapikian et al., 1972) . At that time, most cases of gastroenteritis that could not be attributed to a bacterial agent were termed acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis. The discovery of Norwalk virus provided the first evidence of a viral etiology for human diarrheal disease. Despite this discovery, noroviruses remained largely unrecognized until about 15 years ago because their detection was technically difficult and because the illness is generally mild and short-lived and is not reportable to public health authorities.",

Because norovirus infections are not notifiable, the total burden of disease is not known and is generally grossly underreported (Mead et al., 1999; Wheeler et al., 1999) . However, some of the disease burden is recorded through the notification of gastroenteritis outbreaks to the public health disease surveillance systems in many developed countries. It has been estimated that noroviruses are responsible for approximately 60% of food-borne disease in the United States, including more than 9 million cases, 33% of hospitalizations, and 7% of deaths related to foodborne disease each year (Mead et al., 1999) . Fankhauser et al. (2002) found that 93% of 284 nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks in the United States were due to norovirus, and in 57% of these, contaminated food was the vehicle of infection. The majority of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks in Europe have been attributed to noroviruses, where they were reported to be responsible for more than 85% of nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks between 1995 and 2000 .",

More than 26 different cell lines combined with many varied cell culture supplements and growth conditions have been evaluated, but no norovirus-induced CPE or replicating norovirus was obtained (Duizer et al., 2004) . Noroviruses have now been identified that infect animals, including pigs, cattle, and mice, and progress in this field is now being made with the growth of a mouse norovirus in artificial culture (Wobus et al., 2004 ). This culture system will help to discover more about human noroviruses and their mechanisms of pathogenicity.

The inability to culture noroviruses coupled with the problems associated with identification of the virus by EM restricted their detection for many years. Noroviruses are difficult to identify by direct EM in fecal samples and foods because of their small size and the nature of the background matrices. Immune electron microscopy (IEM) is frequently used to improve the sensitivity of detection, but the antibody coating can mask the appearance of the virus. The development of assays such as reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has facilitated the detection and identification of these viruses, and consequently the role of noroviruses in gastroenteritis outbreaks has been clarified. Noroviruses show great genetic diversity, which has complicated their identification by molecular assays. To date, none of the numerous norovirus primer sets designed have been able to detect 100% of known norovirus strains, but some sets have been found to be more sensitive and have a broader detection range than others (Vinje et al., 2003) .",

These assays use monoclonal antibodies prepared against recombinant norovirus capsid proteins generated in a baculovirus expression system.

The virus also retains infectivity after exposure to pH 2.7 for 3 hr at room temperature Green et al., 2001) . Further evidence of its resistance to low pH was shown when norovirus was exposed to heat treatment and subsequent marination at pH 3.75 in mussels for 1 month. No decrease in norovirus titer was observed by real-time RT-PCR (Hewitt and Greening, 2004) . There are anecdotal reports of people developing gastroenteritis after eating pickled shellfish. Norovirus, like other enteric viruses, remains infectious under refrigeration and freezing conditions, appears to survive well in the environment, and is resistant to drying.

Evidence that norovirus transmission occurs through aerosolization of vomit was clearly demonstrated at a U.K. hotel. During a meal, a guest vomited at the table, and norovirus infection spread in a radial pattern through the restaurant, progressively decreasing from 91% attack rate among those seated at the same table to an attack rate of 25% in those patrons who were seated the farthest distance away from the guest who vomited (Marks et al., 2000) . Norovirus infection characteristically has an attack rate of 50-70% or even higher in some situations. This high attack rate combined with a low infectious dose, prolonged virus excretion, short-term immunity, and the environmental stability of the noroviruses contributes to the epidemic nature of noroviral gastroenteritis.",

Two of the structural proteins, VP7 (glycoprotein) and VP4 (protease or P protein), comprise the outer shell of the capsid and are important in virus infectivity. These two proteins are used to define the rotavirus serotype; there are 14 VP7 serotypes and 11 VP4 serotypes within the Rotavirus A species. The VP6 protein located on the inner capsid layer is designated the group-specific antigen and is the major target of rotavirus diagnostic assays. This protein is believed to play a role in the development of protective immunity. Genomic reassortment of the rotaviral RNA segments may occur during replication, particularly when there is coinfection with more than one strain.

They are resistant to drying and may survive on fomites and surfaces. Heating at 50\u00b0C for 30 min reduces their infectivity by 99%, and infectivity is rapidly lost at pH <3.0 and >10.0. Repeated cycles of freezethaw can also destroy infectivity. The viruses are resistant to solvents such as ether and chloroform and to non-ionic detergents such as deoxycholate. Chelating agents such as EDTA disrupt the outer shell and inactivate rotaviruses. Treatment with disinfectants such as chlorine, phenol, formalin, and 95% ethanol is also effective against rotavirus . Normal cooking temperatures are usually sufficient to inactivate rotaviruses. The viruses are found in water and sewage, are resistant to chlorine levels present in drinking water, and are persistent in the environment.

Astroviruses are 28-to 30-nm, spherical, nonenveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of about 6.8-8 kb and a buoyant density of 1.32 g/ml in potassium tartrate-glycerol gradient (Table 2 .1). Because only 10% of astroviruses exhibit the typical 5-or 6-pointed star-like morphology by direct EM, the efficiency of detection was restricted until the introduction of molecular detection methods and improved culture techniques. At least eight human serotypes, two bovine serotypes, and one serotype of each of feline, ovine, and porcine astrovirus are recognized. The human strains are all antigenically distinct from the bovine and ovine strains. A second genus, Avastrovirus, contains the type species turkey astrovirus, of which there are two serotypes. This virus infects birds, including turkeys and ducks (van Regenmortel et al., 2000) .",

Although CaCo-2 continuous cell line has proved to be useful for the propagation of astroviruses (Willcocks et al., 1990) , virus detection is carried out mainly by EM of stool specimens, molecular assays, or by combined culture-PCR methods. Astroviruses are resistant to extreme environmental conditions. Their heat tolerance allows them to survive 50\u00b0C for 1 hr. At 60\u00b0C, the virus titer falls by 3 log 10 and 6 log 10 after 5 and 15 min, respectively.

Of the many types of adenoviruses, only HAdV serotypes 40 and 41 are generally associated with fecal-oral spread and cause gastroenteritis, although all serotypes are shed enterically in feces. HAdV types 40 and 41 can be detected in large numbers in the feces of young children with acute gastroenteritis. In immunocompromised individuals, infection with types 40 and 41 may cause chronic diarrhea. Although rare, some deaths have been reported in immunocompromised children (Bresee and Glass, 1999) . Adenoviruses can cause persistent asymptomatic infections and may become established in tonsils, adenoids, and intestines of infected hosts. It is not known whether they are capable of reactivation causing overt disease.",

The development of molecular techniques, such as PCR and real-time quantitative PCR, is rapidly increasing the knowledge base by facilitating studies on the behavior and persistence of these viruses in food matrices. However, it is important to recognize the limitations of these techniques. PCR-based methods currently detect both infectious and noninfectious viruses and are not able to determine viral infectivity, which is the key factor when assessing human health risks from food-borne pathogens. It is important that data generated solely from molecular-based assays is judiciously interpreted when studying these viruses. Use of cell culture combined with PCR methods (culture-PCR) can overcome some of these problems for those viruses that are difficult to grow. Unfortunately, the infectivity status of the main food-borne viral pathogen, norovirus, still cannot be determined by in vitro methods. This has limited our knowledge of the natural history and biological properties of this pathogen and has also slowed progress in the development of effective control and intervention strategies.",
