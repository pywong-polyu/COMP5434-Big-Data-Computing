How to develop effective and reasonable plans to prevent the spread of mutated COVID-19 is an important issue. In order to simulate the transmission of mutated COVID-19 (Delta strain) in China with a certain proportion of vaccination, we selected the epidemic situation in Jiangsu Province as a case study. To solve this problem, we develop a novel epidemic model with a vaccinated population. The basic properties of the model is analyzed, and the expression of the basic reproduction number R 0 is obtained. We collect data on the Delta strain epidemic in Jiangsu Province, China from July 20, to August 5, 2021. The weighted nonlinear least square estimation method is used to fit the daily asymptomatic infected people, common infected people and severe infected people. The estimated parameter values are obtained, the approximate values of the basic reproduction number are calculated R 0 \u2248 1 . 378 . Through the global sensitivity analysis, we identify some parameters that have a greater impact on the prevalence of the disease. Finally, according to the evaluation results of parameter influence, we consider three control measures (vaccination, isolation and nucleic acid testing) to control the spread of the disease. The results of the study found that the optimal control measure is to dynamically adjust the three control measures to achieve the lowest number of infections at the lowest cost. The research in this paper can not only enrich theoretical research on the transmission of COVID-19, but also provide reliable control suggestions for countries and regions experiencing mutated COVID-19 epidemics.",

While these vaccines can't completely protect people from infection, they can reduce the severity of infection to some extent when fighting COVID-19. The second is that there are many different types of mutations in COVID-19 that make them different in their infectivity and mortality. Much has been written about control measures for COVID-19 as it spreads around the world in 2020. However, noting these differences, there have been few studies on the spread of mutated COVID-19 in populations with a certain proportion of vaccinations.",

The control measures are mainly implemented through two programmes: one is to increase vaccination in unvaccinated susceptible group S 1 ; The second is to supplement the COVID-19 antibody to S 2 , a population with weakened antibodies. \u03c4 1 represents the rate of vaccination in S 1 and S 2 . (2) u 2 represents the measure to isolate the virus, which are mainly achieved through isolation of infected persons, disinfection of the environment and increasing the daily wear of masks when going out. (3) u 3 stands for nucleic acid test for all people in the city, with the aim of screening out all asymptomatic infected person A , common infected person I 1 and severe infected person I 2 , and then treating them separately. \u03c4 2 represents the probability of successful screening of a nucleic acid test.",

This analysis quantifies the uncertainty in any complex model in math. In particular, sensitivity analysis is used to study the contribution of initial parameters and conditions to model results. In order to achieve this goal, we use a very efficient statistical techniques that a combination of latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) is used. In the method, we obtain the values of PRCC for each parameter, which can be used to help estimate the level of uncertainty in mathematical models.

In the previous section, we estimated R 0 to be 1.378, which is close to the mean. The estimate of R 0 is indicated by a red dotted line in Fig. 5 . We notice that the distribution of R 0 is very wide, so its uncertainty is very high. And most of the values of R 0 are smaller than the estimated values of R 0 . Therefore, we want to further analyze which parameters have a greater influence on R 0 and consider the control means in reality through the analysis results.

Because of the level of vaccine production and the number of health workers, it is difficult to rely on vaccination to make a large number of people produce antibodies in a short period of time and stop the spread of COVID-19.
