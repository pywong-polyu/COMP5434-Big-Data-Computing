Using a recently developed transfer learning algorithm, TLmutation, we sought to identified other ACE2 variants, namely double mutants, that may exhibit similar binding affinity with decreased mutational load. Upon training a TLmutation model on the effects of single mutations, we identified several ACE2 double mutants that bind to RBD with tighter affinity as compared to the wild type, most notably, L79V;N90D that binds RBD with similar affinity to ACE22.v.2.4.

Recently, Chan and colleagues performed a deep mutational scan of ACE2 and uncovered several amino acid substitutions throughout the ACE2 receptor that enhance the binding affinity to S of SARS-CoV-2 12 . They further characterized a sACE2 derivative containing the three mutations T27Y, L79T, and N330Y, referred to as sACE22.v2.4 (Figure 1A) , to exhibit a 35-fold increase in binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2, and further tighter affinity for SARS-CoV-2 variants that contain the N501Y mutation 12, 13 . In vivo characterization further demonstrates that inoculation of sACE22.v2.4 in mice prevents acute lung vascular endothelial injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 and improves survival 14 .

To overcome this, the TLmutation platform implements a supervised algorithm to train a model with the experimental scores from a deep mutational scan. In doing so, the weights of the site-specific conservation and coevolutionary couplings are decoupled from a function of overall survival and fitted to the experimentally tested function of the protein. We have previously demonstrated the use of TLmutation to successfully incorporate deep mutational scanning data to decouple protein function from overall survival to enhance the prediction of variant effects in 13 individual proteins 15 .

As such, the TLmutation algorithm demonstrates the ability to decouple overall survivability and predict a particular function of interest. We find that DeepSequence, which models the evolutionary information into a latent representation 19 and is considered a top preforming method for predicting deep mutational scans 20 , performed subpar to TLMutation ( Figure 1B) .

            "text": "As TLmutation utilizes coevolutionary couplings to make predictions, we used the model trained on single point mutations to predict the effect of ACE2 double mutants. To validate the predictions generated by the model, we selected 18 ACE2 double mutants from the following different categories: 9 double mutants that scored in the top 1% of TLmutation; 4 double mutants in which each single mutation independently enhances binding, but scored less than the top 1%; 2 double mutants with a TLmutation score in the lowest 1% to serve as negative controls; and 3 double mutants consisting of the combination of single mutations in sACE22.v2.4 ( Table S1 ). The ACE2 mutants were evaluated by expression of full-length, myc-tagged protein in human Expi293F cells, which were tested by flow cytometry for binding to superfolder GFP (sfGFP)-fused RBD ( Figure   2 ). The predicted constructs exhibited levels of expression similar with the wild-type ACE2, suggesting these mutants do not significantly alter the stability of the receptor (Figure S1 ). With the exception of the two negative controls, all the mutants tested were observed to bind better or on par with the wild type (Figure 2) . Additionally, the TLmutation scores correlated more to the experimental results as compared to EVmutation and DeepSequence (TLmutation R 2 = 0.52, EVmutation R 2 = 0.09, DeepSequence R 2 = 0.23, Figure 3A-C) . to be highly deleterious in function. We hypothesize the limited dataset of double mutations was not adequate to distinguish critical couplings to accurately predict higher order mutations.",

Two ACE2 mutants exhibited over a two-fold relative binding increase over the wild type. For the L91P;N330Y mutant, both single mutations exhibited a relative binding fold enhancement of under two 12 ; however, when expressed together, the relative binding increased over 2.5 fold. We have previously conducted molecular dynamics simulations of sACE22.v2.4 with the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 and observed the N330Y mutation to interact with backbone carbonyls of P499 on RBD further to stabilize the associated complex 14 (Figure 4A) . Interestingly, L91P is not directly located on the ACE2 binding interface and may allosterically stabilize the \u03b12 helix for favorable S binding 12 . It is also possible that the proline introduction may alter the dynamics of the glycosylation motif at position 90. The best performing double mutant, L79V;N90D (Figure 4B) , bound RDB-sfGFP exceptionally well, equivalent to sACE22.v2.4. This double mutant scored within the top 0.7% of all TLmutation double mutants, whereas in EVmutation and DeepSequence, it scored in the top 5 th and 2 nd percentile, respectively. However, this mutant disrupts the N90 glycan which has been shown to interact with RBD 21 and could impair glycosylation that is required for in vivo compatibility, solubility, and reduced drug immunogenicity in ways that are unpredictable. Overall, the TLmutation algorithm successfully predicted higher order ACE2 mutants with tight RBD binding activity from single mutation data, but nonetheless the sACE22.v2.4 derivative remains a top candidate for drug development as it combines high affinity spike protein binding and preserves the native glycosylation sites.",

Indeed, many high scoring (above a TLmutation score of 2 or the top 0.4% of all scored variants) ACE2 double mutants contains residues not involved at the interface ( Figure S3 ). As such, computational techniques that employ in silico mutagenesis provide a powerful and attractive approach to systematically identify potential candidates for further validation. A recent in silico mutagenesis study employing the Rosetta based modeler for protein-protein association, Flex ddG, has successfully identified a quadruple ACE2 mutant, S19F;T27F;K31W;N330F, to exhibit nanomolar binding affinity similar to the sACE22.v2.4 designed mutant 22 . Similar in this study, the use of a supervised transfer learning algorithm implemented by TLmutation successfully identify several double mutations that enhances binding to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2. Though, while the mutations initially identified sACE22.v2.4 construct retains the very tight binding activity and provide the most in vivo compatibility, these works demonstrate the successful use of computational techniques to aid in the engineering of protein design. A current limitation of variant effect predictors, TLmutation included, is in its ability to predict higher order mutations due to the lack of training data to identify relevant residue couplings. As mentioned, TLmutation, EVmutation, and DeepSequence fail to predict sACE22.v2.4 variant to be functional in binding. However, as deep mutational datasets become more readily available, specifically double mutational scans, we expect the use of computational algorithms may not only improve in silico variant effect predictions, but further aid in the systematic design of protein function that considers in vivo compatibility with minimal mutational load.",
