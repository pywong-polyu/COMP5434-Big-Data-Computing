The present study aimed to investigate the concentrations of urinary PAHs and their health effects in individuals living near restaurants via a health risk assessment analysis. This cross-sectional study was performed on 57 people living near restaurants and 30 individuals as the control group. Five urinary metabolites of PAHs were monitored. In order to evaluate the effects of the urinary metabolites of PAHs on Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, Total Anti-oxidation Capacity (TAC) in urine samples, and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in serum samples, regression model was used by considering the effects of the possible confounding factors. Non-carcinogenic health risk was calculated, as well. The median concentration of urinary PAHs was 1196.70 and 627.54 ng/g creatinine in the people living near restaurants and the control group, respectively. Among the metabolites, the lowest and highest mean concentrations were related to 9-OHPhe and 1-OHP, respectively in the two study groups. Moreover, PAHs were significantly associated with MDA level and TAC (p < 0.05). Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Hazard Index (HI) were less than 1. Long-term studies are required to determine the actual health effects by identifying the sources of PAHs emission and to find ways to decrease the production of these compounds.",

Most PAHs (around 95%) size below 3 \u03bcm and can be easily transported over long distances 3 . They have been long considered priority pollutants by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) 4 . Some PAHs are the byproduct of anthropogenic activities such as the incomplete combustion of substances such as coal, oil, gas, plastics, and tobacco 5 . The main pathway, through which they can cause damage to humans is by the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the body 6 . Oxidative stress is a process that occurs through free radicals at the cell membrane and leads to cell membrane damage and peroxidation, eventually causing cell dysfunction 7 .",

The results of some studies have shown an increased risk of cancers amongst restaurant workers 11, 15 . For instance, the results of a study performed on urinary PAH metabolites among Indian kitchen workers demonstrated that the concentrations of these metabolites were higher in the workers than in the control group 15 . Another study conducted in Japan in 2019 also showed that the exhaust gas from cooking indoors might increase the risk of cancer during life 17 . However, to date, no sufficient information is available regarding the effects of PAH metabolites as well as health risk assessment among people living near restaurants. Thus, the present study researchers attempted a multilevel assessment focusing on Malondialdehyde (MDA) as an effective biomarker, Total Anti-oxidation Capacity (TAC), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). To monitor these effects on humans' well-being, the impacts of the urinary concentrations of PAHs on health were investigated among individuals living near restaurants. The daily intake of the compounds in question was also assessed and the Hazard Quotient (HQ) was computed for both the control and exposed groups. As such, an estimation of the risk of inhabitants in the vicinity of restaurants was proposed.",

Then, the mixture was placed on a shaker at 3000 rpm for 15 min, and the metabolite was separated. The separated supernatant was put in a Gas Chromatography (GC) vial. Finally, 3 ml of this supernatant was injected into the Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) device (Agilent, 7890, USA) equipped with the HP5-MS capillary column to measure OH-PAHs. In this study, five urinary metabolites including 1-Naphthalene (1-OHNap), 2-Naphthalene (2-OHNap), 2-Fluorine (2-OHFlu), 1-Hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), and 9-Phenanthrene (9-OHPhe) were measured. The creatinine level was assessed according to the Jaffe method using a spectrophotometer immediately after sampling. The concentrations were expressed in nanograms per gram of creatinine (ng/g creatinine). Creatinine was measured to adjust the effect of urine dilution in different individuals 14 .

            "text": "The present study aimed at comparison of a study group living near restaurants and a control group regarding their exposure to PAHs. Among the assessed urinary \u03a3OH-PAHs, the highest mean concentration was found at the 1-OHP level. Besides, the results revealed no significant difference between the two groups concerning the \u03a3OH-PAHs levels. However, a significant relationship was observed between the concentrations of the PAH metabolites and MDA level and TAC. Nevertheless, both HQ and HI were lower than 1 in all the cases and, consequently, the associated health risks were not high for the specific study groups. Yet, the generalization of these findings should be done with due caution. Given the harmful effects of PAHs on human health and the existing literature on the topic, further long-term studies are required to determine the real health effects by identifying the sources of PAHs emission to find ways to decrease the production of these compounds. Limitation. One of the limitations of this study was its small sample size. Thus, the results have to be supported by other studies. Additionally, PAHs in the air around restaurants could not be measured due to financial limitations and further studies in this field are warranted.",
