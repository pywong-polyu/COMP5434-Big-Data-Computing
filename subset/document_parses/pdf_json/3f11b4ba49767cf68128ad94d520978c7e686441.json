Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA can be detected in specimens derived from asymptomatic individuals where its presence is likely to represent colonization rather than active disease. A positive PCR assay in an individual without overt pneumonia is therefore a diagnostic dilemma that requires a broader assessment to determine if treatment is appropriate. This ambiguity underlies the difficulty in quantifying diagnostic performance of P jirovecii PCR as there is no perfect gold standard for comparison. Microscopic examination of specimens obtained by bronchoscopy, while still not perfectly sensitive, might be considered the closest approximation of \"ground truth, \" as deeper sampling (such as BAL specimens and transbronchial biopsy) may be more sensitive for achieving diagnosis compared to induced sputum [5] . But since not every patient suspected of PJP undergoes bronchoscopy, analysis of only those cases involving bronchoscopy is likely to introduce sampling bias and may inaccurately reflect the performance of PCR in a broader population. Some studies have alternatively employed the judgment of a clinician as a reference standard-either the treatment team managing the patient in real time or a retrospective adjudicator [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

Furthermore, quantification of organism burden by examination of the PCR cycle threshold (C T ) has been considered a tool to improve the specificity of PCR for discrimination between PJP and colonization [14] . This has exclusively been performed using in-house PCR assays not commercially available [7] [8] [9] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] with rare exception [6] . The Emory University Hospital Microbiology Laboratory uses a thoroughly validated, laboratory-developed real-time PCR assay using primers that amplify the P jirovecii mtLSU gene with a CFR610-and BHQ-2-labeled detection probe (DiaSorin Molecular LLC, Cypress, California) on the commercially available LIAISON MDX thermocycler. Use of this platform for the detection of P jirovecii DNA has only been described in 1 prior report and showed a high sensitivity and negative predictive value when compared to a P jirovecii immunofluorescence assay on BAL samples from immunocompromised patients [22] .",

Early and accurate diagnosis of PJP is crucial for favorable outcomes and prevention of inappropriate therapy and offtarget antibiotic adverse events among vulnerable patients [23] . In the present study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance and clinical use of the DiaSorin Molecular PCR platform in patients suspected to have PJP. We analyzed a total of 1006 results representing unique treatment decision opportunities among 785 patients during an 18-month period. Clinical use of the DiaSorin Molecular P jirovecii PCR assay played a major role in decisions to treat or discontinue treatment for PJP at our intuitions. Comparisons to pathology results found PCR testing to have a moderate positive predictive value and high negative predictive value, and lower C T values were highly predictive of positive pathology results. Several studies report the diagnostic performance of P jirovecii PCR with varying reference standards. A study of 448 HIV-negative immunocompromised patients found PCR to be 100% sensitive and 90.0% specific in induced sputum and 84.0% sensitive and 92.2% specific in BAL fluid with respect to indirect fluorescent antibody staining [10] .

In our cohort, 14 patients were started on treatment after the PCR result was reported and either had negative pathology or did not have a pathology result. Without PCR, these represent likely missed cases (the clinical team would likely not have treated the patient without the positive PCR result). There were also 27 cases without pathology or with negative pathology where the PCR result and treatment initiation occurred on the same day, and therefore it was more difficult to speculate whether treatment would have been initiated if PCR was not available as a diagnostic tool. We interpreted these as possible missed cases. A negative PCR result in 35 of 126 (27.8%) patients who were initiated on treatment suggests that PCR facilitated discontinuation of empiric antimicrobials. The primary therapeutic agent of PJP is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Its use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal intolerance, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, leukopenia, and allergic reactions [24] . Hence, limiting inappropriate therapy, especially among immunocompromised patients on polypharmacy, is of great value.",

            "text": "It has been proposed that quantitative PCR, by characterizing fungal burden in a respiratory specimen, may be a discriminator of active disease from colonization. A small number of studies have described the direct use of C T values or quantitative estimation of organism number derived through reference standards [6] [7] [8] [9] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . An overview of these studies and the assays utilized [25] [26] [27] [28] is shown in Supplementary Table 3 . Collectively, these analyses are problematic: Cutoff values vary by several orders of magnitude between studies, and even those studies with good internal consistency often require identification of 2 separate cutoff values (1 with high sensitivity and 1 with high specificity). Only 1 of the studies we identified had analyzed C T values from a commercially available assay [6] . Furthermore, recent experience with SARS-CoV-2 shows that C T values can vary significantly between and within methods, as demonstrated by a survey of 700 laboratories using SARS-CoV-2 proficiency testing material produced from the same batch, where within a single gene target for a single method, up to 12.0 cycle differences were seen across all laboratories [29] . The totality of this literature highlights the barriers to standardization across platforms and institutions.",

First, test performance of C T values relative to pathology demonstrated that low CT values are highly predictive of a positive pathology result (Figure 2A and 2B). Second, comparisons by t test revealed significant difference in distribution of C T values from deep respiratory specimens with respect to treatment decision, although there was significant overlap. There was not significant difference in this comparison among sputum and ET aspirate specimens. Further comparisons with indicators of disease severity did not exhibit statistically significant differences. For example, while deep respiratory specimens with C T values <25 all had imaging suggestive of PJP, many high C T values were observed in patients with suggestive imaging while sputum/ET aspirate specimens included a few specimens near or below 25 without suggestive imaging. This illustrates that C T values must be interpreted with caution.",

While lower C T values might be expected in individuals with more severe PJP, other processes causing respiratory failure, imaging features compatible with PJP, or prompting the use of steroids can confound these results. Meanwhile, specimen collection has inherent variability and can impact C T value results. For example, fungal concentration in a liquid specimen, which would influence C T values, is influenced by sampling technique and sample preparation. Lavage or bronchial brushing may exert different mechanical forces on the lower airways, resulting in differing yield. Fluid volume likely also influences fungal recovery as BAL technique can range from tens to hundreds of milliliters and inadequate volume may compromise recovery, whereas excess volume may dilute fungal organism and therefore influence C T value. Sputum is produced by an inherently different process (which is why it is not compared to bronchoscopy-derived samples in this study) and may differ based on patient effort, age, and underlying lung disease and can be contaminated with saliva. Other preanalytical factors-time from collection to analysis during which DNA could degrade and sample storage conditions-as well as when in the clinical course a specimen is obtained (especially if empiric treatment has been administered) and degree of host immune suppression also likely influence organism burden and impact the C T value.",

We do not present diagnostic performance with respect to clinical treatment decision because this is inherently flawed and may be influenced by clinician knowledge of the C T value (which is occasionally requested by the infectious diseases consultant) and the experience or expertise of the clinical teams making a treatment decision.
