Preference signaling allows applicants to assign virtual \"tokens'' to their most desired employers, providing applicants the opportunity to communicate their interest, and employers the ability to focus their attention on these most \"serious\" applicants. 10 While used by the American Economic Association since 2006, PS only recently gained attention in the residency application process. It was first proposed in the orthopedics and ENT literature in 2017 and 2018, respectively, followed by a promising computer simulation model by ENT in 2019, and implementation by ENT during the 2020-2021 application season. [11] [12] [13] [14] During the 2020-2021 application season, each applicant to ENT was able to assign five allotted tokens to desired programs via the Otolaryngology Program Directors Organization (OPDO) website over a two-week period, after which their list was finalized.

Additionally, it stands to reason that as more applicants receive and accept their most desired interviews (rather than accept offers from lessdesired programs), it would potentially relieve interview congestion, opening earlier interviews to middle-and lower-tier applicants. 13 Similarly, programs could more efficiently assign interview invitations to higher probability matches, potentially reducing interview cancellations. 11 Some reasonable concerns have been raised about PS. Preference signaling may not actually decrease the number of applications from students. 21, 22 By forcing an expression of preference early in the season, PS may disadvantage applicants who may be unclear regarding which programs are a good fit or wish to find their fit in programs during the interview process. Similarly, applicants may change their preferences during the season but would not have the opportunity to reassign their tokens. Programs may hold bias against applicants that do not assign them a token, potentially causing these programs to disregard applicants who may be a strong fit for their environment. Additionally, tokens are valuable due to their scarcity and may be unintentionally devalued by programs that receive a disproportionate number of tokens. It is also worth mentioning that there may be unforeseen challenges or consequences with the PS model for both applicants and programs that have yet to be discovered.",

While ENT suggests applicants divide tokens between \"reach\" programs and programs for which they are competitive, economics research suggests it is ideal to use all tokens on programs where an applicant is competitive. 10, 24 Finally, it has been suggested that a continuous-variable system may be more ideal than the current binary PS system, allowing applicants to signal degree of preference in a program by dividing 100 points among prospective programs (eg, all 100 to one program or 20 for each of five programs). 22 While smaller specialties such as ENT and urology have had success with using their own websites and program director organizations to coordinate PS, we recognize that the much greater number of EM residency programs and applicants to EM may make this exceedingly challenging for the Council of Residency Directors in EM to coordinate and/ or finance. Therefore, we would propose using the ERAS platform, as larger specialties like internal medicine and surgery have opted to do. We also support the ENT model of applicants finalizing signals prior to ERAS application opening for programs, which will allow programs to more effectively allocate time to holistic application review and identify high-yield applicants for interview.",

We recommend exploring interest in PS from all EM residency application stakeholders, continuing to learn from the experiences of ENT, urology, dermatology, internal medicine, and surgery, and investigating methods for potential implementation of a PS pilot in EM for the 2022-2023 application season. While PS may not decrease the raw number of applications, it could address the largest flaw in the current system: the lack of ability for applicants to communicate, and programs to discern, genuine interest. 19 By allowing applicants and programs to understand each other better, we believe that PS has the potential to allow for a more sustainable and equitable match process that might create more ideal matches for all candidates and programs with less friction along the way.",
