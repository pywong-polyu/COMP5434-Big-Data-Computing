No less important is a quick and objective determination of the effectiveness of the prescribed drugs for a given patient. Determination of the lungs functional state is difficult in some cases of pediatric practice (preschool children insufficiently cooperate during the examination), and the results of physical examination by auscultation of the lungs by \u0430 doctor are largely subjective, and sometimes timely auscultation of the lungs by \u0430 doctor is delayed, as, for example, it occurs during the COVID-19 pandemic [2, 3] .",

Computer-aided methods for diagnosing pulmonary diseases are devoid of subjectivity and allow analyzing changes in respiratory sounds, which cannot be detected by the human ear. Changes in the characteristics of the airways caused by various diseases lead to appearance of additional pathological noises, the analysis of which is used in development of computer-aided methods for the diagnostics of pulmonary diseases [6, 7, 12] . Respiratory sounds, accompanying broncho-obstructive syndrome can be characterized by the appearance / amplification of a set of periodic waves with a fundamental frequency in the range from 100 Hz to 2500 Hz. In works [8, 9] it is indicated that the fundamental frequency lies between 100 Hz and 1000 Hz and between 400 Hz and 1600 Hz, respectively. At the same time, the dominant frequency of wheezing is above 400 Hz, while of wet wheezing it is about 200 Hz and less [9, 10] . The breathing of patients with asthma is characterized by wheezing sounds in the expiratory phase, the wheezing duration is in the range from 80 ms to 250 ms. Using these features of respiratory sounds of patients with asthma, the methods of computer-aided diagnostics of broncho-obstructive syndrome in children were developed [4, 5, 11] . These methods are based on an automated comparison of the Fourier spectra of respiratory sounds of the healthy and asthmatic children and demonstrate high diagnostic values (AUV varies from 0.783 to 0.895). One cannot exclude variability of this sound phenomenon depending on the personal characteristics of a patient with bronchial asthma (age, sex, stage of disease, individual characteristics of physical development).",

An alternative approach could be the following: to develop diagnostic methods based on machine learning and deep machine learning techniques. Recently, the studies of the possibility of applying such methods in various fields of medicine have been actively carried out (see [12, 13, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and references therein). At present, there is a large number of machine learning methods that allows creating decision-making algorithms suitable for a given situation and able to solve various tasks, including medical ones (e.g., classification of various types of cancer [18] , analysis of the effectiveness of dialysis [18] , diagnosis of pulmonary diseases [12, 13, 20, 36] ). Machine learning methods are proposed to be widely used, in particular, in pulmonology: for sorting patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [21] , for automatic classification of respiratory sound spectra in patients with pulmonary diseases [22] , for diagnosis of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [23] and ranking of clinical assessments in children with asthma [24] . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

At solution of the regression problems, the mathematical relationship between a function and an argument (or arguments) is restored. \u0422he solution of the clustering problem, which refers to automatic learning, without user / programmer interference (unsupervised learning), it is designed to divide the data into certain categories according to the selected common features. When solving clustering problems, the number of categories, which will be obtained as a result, is unknown. In the case of automatic diagnostics, it is necessary to solve classification problems, which are similar in formulation to clustering problems, but at the same time, the number of categories is known in advance. The main problem comes down to choosing the most efficient algorithm, which allows achieving the maximum accuracy for the test dataset. The purpose of solving classification problems is to assign a phenomenon or parameter to a specific category, in our case, to establish the correspondence of the respiratory sound to a healthy volunteer or a patient with bronchial asthma. The difficulty in choosing an algorithm lies in the fact that there is a large number of different algorithms for solving clustering problems, and each of them is better suited for some particular class of problems.",

Thus, when an input signal comes to a neuron, as a result of simple mathematical operations, a decision is made which neuron will be the next to be activated. Thus, the procedure reaches the last stage (the last neuron), the result of which will coincide with one of the categories into which the input data should be divided as a result of solving the problem. In our case, the input data are the digital recordings of respiratory sounds. The recordings are divided into two categories at the output: healthy and sick. In addition to the above noted advantages of the neural networks over the random forest method, it is worth mentioning that a trained neural network can fairly quickly work on relatively low-power computers [27] . The latter advantage of networks is important for development of methods of computer-aided diagnostics in real time, remote screening diagnostics and monitoring of the patient condition, as well as for development of outside medical diagnostics and condition monitoring (for example, parental control over the child condition; the result of such monitoring should be recommendation to visit a doctor in time).",

These characteristics can subsequently be used to train the neural network and develop methods for express analysis. The Fourier spectrum of respiratory sounds of asthmatic patients contains frequency ranges, in which the amplitudes of harmonics significantly exceed the amplitudes in the spectrum of healthy patients (see, for example, Fig. 4 in [3] and Fig. 3 in [10] ). There is a periodic manifestation of such an increase in time. The duration of such amplifications is about 200 ms (see, for example, Fig. 5 in [3] ). This allows one to visually distinguish the respiratory sounds of sick and healthy persons. Note that asthmatic disease is often accompanied by an increase in respiratory rate. These differences between the characteristics of the respiratory sounds of the patients and the healthy volunteers allowed us to choose the following parameters for training the neural network: spectral bandwidth, spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate, spectral roll-off and chromaticity. Our results have shown that a set of these parameters is sufficient for constructing and training a network, application of which makes it possible to achieve a high level of reliability of computer-aided diagnostics.",

The same parameters can be used in the diagnostics of bronchial asthma disease in different stages (exacerbation, remission, incomplete remission). This can be explained as follows: bronchial asthma is characterized by obstruction and inflammation, which affect all airways from the central to the peripheral parts of the tracheobronchial tree (small bronchi) [35] . These pathological changes in the airways lead to variations in respiratory sounds and changes in the amplitude-frequency characteristic of sounds and to appearance of additional harmonics in the Fourier spectra. The use of drugs reduces inflammation and expands the airways; the patient comes in the incomplete remission or remission stage of the disease. Although at these stages the external signs of the disease (shortness of breath, dyspnea, rapid breathing) may not be observed, lung function is not fully restored that is reflected in the characteristics of respiratory sound. Moreover, the manifestation of pathological processes in respiratory sounds of patients in remission stage may be more pronounced than in the sounds of the patients during exacerbation. Thus, the energy of the pathological respiratory sounds in the remission stage may be higher than the energy during the exacerbation (Fig. 1) . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

The proposed method can be used to diagnose and monitor the health state of children under 5 years of age, for whom it is difficult to conduct physical examination and spirometry, to diagnose patients in remote areas and to quickly diagnose patients outside the hospital as well as be applied in telemedicine.",
