            "text": "High-performance textiles have significant potential in marketing nano-based functional commodities, such as antibacterial and self-cleaning textiles [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . These nano-based functional textiles can be accomplished by the immobilization of metal and/or metal oxide nanoparticles onto the fabric surface during the finishing process. The great prospects of metal nanoparticles can be effectively employed to provide multifunctional stimulation without deteriorating the exterior properties or negatively affecting the native features of the fibers [6] . Various studies were explored for the usage of Ag 0 , TiO 2 , and ZnO nanoparticles as agents for textile surface modification to provide smart fibers with a variety of distinctive properties, like ultraviolet blocking, self-cleaning, and antibacterial activity [7] [8] [9] . Different techniques were described recently to tie TiO 2 nanoparticles into the fiber surface to present self-cleanable products [10] . The photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 nanoparticles upon irradiation with a UN supply was described. The exposure of TiO 2 nanoparticles to UV (\u03bb < 388 nm) results in stimulating the electrons of the valence band into the other conduction one to generate holes (h + ) and electrons (e \u2212 ). Those reactive entities showed a major role in the commencement of a reduction-oxidation course [11] . TiO 2 nanoparticles have been reported as a high-quality substance in photocatalysis under irradiation with an ultraviolet supply owing to its satisfactory optical properties, chemical/physical stability, non-toxicity, and cheapness [12, 13] . Nonetheless, some weakness was linked to the use of TiO 2 nanoparticles, such as an elevated band-gap (Eg = 3.2 eV). In addition, TiO 2 nanoparticles can be excited only under irradiation with an ultraviolet supply (\u03bb < 388 nm) to release electrons to conduction band departing holes to the other valence one, limiting their photocatalytic activity under visible or sunlight. Furthermore, the high recombination rate between holes and electrons on TiO 2 nanoparticles results in less effective photocatalysis [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

            "text": "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been applied as an antimicrobial agent onto a variety of textile substrates in the absence of UV light [14, 15] . However, silver nanoparticles can simply influence the colorimetric properties of the treated textile surface by oxidation into the brownish AgO or by aggregation into bigger black microparticles. In addition, silver is a costly metal, and small amounts are ineffective for a variety of realistic products. In order to accomplish the advantageous effects from both Ag 0 and TiO 2 nanoparticles and reduce their weaknesses, Ag/TiO 2 composites were developed by producing AgNPs onto TiO 2 nanoparticles, employing a variety of methods to enhance the photocatalytic and antimicrobial properties. The deposition of AgNPs can significantly improve the light-induced catalytic activity of TiO 2 nanoparticles. This could be ascribed to the ability of AgNPs to trap electrons at Schottky bar at each contact area of Ag/TiO 2 [16] [17] [18] [19] . This results in a decrease in the recombination effect between electrons and holes on the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Thus, separating the charge was stimulated and the transfer of electrons took place to result in a higher life-time of hole/electron pairs [20] [21] [22] .",

The improvement of the antimicrobial properties of viscose has been critical for a variety of healthcare purposes. Therefore, various techniques have been reported to improve the antimicrobial properties of viscose fibers [23] . The weak binding of the colloidal nanoparticles to viscose fibers has been a substantial problem that can be overwhelmed by plasma treatment [24] . Plasma curing by etching was employed to activate the fibrous surfaces to induce the creation of polar groups, such as carbonyl, alcohol, carboxyl, and ether, facilitating better binding to nano-scaled particles [5, 25] . Herein, we report the synthesis of TiO 2 NPs and Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposites as antibacterial and photocatalytic agents and their immobilization onto the surface of viscose fibers via a pad-dry-cure procedure to introduce multifunctional textiles. The morphologies and elemental compositions were evaluated by different analytical techniques. The performance of the Ag/TiO 2 -coated viscose fibers showed an improved efficiency compared with TiO 2coated viscose fibers.",

The absorption spectra of TiO 2 and Ag 0 /TiO 2 showed broad absorbance bands with a wavelength maxima <400 nm. This can be attributed to the electron transition in TiO 2 depending on its energy band gap (~3.12 eV) owing to a charge transfer. The absorbance spectral curves of TiO 2 were enhanced in Ag 0 /TiO 2 . Obvious variations in absorbance activity of Ag 0 /TiO 2 were detected in the visible spectrum range as a result of the weak Plasmon effect owing to the low Ag 0 content on TiO 2 NPs. This could enhance both surface excitation and electron/hole separation. The absorbance band of Ag 0 /TiO 2 demonstrated that Ag 0 /TiO 2 exhibits properties similar to TiO 2 NPs. The absorbance intensities were observed to exhibit a red shift for Ag 0 /TiO 2 , representing a decrease in TiO 2 gap. The absorbance spectra showed maximum absorbance wavelengths at 383 and 388 nm for TiO 2 and Ag 0 /TiO 2 , respectively.

This can be attributed to the electron transition in TiO2 depending on its energy band gap ( ~ 3.12 eV) owing to a charge transfer. The absorbance spectral curves of TiO2 were enhanced in Ag 0 /TiO2. Obvious variations in absorbance activity of Ag 0 /TiO2 were detected in the visible spectrum range as a result of the weak Plasmon effect owing to the low Ag 0 content on TiO2 NPs. This could enhance both surface excitation and electron/hole separation. The absorbance band of Ag 0 /TiO2 demonstrated that Ag 0 /TiO2 exhibits properties similar to TiO2 NPs. The absorbance intensities were observed to exhibit a red shift for Ag 0 /TiO2, representing a decrease in TiO2 gap. The absorbance spectra showed maximum absorbance wavelengths at 383 and 388 nm for TiO2 and Ag 0 /TiO2, respectively. This monitored shift in the wavelength and the reduced band gap led to the increase in the light-induced catalytic activity of TiO2 NPs in the visible range. ",

Thus, MTC is a suitable model to investigate the photo-induced catalysis process. The self-cleaning performance of TiO 2 or Ag 0 /TiO 2 deposited onto viscose fibers could be studied by testing the decomposition of MTC underneath UV and visible lights, as shown in Figure 6 . Ultraviolet/visible absorption spectral curves of MTC were collected for the treated viscose under irradiation with UV and visible light over 24 h. The absorbance peak at 665 nm decreased as a result of the degradation of MTC. The self-cleaning activity was tested by exploring the total content (C/C 0 ) of MTC as a function of time. The degradation of MTC on the uncoated fibers showed almost no variations under irradiation with either UV or visible daylight to prove that the uncoated fibers do not exhibit any light-induced decay ability. The deposition of TiO 2 NPs onto plasma-activated fibers proved an improvement in photoinduced degradation of MTC under UV light. However, this photo-induced degradation of MTC was incomplete. The deposition of TiO 2 onto plasma-pretreated fibers displayed a negligible photo-induced degradation under visible light owing to the adsorption and diffusion of MTC within the coated viscose. The integration of the nanocomposite into the plasma-pretreated fibers induced a total photoinduced degradation of MTC under ultraviolet and visible light, as the blue shade was monitored neither on the coated fibers nor in solution to prove a complete photo-induced degradation of MTC. The photo-induced degradation of MTC for fibers coated with Ag 0 /TiO 2 demonstrated improved activity in comparison with TiO 2 NPs, proposing that the inclusion of AgNPs onto the surface of TiO 2 is an efficient approach. The photo-induced degradation rate for TiO 2 and Ag 0 /TiO 2 coated onto viscose fibers decreased with washing. Nonetheless, they persisted higher than the plasma-inactivated viscose fibers. This proposed higher adhesion of particles onto plasma-activated viscose. After washing, the light-induced decay of methylthioninium chloride (MTC) for Ag 0 /TiO 2 deposited onto viscose fibers was lower than the case of the viscose fibers coated with TiO 2 under visible/UV light. Thus, the nanocomposite enhanced the self-cleaning activity of viscose as a beneficial effect of silver on the light-induced catalysis of TiO 2 . ",

The absorbance peak at 665 nm decreased as a result of the degradation of MTC. The self-cleaning activity was tested by exploring the total content (C/C0) of MTC as a function of time. The degradation of MTC on the uncoated fibers showed almost no variations under irradiation with either UV or visible daylight to prove that the uncoated fibers do not exhibit any light-induced decay ability. The deposition of TiO2 NPs onto plasma-activated fibers proved an improvement in photo-induced degradation of MTC FT-IR spectra of coated viscose fibers.",
