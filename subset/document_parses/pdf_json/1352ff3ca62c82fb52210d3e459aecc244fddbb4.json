However, we lack effective biomarkers to predict the mortality of critically ill patients with AKI. Few studies have investigated the association between lactate dehydrogenase levels and mortality in patients with AKI. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study with large samples, using a large database, the Multi parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care III project. Clinical and demographic data were collected from the database by structure query language. Multiple models were constructed by stepwise methods to examine the association between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and in-hospital mortality. The predictive performance of LDH was assessed by ROC analysis and p values were calculated for trends. Results In the final analysis, 8436 patients met the inclusion criteria, and 1519 patients died during their hospital stay. The mortality rate increased with increasing LDH levels. The association between LDH and in-hospital mortality was almost linear (p < 0.001). A multiple logistic regression model indicated that LDH level was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.56, 95% CI (1.39-1.73), p < 0.001) and this effect remained stable in the subgroup analysis. Moreover, the combined AUC of LDH and SAPSII was 0.83. Conclusions The LDH level, which can be easily assessed, is significantly and independently associated with in-hospital mortality, and could increase the predictive ability of SAPSII for in-hospital mortality in our study.",

Moreover, the persistent loss of renal function may increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) [2] . Among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), nearly 60% of critically ill patients may suffer from AKI during their ICU stay, and approximately 12% require renal replacement therapy (RRT) [3] . In particular, the mortality of septic patients with AKI may increase to 45-60% [4] . Because of the high incidence of AKI and high patient mortality, it is essential to find effective predictors of in-hospital mortality, especially for patients in the ICU.",

Subsequently, we developed three multivariate models, and factors were entered into our models by stepwise methods. After adjusting for many relevant factors, the LDH level was still an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI. There were no significant interactions in any strata in the subgroup analysis, and the association between the LDH value and in-hospital mortality was linear. Moreover, the combination of LDH and SAPSII could predict in-hospital mortality more effectively than each single variables. All these findings show that LDH can be an effective tool to predict the prognosis of AKI patients in the ICU.",

In addition, previous studies have shown that LDH levels may increase in patients with malignant tumors and that it can be considered a good predictor of prognosis in patients with gastric cancer [23] . Furthermore, LDH has long been considered a predictor of disease severity, as it has high morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.
