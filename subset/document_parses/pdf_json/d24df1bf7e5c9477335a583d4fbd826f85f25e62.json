Contributing factors were the increased immune evasion by the variant, 1 and the passage of more than four months since most adults had received their third vaccine dose. In an effort to address the challenges presented by the Omicron variant and to reduce the load on the healthcare system, Israeli authorities approved on January 2, 2022 the administration of a fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine to persons who were 60 years of age or older, as well as to high-risk populations and health-care workers. The real-world effectiveness of the fourth dose in decreasing the rate of confirmed infection and severe illness remains unclear. Here, we use data from the Israeli Ministry of Health national database to study the effectiveness of the fourth dose against confirmed infection and severe illness.",

The treatment group was composed of participants for whom 12 days or more elapsed from receipt of the fourth dose. The first control group included individuals who were eligible for a fourth dose but had not yet received it. As this natural control group might differ from the treatment group by unmeasured confounding variables, a second control group was defined as individuals for whom 3-7 days had passed since receiving the fourth dose. This control group included the same individuals as the treatment group, but at times when the fourth dose was not expected to be effective. The time of onset of severe Covid-19 was assigned to be the date of the test confirming infection. Data was retrieved on January 29, 2022, eight days after the end of the study period, allowing at least 7 full days of follow-up time for the development of severe illness. To allow for the same followup for all individuals, we considered participants to have severe illness if they were hospitalized in severe condition within seven days of their confirmed infection.",

Since incidences of both confirmed infection and severe illness increased rapidly during January 2022, days at the beginning of the study period had lower exposure risk compared to days at the end. Moreover, the fraction of the population in each dynamic cohort also changed throughout the study period ( Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Therefore, we included calendar date as an additional covariate to account for growing exposure risk. 5 For each outcome, we estimated the incidence rate in three groups of participants: eligible individuals who had not received the fourth dose, individuals for whom 3-7 days had passed since receiving the fourth dose, and individuals for whom 12 days or more had passed since receiving the fourth dose. We calculated two incidence rate ratios for each outcome. First, we compared the group of eligible individuals who did not receive the fourth dose with the group of individuals for whom 12 days or more had passed since receiving the fourth dose. Second, we compared the group of individuals for whom 3-7 days had passed since receiving the fourth dose with the group of individuals for whom 12 days or more had passed since receiving the fourth dose. In addition, adjusted rate differences per 100,000 person days during the study period were calculated in a way similar to that used by Bar-On et al. 5 Confidence intervals were calculated by exponenting the 95% confidence intervals for the regression coefficients without adjustment for multiplicity.

Nevertheless, the results presented here indicate that a fourth dose is still able to provide added protection against confirmed infection and severe illness with Omicron compared to three vaccine doses that were given at least four months previously. The incidence rate for confirmed infection was lower by a factor of two, and the rate of severe disease by a factor of four in people who received the fourth dose 12 days or more previously compared to eligible individuals who did not receive the fourth dose. While our main analysis relates only to people aged 60 years and older, an additional analysis performed for select groups of people aged 20-59 showed similar results for protection against confirmed infections (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).",

For severe illness, differences in the prevalence of comorbidities could potentially affect the results, but are not recorded in the national database. To address some of these biases, we compared the rate of confirmed infection and severe illness within the group of people who received the fourth dose. Specifically, the rate of confirmed infections and severe illness on days 3-7 following vaccination, before the vaccine is expected to take effect, 5 was compared to the rate 12 days or more after vaccination. The rate ratios obtained were very similar to those obtained when comparing the latter group to people who did not receive the fourth dose. Thus, the results appear to be robust to the selection of people who opted to receive the fourth dose. Figure 2 that compares the rate ratio over time suggests that the protection of the fourth dose continues to increasee beyond day 12, reaching a rate ratio of about 2.5 after 2.5-3 weeks. Longer follow-up will help to evaluate the protection of the fourth dose over longer periods of time.",

First, we performed the analyses using data only from the general Jewish population, since the participants in that group are enriched in the population that received the fourth dose. Second, we included in the model the exposure at the place of residence. The results of these analyses, presented in Table S1 of the Supplementary Appendix, are similar to the results of the main analysis. As discussed in the Supplementary Appendix, the testing policy in Israel was changed before the study period in early January. Under the new guidelines, vaccinated people under the age of 60 who were exposed to a confirmed case or developed symptoms were asked to perform a rapid antigen test at home, and if positive to perform a state-regulated antigen test. The guidelines for the elderly population have not been changed, and they were asked to perform PCR tests, but the change in the under-60s could indirectly affect the testing behavior in the 60+ age group. To test the possible effect of the type of diagnostic test, we repeated the analysis using only positive PCR tests to confirm infections. As shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, using only PCR tests resulted in very minor changes to the estimated level of protection conferred by the fourth dose.

Specifically, the data used for conducting this study included vaccination dates (second and third doses), PCR tests (dates and results), hospital admission dates (if relevant), clinical severity status (severe illness or death), and demographic variables such as age, sex, and demographic group (General Jewish, Arab, ultra-Orthodox Jewish). Severe disease is defined as a resting respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation on room air <94%, or ratio of PaO2 to FiO2 <300. Those who died from COVID-19 during the follow-up period were also counted as severe disease cases in our analysis. The fact that Israel has a central health care system increases the coverage and reliability of the data. A small fraction of the population with missing observations on gender or demographic sector were excluded from our analysis. They comprised \u22480.1% of the total population and were most likely missing those variables at random. We also excluded from the analysis individuals for whom the area of residence was unknown, which amounts to about 2.5% of the total population in the database. As we show in Supplementary Analysis 2, this exclusion has a negligible effect on the results of the analysis. The MOH database comprises data from multiple sources. These include all MOH-approved laboratories performing PCR and antigen testing in Israel, including private laboratories, hospitals and the four Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) that together insure the entire Israeli population.

All sampling laboratories digitally report the data to the MOH database. Turn-around intervals between nasopharyngeal sampling and test result are 48 hours at most and typically within 24 hours. Surveillance of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations is continuously performed by the MOH. Data from all hospitals are updated daily, and often twice a day. In accordance with national guidelines, healthcare providers report all hospitalizations and deaths among individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection. On January 7, 2022, the Israeli ministry of health changed its policy regarding the type of testing people exposed to COVID-19 cases are required to perform to exit quarantine. For vaccinated people above the age of 60, which is the population studied here, policy had not changed. Nevertheless, vaccinated people younger than 60 years of age are no longer required to perform a PCR test but can use an athome or a state-regulated rapid antigen test. If negative, they can avoid entering quarantine. At the same time, due to the rapid increase in the incidence of COVID-19 cases throughout January 2022, PCR testing capacity in Israel became strained, which led more and more people to use state-regulated antigen tests for diagnosis. Even though the testing policy for our study group hasn't changed dramatically, due to the large overall changes in the testing policy, we consider either a positive antigen or a positive PCR test as a confirmed infection.",

It is probable that with increasing incidence of COVID-19, followed by long waiting times in testing facilities, more people have opted to perform at-home rapid antigen tests. As these tests are not regulated, it is hard to discern what fraction of the people who test positive in these at-home tests report their positive result or get a PCR confirmatory test. Specifically, we do not know how similar nonreporting rates are between the study groups.",

            "text": "One possible confounder that can affect the results of the analysis is a behavioral difference between the study groups in their tendency to perform tests for diagnosis of infection. On the one hand, it is possible that people who were more recently vaccinated feel more protected against infection and thus would be less likely to get tested in case of exposure. On the other hand, vaccination status itself may be associated with traits such as increased awareness of the pandemic, which could lead people who chose to get the fourth vaccine first to get tested more regularly. To test the possible direction and extent of such between group differences, we calculated the total number of tests performed per 100,000 people in the week between January 16 and January 23, 2022 in two groups of individuals. The first group was defined as eligible individuals who did not receive the fourth dose by January 23, 2022. The second group were individuals who received the fourth dose before January 16. The results, presented in Figure  S2 , indicate that the testing rate in the group of eligible people who did not receive the fourth dose was lower by about 30% than in the group of people who received a fourth dose (\u224817,000 tests per 100,000 compared with \u224822,000). The fraction of rapid antigen tests out to the total tests performed by people who received the fourth dose was 13% compared to 23% in people who received only three doses. In theory, this difference could lead to an underestimate of the effect of the fourth dose in reducing the rate of confirmed infections. We use our secondary analysis, in which both our treatment group and our control group received a fourth dose, as a proxy for the effect of this difference in testing rate between recipients of the fourth dose and those that received only three doses. We obtained very similar results to our primary analysis regarding the level of protection against confirmed infection, suggesting that the effect of testing rate on the results is not substantial.",

First, we performed the same analyses as described in the statistical analysis section using data only from PCR tests without inclusion of state-regulated antigen tests as confirmed infection. Second, the analyses were done using data only on the general Jewish population which had the highest rates of fourth dose vaccination. Third, we analyzed the data while accounting for exposure over time of each individual. This was done by binning the incidence rate per 1000 residents in each area of residence into 10 quantiles and using these quantiles as a covariate. We also fitted the model to individuals aged 20-59 who received the fourth dose (mostly health workers and people with preexisting health conditions). Due to the small number of severe cases in these ages, and since not all individuals in this age group were eligible to receive the fourth dose, we compared the rate of confirmed infection of vaccinees 3-7 days after to 12 days or more after vaccination.
