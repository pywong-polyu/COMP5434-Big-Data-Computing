Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was constructed using our institution's pelvic trauma registry and ambulatory database registry. The study included all elderly pelvic trauma patients and ambulatory outpatients between May 2016 and March 2020 who had a comprehensive geriatric assessment and CT abdomen/pelvis within 1 year from the date of the assessment. Patients were dichotomized in prefrail or frail groups. The study excluded patients with history of metastatic disease or malignancy requiring chemotherapy.",

Each gender population was subdivided into frail (114 female [75%], 51 male [78%]) and prefrail (37 female [25%], 14 male [22%]) patients. CT-imaging-derived diagnosis of osteoporosis (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI: 1.2-5.5) and sarcopenia (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2-5.6) were associated with frailty in females, but did not reach statistical significance in males. BMI and subcutaneous adipose tissue at L3 level were statistically lower in the frail male group compared to the prefrail group. BMI showed strong correlation with the subcutaneous area at the L3 level in both genders (Spearman's coefficient of 0.8, p < 0.001). Hypoalbuminemia and visceral obesity were not associated with frailty in either gender. Conclusion This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of using CT-derived body-composition parameters as a screening tool for frailty, which can offer an opportunity for early medical intervention.",

Frailty approximates patient's biologic age-an active rate at which body is aging-which may be more relevant to the clinical practice compared to the chronological age. Frail patients display increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, which have been shown to be independent of age, comorbidity, and disability [2] [3] [4] [5] . Frailty comes at a high cost to society, as frail patients are at increased risk of fractures, more likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility, more likely to be readmitted within 30 days, and have higher rates of postoperative mortality and complications compared to their robust elderly peers [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

Briefly, determination of patient's frailty state was based on the reviewer's clinical judgment upon completion of a comprehensive geriatric assessment, which among other factors assessed patient's movement status, function, thought process, medication use, social history, and personal assessment of health, with frequent corroborative information from the relatives and caretakers. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was used to assess patient's clinical frailty status until 2018 Fig. 1 a Axial CT imaging slice at L3 vertebral level taken from a CT abdomen-pelvis with b corresponding color-coded total cross-sectional area of the muscle (red), visceral (yellow), and subcutaneous (green) adipose tissue which was determined by the automated machine learning segmentation model developed at our institution at our institution. CFS represented a qualitative approach of summarizing the key points of comprehensive geriatric assessment and was primarily based on the deficits in the functional category of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Starting year 2018, CSF has been replaced by the frailty index (FI) score at our institution, which instead of qualitative assessment provided quantitative measurement of all of the patient's deficits and believed to be the best tool in relaying patient's frailty status [15] . In these instances, the numeric value of FI score was converted to CFS using established conversion criteria [23] . Using CFS, patients were stratified into the well, prefrail, mild, moderate, and severely frail groups (Fig. 2) . When dichotomizing groups, well and prefrail patients were grouped into prefrail group, and the rest of the patients were grouped into the frail group.",

            "text": "It has been well known that sarcopenia and osteoporosis, as determined by traditional methods of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, are prevalent in frail patients [30] [31] [32] [33] . To our knowledge, this is the first study to date to assess CTderived body composition profile in patients with a clinical diagnosis of frailty or prefrailty as determined by a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Our results demonstrated that osteoporosis and sarcopenia, as determined by CTderived body composition analysis, were common in both genders and might be able to discern frail patients from prefrail patients, especially in females where the relationship between frailty and sarcopenia or osteoporosis reached statistical significance. These relationships did not reach statistical significance in males, most likely due to a smaller cohort size. Interestingly, although visceral obesity was not associated with frailty in both groups, BMI and subcutaneous adipose tissue at L3 level were statistically significantly lower in male frail group compared to the prefrail group, and BMI showed strong correlation with subcutaneous area at L3 level in both genders. Assessment of frailty is important for both clinical and health care policy-making purposes. In trauma, frailty assessment may lead to identification of patients at risk for adverse outcomes should a surgical procedure be performed. For instance, frailty has been shown to be significantly associated with mortality in a large cohort of emergency general surgery admission including both high-and low-risk procedures, raising the importance of preoperative frailty assessment [34] . Assessment of frailty has gained a particular importance during COVID-19 pandemic where the possibility of rationing resources such as ventilator machines has been discussed. Frailty was highlighted as an important tool to address this possibility due to its predictive power of disease outcome which was superior compared to age or comorbidities alone [35] . In terms of health care policy, knowledge of the prevalence of frailty in a given community may play a role in resource distribution, such as funding of the geriatrics department and tailoring range of services available.",

Given that elderly patients with a complex medical profile or trauma history frequently undergo CT examinations, with ongoing annual growth in CT imaging utilization, it is likely that CT imaging will be much more available than a geriatric appointment [37] . Utilization of information gathered from CT imaging already available in a patient's medical chart represents an attractive strategy for flagging patients at risk for frailty who may benefit from a comprehensive geriatric evaluation, and thus be of a significant benefit to society at no additional cost. On a larger scale, this study serves as a gateway to personalized medicine. It may be viewed as a window to peer to the possibilities of using CT-derived markers of body composition to assess patient's well-being and supplement radiology reports with additional information that may alter patient's treatment or qualify patient for a geriatric workup and assistance with activities of daily living. This analysis will be attributed to the radiologist interpreting the study and will be integrated with the final report, which will provide valuable information regarding patient's health at no extra cost. Further, such information highlights the important role of radiology in the field of medicine and patient care and solidifies its relationship with the field of orthopedics and geriatrics.",

For example, the median SMI for both frail women and men corresponded to approximately 25th percentile or lower of the age-matched SMI reference curve obtained in a recent population study employing automated CT-derived body composition analysis where patients with a diagnosis or major cardiovascular disease or malignancy were excluded from the study [21] . Although the strength between imaging-derived sarcopenia and frailty was reduced when adjusted for age, using this approximation to a relatively healthy adult population, this study suggests that CTderived diagnosis of sarcopenia is common in both frail men and women and will likely serve as a useful screening tool in identifying frail patients and separating them from their healthy peers.",

Ideally, the control group would be composed of age-matched patients who would be classified as very fit, exhibiting no signs of frailty and have corresponding abdominal CT performed within the same time frame. However, such patients do not get routinely evaluated by geriatric services or undergo CT imaging. Future research may include the prospective recruitment of such patients. Frailty also represents a dynamic clinical condition where pathogenesis includes psychological and social functioning in addition to physical functioning [40, 41] . CT-based assessment of frailty can only approximate physical functioning. One should also consider probable limitations imposed by man-made body composition cutoff values, particularly of sarcopenia, which were not vigorously verified across the older populations without cancer. It would also be advantageous to utilize numerical FI score instead of CFS for correlation of frailty with CT-derived markers of body composition once there are enough patients with prospective FI score assignment. Of note, while our current algorithm does not automatically extract bone attenuation, an upgraded version of the model with both automated SMI and bone attenuation information will be more useful.",

Future research is necessary to continue exploring associations between body composition and frailty, and it is likely that a combination of multiple body composition imaging parameters as well as laboratory values and changes in BMI and adipose tissue distribution over time will be necessary for the creation of a sensitive and specific CT imaging-based frailty detection algorithm.",
