As a result, the variety of their combinations and potentially differential effects that they produce remain underexplored. The current study aimed to address this gap in two ways. First, we hypothesized that quantitative job insecurity would manifest in a cumulated form along with qualitative job insecurity but not vice versa. Second, we aimed to test whether different combinations of quantitative and qualitative job insecurity differentially reflect in employees' occupational characteristics and health and well-being outcomes. Latent profile analyses were conducted on two different samples of employees (N = 1077 and N = 608). The findings from both samples supported a three-profile solution of qualitative and quantitative job insecurity resulting in the balanced low, balanced high, and qualitative job insecurity dominant profiles. As expected, the probability of temporary and part-time employment was the highest in the balanced high (i.e., cumulated) job insecurity profile. Moreover, both the balanced high and the qualitative job insecurity dominant profiles were linked to significantly lower mental health and well-being than the low job insecurity profile, suggesting that substantially detrimental effects may occur even if experiencing qualitative job insecurity only.",

            "text": "To elaborate on the above, the current study relies on a psychological perspective on job insecurity, which considers it a subjective perception rather than a purely objective phenomenon. One of the most widely used psychological definitions of job insecurity distinguishes between its qualitative and quantitative dimensions (Hellgren et al. 1999) . Qualitative job insecurity refers to the perceived threat of losing valued features of the job, whereas the quantitative dimension pertains to the anticipated loss of the employment situation as a whole (Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt 1984; Hellgren et al. 1999) . While there is some debate about the perceptual boundaries between these two dimensions (e.g., Probst 2005) , there is no doubt they can go side by side and research usually agrees that they represent different aspects of insecurity in employment relationships (Sender et al. 2017) . Conceptually, the target of quantitative job insecurity is larger in scope, which means that it possibly overarches qualitative job insecurity, so that they are both present in a cumulated form. However, consistent observation of higher mean levels of qualitative than quantitative job insecurity when measured together (Chirumbolo et al. 2017; Tu et al. 2019) suggests that qualitative job insecurity may be relatively more salient and occur rather independently from quantitative job insecurity.",

Only recently, De Cuyper et al. (2019) have offered a rare exception. Their study has revealed the existence of five distinct combinations of job insecurity with differential effects on career outcomes, thereby showing the utility of a person-centered perspective in better understanding job insecurity as a stressor. This line of research certainly merits further elaboration because it can shed new light on the variety of job-insecure situations and their severity as well as their prevalence within the population. Linking them to employees' characteristics that pertain to occupational instability and further inspecting the scope of their detrimental effects allows for a better detection of high-risk employee groups, which is relevant both in theory and in practice.",

First, it aimed to test whether different person-centric combinations of quantitative and qualitative job insecurity (i.e., latent profiles) identified by De Cuyper (2019) could be empirically justified and replicated. Second, it additionally hypothesized that the two insecurity dimensions might be not mutually inclusive in their manifestation (i.e., quantitative job insecurity usually also implies qualitative job insecurity, but the latter might occur on its own). Third, it sought to expand on the investigated correlates testing how different job insecurity profiles link to objective occupational characteristics and selected well-being outcomes (i.e., work engagement, exhaustion, and mental health). Objective \"instability\" characteristics are important to investigate because they may determine the occurrence of job insecurity (e.g., Keim et al. 2014; Shoss 2017 ) that is considered a labor market vulnerability , whereas the above-mentioned well-being outcomes are key indicators of employee thriving versus strain and have been commonly associated with job insecurity (Probst 2002; Sverke et al. 2002; Vander Elst et al. 2014 a and b) . We thus contribute to the stressor-strain literature by examining how well different job insecurity profiles (versus separate dimensions) differentiate between situations with ranging employee precarity and testing whether there is any evidence that the most extreme profiles that are high on both dimensions produce cumulative negative effects.",

            "text": "The distinction between qualitative and quantitative job insecurity was introduced in the early works of Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt (1984) and was further elaborated by Hellgren et al. (1999) . Currently, it is one of the most widely adopted conceptualizations of job insecurity 1 used in numerous psychological studies. However, despite the definition of job insecurity as a multidimensional phenomenon, to date, most attention has been given to its quantitative dimension that refers to the loss of the job as such . Scholars have argued that due to uncertainty about the future and powerlessness to change the situation, a threat of unemployment (i.e., quantitative job insecurity) is a severe work stressor with a host of detrimental outcomes for both employees and their organizations (Probst 2002; Sverke et al. 2002) . Qualitative job insecurity, on the other hand, seems to be a milder form of insecurity, as it does not imply the job loss but rather some unwanted changes in it or the loss of its valued features (Hellgren et al. 1999) . Nevertheless, it is considered a particularly relevant aspect of job insecurity in today's changing world of work (Lee et al. 2018) . It has been shown to trigger a wide range of detrimental effects on employee attitudes and behaviors with similar underlying psychological mechanisms as those of quantitative job insecurity (Stynen et al. 2015; Vander Elst et al. 2014a and b) . The current literature unequivocally recognizes that both job insecurity dimensions separately represent a risk for employees' and organizational well-being (see Shoss 2017 for a recent overview). However, it rarely takes into account that, when analyzed jointly, quantitative and qualitative job insecurity define a situational scenario that can encompass either one or both dimensions to a varying degree, and thus may vary in its precarity from person to person. This is an important moment to inspect from a strain-stressor point of view. Conservation of Resources Theory (Hobfoll 2001) is often used to explain the detrimental nature of job insecurity by resource depletion that is at the core of strain experience. Both continuous employment (the subject of quantitative job insecurity) and valued features of the job (the subject of qualitative job insecurity) can be thought of as resources that employees aim to maintain and protect. Yet, they represent separate forms of resources, which implies that strain and precarity may add up when they are threatened altogether. Such situation requires much more effort to cope with and leaves less space to rely on other available resources to keep things in balance (e.g., in the case of qualitative job insecurity, one may still invest in the future of one's job, but this is obviously not possible if both forms of insecurity are present). For this reason, we are in need of a better understanding of how the two aspects of job insecurity may combine into a unique personal experience and what implications it bears for occupational precarity and well-being.",

Some indirect evidence comes from studies that have included both dimensions measured on the same scale. Many of them have observed slightly higher mean levels of qualitative than quantitative job insecurity (Chirumbolo et al. 2017; ). This offers a data-driven suggestion that situations of qualitative job insecurity may occur on their own (i.e., quantitative job insecurity can remain low even if qualitative job insecurity is high). On the other hand, vice versa is not necessarily true as the two dimensions are arguably not isolated from one another. As maintained by Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt (1984) and more recently reemphasized by De Witte (2015), quantitative job insecurity has a wider scope in terms of what is lost. Hence, in theory, whenever a person experiences quantitative job insecurity, it should come with qualitative job insecurity because the loss of employment often implies the loss of all valued features of the current job.",

This is a notable finding because it marks one of the first attempts to explicitly investigate how the two job insecurity dimensions come into effect and suggests that at some point they converge. However, sequential effects only partially address the questions raised above. They demonstrate an overall tendency for qualitative job insecurity to follow quantitative job insecurity from a variable-centric perspective but do not inform about the severity of such situation for a given person. To do so, we need to know how elevated job insecurity was at the moment when its two aspects (co-)occurred. Hence, in order to truly understand job insecurity as a cumulative stressor, it may be useful to take a closer look into the different level patterns of these co-occurrences for they may considerably vary from person to person.",

            "text": "A person-centered analytic approach represents a group of methods that share a key feature of assuming population heterogeneity. Latent profile analysis (LPA) is one such method aimed at identifying latent (i.e., directly unobserved) subpopulations or profiles within a population based on the patterns of the investigated set of theoretically related, yet distinct variables (Howard & Hoffman 2018; Zyphur 2009 ). While various clustering methods are certainly not new in psychology, compared to traditional clustering analyses LPA treats individual profile membership as an unobserved categorical variable, with a varying degree of probability of belonging to a given profile (Spurk et al. 2020) . It is considered an ideal technique for investigating qualitatively and quantitatively different patterns that may differ in their shape (i.e., the way in which profile indicator variables are configured above or below the sample mean across the profiles) and levels (i.e., the absolute levels of the profile indicator variables; for details see Gabriel et al. 2015; Spurk et al. 2020 ). As such, LPA is capable of yielding important benefits because it offers more specificity than a regression-based approach drawn from a single population (Howard and Hoffman 2018) , and it focuses on the nature of the individual situation rather than separate variables (Zyphur 2009 ). This is particularly applicable to the topic of our current study, where we see a benefit in capturing the most common, empirically justified personal job insecurity situations in terms of combinations of qualitative-quantitative job insecurity, as well as identifying those that are less likely to occur.",

Hence, these analyses offer a completely new insight allowing to see what exactly happens when the two dimensions coincide, irrespective of their sequence. While De Cuyper et al.

However, according to our hypothesis, the reverse would be not true, as by definition high qualitative job insecurity does not necessarily imply the loss of the job itself. In this way, we approach the integration of qualitative and quantitative job insecurity (cf. Chirumbolo et al. 2017 ) from a different point of view by focusing on concurrent combinations of the two dimensions as stated below:",

            "text": "Contextual Covariates To date, a large body of research has been dedicated to the investigation of both situational and psychological correlates of job insecurity. Understanding the context is extremely important for it provides essential information about when and for whom job insecurity is most likely to occur, thereby enabling researchers and practitioners to pinpoint the sources of job insecurity. The literature identifies a number of objective conditions that either predict or covary with job insecurity. Among others, age, tenure, contract type, occupational category, organizational communication, and organizational change experience have been associated with the likelihood of experiencing job insecurity (Keim et al. 2014; N\u00e4swall and De Witte 2003) , whereas age and tenure have also been observed to moderate some of its detrimental outcomes (Cheng and Chan 2008) . However, as already noted above, such studies have largely relied on a variable-centered approach to job insecurity. As a result, the way in which these objective characteristics may relate to different patterns of job insecurity is still not known. In the current study, we aimed to contribute to the existing literature by examining how a set of objective characteristics that reflect some occupational instability-temporary work, part-time contract, and the experience of organizational change-covary with the profiles of qualitative and quantitative job insecurity. Temporary or contingent work is one of the most frequently analyzed aspects of the job contract in job insecurity studies. Despite some findings showing that job insecurity may actually have stronger negative effects for permanent employees (e.g., Bernhard-Oettel et al. 2005; , it is quite unequivocally considered a condition increasing the likelihood of job insecurity Keim et al. 2014; Klandermans et al. 2010) . Hence, we hypothesized that cumulated job insecurity profile(s) would be associated with temporary work. A similar implication may be drawn for organizational change experience, as it is usually seen as one of the main pre-conditions and causes for job insecurity to rise (Ashford et al. 1989; Keim et al. 2014 ). Subsequently, we took part-time versus full-time job into account. The evidence on the role of part-time employment in job insecurity perceptions is somewhat mixed (Bernhard-Oettel et al. 2005; De Witte et al. 2012; N\u00e4swall and De Witte 2003) . However, as it may be indicative of an objectively weaker and thus more vulnerable position in the labor market, and objectively insecure employment status leads to job insecurity (e.g., Klandermans et al. 2010 ), we expected part-time workers to be more represented in the most \"cumulated\" job insecurity profile(s) compared to other profiles.",

            "text": "Well-Being Outcomes Furthermore, we aimed to investigate whether different job insecurity profiles show differential relationships with employee outcomes, as expressed in exhaustion, work engagement, and mental health. Drawing on Conservation of Resources Theory (Hobfoll 2001) , these detrimental outcomes of job insecurity can be inferred due to so-called resource depletion processes. As a severe work stressor, job insecurity poses a threat to the valued status quo. It is then thought to trigger mental or behavioral attempts to restore it that may result in substantial loss of energy, withdrawal behaviors, and health impairment (e.g., Dekker and Schaufeli 1995; Vander Elst et al. 2014a and b) . Furthermore, because quantitative job insecurity implies more loss (Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt 1984) and somewhat encompasses qualitative job insecurity , it may be implied to have stronger detrimental outcomes. Unfortunately, this is only a theoretical implication at the moment, as existing literature comparing the effects of qualitative and quantitative dimensions of job insecurity is still scarce, and those few studies that have attempted to do so yield rather equivocal results. For instance, Hellgren et al. (1999) and Tu et al. (2019) found some support for the differential effects. In the first study, quantitative job insecurity was more strongly associated with employee well-being and the authors suggested that qualitative job insecurity might be primarily related to attitudinal outcomes. The second study reported a stronger relationship between quantitative job insecurity and stress symptoms, while qualitative job insecurity was related to lower work engagement.",

Even if both job insecurity dimensions may be expected to have similar outcomes, they have been shown to have separate negative effects controlling for each other.

A survey method was used to collect the data. It was held in Lithuanian. To this end, all scales were independently translated into the Lithuanian language by three experts. The best translation was then agreed upon by the study authors, which was ultimately double-checked by a linguist for accuracy and grammar. Participants completed the survey through an online platform. Both samples were drawn based on convenience sampling. Participants were contacted either through the HR management staff in their respective organizations or by directly spreading the invitation link to them via the mailing lists available to the authors. Irrespective of the recruitment method, all participants received identical information about the study. Before beginning the survey, they were introduced to the goal of the study and informed that the data would be treated confidentially and analyzed in an aggregate manner only.

During the first stage, exploratory factor analyses (EFA) with Varimax rotation and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were conducted on job insecurity items. These analyses served two purposes. First, they allowed us to check whether qualitative and quantitative job insecurity are separate constructs. Second, we used job insecurity factor scores obtained during the EFA in further analyses. Given that qualitative and quantitative job insecurity are usually quite highly correlated and thus overlap to some extent, their factor scores served as better indicators for latent profile analysis. This initial step was carried out both on the first and on the second (i.e., cross-validation) sample. Subsequently, in the second stage, latent profile analyses (LPA; Lanza et al. 2003) were performed on both samples using MPlus version 7.11. As per guidelines in the literature (Nylund et al. 2007 ), we tested a two-profile solution first, increasing the number of profiles until the optimal solution was reached. Since there are no cut-off values for fit statistics in the LPA, the decision on the final profile solution was made based on a comparison of fit statistics for alternative profile models as well as on the interpretability of the profiles. The following fit statistics were inspected: the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the sample-adjusted BIC (SaBIC), Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (LMR), the Bootstrap Likelihood Ratio Test (BLRT), and entropy. Lower values of the AIC, BIC and SABIC indicate a better fitting model, whereas a non-significant value of the LMR and BLRT tests, obtained after comparing a kprofile model with a k-1 profile model, indicates that a more parsimonious model should be kept. Entropy informs about the classification accuracy, values closer to one indicating that a given profile solution fits better.",

The balanced Note. Sample 1 = initial sample (N = 1077). Sample 2 = cross-validation sample (N = 608) high job insecurity profile compared with the qualitative job insecurity dominant profile was associated with higher probability of having a temporary contract. In terms of work rate, a significant difference was also observed between the balanced high job insecurity profile and the qualitative job insecurity dominant profile, \u03c7 2 (1) = 4.35, p = .037. The balanced high job insecurity profile was associated with a higher probability of having a part-time job. Subsequently, there was a significant difference between the balanced low job insecurity profile and the qualitative job insecurity dominant profile in terms of participants' organizational change experience, \u03c7 2 (2) = 6.77, p = .034. The balanced low job insecurity profile, compared to the qualitative job insecurity dominant profile, was associated with a lower probability of having experienced work-related organizational change and a higher probability of having experienced organizational change that was unrelated to one's work. Probability estimates within the profiles are summarized in Table 4 . The overall between-profile test, however, revealed non-significant results in the expected distribution of temporary employment (\u03c7 2 (2) = 5.34, p = .069), part-time contract (\u03c7 2 (2) = 4.52, p = .104), or organizational change experience (\u03c7 2 (4) = 7.12, p = .130), which may be due to quite different size and variability of the compared profiles. Finally, covariate analyses based on the BCH procedure on sample 2 revealed several differences across the job insecurity profiles in terms of the investigated distal wellbeing outcomes.

For comparison, we may see that qualitative and quantitative job insecurity only interacted in predicting work engagement but not regarding other outcomes. Similar to the LPA results, work engagement was the highest under the low qualitative-low quantitative job insecurity condition and the lowest when qualitative job insecurity was high. However, one should keep in mind that not all combinations depicted in the interaction analysis turned out to be equally realistic. One should be especially careful interpreting the low qualitative-high quantitative job insecurity condition because we know from the LPA that such combination barely exists in our sample (hence, it likely relies on a very small number of subjects). Moreover, no significant interaction was found for mental health as the outcome, whereas a person-centered approach is suggestive of significant differences between the profiles with regard to it.",

In addition, we implied that they might produce more negative effects than any single qualitative job insecurity dimension. In this way, our study enriches the theoretical understanding of job insecurity by testing whether the occurrence of its qualitative and quantitative dimensions is mutually inclusive (i.e., whether for a given person experiencing high levels of one aspect of job insecurity would at the same time imply experiencing elevated levels of the other one). Given only scarce attempts to investigate how these two job insecurity dimensions combine to produce detrimental effects (e.g., Chirumbolo et al. 2017; De Cuyper et al. 2019) , the present study significantly contributes to existing literature. Specifically, we advance on Chirumbolo et al.

We also add on previous latent profile analyses by De Cuyper et al.

Moreover, they estimated the profiles based on correlated job insecurity factor scores, whereas in the current study we aimed to circumvent this issue by using the scores obtained from an orthogonal rotation, which helps to elucidate the differences between qualitative and quantitative job insecurity. A major contribution of our current findings is that they address how the two job insecurity dimensions are intrinsically interwoven, which has not received much attention before. We offer practically relevant evidence about their relative cooccurrence, suggesting that the experience of quantitative job insecurity may be cumulative: It seems to be indispensably accompanied by qualitative job insecurity, whereas the qualitative dimension of job insecurity did occur independently. The size of the qualitative job insecurity dominant and the balanced high job insecurity profiles was rather small in both samples, the balanced low job insecurity profile representing the majority of the study participants. However, we believe that such results correspond to the reality quite well. Both qualitative job insecurity dominant and balanced high job insecurity profiles denote extremities in job insecurity that naturally are observed in a small proportion of the population (De Cuyper et al. 2019; Eurofound 2017) . Somewhat similar findings were also observed by Kinnunen et al.

(2017) study implies that the negative effects of quantitative job insecurity are explained by qualitative job insecurity. The reasoning based on our current findings goes beyond that, offering an explanation for why this may be the case. Specifically, our study hypothesized that quantitative job insecurity might encompass the negative aspects of qualitative job insecurity, resulting in a cumulated profile that is related to the most vulnerable occupational situations. The results of covariate analyses partly supported this claim, corroborating Hypothesis 2a. First, the findings of the current study showed evidence that compared to the qualitative job insecurity dominant profile, the most extreme (i.e., balanced high job insecurity) profile was characterized by more vulnerable employees in terms of temporary contracts and parttime jobs. This is in line with the literature suggesting that objective occupational characteristics contribute to an increased likelihood of encountering job insecurity (see De Keim et al. 2014; Kinnunen and N\u00e4tti 1994; Shoss 2017) . Moreover, our findings additionally draw attention to the fact that certain groups of employees, such as those in contingent jobs, may be particularly at risk of experiencing cumulative forms of job insecurity.",

Despite the lowest mean values of mental health and the highest ratings of exhaustion, the balanced high job insecurity profile did not show to be significantly different from the qualitative job insecurity dominant profile in terms of employee health and well-being. For comparison, except for work engagement, supplementary variable-centered regression analyses did not reveal interaction effects in predicting the outcomes, showing that the effects of qualitative job insecurity were only marginally determined but not strengthened by the levels of quantitative job insecurity. These results, however, point to the relative importance of single dimensions placing more emphasis on qualitative job insecurity. Hence, as previously noted by Gabriel et al.

Thus, qualitative job insecurity seems to be present in the vast majority of job-insecure situations. Such findings also add to the discussion in the existing literature as to which dimension of job insecurityqualitative or (cumulated) quantitativemay produce more severe detrimental effects (e.g., De Tu et al. 2019) . Our findings suggest that qualitative job insecurity alone may be severe enough for the detrimental outcomes to occur. This implication is particularly relevant in times of turbulent economies (e.g., due to the recent COVID-19 crisis), when many companies are forced to implement changes in their size, structure, or the ways of working. The risk of losing one's job (i.e., quantitative job insecurity) would be considered a well-recognized and \"legitimate\" threat to employee well-being in such cases. Whereas qualitative job insecurity is easy to overlook because it has the label of being somewhat milder and inevitable. In light of this, our findings are alerting as they show that the latter form of job insecurity can be substantially detrimental, even if it is not accompanied by the risk of losing the job. At this point, however, we cannot explain why the strength of the detrimental outcomes did not increase in the balanced high job insecurity profile. Perhaps the non-significant difference between the balanced high job insecurity profile and the qualitative job insecurity dominant profile could be due to the very small size of these profiles. For this reason, true mean score differences in the outcomes may be more difficult to detect. Moreover, the cross-validation sample used for distal outcome analyses consisted of public sector employees only, who had encountered some form on organizational change. It is possible that qualitative job insecurity was a more pertinent job insecurity dimension for them, and this may have somewhat affected the results.",

This scale has been used in a number of studies over the recent years, such as Van den Broeck et al. (2014) and De Cuyper et al. (2019). It consists of four items measuring perceived negative changes in the overall job content and working conditions. A sample item: \"I feel insecure about the characteristics and conditions of my job in the future\". Cronbach's alphas were .86 in the first sample and .90 in the second sample. Quantitative Job Insecurity Quantitative job insecurity was measured with three items from the scale developed by De Witte (2000) and validated by Vander Elst et al. (2014",
