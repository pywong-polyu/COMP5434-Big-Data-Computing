According to the PFDI-20 development study, the calculation for assessing the distress of PFD symptoms was based on the Classic Test Theory (CTT), which takes into account the instrument as a whole and does not assess items or symptoms separately [3] . In addition, the PFDI-20 total score and each subscale is interpreted as the higher the score, the worse the distress [3] . This can affect the patient's comprehension of the meaning of the score for their health status and also limit statistical analysis in scientific research to only continuous data. According to COSMIN, when an instrument does not have its consolidated factorial structure in which few studies have found different numbers of factors, or the method used for structural analysis is not clear, it becomes necessary to explore factorability by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and then use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm the adequacy of the results to the factors [2] . Due to this, it is necessary to assess the measurement properties of PFDI-20, especially the structural validity, in order to test its dimensionality and internal consistency, and also if this PROM is suitable for use in clinical practice in gynecology and scientific research. In addition, one of its strengths is the comprehensive assessment of the distress caused by the presence of PFD symptoms of three groups of PFDs in women. However, there are no established values for the classification of the distress intensity [3] .",

From the responses to the items obtained through the application of PFDI-20, the parameters of the items were estimated on a measurement scale (0-1), in which 0 is the mean of the \u03f4 of the participants and 1 is the standard deviation. With these values, the measure of the \u03f4 of each participant was estimated on the same scale. This allows the items to be positioned on the scale in order to enable their interpretation in the context of the \u03f4 measured.

In one-dimensional structure, all items of the instrument evaluate a single construct, the distress caused by the presence of PFD symptoms in women, differently from the factor structure found in a previous study [9] . Through the PCM, the proposed new PFDI-20 score classified the intensity of distress caused by the presence of PFD symptoms as mild (1-15 points), moderate (16-34 points) and severe (35-40 points). In our clinical experience, we believe that patients can better understand the severity of their own health problem through this new classification. Furthermore, it is possible that the perception and management of the distress caused by the presence of PFD symptoms are guided in different ways by clinicians for each severity.",

Compared to the study by Ma et al. [9] , another important aspect of the PFDI-20 factorial structure found in this study was the application of the instrument in different cultures, which can be seen in the replicability values. In the present study, the replicability analysis showed that the one-dimensional model can be replicable in other populations. On the other hand, the models of three and five factors suggested that the factors may not be replicable in other populations. This means that future studies may find similar one-factor structures for PFDI-20, indicating a stability of the instrument in other populations. Table 2 Factor loads of the one-dimensional structure of the PFDI-20 Comparing the measure of the \u03f4 generated by the IRT with the score generated by the CTT, it was possible to classify the distress caused by the presence of PFD symptoms assessed by the PFDI-20 total score. Unlike CTT, IRT determines the probability of a participant selecting a response on the scale corresponding to their symptoms at a certain level of severity, i.e., in this study, \"with mild symptoms and distress\". In addition, the PCM assumes that respondents with more severe distress symptoms may be more likely to report symptoms that reflect worse distress severity [23] . Thus, items 3, 4, 6, 9, 10 and 14 of the PFDI-20 had a lower frequency of \"bother moderately\" and \"bother quite a bit\" responses, identifying participants with a high probability of presenting PFD symptoms that don't bother at all or bother somewhat at \u03b8 \u2265 3.25. The low frequency of responses in these items may be due to the symptoms being considered more severe, because the sensation of something coming out of the vaginal area (item 3), the need to push something in the vagina or around the anus to complete the evacuation (item 4), need to push something around the vagina to complete the urination (item 6), AI (items 9 e 10) and rectal prolapse (item 14) are considered characteristic symptoms of greater severity among POP and anorectal symptoms [7, 24] .",

In this case, the PCM provides information to discriminate individuals with different levels of \u03f4 and the category limit for each item [23] . Thus, the items or symptoms of PFDI-20 can be assessed according to their severity, and the classification of distress as mild, moderate and severe is feasible and easy to understand for both patients and clinicians.",

In this study, we included women with and without PFD, unlike other validation studies of PFDI-20, in which only women with PFD participated [3, 6, 9] . Thus, the greater variability of characteristics in this sample is understandable, which is evident in countries with diverse ethnicities and cultures such as Brazil. Furthermore, although the factorial structure of PFDI-20 is considered one-dimensional, according to a study not yet published in this sample, the items can still assess different symptoms of PFD. Thereby, we emphasize that the use of this PROM in scientific research or clinical practice must consider the symptoms assessed in each item for each PFD, and also thoroughly evaluate the distress caused by the presence of PFD symptoms in women.",

In addition, our proposal for classifying the distress caused by the presence of PFD symptoms by PFDI-20 is simple, easily applicable and understandable, which may contribute to its widespread use in clinical practice and scientific research. However, the selection of a convenience sample and the lack of an evaluation of medical diagnoses for PFD can be considered limitations of this study.",
