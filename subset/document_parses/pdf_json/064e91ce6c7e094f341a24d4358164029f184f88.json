Reducing the potential exposure should be recommended as a reasonable way to curb the epidemic of the disease in children. Interferon was the first recommended anti-virus treatment. In case of intolerance, arbitol could serve as an alternative. However, the necessity of anti-virus treatment needs to be further evaluated because previous studies have indicated that there are no obvious differences between children with and without anti-virus treatment [4, 5] . Further, a cocktail of Chinese herb might be helpful to facilitate recovery. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of small sample size.",
