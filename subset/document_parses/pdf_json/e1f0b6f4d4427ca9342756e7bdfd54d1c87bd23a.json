            "text": "Global mortality trends of COVID-19 show marked differences by demographic characteristics including age (increased risk of severe illness in older individuals), sex (higher among males), socioeconomic status, and race (higher among Blacks). In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that 80% of COVID-19-related deaths occur in individuals aged 65 years and older. 13, 14 Data from the United Kingdom has demonstrated that the strongest risk for death is advanced age, which dramatically outweighs the risks associated with any other demographic factor or medical condition. 15 Demographic structures for Europe, the Americas, and Asia demonstrate median age ranges from 32 years to 42.5 years, 4,16-19 with 8.9% to 19.1% of the population older than 65 years. [20] [21] [22] [23] In contrast, the median age of the SSA population is considerably lower, with a median age of 18 and only 3.0% of the African population older than 65 years. 24, 25 Figure 2 compares the population pyramids of Uganda and Canada, which are similar in overall population size. The median age of Canada (41.1 years) is remarkedly higher than that of Uganda (16.7 years). 26, 27 In Uganda, less than 0.2% of the population is in the highest-risk group of developing more severe illness (aged 80 years and older). 28 Conversely, the proportion of individuals aged 80 years and older in Canada is higher (4.4%). 29 Further, Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of COVID-related deaths in Canada as of June 25, 2021. 30 A large proportion of deaths are attributed to older age; approximately 98.0% of COVID-related deaths occur in individuals aged 50 years and older, with approximately 64.7% in individuals aged 80 years and older. 30 With the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations and prioritization of those aged 70 years and older in North America and other areas, the mean age of those being admitted to hospital has decreased. 31, 32 However, it is still highly likely that those aged 70 years and older remain the highest risk among the unvaccinated population.",

Low-income countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, such as Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Haiti also have greater median ages (24.0-27.6 years) and a larger proportion of the population age 65 and older (5.2%-8.7%) than in SSA. 33-38 Similar demographics are observed for countries in South Asia, such as India and Pakistan; median age ranges from 22.8-28.4 years with 4.4%-6.6% of the population aged older than 65 years. [39] [40] [41] [42] Older age is associated with more degenerative and metabolic disorders that have also been shown to heighten the risk of death from COVID-19. Therefore, it is posited that the demographic The Conundrum of Low COVID-19 Mortality Burden in sub-Saharan Africa www.ghspjournal.org structure of SSA plays a critical role in the low morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. It is possible that the burden of severe disease and death may be low despite suspected and undetected widespread transmission. In fact, it is possible that widespread transmission has already occurred without precipitating the high death rates seen elsewhere due to the relatively small proportion of elderly and lack of large long-term care facilities for the elderly, which have been the epicenters of mortality in Canada and elsewhere. 43 It is notable that some areas of SSA, such as South Africa, have ",

The CDC defines long-term care facilities as those whereby elderly who are unable to live independently receive medical and personal care. 45 Unfortunately, long-term care facilities pose a significant risk for infectious and communicable diseases; approximately 1.0-3.0 million infections occur in these facilities per year. 45, 46 During the first wave of the epidemic in Canada, 81.0% of all deaths occurred in long-term care facilities. 47 Transmission to the elderly can be particularly efficient in these settings and lead to a markedly higher infection fatality rate. 48 Across SSA, long-term care facilities are almost nonexistent, with the notable exception of South Africa, leaving the provision of care to families. 49, 50 Large young families with high levels of unemployment and low labor costs enable care to be provided by individual relatives rather than a team of professionals, which limits the number of caregivers that may transmit infection. In the first wave, approximately 33% of South African long-term care facilities experienced outbreaks. 51 Furthermore, data from South Africa have demonstrated that COVID-19related deaths are highly correlated with increased age; approximately 2.2% of all COVID-19-related deaths occurred among persons younger than 30 years, despite their consisting of 54.2% of the population. 52, 53 This is a further potential explanation for South Africa being an outlier with a higher death rate than in other African countries. 54",

Seasonal human coronaviruses, such as NL6, 229E, OC43, and HKU1, are common and result in cold-or flu-like symptoms. 55 Zoonotic coronaviruses, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV, are responsible for more severe diseases. 55 Previous exposure to locally circulating coronaviruses and the development of antibodies is posited to mediate cross-protection to COVID-19 and induce partial immunity. 56 Several studies have been conducted to investigate this unique relationship. Studies assessing antibody prevalence to SARS-CoV-2 in prepandemic serum samples observed a significant increase in the prevalence of cross-reactivity among sera in SSA compared to other continents. 57 In addition, previous studies have demonstrated high false positivity when testing pre-pandemic sera from SSA using European assays. 58, 59 The discrepancy of seropositivity may be attributed to widespread exposure to various endemic coronaviruses before the emergence of It is possible that widespread transmission has already occurred without precipitating the high death rates seen elsewhere due to the relatively small proportion of elderly and lack of large long-term care facilities. the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A limitation of these studies was the use of serological assays to determine previous exposure, particularly because there can be discrepancies in results when comparing T-cell versus antibody evidence of exposure and immunity. 60 In contrast, a study by Sagar et al. 61 used results from previously performed comprehensive respiratory panel polymerase chain reaction assays to examine the impact of previous exposure to endemic coronaviruses in COVID-19 patients. Their results demonstrated a significant decrease in odds of mortality and odds of being admitted to an intensive care unit in patients who had evidence for previous exposure to endemic coronaviruses compared to those who did not. 56, 61 These findings indicate that exposure to other coronaviruses may reduce the severity and burden of COVID-19. Furthermore, a recent study by Uyoga et al. 62 observed increased rates of antibody prevalence to SARS-CoV-2 among Kenyan blood donors between April 30-June 16, 2020, that are higher than case counts would predict.",

It is hypothesized that there has been a dramatic undercounting of deaths due to lack of SARS-CoV-2 testing as was suggested in the mass media to have happened in Kano, Nigeria. 63,64 Current data may not reflect the true extent of the disease. The true numbers of infected and deaths could be higher given that, at least in South Africa where the median age is much higher than SSA as a whole, 44 the excess mortality observed is far higher than the officially reported totals for deaths from COVID-19. Lack of local access to testing and contact tracing, and insufficient data collection have interfered with the ascertainment of the incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 in SSA. The WHO reports varying levels of testing across Africa, however, testing is still relatively low compared to other areas of the world. 65 As of June 25, 2021, testing rates ranged from as low as 7.7 tests per 1,000 population in Madagascar to as high as 215.3 and 389.9 tests per 1,000 in South Africa and Gabon, respectively. 66 However, these numbers are far lower than rates in the United States (1,401.8 tests per 1,000 population) and the United Kingdom (2,973.0 tests per 1,000 population). 66 Although low testing rates likely resulted in a much lower case rate, the lack of hospital overcrowding and widespread deaths likely resulted from lower morbidity and mortality in this region. This would suggest a lower predisposition to severe illness. The initial priority for the Africa Task Force for Novel Coronavirus was to expand COVID-19 testing capability. This expansion proceeded rapidly; at the outset of the pandemic, only 2 labs in Africa were capable of SARS-CoV-2 detection, but by mid-March 2020, 43 countries had this laboratory capability. 67 Preliminary observations from the poorly maintained civil and vital registration systems seem to indicate that it is unlikely that there has been excess all-cause mortality in the region. 68 Studies are underway in Kenya assessing excess mortality through verbal autopsies and populationbased serosurveys for past infections to assess past exposure. 69 The concerns of recording the impact of COVID-19 across SSA offers the opportunity of novel means of data collection to expand current knowledge on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Morbidity may be further explored through the use and purchase of oxygen as a proxy of the current situation in hospitals. Further, data collection on death may be extended to churches and faith groups, obituaries, and morticians. These and other means should be further explored to help better understand the impact of COVID-19 on SSA as a whole.",

Uganda is a leading example of curbing the impact of COVID-19 in the African context. Rapid response and implementation of risk communication, testing, social and physical distancing measures, and contract tracing were critical for the success seen in Uganda. 75 Additionally, new programs to promote regional sharing of COVID-related information were initiated across SSA. For example, the East African Community created the Regional Electronic Cargo and Drivers Tracking System. This system electronically shares the COVID test results of truck drivers between member countries. In addition, the program uses the drivers' cell phones to track their routes and record stops. This tracking allows for quick contact tracing in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak. 76 Furthermore, several African countries have scored particularly well in critical policy areas in terms of public health directives, financial responses, and fact-based public communications to help control COVID-19. 77 In particular, Kenya, Ghana, and Ethiopia scored more than 95 on a 100-point scale. 77 This may have helped to mitigate the scope of the pandemic although further validation of the scores would be helpful.",

Some localized areas with a greater number of older individuals, such as South Africa, may be exceptions to this trend. The presence of a long-term care facility sector as well as extremely high rates of HIV and TB coinfection, Diabetes and obesity have been observed to increase the severity of COVID-19 illness, but the rates of diabetes and obesity are remarkedly lower in SSA compared to North America. and effects of noncommunicable diseases may also have led to South Africa having a higher disease burden. Limited resources for disease diagnosis, effective public health campaigns, and other factors discussed are also important considerations. Further studies to clarify these various hypotheses for the low mortality presently reported in Africa are required. While data accrue, the risks and benefits of widespread social mitigation strategies such as lockdowns, need careful consideration. The continent is reeling from the effects of the pandemic; the economic and societal tolls in terms of hunger, teen pregnancy, gender-based violence, and disruptions in the treatment of malaria, TB, and HIV are enormous. Furthermore, the 501. V2 variant of SARS-CoV-2 heightens the risks of further waves and raises the risk to the rest of the continent, including the danger of hospitals reaching capacity in other SSA countries. 104 However, as discussed, widespread adoption of stringent lockdown strategies used previously should be undertaken only with great caution. Consideration must be given to local, unique conditions such as the age structure of the population, competing health risks, and food security. 104 With the recent experience of a severe second wave in India, it is imperative to establish adequate molecular epidemiology to monitor emerging variants that have the potential to cause severe infection in the younger population. As full vaccine rollout in Africa with widespread coverage will likely not occur for some time, these issues remain of critical importance. This review of the literature will aid countries in adopting unique strategies for limiting the spread of COVID-19 without the need for stringent lockdowns. Further research on the potential mechanisms needs to be carried out to understand other possible reasons for the observed discrepancy in mortality seen in SSA.",
