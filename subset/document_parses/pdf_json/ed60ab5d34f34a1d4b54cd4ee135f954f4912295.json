Noise model: We propose an explicit noise model where cycle thresholds are measured with additive Gaussian noise, leading to a multiplicative noise on the reconstructed vector y. Such explicit noise models are not considered in [3, 5] . 3. Bespoke reconstruction algorithm: Because of the unique combination of sparse 0-1 pooling matrix, multiplicative noise model, nonnegative x vector, and one-sided error seen in this problem, we have modified existing reconstruction algorithms and obtained a corresponding improvement in performance. 4. Sparsity estimator and graceful failure: Any pooled testing scheme that takes prevalence rate as input runs the risk that the input prevalence rate may grossly underestimate the true prevalence rate, especially as the disease progresses in a population. It is important to design the scheme so that in such settings, it can (a) recognize that it is operating in a regime where the true prevalence rate exceeds the prevalence rate it was designed for, (b) maintain very high sensitivity of the test, (c) return a list of \"suspected positives\" and an estimate of how many of these suspected positives are truly positives. Our algorithm is able to achieve all three objectives. We employ a sparsity estimator that achieves (a). We design our recovery algorithm to guarantee (b) and achieve (c). 5. Deployment challenges: It is clear that nonadaptive strategies, for all their advantages, are in general more complex than simple pooling strategies. This raises real questions about whether they can be deployed effectively in the real world with so many moving parts. A big part of answering such a question is coming up with a way to encapsulate the complexity so that at the end of the testing laboratory the protocol to perform is made as simple as possible.
