We treat the problem by adopting a partial differential equation (PDE) version of the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model of epidemiology, which is achieved by replacing compartmental populations by their densities. Building on our recent work (Computational Mechanics, 66, 1177, 2020), we replace our earlier use of global polynomial basis functions with those having local support, as epitomized in the finite element method, for the spatial representation of the SIRD parameters. The time dependence is treated by inferring constant parameters over time intervals that coincide with the time step in semi-discrete numerical implementations. In combination, this amounts to a scheme of field inversion of the SIRD parameters over each time step. Applied to data over ten months of 2020 for the pandemic in the US state of Michigan and to all of Mexico, our system inference via field inversion infers spatio-temporally varying PDE SIRD parameters that replicate the progression of the pandemic with high accuracy. It also produces accurate predictions, when compared against data, for a three week period into 2021. Of note is the insight that is suggested on the spatio-temporal variation of infection, recovery and death rates, as well as patterns of the population's mobility revealed by diffusivities of the compartments.",

            "text": "Classical epidemiological models, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIRD) model [1] , are ordinary differential equations (ODEs) defined by specifying the compartmental sub-population numbers over some geographical region. Spatial effects have typically been introduced by resolving smaller regions and treating them individually [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . During the long-lasting and widespread epidemics, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic, the effects on the infection rate of imposing-and then lifting-mobility restrictions and social distancing mandates revolve on the question of the time and spatially varying mobility of the population. At the finest resolution, this must be approached via agent-based models [7] , using individuals' mobility data. However, this data is not available for the entire population, and contact tracing campaigns face challenges of recruiting workers, access, technology, as well as socio-political resistance. Against these difficulties, an intriguing question to explore is whether simple reaction-diffusion models can detect the evidence of mobility in these data. Such an approach must start with a partial differential equation (PDE) version of the epidemiological models, which is easily defined by converting compartmental sub-populations to densities over sub regions by normalizing with the corresponding areas. To address the mobility of the population, diffusion terms are introduced to the SIRD model, which is transformed to a set of reaction-diffusion PDEs in two spatial dimensions [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

            "text": "The widespread availability of data in the public domain [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] has spurred a widespread interest among computational and data scientists, who have sought to test and refine their methods against these repositories. This has opened up the possibility that advances in computational and data science may contribute to the existing and rapidly expanding body of work in epidemiology, in inferring the dynamics of COVID-19 and making projections. We have similarly sought to build off our recent work in data-driven and machine learning approaches [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] and presented a class of system identification techniques for inference of ODE and PDE forms of the SIRD model, as well as Bayesian neural networks for representation and uncertainty quantification-guided prediction [11] . That work focused on the US state of Michigan. In this communication, we revise our approach for inference of the PDE SIRD model with temporal and spatial evolving parameters and diffusivities. Importantly, instead of global polynomial representations of PDE SIRD parameters over the spatial and temporal domains, we adopt field inversion over time intervals that coincide with the time steps of our underlying numerical implementation. This affords much greater accuracy over the global polynomial ansatz. Adjoint-based gradient optimization for field inversion of parameters at each time step replaces the use of stepwise regression-based system identification in our previous work. We find that the improved accuracy with respect to the data over the time interval of inference, as well as of the predictions, is worth the increased expense. We have brought abundant high-quality, public domain, data [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] on the evolution of COVID-19 in both, the State of Michigan, with a population of 9.98 million, distributed in 83 counties, over 250,493 km 2 , and the country of Mexico, with a population of 126 million, distributed in 32 geographical entities (31 states, plus Mexico City), on 1,972,550 km 2 . The temporal resolution by days and spatial resolution by counties/states have allowed us to study the mobility in these data using our methods of system inference.",

The inferred model for Michigan accurately replicates the initial burst of disease and the following multiple waves around Detroit (please see the SI movie: michigan prediction.mp4). It also captures the second burst in the southwest of Michigan around the city of Grand Rapids. The high burden of the disease in these, the largest and second largest cities, respectively, in Michigan, reflects wellknown socio-economic challenges related to Detroit in particular, and more generally reflected in other urban centers. Similarly, Mexico City, with highest population density in Mexico (6, 200/km 2 [18] ), was the worst affected area in that country and dominated the evolution of the disease (See SI movie: mexico prediction.mp4).",

Figure 3 shows the inferred infection rate, death rate and the recovery rate in Michigan every 70 days starting from t = 0 (the time-resolved dynamics are shown in SI movie: michigan parameter.mp4). The evolution of these inferred parameters reveals that the population's infection rate, \u03b2(t), declined from the initially higher values in highly infected areas (such as Detroit), and spread to the western parts of Michigan. The death rate was mostly stable after May 2020 (t > 69), and remained low in the more highly infected areas. This can be attributed to the ramp up of the public health campaign, hospitalizations and emergency response of the medical system, and prioritization to the more highly infected areas. The recovery rate around Detroit city evolved in multiple stages: increasing\u2192 decreasing \u2192 increasing, which was consistent with the multiple waves reflected in the data on the recovered population in this region (SI movie: michigan prediction.mp4).",

However, given the difficulties encountered in effective contact tracing, and its acceptance by the population [9, 32, 33] , an intriguing question to explore is whether simple reaction-diffusion models can detect the evidence of mobility in these data. Figure 4 shows the inferred diffusivities of the susceptible, infected, and recovered sub-populations. Note that for field inversion, the population density data for each compartment was taken to be uniform within each county/state, since no finer grained information was available, and then subject to Gaussian smoothing before inference. Thus the density gradients, which drive the inference of diffusivities, arise at the counties/states scale more than they do at the intra-county/intra-state. Accordingly, the inferred diffusivities are meaningful on this scale. The lower Peninsula of Michigan is about 446 km long from north to south and 314 km wide from east to west-scales that can help place the diffusivities in Figure 4 in perspective. The mobility of the infected population was always high around the highly infected areas. In Michigan, this infected 8 .

This finding is consistent with the second burst around Grands during the evolution of the pandemic. The recovered population demonstrated a similar pattern of mobility, and was more active in the southern part of Michigan around the more highly infected regions. On the other hand, susceptible population closely tracks the total population. Since the population at large has low mobility, the susceptible population's mobility is low in high population density areas. See SI movie michigan prediction.mp4 for these dynamics. Figure 5 show the inferred infection rate, death rate and the recovery rate of the inferred model for Mexico. We can clearly see the spreading of the disease from Mexico City. Similar to the case of Michigan, infection rates, and to a lesser extent, death rates, were relatively lower in Mexico City, which is the most densely populated region of the country, than that in the surrounding cities. The recovery rate was high in Mexico city due to the relatively greater resources of the medical system there. The infection and death rates tended to be stable for five months following March 23, 2020, and the recovery rate gradually increased in more areas. Notably, far from the Mexico city, Baja California also displayed a high inferred rate of infection. We suspect this to be because it borders California, USA, and the international border restrictions did not contain the spread of the virus between the two regions. Unlike Mexico City, the death rate remained high, and the recovery rate did not increase to levels comparable to the capital, perhaps because of the looser restrictions in this popular tourist destination.",

We extended the PDE SIRD model by allowing the infection rate, death rate and the recovery rate, as well as the diffusivities of the susceptible, infected, and recovered sub-populations to vary over space and time. Using field inversion to infer the parameters as finite-dimensional fields on time scales of a single day, we obtained models to predict the evolution of disease with high accuracy. This provides us with the ability to analyze the dynamics of the disease through the inferred parameters, and make accurate predictions within a reasonable time frame. Particularly, we can detect the evidence of time and spatially varying mobility of the population through the simple diffusion-reaction models instead of the relying on the agent-based models which require individual's mobility data. The latter can prove challenging, technically as well as politically, to obtain.",

Particularly, the higher infection and death rates in areas with low infection at later times suggests that more attention is needed in such locations. This may be due to a lack of medical services, or a lack of compliance with mitigation strategies. Our inferred models also reveals higher mobility surrounding the highly infected areas suggesting the importance of quarantine and social distancing.",

            "text": "Finite-dimensional representation allows the parameters to accurately capture the spatial dependence, however the non-parametric representation makes the projection of these parameters beyond the data range extremely challenging. A prediction cannot be made with confidence if the dynamics of the disease reflected by these parameters are not stable. Of course, extrapolation is challenging in almost all data-driven methods. One possible alternate is to develope surrogate models of these parameters via time dependent neural networks under the constraints of the SIRD model to learn the spatial variation in time, and thus to make reasonable prediction of the dynamics in the evolution the disease, such as we have demonstrated previously [11] . Nevertheless, without including factors such as mobility restrictions or other mandates, only short time predictions may be accurate. ",
