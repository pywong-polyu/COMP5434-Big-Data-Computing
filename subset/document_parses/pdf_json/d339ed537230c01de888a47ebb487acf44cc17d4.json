            "text": "Background: Little is known regarding long-term outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 6-month outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with new neurological complications during hospitalization who survived were propensity score-matched to COVID-19 survivors without neurological complications hospitalized during the same period. The primary 6month outcome was multivariable ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale(mRS) comparing patients with or without neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included: activities of daily living (ADLs;Barthel Index), telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Neuro-QoL batteries for anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep. Results: Of 606 COVID-19 patients with neurological complications, 395 survived hospitalization and were matched to 395 controls; N = 196 neurological patients and N = 186 controls completed follow-up. Overall, 346/ 382 (91%) patients had at least one abnormal outcome: 56% had limited ADLs, 50% impaired cognition, 47% could not return to work and 62% scored worse than average on \u22651 Neuro-QoL scale (worse anxiety 46%, sleep 38%, fatigue 36%, and depression 25%). In multivariable analysis, patients with neurological complications had worse 6-month mRS (median 4 vs. 3 among controls, adjusted OR 1.98, 95%CI 1.23-3.48, P = 0.02), worse ADLs (aOR 0.38, 95%CI 0.29-0.74, P = 0.01) and were less likely to return to work than controls (41% versus 64%, P = 0.04). Cognitive and Neuro-QOL metrics were similar between groups. Conclusions: Abnormalities in functional outcomes, ADLs, anxiety, depression and sleep occurred in over 90% of patients 6-months after hospitalization for COVID-19. In multivariable analysis, patients with neurological complications during index hospitalization had significantly worse 6-month functional outcomes than those without.",

Our primary aim was to compare global functional outcomes between COVID-19 hospital survivors with and without neurological complications using an ordinal analysis of the modified Rankins Scale (mRS). Secondary outcomes included assessments of activities of daily living, return to work, cognitive function, anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep abnormalities.

The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale [mRS; 0 = no symptoms, 6 = dead] [23] , analyzed using an ordinal proportional odds model. Secondary outcomes included: the Barthel Index [24] for activities of daily living (0 = completely dependent, 100 = independent for all activities), the Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; 22 = perfect score; \u226418 = abnormal cognition) [25] , and Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders [26] (Neuro-QoL) short form self-reported health measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep. Patients with fewer than 13 years of education received an additional point when scoring the telephone MOCA [27] . The outcomes of occurrence of return to work among those employed pre-morbidly and hospital readmission were self-reported by the patient or their surrogate. Patients were coded as having \"returned to work\" if they resumed work either in person or remotely, even if they changed employers. All of the above batteries have been validated for surrogate completion with the exception of the telephone MoCA, which was only scored if the patient was able to complete the assessment. Incomplete or partial responses to a given metric were excluded from analysis.",

Furthermore, over half of these neurologically affected patients could not independently perform some of their basic activities of daily living and 59% of those employed prior to COVID-19 infection were unable to return to Excluding patients with a history of dementia or memory disorders. IQR = interquartile range; MOCA = Montreal Cognitive Assessment work by 6-months. We did not identify significant correlations with return to work and fatigue (Spearman's rho \u2212 0.118, P = 0.16), or depression (Spearman's rho \u2212 0.152, P = 0.07), suggesting that these factors were not primarily driving employment status. Though return to work metrics may be impacted by unmeasurable pandemic-related economic conditions, patients with neurological complications were still significantly less likely to return to work, even after adjusting for confounders, than patients living in the same metropolitan area without neurological complications. Similarly, while patients with new neurological events had higher baseline levels of dementia, stroke, and seizure, increased odds of worse 6-month functional outcomes persisted after adjusting for these baseline differences, as well as for age and baseline premorbid modified Rankin scores. Though we hypothesized that patients with neurological disorders would generally have worse long-term outcomes, we found that both groups of patients had high rates of cognitive impairment approaching or exceeding 50% at 6-months. While we did not compare our patients to non-COVID controls, the estimated prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in the general community among patients aged 65-69 years (the median age of our population) is only 8.4% [29] and the prevalence of dementia is <1% [30] . Notably, we did not find a correlation between depression and cognition scores, suggesting that depression alone is not the cause of cognitive deficits. Neuropsychiatric symptom burden was also substantial, with nearly two-thirds of all patients reporting worse than average anxiety, depression, fatigue or sleep disorders. Because we used T-scores for Neuro-QoL metrics, these findings represent abnormalities compared to reference populations. Though we identified significant relationships between most outcome measures and self-reported persistent dyspnea, the association was weak and it does not seem that dyspnea alone can fully account for the levels of disability or cognitive impairment that we measured.",

            "text": "Strengths of our study include its prospective ascertainment of data beginning at the time of index hospitalization, initial neurological diagnoses by board-certified neurologists [11] , a propensity-score matched control group and a multi-domain outcome battery. This is the first study, to our knowledge to prospectively assess long-term neurological function and cognitive outcomes among COVID-19 hospital survivors in a standardized fashion. Other studies have presented short-term outcomes between 2 weeks and 2 months from COVID-19 symptom onset, but neither used formal assessments of fatigue, mood, cognition or functional status [31, 32] . In one study of outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19, reports of protracted symptoms during the subacute phase (14-21 days) included persistent fatigue in 35%, persistent loss of taste/smell in 20% and confusion in 20% [32] . Another study in a hospitalized COVID-19 cohort found that 87% of patients had at least one lingering COVID-19 symptom in a mean of 60 days after initial COVID-19 symptom onset, with the most common long-term symptoms being fatigue (53%) and dyspnea (43%) [31] . In a large, 6month study of a COVID-19 cohort from Wuhan, China [22] , fatigue or muscle weakness was reported in 63%, and sleep difficulties in 23%, however, these metrics were not assessed using a standardized battery and it is unclear how these rates compare to a reference population. This study also identified anxiety or depression in 23% based on the EuroQol five-dimension five-level questionnaire, but this metric does not differentiate anxiety and depression. This study also excluded some of the sickest patients such as those with underlying dementia, psychiatric illness, hospital readmission, nursing home or facility patients and those physically unable to return for an in-person follow-up. This may explain the higher rates of anxiety (46% of patients), and depression (25%) that we observed. We identified neurological complications during index COVID-19 hospitalization, age, and worse premorbid baseline functional status as independent predictors of poor outcomes, however, these risk factors are not readily modifiable. Invasive mechanical ventilation and hypotension requiring vasopressors were associated with worse activities of daily living, fatigue and sleep. These variables may be potentially modifiable by medications and therapeutics that were not available early in the pandemic. While we anticipated an association between the severity of lung injury, hypoxia and worse cognitive outcomes based on prior ARDS studies [33] and neuropathological findings of hypoxic brain injury in COVD-19 autopsy specimens [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] , we did not find a significant relationship. One possibility is that the telephone MOCA may not be sensitive enough to detect certain types of cognitive impairment. We used this tool because it is validated for phone interview and would allow us to gather data on patients that would not otherwise be able to complete follow-up in person due to pandemic related restrictions. Another possibility is that we were unable to fully capture the duration and severity of hypoxemia burden using stochastic measures of the lowest oxygen saturation or the lung injury severity scale [22] . Furthermore, there is likely an interaction between hypoxemia and hypotension that compounds the risk of cognitive deficits, however, we only identified a significant effect of the interaction of intubation and hypotension requiring vasopressors on the outcome of fatigue. The degree and duration of hypoxemia and/or hypotension required to cause permanent brain injury may vary from patient to patient depending on the presence of flow-limiting extra-or intracranial vessel stenosis, carbon dioxide levels, the integrity of cerebral autoregulation, prior ischemic damage, and the degree of brain metabolic activity and blood flow coupling. Big data studies evaluating oxygen and blood pressure levels are needed to evaluate these associations further.",

However, the first study excluded patients for whom follow-up would be difficult (including those readmitted to a hospital for underlying diseases) [22] and the other looked at short-term readmissions within its own hospital system, not accounting for readmissions that could occur outside of its network [39] . Because our readmission data came directly from patients or their surrogates, we were able to capture readmissions across different hospital systems. It is likely that limited access to outpatient follow-up during the New York COVID-19 surge may have contributed to this high readmission rate. Systematic video and phone follow-up early after discharge may help mitigate readmission risk.",

            "text": "There are limitations to our work. First, though all patients completed the mRS evaluation, the sickest patients were unable to complete other metrics due to limited function. Thus, secondary outcomes may actually be worse than what we were able to measure. Additionally, family members of patients who did poorly may be less motivated to participate in research. Second, certain outcomes may be confounded by unmeasured factors. For example, return to work may be impacted by the current economic environment. Anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep may be similarly impacted by unmeasured societal, economic and environmental pandemic-associated factors. Comparing COVID-19 patients to similar community members without COVID-19 would help quantify the impact of some of these unmeasured factors. Third, though we identified high rates of disability among both neurological COVID-19 patients and controls, this study was not designed to determine whether the deficits measured by these metrics are static or represent ongoing injury as suggested by some \"long-hauler\" and post-COVID literature [40] . Since cognitive impairment and mood abnormalities occur in over 50% of ARDS survivors [41] , it is possible that the level of disability we are documenting is not specific to SARS-CoV-2, but rather a result of factors related to critical viral illness. Additional oneyear follow-up in this cohort may help clarify the trajectory of recovery. Fourth, while we were able to adjust for a variety of past neurological diagnoses in multivariable analyses, we had limited data on specific psychiatric diagnoses (e.g. depression, bipolar disorder, thought disorder). We did adjust for a conglomerate variable of \"past psychiatric history\", but further differentiation may have provided insights into analyses of NeuroQoL outcomes. Fifth, the telephone MOCA is meant to screen for cognitive impairment, but more extensive neuropsychological testing is needed to identify specific domains of cognitive abnormality. While we did adjust for years of education when scoring the telephone MOCA, other societal factors may impact scores [27] . Sixth, we did not obtain information regarding therapeutic interventions that may have modulated outcomes. We are currently studying the impact of both conventional and alternative treatments on functional, cognitive and NeuroQoL metrics at 1-year follow-up post-hospitalization for COVID. Finally, while we did find a small, yet significant relationship between ongoing severe dyspnea and other outcome metrics, we did not use a standardized measure of dyspnea because we felt that a longer survey would lead to participant fatigue and incomplete responses. Further investigation of the impact of long-term pulmonary sequelae on neurological outcomes is warranted.",
