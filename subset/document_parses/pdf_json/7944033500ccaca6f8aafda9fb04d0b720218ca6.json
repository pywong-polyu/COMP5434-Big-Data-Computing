Participants with co-morbidities and pregnant women will be excluded. Patient recruitment will be done in Shaikh Zayed Medical Complex, Doctors Lounge and Ali Clinic in Lahore (Pakistan). Intervention and comparator: The registered patients will be allocated in 6 groups (30 participants each). Patients will be taking subcutaneous IVM at 200 \u03bcg/kg/48 h (Arm A) or subcutaneous IVM at 200 \u03bcg/kg/48 h and oral Zn 20mg/8 h (Arm B) or oral IVM at 0.2 mg/kg/day (Arm C) or oral IVM at 0.2 mg/kg/day and oral Zn 20mg/8 h (Arm D) or alone oral Zn 20mg/8 h (Arm E) or placebo alone (Arm X). Patients in all arms will receive standard care and respective placebo (empty capsule 8 hourly and/or subcutaneous normal saline 2ml/48 h).",

SARS-CoV-2 clearance will be calculated by second PCR on day 7. HRCT chest score will be measured by the percentage and lung lobes involvement on day 6 with a maximum score of 25. CGS will be recorded on a seven-point scale; grade 1 (not hospitalized, no evidence of infection and resumption of normal activities), grade 2 (not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities), grade 3 (hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen), grade 4 (hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen), grade 5 (hospitalized, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy and/or noninvasive mechanical ventilation), grade 6 (hospitalized, requiring ECMO and/or invasive mechanical ventilation) and grade 7 (death). Randomisation: A simple lottery method will be used to randomly allocate scrutinized patients in 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio in 6 groups.",
