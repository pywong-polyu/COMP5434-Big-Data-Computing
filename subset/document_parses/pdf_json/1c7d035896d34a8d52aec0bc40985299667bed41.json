            "text": "In November 2021, the Omicron variant emerged in South Africa, concurrent with a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases 1 leading to the fourth epidemic wave. The identification of the new variant caused concern due to the large number of mutations present throughout the genome. In particular, mutations that are known to be associated with immune escape and increased infectivity were identified in the spike protein. While a number of studies are underway to rapidly assess phenotypic behaviour and immune escape, it is also critical to understand the clinical severity of infections caused by Omicron. We evaluated the severity of SGTF infections (as a proxy for the Omicron variant) by comparing to (i) non-SGTF infections during the same period of time, and (ii) Delta variant infections, which dominated the third wave. When compared to non-SGTF infections, we found that SGTF infections had an 80% lower odds being admitted to hospital, but did not differ in the risk of severe disease among hospitalised individuals. When compared to Delta infections, SGTF infections were associated with a 70% lower odds of severe disease. In addition, we found that early Omicron wave infections had a significantly lower mean PCR Ct-value compared to early Delta wave infections, which may reflect higher viral loads in Omicron infected individuals.",

Firstly, SGTF infections were only identifiable using the TaqPath PCR and only for specimens with high viral loads (Ct\u226430) and therefore the number of SGTF infections is underestimated and biased towards geographic regions where this assay was more commonly used. Secondly, SGTF identified on PCR was used as a proxy for Omicron variant detection. However, SGTF may also identify the Alpha variant and occur sporadically in other variants and therefore some infections may have been misclassified as Omicron. However, we only used SGTF as a proxy for Omicron after 1 October 2021 and genome data generated by NGS-SA has not identified the Alpha variant in South Africa since August 2021 and at its peak Alpha variant was only detected in 6% of samples in May 2021 13 . In addition, Omicron has recently been classified into three sub-lineages, one (BA.2) of which does not contain the \u039469-70 deletion and which therefore will not be identifiable by the SGTF.

We accounted for this by only including hospitalised patients with known outcomes, censoring cases to ensure at least three weeks of follow up, and adjusting for time interval between diagnosis and hospitalisation in the severity multivariable models. The inclusion of individuals only with accumulated in-hospital outcomes may have biased SGTF towards shorter hospital stay, hence this result should be interpreted with caution. Fourthly, we compared cases through the full Delta wave to cases in the ascending phase of the Omicron wave, this could bias comparisons if case characteristics differ in the ascending and descending wave phases. However, data from the DATCOV programme suggest that the proportion of severe cases does not vary substantially through the different wave phases 10 . Lastly, we had limited vaccination information only for hospitalised cases and that was based on self-report. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

It is difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of high levels of previous population immunity versus intrinsic lower virulence to the observed lower disease severity. Our finding of no difference in severity in SGTF compared to non-SGTF infected individuals in the same time period, and the lower risk of severity in SGTF compared to earlier Delta infected individuals, suggests that this reduced severity may be in part a result of high levels of population immunity (due to natural infection and/or vaccination).",
