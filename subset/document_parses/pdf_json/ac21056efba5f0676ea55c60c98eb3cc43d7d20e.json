Previously we developed a large variety of benzimidazole derivatives able to inhibit these viruses. Herein, two series of (thio)semicarbazone-and hydrazone-based benzimidazoles have been explored, by derivatizing 5-acetyl benzimidazoles previously reported by us, thereby evaluating the influence of the modification on the antiviral activity. Compounds 6, 8, 16 and 17, bearing the 5-(thio)semicarbazone and 5-hydrazone functionalities in combination with the 2-benzyl ring on the benzimidazole core structure, acted as dual inhibitors of influenza A virus and human coronavirus. For respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), activity is limited to the 5-thiosemicarbazone (25) and 5-hydrazone (22) compounds carrying the 2-[(benzotriazol-1/2-yl)methyl]benzimidazole scaffold. These molecules proved to be the most effective antiviral agents, able to reach the potency profile of the licensed drug ribavirin. The molecular docking analysis explained the SAR of these compounds around their binding mode to the target RSV F protein, revealing the key contacts for further assessment. The herein-investigated benzimidazole-based derivatives may represent valuable hit compounds, deserving subsequent structural improvements towards more efficient antiviral agents for the treatment of pathologies caused by these human respiratory viruses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The benzimidazole scaffold is a structural isostere of naturally occurring nucleobases. Many approved drugs bear a benzimidazole ring as their main unit or important substructure [1, 2] . Benzimidazole-based agents are also considered for antimicrobial purposes, such as antituberculosis, antiprotozoan or antiviral activities [3, 4] . Maribavir, a benzimidazole riboside with strong activity against cytomegalovirus (HCMV), is undergoing Phase III evaluation (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02927067 and NCT02931539) ( Figure 1 ). Different substitutions on the benzimidazole nucleus of maribavir were reported to entail activity against flaviviruses, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [5] . Besides, a few non-nucleoside benzimidazole derivatives interfering with RSV F protein-mediated fusion, namely, JNJ-2408068 (R-170591), BMS-433771 and TMC353121, have reached a far stage of (pre)clinical development, but have been halted after a negative outcome [6, 7] (Figure 1 ). Two FDA-approved inhibitors of the HCV NS5A protein, pibrentasvir and after a negative outcome [6, 7] (Figure 1 ). Two FDA-approved inhibitors of the HCV NS5A protein, pibrentasvir and velpatasvir, contain a benzimidazole nucleus (Figure 1 ). The benzimidazole derivative B5, under clinical evaluation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, was shown to delay HCV infection in a humanized mouse model [8] (Figure 1 ). The literature further contains examples of other benzimidazole derivatives with activity against unrelated viruses, such as influenza virus or poliovirus. Another chemical entity with relevance for antimicrobial drug development is the (thio)semicarbazone moiety. Compounds containing this structure may interfere with processes that are essential for microbe survival, such as deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, bacterial cell wall synthesis or maintenance of thiol content [9, 10] . Interest in their antiviral properties dates back to the discovery of methysazone (Marboran \u00ae ), which was used to treat smallpox prior to its global eradication [11] . More recent studies have reported activity against other poxviruses, herpes simplex virus or influenza virus [12] .

Interestingly, this featured H-bonds between the thiosemicarbazone function and E487, while the benzotriazolyl group and the amine chain moved far from the corresponding heteroaromatic group and hydrazone moiety of the analogue 25 (see Figure S1 ). On the other hand, even if this kind of positioning was in agreement with that previously discussed for the effective analogue 22, it was unable to detect the same contacts displayed by 22 probably because of the different docking mode driven by the benzotriazol-1-yl skeleton in place of the benzotriazole-2-yl one of 25. Accordingly, compound 19 exhibited a comparable docking mode with that of the analogue 21, lacking the key contacts with F137 at the thiosemicarbazone moiety or amine chain group ( Figure S2) . Finally, the introduction of the smaller phenyl ring instead of the benzotriazolyl core at position two of the benzimidazole main ring (compound 4) moved the amine chain towards the protein's deep crevice delimited by T397 while the phenyl moiety detected \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking with F137, missing any H-bonds with this residue.
