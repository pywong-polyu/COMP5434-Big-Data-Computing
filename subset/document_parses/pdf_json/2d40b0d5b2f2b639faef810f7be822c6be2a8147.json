There was no observable trend in the search behavior in the days leading up to the announcements, suggesting the first \"local\" case indeed heightened the collective attention to the pandemic. However, the increased level of information seeking faded within 2 wk, even though many announcements of school closures or other mitigation strategies followed, suggesting that increased attention is only short-lived. This is consistent with no observable trend in the sense of urgency prior to the local announcement. Fig. 2 shows the event studies of internet search for 1) symptoms and treatments, 2) hand sanitizer and diagnostic tests, 3) coordinated responses, and 4) narratives that undermine public responses.

To investigate information spillovers in which states respond to epidemics in other states, we examined augmented models that controlled for the timing of the announcements of Washington, Illinois, California, and Arizona, as well as for the timing of the earliest announcement among a state's neighbor states [section A of additional results at https://github. com/anabento/GoogleBehaviorCovid (9)]. The results show that COVID-19 searches responded to Washington's first case (Dataset S1, column 2), to first case announcements in other states that occurred in January (Dataset S1, column 3), and to announcements in neighboring states (Dataset S1, column 4). These results indicate some spillovers, but the main conclusions regarding the effect of a state's own first case remains. Each state may experience different treatment effects of the first COVID-19 cases on online searches. Therefore, we present single-state time series of search volumes in figure B-2 in additional results available at https://github.com/anabento/GoogleBehaviorCovid (9), to descriptively depict the treatment effect heterogeneity. The results suggest that information-seeking responses were larger and faster in late states compared to the early states. We checked whether the findings were driven by accessed date of the data by rerunning the analysis using the latest search output from Google Trends, which we retrieved on April 18, 2020 and compared to the current results using the data retrieved on March 20, 2020 [https://github.com/ anabento/GoogleBehaviorCovid (9) ]. These core results were not sensitive to this replication.",

We find that announcements of first cases have the biggest effect on searches for basic information about the virus and its symptoms, suggesting that people attempt to educate themselves about COVID-19 and its effects. However, first case reports do not lead to a differential increase in searches involving large-scale NPIs (e.g., school and workplace closures) that will likely have important consequences for everyday life. This may be because first cases are reported relatively early in the epidemic when many of these more serious mitigation strategies are not yet part of public discourse. Finally, although one might expect official news to reduce concerns related to false messages, we do not find much indication that state announcements of first COVID-19 cases affect searches questioning whether the epidemic may be a hoax. Overall, our analysis of internet search data suggests that government information disclosure does help focus public attention on the crisis. Our evidence also indicates that people seem to mainly react by seeking information on what they can and should do in response to the epidemic. One conjecture is that policy makers may be able to take advantage of a brief period of active information seeking following focal events (first cases and first deaths) to provide clear advice regarding the actions people can undertake to avoid risk.",

This study has, indeed, several limitations. First, our state-level data from Google Trends database do not allow us to adequately understand intrastate variation of search volumes following the announcements or to generalize conclusions about population search behavior (as Google Trends only captures the search behavior of a particular segment of information seekers). Second, the major issues with search query data-long-term drift and representation bias across geographic regions-does not come into play in our study because we focus on responses in a short time window surrounding the government announcements. The third limitation comes from potential confounding factors in our event study framework, including anticipatory behavior and unobservable local events (15) . We mitigate these concerns by controlling for the timing of the announcements of Washington, Illinois, California, and Arizona as well as for the timing of the earliest announcement among a state's neighbor states, in several sensitivity analyses.",
