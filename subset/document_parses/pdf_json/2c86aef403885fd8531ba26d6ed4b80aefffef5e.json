COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on people of color and has shown profound economic challenges, including pushing low-income and self-employed people with diabetes to self-ration supplies in order to reduce costs. On a more positive note, the pandemic has served as an accelerant for innovation with telehealth and the sharing of data, which have become indispensable tools to manage diabetes during the time of COVID-19. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has rapidly assembled a robust response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including: (1) healthcare education with a series of webinars from a core leadership team of experts that shared early learnings on inpatient and outpatient care, team-based approaches, patient empowerment, and mental health; (2) new research funding (see Table 1 ); and (3) patient resources. Some of the important questions that need to be answered include: (1) the role of inpatient glycemic control for hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; (2) the impact of corticosteroids in patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia; and (3) the interplay between kidney disease and COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. The potential that COVID-19 has to increase the risk of diabetes after recovery and which specific diabetes medications may have a role in COVID-19 infection treatment also require further research.",

Individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. In 2020, after the start of the pandemic, the number of deaths exceeded the mean number of deaths for the corresponding weeks in the preceding three years in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), as seen in Figures 2(a) and (b), which present data from the UK. Mortality for patients with COVID-19 and diabetes increases substantially with age, as seen in Figure 3 , which also presents data from the UK. The presence of poor glycemic control both in patients with T1D and T2D is associated with higher mortality from COVID-19. 5 Obesity has been identified as an important risk factor for morbidity, and there is a correlation between body mass index (BMI) and poor clinical outcomes, such as need for mechanical ventilation or death, as seen in Figures 4(a) and (b). Additionally, age, male sex, and excess adiposity have been influencing factors in the cytokine storm seen during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to disproportionally affect racial minorities. 6 These findings have created areas of research interest that could help clinicians better manage at-risk or affected patients.

The 1918 influenza pandemic, caused by an H1N1 virus, affected approximately 500 million people worldwide, with an estimated 50 million deaths globally and 675,000 deaths in the USA. 11 There are several similarities between 1918 influenza pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, including the sudden appearance of an unexpected disease, rapid and widespread increases in cases and deaths, lack of effective pharmacologic interventions, sudden implementation of public health measures with significant regional variability, and inconsistent recommendations from medical authorities. Public health measures focused on individual and organizational behavior modifications. Anti-crowding measures (cancellations and postponements of large events, gatherings, other activities, school closures, etc.), physical distancing (also called social distancing), hand hygiene, and masks were all measures that were recommended in 1918, and when implemented, helped to slow the spread of disease and limit suffering, disease, and death. 12 It is also worth noting that the 1918 influenza pandemic occurred while many Western nations were involved in World War I. Governments around the world tried to control information by obscuring infection and mortality rates and pushed nationalistic messaging and activities. In the USA, public media contributed to these efforts along with government agencies like the Woodrow Wilson Administration's Committee on Public Information, which explicitly sought to hide infections and minimize risks to enhance the war effort. Despite these similarities, there are several key differences between the 1918 and 2020 pandemics. These include much-improved technology for diagnosis and treatment, more awareness of the distinctions between diseases, and recognition of the importance of testing as a diagnostic tool. In addition, we now have an information ecosystem that is more rapid and decentralized. Political polarization fostering mistrust of health policy measures, while not new as a phenomenon, seems to have a larger impact in 2020 than 1918. Finally, while the 1918 influenza epidemic resolved by 1919, the current epidemic is anticipated to last for months and even years, according to some estimates.",

            "text": "Diabetes confers a three-fold increase in risk of severe outcomes (defined as hospitalization, ICU admission, intubation, or death) compared to individuals without the disease. 13 Many of the common comorbidities of T2D, including hypertension (HTN), obesity, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease, further compound the risk of severe outcomes, up to five-fold greater than the general population. Conditions that increase the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 patients are shown in Figure 5 . Some studies suggest that aggressive control of diabetes may result in better outcomes. 14 Although individuals with diabetes are more likely to contract certain infections because of immune dysregulation, diabetes does not appear to confer a greater risk for contracting COVID-19, though there are insufficient data to definitively rule this out. Additional social factors, which are yet to be defined, appear to place persons with diabetes at increased risk of exposure and infection. There are several other identified risk factors for COVID-19 that are also commonly associated with diabetes: older age, overweight and obesity, male sex, nonwhite race/ethnicity (specifically, Native American, Black, South Asian, and Latinx), and two or more chronic conditions. Obesity in particular seems to be a major factor (85% of individuals with T2D have obesity). Obesity may be linked to increased disease severity through several mechanisms, including underlying impairment of the cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and thrombotic pathways, a pro-inflammatory or dysregulated immune response, and potentially increased viral shedding. 16 Obese adults may also have more difficulty with effective treatment such as prone positioning, which can delay intubation and improve outcomes once ventilated. 17 Biologically, estrogen may have protective effects and may explain, at least in part, some of the gender-based differences. 18 The immune-stimulatory genes encoded from the two X-chromosomes in women versus one X-and one Y-chromosome in men also influence the gender-based difference. Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) have been implicated as key molecules in SARS-CoV-2 infection. 19, 20 The relative overexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in men may contribute to their increased viral load and decreased viral clearance capacity. Men, compared to women, are characterized by an increased intrinsic propensity to meta-inflammation leading to cytokine storm. These hypotheses can be tested in further epidemiological observation. Careful targeting of the renin-angiotensin system axis and cytokine storm may represent a strategy for improving clinical outcomes in people with diabetes infected with COVID-19.",

There have also been methodological concerns about many of the studies published. 22 More rigorous and systematic studies will be needed to fully understand the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19, and how it impacts people with diabetes. 23 The differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across different communities in the USA has both highlighted and exacerbated the underlying health inequities driven by SDoH. Early on in the pandemic, it became obvious that Black, Latinx, and low-income communities experienced disproportionate morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. 27, 28 By leveraging large, national datasets, it is possible to explore many of the SDoH that influence COVID-19. A recent study by Debopadhaya et al 29 explored the association of various social determinants with COVID-19 mortality at the county level across the entire USA. They found that high rates of lacking insurance, limited English proficiency, air pollution, overcrowded housing, and lower educational attainment were all associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. Communities with large Black or African American and Latinx populations also had higher mortality. Interestingly, the study also found some protective factors without an obvious causal relationship. Communities with higher rates of suicide and excessive drinking seem to experience less COVID-19 mortality. This may be related to preexisting social isolation that, while contributing to deaths of despair, may reduce COVID-19 transmission. Communities with high asthma rates also seemed to have a lower mortality ratio. One possible explanation for this might be that the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of asthma may improve COVID-19 outcomes. 30 SDoH results in social stressors, such as anxiety about food availability and paying rent. Income insecurity, food insecurity, and housing insecurity have all been identified as survival threats for COVID-19. From a policy perspective, we should consider unaddressed SDoH as threats for new infections, and these should be taken on not only by providers, but at the local, state, and federal policy levels. Testing policies and resources should take into consideration existing inequities of access and trust in order to meaningfully reach underserved and marginalized communities. Food and water distribution is critical, and will require collaboration across sectors, including philanthropies, churches, healthcare, and local governments. A systematic approach to addressing SDoH will help reduce the inequities we are observing in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.",

COVID-19 cases and deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in all six of the geographic regions recognized by the WHO (Figure 6 ). It is predicted that moving forward, COVID-19 will establish itself as one of our seasonal coronaviruses and become endemic. People with diabetes and other individuals at highest risk of morbidity and mortality from this virus will continue to face challenges even with the development of a vaccine, because the vaccine will likely not provide sterilizing immunity. High-risk individuals will need to continually assess their risk of morbidity and mortality. We should expect more pandemics and infectious disease emergencies. In the future, we need to focus our efforts on pandemic preparedness. This should include: (1) earlier and more aggressive efforts to characterize and identify unknown diagnoses quickly, (2) better containment strategies, and (3) consistent funding for pandemic preparedness.

The QBI Coronavirus Research Group (QCRG) was involved in generating a SARS-CoV-2 human protein-protein interaction map. Over 330 human proteins have been identified that are necessary for viral infection. Currently, 69 drugs and compounds have been identified that target these proteins, and a number of these have potential for being potent antivirals. 42 Similarly, global phosphorylation analysis in infected cells can identify potential therapies using kinase inhibitors. 43 Scientists have pinpointed several drugs that block the virus in lab tests, some of which are now in clinical trials. One drug, that looks particularly promising and was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical trials, is Zotatifin, 44,45 a translational initiation inhibitor. In the future, more drugs will need to be transitioned into clinical trials, and the interactions between different drugs should be studied. The role genetics plays in SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment should also be examined. Summary of Panel. People with diabetes have an increased risk at baseline for depression, anxiety, and other psychological issues that can make it difficult to care for themselves. Diabetes in itself can be a psychologically taxing disease, and when you layer on it all the necessary alterations in lifestyle and accessibility to services that come with the pandemic, it is understandable that patients with diabetes will be affected. There are not many published reports so far on the magnitude of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with diabetes. However, there are many reports 46, 47 showing increased anxiety, depression, and distress in the general population of adults and children. Likely predictors for increased psychological stress in this population include a change in social support (less, different types), limited resilience, being already overwhelmed (life stress, poverty, and baseline depression), increased emphasis on achieving better glycemic control, and trouble accessing diabetes care teams. HCPs can help in a number of ways. First, HCPs should label and normalize their patients' concerns. Patients should be assured that it is understandable and reasonable that they feel this way. Next, providers should encourage a compassionate discussion about risk and help patients identify needs and safety precautions. HCPs can help by recommending simple behavioral strategies to their patients, which may include encouraging patients to follow their daily routines as much as possible, to reach out for social support as needed, and to engage in physical activity. \u2022 \u2022 Patient and staff preparation for effective remote diabetes visits: comprehensive data gathering by the patient with coaching by staff before the visit will improve the quality of the visit. \u2022 \u2022 Assessing glycemia is \"all about the numbers,\" so remote connection and HCP access to meaningful glycemic data, facilitated by cloud-based systems, are critical to allow optimal interventions. \u2022 \u2022 Seeing patients in the office requires careful assessment of local conditions where the patient lives, how they must travel, the location of the diabetes facility, and setting up a clinic environment that protects patients and staff. This can be done by emphasizing pre-visit risk screening, physical distancing, effective masking, avoiding patient grouping, enhanced cleaning of surfaces, and minimizing administrative tasks that can be carried out remotely.",

Table 3 lists six actions for conducting clinical research to protect subjects who are participating in clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reducing the complications of diabetes through self-management education and medications has always been the overarching goal of diabetology. Because poorly controlled diabetes is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19, the pandemic provides a heightened sense of urgency for our patients to optimally manage their blood sugars and to improve other contributing comorbid conditions, such as obesity. Drastic measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as stay-at home orders, face masks, and social distancing, have forced clinicians to rethink the way diabetes care is delivered. The initial response has come largely in the form of virtual telemedicine visits, enabled by the data-sharing capability of digital diabetes tools such as continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and insulin pumps. Furthermore, triage algorithms have been introduced to assist with prioritizing which types of patients should be evaluated in a timely manner and which can be postponed. 48, 49 Such algorithms might potentially be configured to empower the management of entire populations by better allocating limited resources to patients most in need. Finally, the reach of remote care is growing to include patient education, clinical research, and even some routine screening services such as specimen collection.",

Remote consultations need to be an option for all users and all consultations, and the concept of a consultation should include a \"before,\" a \"during,\" and an \"after\" part. \u2022 \u2022 More and more patients are now collecting relevant health information in addition to data on blood glucose (BG) and medication use as part of their daily lives ( Figure 8 ). This additional patient-gathered data should be used when patients and HCPs meet. Identify key members of the Institutional Review Board to quickly accommodate protocol changes and approval for essential visits Use video or phone as much as possible, having participants come in only for essential study activities (such as electrocardiography, phlebotomy, etc.) Work remotely with participants to download devices from home as much as possible Implement Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Actauthorized electronic-signature methods to avoid print-and-sign Convert many paper forms to \"fillable\" forms that could be completed remotely Arrange with the IT department to allow study monitors remote access to the electronic medical record Summary of Panel. The widespread, rapid implementation of telehealth has been a bright spot amidst the darkness of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the increased amount of data that patients track using various smart devices ( Figure 8 ), there is the potential of remotely accessing more types of patient data by HCPs, even after the pandemic. Diabetes is particularly well-suited for remote and asynchronous care thanks to the growing use of smartphone-connected tools such as CGMs, insulin pumps, and smart insulin pens. Furthermore, reimbursement codes now exist in the USA that incentivize providers to provide services such as virtual check-ins (G2012, G2010) and chronic care management (99490, 99487, 99489, G0506). However, innovation alone is not the answer. Any solution must be designed from idea to execution with a clear focus in mind. For example, while technology is often looked to as an equalizer for social or economic disparities in healthcare, these barriers can only be overcome with intentionality. Otherwise, technology can, in fact, further widen the gaps between those with resources and those with limited access. Another pain point with diabetes technology originates from diabetes device companies that force patients to keep their health data within their own ecosystems, creating dreaded \"data silos.\" This practice is hostile to patients and can only detract from their care by making it harder to integrate multiple streams of data that are necessary for clinical decision-making.",

The use of CGMs and remote wireless monitoring through glucose-telemetry has allowed for the potential for improved glycemic control, 50 decrease in nursing workload, and decreased exposure risk. 51, 52 In April 2020, the FDA allowed discretion of enforcement for two CGM manufacturers to provide devices and technical support to hospitals and other healthcare facilities for off-label use to support COVID-19 healthcare-related efforts during the current pandemic. 53, 54 It is unclear how long this enforcement discretion will last. An example of a glucose telemetry system is shown in Figure 9 . Patients with COVID-19 infection and diabetes could initiate using CGM devices or continue using existing outpatient CGM systems after consultation with appropriate inpatient teams (diabetes service/endocrinology) and once appropriate implementation (nurse training) has taken place. 54 Several case reports/series have been published, demonstrating the initial feasibility of remote glucose monitoring and insulin adjustment based on monitoring with a CGM. [55] [56] [57] In addition, CSII/AID systems could also be utilized in selected patient populations in both the ICU and floor settings to potentially improve glycemic outcomes and reduce work burden. 51, 58 However, implementation of any of these technologies requires an approach that is collaborative/teambased and allows for close follow-up and adaptation if needed over time. Known and unknown potential sources of error (environment, technique, interference, clinical states such as anemia and hypotension, or delayed results) need to be closely monitored. 59 Implementation barriers, such as establishing appropriate algorithms, stakeholder alignment, technology components (Wi-Fi), and data integration, should be addressed prior to implementation. In the ICU, various approaches that use POC devices and CGMs have been evaluated. In the first phase, until sensor validation is obtained or until the first 24 hours, frequent POC glucose testing is performed, which is used for insulin adjustment. In the next phases, while the patient is still in the ICU, CGM readings are used for insulin titration, where POC testing is performed as adjunctive glucose measurements. In the final phase, when patients are transferred to the non-ICU setting, CGM readings are used mainly for insulin adjustment with POC performed infrequently, as needed. Glucometrics and use of glucose telemetry present an invaluable opportunity to monitor critical information about clinical outcomes in patients with hyperglycemia, diabetes, and COVID-19. ",

Applying data for risk stratification could streamline care; as an example, previous insulin use has been strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality, while being older, male, and obese has also increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19. 62 Protocols, which could specify use of subcutaneous insulin for treating DKA, can be utilized for COVID-19-related care with the goal of both preserving ICU beds and decreasing face-to-face time. 60, 62 However, both utility and implementation successes and failures across systems and across countries will need to be studied closely. Inpatient glucose/diabetes consultations are clearly increasing in the COVID-19 era, and remote glycemic management can expand access, while allowing for both practicality and speed without forsaking quality. Virtual care is also being explored, and telehealth and virtual visits could deliver optimal care regardless of circumstance, while also allowing for increased capacity. Bedside tablets, e-consults, virtual glucose management services, and even phone calls can be utilized to complete telehealth visits or hybrid visits day-to-day depending on the hospital volume.",

            "text": "While technology can be critical to improving care during these challenging times, the potential benefit of any new interventions or workflows must be weighed against the possibility of introducing new safety risks. Major changes that do not rely on known infrastructure and training could increase the risk of errors. Simple approaches such as clustering care in both ICU and other care units should be used, and special efforts should be made to cluster glucose checks, food delivery, insulin dosing, and delivery of other potentially necessary interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic has left some areas in the USA with scarce resources. In response, CSC triage protocols from the past were reinstituted with the goal to provide more utilitarian care. These CSC triage protocols evolved throughout the USA to lessen discrimination, but concerns were still raised about age and disability discrimination, including against chronic diseases such as diabetes. Initial assessments have now replaced specific criteria for triage to address some of these concerns. It is possible this could have a greater and potentially more disparate impact on our older patients or patients with diabetes, especially those older adults with diabetes. 63 The need for equitable care must be balanced and should not allow for possible discrimination. Figure  10 . While there are differences in the reported sensitivity rates (94.4% to >97.5%), reported specificity has been in an acceptable range. Some of the reasons that can explain the false negative results of the tests is the quality of the nasopharyngeal swab samples as well as the timing of the tests, especially in the early stages of the COVID-19 infection. This is because adequate viral load needs to be present for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Prolonged positivity poses another challenge because this makes testing harder to interpret in order to distinguish a cure from active disease. Overall, the performance of the nucleic acid amplification tests should be framed against their particular clinical context, depending on whether they are used for screening, diagnosis, or identifying a cure. Screening tests aims to detect infected individuals before symptoms develop, while diagnostic tests are used to confirm infection in individuals who are demonstrating symptoms. 64 Serology assays represent additional options and can identify those who have been exposed (sensitivity 80%-97%). However, they are also limited because they only identify individuals who have produced antibodies. Antibody tests are highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 by detecting antibodies in a blood sample. The antibody target is usually either the nucleocapsid or spike proteins of SARS- These children were also more likely to be hospitalized for DKA and less likely to use insulin pumps. Among those who were confirmed COVID-19 positive, 80% of those hospitalized were Black or Latinx. Those who were hospitalized (n = 20) were more likely to have public insurance, less likely to use CGMs, and had higher DKA rates. Therefore, improving care among children with diabetes is extremely important during the current crisis. Evidence from the pre-COVID-19 era showed that telehealth can be a promising tool among adolescents and young adults with T1D, because it leads to increased visit frequency and improved psychosocial outcomes without increasing total cost. During the current COVID-19 period, those patients who were monitored by telehealth missed fewer appointments and had similar satisfaction to that of those being seen in person. Additionally, HCPs experienced higher satisfaction rates with telehealth compared with in-person care. However, in order to widely adopt telehealth, we need to overcome socioeconomic and technological barriers and challenges. We need to (1) design new models for providing patient support, (2) advocate for permanent legislative changes, (3) publish outcomes and treatment recommendations, and (4) focus on inequities and disparities in healthcare.",

Higher BMI values were found to be associated with more severe disease and adverse outcomes. 67 Transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur, 68 and SARS-CoV-2 has been also identified in human milk. 69 The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way that we manage pregnant patients with diabetes. Telemedicine visits increased from 0% to 60% of all routine prenatal and postnatal care visits (James Bernasko: unpublished data). Maternal surveillance is performed by reviewing glucose logs remotely, while fetal surveillance has to be individualized, based on maternal glycemic control. Healthcare challenges have led to delayed diagnosis of GDM, delayed treatment, and decreased time to prevent complications. The current crisis has made lifestyle changes difficult to achieve, because food access has become a major concern. Limited food access is due to financial and other constraints. The pandemic has also made it harder to exercise at a gymnasium. Enhanced access burdens have been described, including (1) delayed entry to prenatal care or enrollment in pregnancy-based Medicaid, (2) reduced availability of social support services, and (3) greater challenges accessing medications. Telehealth disparities pose important challenges because many low-income pregnant patients with diabetes cannot afford wireless Bluetoothenabled BG monitors and have limited or no in-house internet connection, leading to decreased healthcare access.",

A better approach is to utilize low intensity services with higher frequency, an option that telehealth can offer, with a goal of preventing rather than treating diabetes-related complications. During the COVID-19 crisis, total outpatient visits decreased overall, as illustrated in Figure 11 (a). In contrast, because of implemented changes by policymakers, the proportion of telemedicine visits rose rapidly early in the pandemic, then plateaued, and later slightly decreased, compared to the highest achieved levels. This pattern is illustrated in Figure 11 (b). These changes were not seen in all specialties, because some HCPs saw an overall increase and others a decrease in the total number of healthcare visits in their specialties. Key factors that led to telehealth success were (1) reduction of barriers to access care, (2) increased opportunities for patients to be more engaged with their healthcare, (3) frequent follow-up visits, (4) easier medication titrations, and (5) decreased no-show rates. Even for the subset of patients that require face-to-face visits, those individuals can be more easily identified and stratified at the initial telehealth visits.

Dexcom worked with the FDA early in the pandemic to provide devices and technical support to hospitals who ordered CGMs for off-label use. 54 They then provided training and support for hospitals using their system and tracked new COVID-19 cases to predict where hospital requests for CGMs would come from. Glytec Systems similarly expedited implementation of their insulin management software and rollout of software support. They are facilitating site collaboration for shared learning in the adoption of technology-driven management strategies. Roche Diagnostics is attempting to address the demand for diagnostic testing, which has continued to outpace supply, by striving for a faster turnaround of high-quality, consistent, and high-volume testing and bringing new innovative diagnostics to market. Sanofi has responded to the lack of an approved vaccine ready for sufficient distribution to meet global demand by facilitating collaboration between various companies and academia. Importantly, vaccine manufacturers noted that speed cannot compromise safety in vaccine development, but they are already preparing for eventual approvals. Finally, a market analysis revealed that the biggest technology shift during COVID-19 has come from CGM use. Expanded use of digital strategies for clinical management was noted to be a primary focus of future innovation in medical technology. 71 NIOSH recognizes a hierarchy of five controls to mitigate or eliminate hazards, which is depicted in Figure 12 . From most effective to least effective, the five controls are as follows: (1) elimination, which removes a hazard (such as social isolation and vaccines), has been noted to have the greatest potential for effective control of contagious viruses; (2) effective substitution, which replaces a hazard with a less hazardous agent (such as by administering a drug that prevents viral replication and effectively substituting a less dangerous virus for a more dangerous virus) is currently not a viable control for COVID-19; (3) engineering controls, which isolate people from a hazard (such as ventilation and physical barriers), require time to implement; (4) administrative controls, which change how people act (such as telecommuting, staggered schedules, and hand hygiene), can be implemented quickly but depend upon compliance; and (5) PPE, which puts a barrier between a person and a hazard, serves as the least effective but most widely used control, and if the equipment fails, then the worker can be exposed to the hazard. Building on theoretical guidelines to control hazards, CDC has issued comprehensive guidance on optimizing PPE use. 72 CDC also provides a variety of strategies that can be employed based on PPE capacity, from conventional (when supply meets demand) to contingency (anticipated shortages) to crisis (when supply cannot meet demand). Even with official guidance designed to plan for infection control and management, panelists noted that many healthcare organizations faced a sharp uptick in the need for PPE and a resultant shortage during the pandemic. Different facilities are known to have different needs and availability of PPE (for instance, well-resourced facilities or emergency rooms tend to have a greater supply, while smaller or hospice facilities tend to have a lesser supply). Early in the pandemic, organizations attempted to engage in manual exchange of equipment, but issues of speed and equity in manual allocation prompted the development of a nonprofit organization \"Get Us PPE,\" which provides donated PPE at no cost to frontline workers and under-resourced communities with a sense of urgency and a focus on equity. 73 This organization employs matching algorithms to ensure optimal and efficient resource deployment. Organization data suggest early successes in efficient PPE allocation.",

They also reported, in some cases, to have severe prolonged symptoms after their recovery. While one person had a mild case of COVID-19 that was initially diagnosed as influenza, the other three reported a more severe illness, with two requiring hospitalization. Consistent with published clinical studies, their experiences emphasized that having good glycemic control was helpful for their recovery, but they also noted that the illness caused elevated glucose concentrations that were difficult to manage. Beyond the lasting physical effects of their infections, there was also a substantial impact on their mental well-being. Some experienced survivor's guilt and anxiety/fear around the potential for reinfection. All four expressed gratitude for the care they received in the inpatient setting and from their regular HCPs during and after COVID-19.",

Our hospital staff and patients wear masks, measure their body temperature twice daily, and use antiseptic on their hands.

Now, hospital services are getting back to normal, but medical tourism services and consultations for international patients are still postponed. In addition, we conduct PCR tests for COVID-19 for all patients who are going to have surgery at the hospital to avoid and detect in-hospital infection. So far, none of our staff, including medical professionals at the hospital, has contracted COVID-19 because of the high compliance with hospital guidelines. All staff members are not allowed to visit crowded places or dine with non-household groups in or out of the hospital. \u2022 \u2022 EUAs are expected to be implemented in Japan; so far, remdesivir has received fast-track approval, but there are several pre-conditions necessary for fasttrack approval.

With a lack of consistent, accurate information from a single reliable source of authority, there has been a general failure in communicating important messages to the public. Furthermore, communication with the public should be focused on benefits rather than details to incentivize people to follow guidelines and safe practices. The pandemic has also highlighted underlying, preexisting issues in healthcare delivery in the USA, including socioeconomic and race disparities, inaccessibility of healthcare services, and shortcomings of employer-based health insurance. As the pandemic situation evolves, it is key to have flexibility in regulation. However, there might be unforeseen risks with overly flexible policy implementation, so foresight and thorough analysis are necessary. Successful policy changes so far have included collaborations at many levels between government agencies, such as CDC, NIH, the FDA, CMS, other public and/or private healthcare agencies and enterprises, caretakers, researchers, and the general public. CMS has covered telehealth and diabetes prevention programs during the pandemic. For the future, we will need to remember the issues that arose during the current pandemic and amend how we handle them both to prepare for a second wave and to improve the general health of the public. Table 5 shows policies and actions during the COVID-19 pandemic that worked at the Federal, State, and regional levels (panel A), plus policies and actions that did not work (panel B) and that really did not work (panel C). Some specific policies that are now needed include: (1) better and more nimble national surveillance systems, (2) more effective nationally coordinated public health response policies, (3) attention and research devoted to addressing the socioeconomic disparities in health, (4) universally accessible healthcare, (5) stronger primary care and independent institutions, (6) unified messages that are focused on individuals as well as the public, and (7) stronger public trust of the government and science.",

Specifically, their time out-of-range has decreased since schools were closed in the spring of 2020, suggesting the stay-at-home protocol actually provided a better opportunity for the children to stay in range. Similar data have been reported from Spain 77 and Italy 78 ; however, a study from Israel showed that glycemic metrics for children who use CGMs were similar before and after lockdown started. 79 The panel also highlighted that big data from digital health devices is only useful if you can use it to impact care.

Special consideration is needed for pediatric populations for whom existing privacy protections are lax/ missing, and for members of demographic groups at risk from healthcare and social disparities.

Addressing barriers related to fundamental differences in beliefs about the importance of privacy, commitment to its protection, and values for balancing technical and business innovation with citizen protections need to be addressed. Understanding the sociology of these issues and fostering robust collaborations and shared understanding is as, if not more, important than understanding the technologies.",

            "text": "Summary of Panel. The panel discussed patient surveillance using mobile applications, also known as apps, and the importance of building trustworthy apps that protect the privacy of their users. The first app discussed was the COVID-19 Symptom Study mobile app (Figure 18(a) ), which provides real-time pandemic epidemiology. This smartphone app does not have contact tracing, which would involve tracking patients who have been exposed and/or who have tested positive for COVID-19 as well as warning those who have been exposed to individuals who may be carrying the virus. 83 There are no passive data collected from the usersthe only data that are collected are what each participant voluntarily provides. Participants are made aware of the data that will be collected. The app was designed to be easy to use and not time-consuming, with the patient describing how they are feeling. It provided early real-time insight into COVID-19 epidemiology with identification of hot zones using provided zip code data. However, this mobile app has had limitations because of sampling and selection bias and study access. 84 Additionally, patient surveillance must account for social science aspects, including (1) how can the technology be trusted (because some of the most vulnerable are also the most suspicious), (2) who would be using the tool, (3) how the questions are asked, and (4) what is the sequence of the questions. A mobile tool is not valuable if it is not used, so it is important to make the app trustworthy and accessible. A mobile platform for virtual COVID-19 screening developed at Vanderbilt University ( Figure 18 [b]) was designed with all of these social science considerations in mind. It is also critical to consider and understand the public perception of risk to develop an app that will be well-received and widely used. When designing patient surveillance tools, it is important to understand the pandemic as a developing situation, rather than a single event, to ensure that the tool will stay relevant and continue to be used by the intended populations. Finally, security exposure notifications were discussed in the context of Google and Apple working together to design a system that alerts people if they were exposed to an individual that was COVID-19-positive. To protect the users' privacy, the system must be trustworthy in terms of putting privacy first and cannot ask for locations or identifying information from the individuals who use the system. Informed consent and transparency is of utmost importance when it comes to building trust between the user and the app. Privacy is a key driver of well-being and a patient safety concern (particularly for children for whom regulatory controls governing privacy are poorly developed). Disclosure/ breach of privacy has the potential to create harm and widen health disparities. For example, disclosure of preexisting health conditions can place patients at a disadvantage for employment, housing, life insurance, and other opportunities. It may exacerbate stigma. The language of privacy protections and terms of use can be inscrutable, making it especially hard for persons with lower levels of education to understand them, and contributing to inequalities. Privacy is an international commodity-insofar as regulatory standards for protecting health and personally identifiable information including in the setting of apps and digital health tools vary across countries and global regions. This inconsistency can create barriers to international cooperation. Both the competitiveness of businesses and the capacity of health surveillance efforts are affected by differences in standards for protecting privacy -these differences have created potential for conflict and competing interests or a \"trade war\" and \"standards war\" that centers on privacy. Such conflict erodes the level of cooperation needed to handle health threats, a problem that is especially acute in the setting of a global pandemic. Some formulations of privacy prioritize the wishes and needs of the patient, while others place emphasis on decision making that centers on the need to know and value of information sharing with respect to population health. At the end of the day, both are essential, not just one or the other and effective privacy protections will need to balance concern for these issues within a system.",
