However, the prevalence of clinically significant thrombotic complications in patients with milder symptoms is less clear, and the relative risk imparted by COVID-19 compared to other thrombotic risk factors is unknown. We report a case series of three young patients with confirmed COVID-19 and PE, who presented to the same small, suburban emergency department (ED) over a one-week period. The ED sees an average of 32,000 visits per year, and had approximately 200 confirmed cases of COVID-19 by the time of the last case. The patients had previously been diagnosed with COVID-19, and due to their relatively mild symptoms (including no exertional symptoms and no desaturation), they had been discharged home after ED visits in the previous two weeks. None of the patients had pre-existing comorbidities for venous thromboembolism. We explore their presentations in detail, in order to alert clinicians to the heightened risk of PE in all patients with COVID-19, not only those with critical presentations.",

            "text": "Critically ill patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome have been observed to have a high frequency of PE, as well as diffuse intravascular coagulation. 1-3 Several mechanisms have been proposed for these findings, including inflammatory cytokine production, vascular endothelial disruption within the lungs, and hyaline microemboli formation, which may be complementary factors. This multifactorial coagulopathy likely has an additive effect to existing risk factors for PE in the critically ill, which include immobility, invasive procedures, respiratory failure, and mechanical ventilation. [4] [5] Accordingly, some authors have proposed using markers of coagulation, such as D-dimer, platelet count, and partial thromboplastin time as markers of disease severity. [6] [7] [8] Extrapulmonary vascular complications of COVID-19 have also been reported, including large-vessel strokes in young patients, and portal venous and mesenteric arterial thrombosis. 9-10 However, these thrombotic complications have 9 The patients in our case series are notable because despite having pulmonary emboli, their symptoms of both COVID-19 and PE were relatively mild, and none reported periods of immobility or other clear antecedent risk factors. This is particularly concerning in light of the fact that these patients were initially judged to have a low risk of PE via the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) [Table] . The PERC rule, introduced by Kline et al, is a well-validated decision tool for screening patients at low risk for PE, with the goal of reducing unnecessary CT imaging by avoiding the D-dimer test and its high rate of false positives. 11 The rate of PE among patients who are very low risk per the PERC rule is estimated to be less than 2%; thus, many clinicians use the rule in lieu of D-dimer screening for low-risk patients. Its use is widespread throughout emergency medicine. 12 While our findings represent a relatively small case series, when viewed in the larger context of coagulopathy seen in patients with COVID-19, they suggest that clinicians may need to view a diagnosis or presumed diagnosis of COVID-19 as an independent risk factor for PE, for which the PERC rule cannot be used in lieu of D-dimer testing. More research is needed to examine the ultimate validity of the PERC rule in this population. Considerable debate exists over the use of prophylactic anticoagulant use in patients with COVID-19, with recommendations depending on the degree of associated coagulopathy and inpatient status. [13] [14] [15] However, we do not believe that there are data to support such a recommendation for outpatients without either clear evidence of thrombosis or until we have a better understanding of the true prevalence of thrombosis in COVID-19.",
