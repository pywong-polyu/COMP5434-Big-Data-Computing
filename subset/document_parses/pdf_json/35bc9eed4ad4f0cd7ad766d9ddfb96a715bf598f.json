Fitted modified SEIR model provides the prediction of the disease progression in the near future, considering strict control interventions by means of social distancing and quarantine for infected and at-risk individuals introduced at the beginning of COVID-19 spread on February, 25 th by Croatian Ministry of Health. Assuming the accuracy of provided data and satisfactory representativeness of the model used, the basic reproduction number is derived.

Furthermore, both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are capable of being infectious carriers of SARS-CoV-2.

            "text": "In order to determine epidemic parameters, stochastic models are well adopted and preferred in the current research [5] , but during the initial stage of the epidemic, the data are sparse and the epidemic dynamics are better described using deterministic modeling. Generalizations of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model are used for China [6] , [7] and heavily affected parts of Europe [8] , [9] . However, due to the change of diagnostics and the lack of implementation of control measures in the initial stage of the outbreak, early published models were forced to add many free parameters and fit the data in multiple phases. Such complicated models are prone to over-fitting. This paper introduces the modified version of SEIR model with a single additional parameter to fit and implicitly included additional compartment for quarantined and self-isolated individuals. The paper is organized as follows: Section II outlines the mathematical modeling of COVID-19 and methods for predicting the spread of the mentioned disease; Section III is dedicated to the computational results and discussion; lastly, conclusion is presented in Section IV. Scraping of official data, the modified SEIR model fitting details and optimization method are given in Appendix A, while additional details on epidemic parameters are given in Appendix B. is a perfect candidate to simulate a propagation of a disease without much of a prior knowledge on a disease. The entire population, which is assumed to be constant in time (no vital dynamics by means of birth and death rate are taken into an account) is divided into 4 compartments. The rate of change over time for each compartment is expressed in terms of a set of 4 coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Note that the nature of differential equations dealing with time dependant quantities is to assume continuous variables, which is not the case for both the number of people and observed time steps. In order to obtain the discrete time equivalent, the changes of individuals in each compartment are modeled via a set of difference equations over an arbitrary discretetime step t (typically a day). It is worth emphasizing that the discretization of variables is usually carried out as a prequel to stochastic modeling [13] . Nevertheless, continuous compartmental models provide more detailed epidemic dynamics [6] , thus the modified SEIR model is defined in terms of the following set of ODEs:",

Using the estimated parameters of the fitted model, described in detail in Appendix B, reproduction number is calculated for different phases of the epidemic. The data are fitted using the iterative Limited-memory Broy-denFletcherGoldfarbShanno (L-BFGS) algorithm. Within this framework, for each optimization iteration, the set of ODEs (1)-(4) is solved by the 4 th order Runge-Kutta method. The optimization procedure and the solution of the set of ODEs are presented in more detail in section A. Fig. 6 depicts fitted modified SEIR model using different sizes of the train data set. Fig. 6a shows the model fitted using 80% of the data set, while the rest of the data are used in order to assess goodness of fit using the out-of-sample data, Fig. 6b shows the SEIR model fitted using 88% of the data set, while 6c deals with the complete data set. Fitting the data provides optimal values for epidemiological parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4. R 0 is then calculated for different phases of the epidemic and the resulting values are 1.43, 1.33 and 1.25 for 80% of the data, 88% of the data and the complete data set, respectively. These results imply the effectiveness of the control measures implemented to combat the epidemic as R 0 decreases with each increase of the data set. In case there is no change in control measures, one could infer that the positive downward trend will continue up until late April when the number of confirmed active infected cases will reach its maximum. The maximum point is also the inflection point indicating the moment at which R 0 < 1 and after which, with the retention of the control measures, the number of total confirmed cases stops increasing.",

Transmission parameters of the model are optimized using the available data on the number of confirmed, recovered and deceased individuals, respectively. The model assumes a sufficient percentage of a population q \u00b7 N being voluntarily self-isolated, shown in Fig. 1 . The percentages of self-isolated people, together with initial number of exposed, infected and recovered individuals are taken as initial values in order to solve the set of ODEs. The parameters are used to calculate R 0 for different stages of the spread of COVID-19 in Croatia. The values of R 0 improve as the data approach closer to April 11 th . At this point one considers the government control measures, implemented to slow down the disease spread, to be effective and should be continued until R 0 number decreases and remains sufficiently long period of time below the threshold value of 1.",
