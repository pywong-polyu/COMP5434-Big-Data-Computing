The IHCA-prone trajectory group was associated with a higher triage level and a higher mortality rate, compared to other trajectory groups. Except for the persistent hypothermia group, the other four trajectory groups were more likely to have higher levels of C-reactive protein, lactic acid, cardiac troponin I, and D-dimer. Multivariable analysis revealed that hypothermia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.20; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.35-3.57) and recurring tachypnea (aOR 2.44; 95%CI, 1.24-4.79) were independently associated with IHCA.",

Early recognition and prevention have been added as the first link in the Chain of Survival for IHCA (4) . Understanding the pre-IHCA physiological derangements, particularly longitudinal dynamic changes, would help clinicians recognize the patterns and the heterogeneous processes preceding the devastating event. Previous studies have utilized a snapshot of vital-sign data to predict IHCA (5, 6) . In clinical practice, intermittently measured snapshot vital-sign data sometimes cause confusion as to appropriate responses, especially when no prior data are compared or are too late for interventions (7) . Other studies have created summary measures for longitudinal vital-sign data (8) , or have monitored early warning summary scores over time (9) . As such, information is somewhat lost in terms of the dynamic changes of each vital sign over time, which may be more intuitive and clinically useful in phenotyping and prognosticating patients with IHCA. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) is an unsupervised modeling technique to identify hidden subpopulations comprising similar individuals (10) . To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has examined the latent trajectories of vital signs in patients with IHCA. Understanding the vital-sign change patterns prior to IHCA may gain lead time for appropriate interventions.",

For repeat visits, we selected the last visit per patient to maximize statistical power for the cardiac arrest analysis. If a patient had subsequent visits, it was much less likely that he/she suffered a cardiac arrest on a prior visit. We further excluded out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs), patients aged less than 18 years, or those who had less than three vital-sign measurements. At least three measurements would ensure the stability of longitudinal analysis, and therefore many EDOU patients were included. The subject selection process is shown in Figure 1 . ). The vital-sign measurements were from hour 0 (at ED triage) to the last measurement available or hour 191 (the timing of the last IHCA event), whichever occurred earlier. The vital-sign data were split into 1-h blocks, and if multiple measurements occurred in the 1-h block, the average value was used. The quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score at ED triage was calculated (13) . Selected laboratory test results were also retrieved, including C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic acid, cardiac Troponin I (cTnI), and D-dimer. The ED-based IHCA was identified via a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) code (i.e., treated cardiac arrest). All laboratory results were the earliest available data in the ED. For IHCA patients, laboratory data were restricted to those obtained prior to CPR.",

The Bayesian information criterion was used to choose the optimal number and form of trajectories. GBTM was performed using the traj package in Stata software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). After the unsupervised identification of longitudinal trajectories, we used supervised multivariable logistic regression to examine the independent association between the trajectory group memberships and ED-based IHCA, controlling for age, sex, and triage levels. To internally validate the identified trajectory groups, we bootstrapped the model 100 times to obtain the bias-corrected confidence intervals. All odds ratios (ORs) and beta-coefficients are presented with 95% CIs. To test if the trajectory groups using the early data could also relate to the occurrence of IHCA, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by restricting vital-sign measurements from 0 to 24h.",

Three to four trajectory groups per vital sign were identified by the trajectory modeling. For example, in the SBP category, three distinct trajectory groups were identified, representing \"normal\" (44% of patients), \"high, resolving\" (16%), and \"low, fluctuating\" (40%) SBP over time. Similarly, three trajectory groups were identified for the longitudinal HR data. Notably, four trajectory groups were identified in the body temperature category, representing \"hypothermia\" (16%), \"normal\" (50%), \"high, resolving\" (26%), \"very high, resolving\" (8%) groups. For the longitudinal RR and SpO 2 data, three trajectory groups were identified for each vital-sign category. The detailed summary measurements (initial value, mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation) for each vital-sign category is shown in Supplementary Tables 3, 4.  Tables 2, 3 show the clinical characteristics and outcomes of the trajectory groups in each vital-sign category. Across all vital-sign categories, the following five trajectory groups were associated with a higher rate of IHCA: low and fluctuating SBP, high and fluctuating HR, persistent hypothermia, initiallyresolving but recurring tachypnea, and low and fluctuating oxygen saturation. Within each vital-sign category, the IHCAprone trajectory group was associated with a higher triage level and a higher mortality rate, compared to other trajectory groups. Except for the persistent hypothermia group, the other four IHCA-prone trajectory groups were more likely to have a higher qSOFA score and higher levels of CRP, lactic acid, cTnI, and D-dimer, compared with other trajectory groups in their corresponding vital-sign category.",

In general, within each vital-sign category, those whose vital signs resolved to near normal (e.g., initially high but resolving SBP or HR) tended to have better outcomes, compared with those with persistently deviating vital signs. The degree to which the vitals deviated and fluctuated also differed by the vital-sign category. For instance, the fluctuation of SBP and HR seemed smaller, compared to that of RR and SpO 2 . This smaller longitudinal variation might also implicate that hypotension and tachycardia in the early phase of ED stay could predict worse outcomes. Indeed, studies have shown the \"shock index\" at triage, defined as HR divided by SBP, predicted hospital admission and inpatient mortality among ED patients (19) . The higher levels of lactic acid, cTnI, and D-dimer may reflect the combination of various forms of shock (e.g., septic or cardiogenic) in the groups of low/fluctuating SBP and high/fluctuating HR. On the other hand, high blood pressure in the ED is common but does not seem to be associated with subsequent adverse events (20) .",

Hypothermia is known to be arrhythmogenic and could be related to sepsis, both of which may have contributed to IHCA in our study. The hypothermia group demonstrated a \"hypoinflammatory\" state as evidenced by a low qSOFA score and a lower level of CRP. These patients were older and were probably immunosuppressed, and therefore their immune response was insufficient to generate fever. A previous study also showed that hypothermia in sepsis patients was associated with persistent lymphopenia, a sepsis-induced immunosuppression (24) . Our study further demonstrated that the hypoinflammatory state usually persisted, at least in the ED, and predicted worse outcomes.

Many IHCA events are caused by respiratory failure, such as acidosis and pneumonia, and cardiac causes (26) . Prior to IHCA, tachypnea is often present as a compensatory response to shock-induced metabolic acidosis. A previous ward study also reported RR was the most important vital sign in predicting critical events (8) . In our study, the degree of fluctuation of RR and SpO 2 over time was quite large, indicating dynamic changes between treatment response and failure and a strong terminal deviation from the norm. Among various diseases, pneumonia may particularly alter the longitudinal patterns of RR and SpO 2 . A previous study has shown that deteriorating pneumonia demonstrated rapidly-worsening respiratory failure, with high RR and low SpO 2 , but only minor changes in other vital signs (27) . Our study also suggested that, unlike the evolution of SBP and HR, the changes in RR and SpO 2 could be drastic just prior to IHCA. As shown in the sensitivity analysis, the early RR trajectory was not reliable to detect imminent IHCAs. Recognizing these late changing respiratory trajectories, along with various important clinical and social factors, might prompt an early discussion of the risks and benefits of airway interventions or do-notresuscitate orders if not already available.",
