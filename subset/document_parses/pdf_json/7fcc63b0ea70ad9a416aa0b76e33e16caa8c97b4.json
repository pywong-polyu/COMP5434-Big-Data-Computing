The RH-OBA and Free Maternity care policy showed an increase in facility-based deliveries in public hospitals and highlighted the impact of cost as a barrier to healthcare utilisation, particularly by women. [13] [14] [15] However, audits of these programmes identify many persistent challenges. For example, a review of the Reproductive Health Voucher programme in two slums revealed that 22% of the intended beneficiaries did not use the vouchers. 13 Similarly, recent data on the Free Maternity Care programme showed that many disadvantaged groups are not benefitting from the services. 16 Some of the challenges are related to how the programmes are implemented, while others are ingrained in broader societal and health system structural challenges. 17 18 Solutions, which enhance access to care, should be informed by an in-depth understanding of the barriers to access, as these are often context and population-specific and keep evolving.",

            "text": "As Kenya makes more investments towards UHC, it is essential to understand and document current, and if any, persistent barriers to access to quality healthcare by the most disadvantaged population groups such as urban slum residents to identify measures to redress the inequities. Such an assessment needs to go beyond the current limitations in many studies on barriers to healthcare access that tend to focus on demand-side barriers. 19 20 Instead, an integrated approach, bringing together demand and supply-side analyses, is likely to yield a holistic understanding of healthcare access challenges. 1 21 Taking the unique context of urban slums in Kenya, this study explores persistent and current demand and supply-side barriers to optimum delivery and access to quality healthcare. The findings are used to identify opportunities that can be harnessed to reduce these barriers for better health and well-being in two urban slum communities in Nairobi, Kenya. The study draws on data collected as part of a multicountry study to assess current healthcare services in seven informal settlements in Africa and Asia to identify viable service delivery models relevant to the slum setting. 22 The study explored preventive and curative healthcare services for all population groups in the urban slums. 22 With due consideration for the unique context of slums in Kenya (as elsewhere), this study used the Andersen Behavioural Model (ABM) to conceptualise the barriers to access to healthcare. 23 24 The model describes predisposing, enabling and need factors that influence people's decisions to use healthcare services. Predisposing factors are pre-existing socio-cultural characteristics of an individual; enabling factors serve as a means to accessing care, while the need factors refer to the immediate reason why healthcare is sought. The ABM has undergone several iterations, as presented by Andersen that modifications could be made to fit different purposes without distorting the original framework.",

The research assistants had prior experience conducting qualitative interviews, were familiar with the slum communities and were fluent in English and Kiswahili, the two most common languages spoken in the study areas. The research assistants had no prior interactions with participants. The FGDs and IDIs were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic in a central location within the community convenient for all the participants. The selected locations also ensured privacy and minimum disruptions. Data collection procedures for KII participants were adapted to include remote telephone interviews during the COVID-19 period. Participants were contacted a few days before the interviews to select a date and time that was most convenient for them to participate in the interviews. Participants were also briefed and encouraged to position themselves in a place that ensured privacy and minimal disruptions. Interviews were conducted using a structured study guide. The interviews lasted between 30 and 60 min for IDIs and KIIs, and up to 90 min for FGDs. The FGDs consisted of 8-10 participants. All interviews were audio-recorded and complemented by handwritten notes.",

The data were analysed using content analysis method through the stages suggested by Graneheim and Lundman. 30 We applied a deductive component informed by the ABM 23 24 approach and an inductive one allowing for the identification of new themes from the data. 31 The ABM provided the main guiding framework of analysis, enabling us to code and sort the data and identify the categories, predisposing, enabling and need factors driving the barriers to access to quality healthcare services in the urban slums. Because the ABM is flexible, we were able to add factors specific to the slum context as a new level of vulnerability. At the same time, the inductive approach identified recommendations to improve access to quality healthcare. Two researchers identified themes from the coded data. Two other researchers independently reviewed the themes. All the authors agreed on the themes. Additional recommendations were identified during participatory workshops in December 2019, April and June 2021 convened by the research teams and attended by community representatives, health providers and policymakers. Data saturation was achieved during the analysis.",

Across different population and stakeholder groups there was agreement that a combination of factors perpetuated health inequalities and limited access to healthcare. This was shown through the interaction of individual and family socioeconomic status (such as poverty and lack of health insurance), with community factors (such as poor infrastructure, limited availability of health facilities and insecurity) and health system factors (such as limited facility opening hours and health providers' attitudes and skills, limited public health resources).

Insecurity has been reported in previous studies in the study sites as a major barrier to access and utilisation of maternal and child health services in the slums. 33 The mentioning of noncommunicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in one of the sites, Viwandani, reiterates the growing evidence on the burden of chronic conditions among the urban poor in this setting and similar settings. 34 35 Previous studies in the slums and other underserved areas in Kenya have identified similar barriers at individual and community levels. 19 20 36 In our study, context-specific barriers to quality healthcare in the slums included heightened insecurity, poor infrastructure and poor sanitation and hygiene. These are in line with findings by other studies done in slum settings. 9 10 In the 2000 9 and 2012 10 Nairobi Cross-Sectional Slum Surveys the hazardous environment in the slums characterised by the near absence of the public sector, limited access to healthcare and water and sanitation services, among others.

Service providers and other key stakeholders reported their inability to respond to the needs of the communities as most of the decisions about caregiving and services were made higher up, with significant implications on how limited health system resources are managed. It appears that devolution of health services through the 2010 constitution has not resulted in the much-needed empowering reforms at the subnational level or translated into effective care delivery for the most vulnerable, who are also the majority. Thus, bureaucracy and ineffective accountability mechanisms continue to entrench health inequalities that devolving health was to help resolve. 37 38 In a devolved health system, it is necessary to pay attention to health managers' abilities to assess population health needs and respond to them. In addition, the barriers reported regarding the limited use of existing accountability mechanisms need further attention to ensure that the mechanisms work for the greater good of the urban slum residents. For example, a recent systematic review demonstrated that inadequate human resources for health and limited funding of county health initiatives are a persistent barrier dating from the pre-devolution era. 38 The identified challenges reinforce the need to understand and respond to social determinants of health. Tackling these challenges requires multisectoral innovations, rather than the current siloed approach. This is also in line with the recommendations made by study participants to address existing gaps. Multisectoral strategies are needed to address individual, community and system-level barriers to quality healthcare in this slum settings to ensure health access for all.",
