First, I show that law is a cultural semiotic practice that requires decoding and, for that reason, demands a creative intervention by those that want to know, understand, and do things with law. Altogether this amounts to recognizing the different modes in which law creates, and is part of, worlds. Second, I propose that due to different features of their aesthetic form, comics are a particularly effective medium to place students before the myriad ways in which law and lawyers make and reproduce worlds. Third, I illustrate the argument by exploring how the Saga comic series, through its formal multimodality and narrative and cultural complexity, can make good on that challenge.",

Clearly, covid-19 accelerated the technological fix many were claiming should be applied to education in general advocating for more creative ways of engaging students, delivering contents, and fostering collaborative learning and work in the virtual world and digital classrooms [20, 41, 45] . Often, this stance is advanced by authors concerned with the growing gap between highly technological law firms and conservative law schools producing old-school curricula and failing to educate the lawyers the market (arguably) needs and is asking for [14, 21] .",

Indeed, students need to be made aware that regardless of the kind of legal work they (will) carry out-theoretical, practical, or methodological-and the different technologies they will use, they must embrace the idea that law is both a creative and constitutive activity. To assert such a proposition is to further claim that knowing law is a much wider competence than typically assumed; a competence that necessarily comprises constantly discovering and imagining law.

While this may be both taken for granted and forgotten, the official legal world is but one possible semiosphere intersecting many other semiospheres; one based on special kinds of texts and documents, priests, canons of interpretation and thinking, roles, subjects, buildings, images, robes, values, and so on [20] . This, of course, has been the focus of the different law and humanities movements [48] from the early law and literature [54] to law and psychoanalysis [1] , law and aesthetics [35] , and law and dress [56] . However, the contention of this article is that these are piece-meal approaches that fail to convey the multidimensional ways in which law creates a world within the social world with its time, space, volume, life-forms, and narrative.",

It is important to stress that the article avoids critical legal studies' and humanities' lack of reflexivity in refusing to see their narratives as but other narratives that need to be decrypted. Indeed, the present article does not prescribe that reading and experiencing comics leads by default to emancipatory and critical meanings and contents (speaking of moral integrity in this context [31] ; offering a classical CLS statement [29] ).

In Sect. 3, I make a case for the rather unique potential of comics in delivering the multi-dimensional and sensorial experience of creating worlds that is implicit in law. Section 4 exemplifies the point of the previous section by going through some of the themes and forms, and how the latter showcase comics' multimodality, deployed in the Saga comic series created by Brian K.

Yet, the provisional meaning one may find when discerning a sign can quickly be seen to constitute yet but another sign generating a never-ending game of symbolic reproduction and analysis. Furthermore, as Lotman articulated, signs and systems of signs do not exist in a vacuum but instead intersect and meet other semiospheres, other semiotic and nonsemiotic worlds, encounters that, while often taken for granted or left unexamined, require translation and mediation.

Imagine a room in a museum, where exhibits from different eras are laid out in different windows, with texts in known and unknown languages, and instructions for deciphering them, together with explanatory texts for the exhibitions created by guides who map the necessary routes and rules of behaviour for visitors.

In other words, we need to operate a genuine cultural, not merely linguistic, semiotics analysis, if we are to grasp the whole range of ways in which the legal sphere helps co-constituting the worlds we live in.

In other words, law is much more than a set of inanimate objects (such as rules or decisions\u2026) or a set of static roles (officials, subjects\u2026) and values (human dignity, justice\u2026) even if it is also all of this. Law is neither merely a system nor a language but rather a cultural form of life that given its extraordinary social legitimacy-something authors as different as Luhmann [34] and Fitzpatrick [13] identify as having arisen first in the Western world-tends to have a prominent place in the constitution and regulation of other forms of life and subjectivities. I hope this first example describes adequately how law, symbols, and aesthetics make our social world by adding layers of meaning that are represented while absent and thus that knowing law requires being capable of engaging in cultural semiotics. But the analysis is not complete since I have left unexamined the effects that may arise from law's reliance on signs that hide both intense struggles regarding their signifieds and, all too often, the forgetfulness that such meanings are not natural and thus require discussion. Furthermore, messages may also produce (and benefit from) a relationship of visibility / invisibility between signs, making some of them appear whereas hiding others crucially impacting the way we make sense of the message. As we shall see, this reveals much about the workings of the law. It is to this task that I now turn through a second example (Fig. 2) .",

I made a poster out of this juxtaposition and went on to ask my students and friends alike what they saw, felt, and read in it. It was no surprise, honestly, that nobody was familiar with Latouche's theses though this confirmed right away the cultural power of signs. The message of HSBC was interpreted as naturalizing money given both the linguistic expression \"dinero l\u00edquido\" (liquid funds) and the fluid consistency and texture of the monetary sign in the ad. Furthermore, I added during a class, that in Chinese the word \"f\u0103\" represented by the character \u6cd5 and commonly used to mean \"law\" is composed of two characters-\"water\" and \"go\"-given that it is a law of nature that the water flows downwards.

This is, I hold, the hidden myth of the message, drowned under the more obvious connotations of money's circulation and fluidity as being natural. Indeed, that growth is equated with prosperity, and a natural condition of the latter, is an undiscussed belief and value of our societies that generates invisible results. For example, the fact that nobody consulted knew Latouche's work on the opposing stance: given the finite nature of earth and its resources we need de-growth.",

That prosperity and growth, however, could be understood as greater redistribution and equity in the access to wealth or higher levels of happiness is something that neither mainstream cultural politics nor legal arrangements explicitly tackle; and ultimately is what naturalizes this ad's signified. In the legal world, this can be seen by scrutinizing the myriad ways in which the \"right to life\" is rarely interpreted and, even less, legally protected, across the world, as comprising \"the right to a materially decent life\" in addition to the recognized liberal right \"not to be killed\". By the same token, that knowledge is virtue and ignorance vice, is also but one possible ethical and practical meaning. For example, in the Zhuangzi [55, 184] , another ethical source that in Ancient Chinese philosophy disputed the moralism of Confucianism, one can read \"Not to understand is profound; to understand is shallow. Not to understand is to be on the inside; to understand is to be on the outside.\"",

In this sense, my juxtaposition of Latouche's book cover provides an example of such a cultural semiotics strategy that students should develop. Opposing signs to other signs, placing signs in different semiospheres, or creating new relations between signs in order to question received meanings and dissolve their mythic effect. Finally, the deployment of Latouche's cover also illustrates the importance of the form of signs-a crucial point as we shall see through comics-since it would be different, from an efficacy, impact, and aesthetic standpoints to produce the same discourse relying on written language solely. After all, the image is a form that enables engaging the hidden meanings in HSBC's advertisement via a \"visual game\" (Emilio Tejeda's expression when commenting on this point).",

In other words, the difference between approach and methods [46] is the difference between the strategy to grasp and attempt to address a problem and the set of techniques that are to be applied as part of the strategy devised and according to the latter's specific goals. The point being that problem, approach, and solution remain unknown prior to the effort [8, 2] . To that effect, for James Boyd White [57, 262]:",

Key here, and particularly useful for the argument being sketched in this article, are the recent contributions emphasizing comics' multimodality and the multisensory experience they offer.

The combined work of this scholarship (see [23, 37] for classical examples, and [15] for the latest work) has called attention to the gigantic variety and richness of genres, techniques, and themes in comics as well as to the intricate and complex artistic forms deployed together with the demands they place on readers. On the other hand, this was also helped by the spread of explicitly political comics: documental-journalistic by Joe Sacco, e.g., Palestine and Safe Area Gora\u017ede, and historical such as Maus by Art Spiegelman on the plight of World War II, or even the Showa series on the recent history of Japan by Shigeru Mizuki.",

This seems, to my mind, particularly important in times in which the truth of images and texts has come under heavy fire and is now met with widespread disbelief.

The reason being that, in a context in which it is known (and experienced) that images (and other documents) are continuously photoshopped, edited, and manipulated, their aura of truth no longer stems from the kind of medium that produced them. As such, the feeling of truthfulness is associated by students more to the empirical impact they feel whenever exposed to media as well as to the degree of manipulation they seem to detect in such media outputs.

Indeed, given the abundance of signs in the Saga worlds as well as the on and off connections between those realms and what human history and world look like, Saga sharpens the imaginations of readers as one is constantly challenged to make sense of symbols and events that seem to point to some part of past, present, and future choices of both so-called real and unreal worlds.",

Alana, is a feminist mother, rejecting, pre-emptively if needed, any appearance of patriarchal attitudes and outcomes, pursuing dreams and wishing to die rather than to live conservatively simply because she has a daughter. Interspecies explicit sexual intercourse, between winged and horned beings or even beings with screens instead of heads, breaks several important taboos regarding sexuality and the future of the (human) body and gender in the same way that the discussion of \"clipping wings\" as part of a policy to eliminate species' differences recalls hot topics of today (such as female genital mutilation) and of yesterday (such as foot binding).",

One is the lying cat, a rare species that can detect instantly and flawlessly any lie being said in his presence. The other are the imperial robot family members, such as Prince Robot IV, who display screens instead of heads. Excitingly, their screens exhibit, unfiltered, their thoughts and dreams making them an open window to everyone else.

Given the length of the series and the fact that time goes by in Saga's worlds, Marko's choices are not one-off decisions but rather repeated iterations in changing contexts enabling us to witness-and therefore prompting evaluation-real quick changes in his character and ways to go about his values negotiating family, friendship, loyalty, and common good concerns; not without, however, much agonizing.",

Examples which can be used to make students experience the unfinished and open-ended nature of their task as lawyers and the effects of their decisions on contentious cultural, political, ethical, and legal issues. They can also make students realize how much of their options and positions regarding such debates are dependent on the broader cultural semiotics spoken of in Sect. 2. Regardless of the benefits of this approach, the critical reader could point out rightly that these features of Saga are hardly exclusive of comic art. And indeed, comics' unique potential in offering access to the experience of worldmaking that, I suggest, is necessary for law students, comes not from the themes or literary contents of Saga but rather from the specific way its authors deploy the comic form. As I detail below, it is the latter use that enables students to experience \"ways of worldmaking\" in a multimodal and multisensory way further allowing them to perceive, experience, and confront the thematic contents of Saga not as merely intellectual debates but as situated world events, i.e., alternative possibilities of collective forms of life in given social narratives.

It feels like I am shitting!\" [51, 5] . The colours used are warm and vivid fitting the rawness and emotion of the moment. Simultaneously, however, a sentence, printed in small white font, appearing above Alana's head, and uttered from an unclear speaker reads: \"This is how an idea becomes real.\" [51, 5] . While the action continues over the following pages and Alana effectively gives birth amidst aggressive and cynical rants against Marko, Hazel's speech continues to be superimposed on each panel creating a beautiful and deep juxtaposition between images, text, and temporal planes which link giving birth, life, and the properties of ideas. Thus, Hazel's full text reads \"This is how an idea becomes fragile.\" / \"But ideas are fragile things.\" / Most don't live long outside of the ether from which they were pulled, kicking and screaming.\" / That's why people create with someone else.\" / Two minds can sometimes improve the odds of an idea's survival\u2026\" / \"but there are no guarantees.\" [51, [6] [7] . This last bit of text is inserted in a dramatic strip, in which Marko is crying while looking into Alana's open legs, suggesting that perhaps indeed the birth, like an idea, had failed to produce sustainable life. The next panel has Alana asking, with a worried, less confident and proud face than before: \"You're crying. You never cry. What's wrong? Marko, what is it\u2026?\" [51, 7] . The page ends in deep suspense at this point-another typical aesthetic choice in comic art-and we are forced to turn the page, making our body an accomplice in the reading experience, to satiate our curiosity. And indeed, in a powerful page-long panel, to the relief of this reader, a crying Marko, tears dropping down his face proclaims: \"It is a girl.\" [51, 8] . While holding a baby that stands out due to her reddish colour with the umbilical cord in plain view, Hazel writes \"Anyway, this is the day I was born.\" [51, 8] .",

In this way, there is no single (present) world, e.g., Hazel's birth and her parents' interaction, but a myriad of worlds that communicate with that sign/event according to criteria of their own worlds. Social order then shifts from being a flat and discrete surface to a multitextured and rugged landscape that is almost tactile in which time and space are lived, shaped, and overlap continuously in virtue of social interactions, (arguably) stimulating and driving complex intellectual and aesthetic responses in agents.",

Indeed, the number, size, and disposition of panels does not follow a clear pattern ranging from single-page panels to pages with two panels and others with more panels, even if always arranged differently. Altogether, in my opinion, these visual, \"spatio-topical\" elements in Groensteen's words [23, [21] [22] [23] , deepen powerfully the textual and semantic analysis already performed. Indeed, the fact that there is no clear pattern regarding the page layout and page breakdown reinforces the idea that events (and life) always come in disarticulated fashion and can never be \"seen from nowhere\". In other words, narratives are inseparable from the ways in which we arrange them, and these operations are unending attempts to make sense of what is going on. Furthermore, I interpret the effect of these formal choices as potentiating and reinforcing the coexistence of multiple timelines as remarked earlier. This is because arranged in this way, and in \"iconic solidarity\" [23, 17] with the textual elements, the panels' layout create the perception that reality is unfolding panel by panel and thus is being enacted in a non-predictable and linear way by characters that exist in different times and spaces. Ultimately, the specific page layout and page breakdown choices frame superbly the analogy between ideas and birth and their fundamental uncertain, agentive, and risky nature.",

But visual properties in Saga, also introduce features that transcend the state of the situation and the space of possibilities of what is feasible in the world built in black. Consequently, ghosts can bond with living creatures bringing with them special powers and abilities as well as the experience of past lives-a supernatural existence that is branded through the use of the red colour as mentioned above. And those speaking blue remind us of the power to change the laws of physics and reality as we know it, a key ingredient to remain hopeful and critical at the same time. The colouring of speech (and characters) has therefore the power to evoke deftly and instantly the multiple worlds and their radically different backgrounds, features, and social hierarchies, throughout the panels of the series.",

The exceptionally rare black gutters, suggesting right away the sombre and tense mood of what is to come, are pierced by the trajectory of ballistic projectiles and spells in an ultradetailed slow-motion that makes us follow the havoc they are causing taking the reader in a snake-shaped path top-down, from left to right, right to left and left to right again. Time and space freeze over these six-panels that zoom in on a specific event before expanding again revealing the devastation left behind and the consequences characters are left to face. Once again, the visuality of Saga, here in similar fashion to Matrix's famous lobby scene, guides and directs the construction of the narrative by both distinguishing the importance of events in the narrative arc and making them weigh differently too, emotionally speaking, in the reader.",

Indeed, it is widely held that law is an enterprise largely based on tradition in which decisions connect the past, present, and future [32] . Furthermore, while some decisions may seem to be down to earth and consist in the application of well-established principles and rules, such decisions are always open to, and part of, a meta-reading inferring principles and shared wisdom from it. Or simply placing the concrete narrative one is involved in within a much larger context both factual and normative.

What there is instead, is a continuity in their intertextuality or multimodality, the narrative and visual worldmaking ways in which they work, and that experiencing them in comic art-due to the latter's forms-can make it easier to experience, recognize, and create them in law. Indeed, the point is that awareness of the fact that law is an ongoing communicative and living practice is fundamental to know how and when to make use of these different dimensions of analysis or, simply, that law is always open to such kind of reflection and experience. Comics' multimodality unfolds therefore, as Giddens [16, 5] has asserted, \"a space where we may be free to engage, imagine, and create law in different forms-to \"re-form\" law.\"",

It is important to stress that exposure to these multiple planes is congenial to comics but very hard to achieve in traditional doctrinal methods of analysis and other aesthetic media. This is because the comic form allows for the compression of different media that typically would be kept separate since the interested student or citizen would have to first find images or videos portraying a given situation, then she would have to go through different documents issued by various authorities as well as other sources such as monographs, podcasts, documentaries, or clips on more detailed topics. Strikingly, comics like Saga can produce this multi-media effect in a single panel. What is more, and due to the use of gutter, closure, page breakdown and layout, sound, and the play of image and text concerted with the turn of the pages, comics also add a clear emotional, and more broadly aesthetic, experience to the act of reading, transforming it radically in the process.

From the conventional legal practitioner's point of view, things are different since one does not always face hard cases nor can one engage in meticulous thinking about how law is making and should attempt to make worlds. It should not be forgotten that being competent in the practice of law is not a matter of truth but of knowing how to deploy the vocabulary of law as determined by existing conventions and intersubjective agreements [40] . Thus, it should not surprise us that in conventional lawyering in current positivist legal cultures the scope for explicit and direct worldmaking in ordinary concrete cases will most likely be rather limited.",

Thus, even at the level of a concrete legal case much is about ensuring that the system recognizes the world we are trying to assert, reproduce, and create. And this can certainly be enhanced by worldmaking and awareness of legal signs' relation to other semiospheres and the forms through which different media operate. Furthermore, the fact is that legal practice is increasingly governed by general concepts, constitutional values mediated by fundamental rights, and concerns towards the effects of norms and regulations [53] . In other words, it is becoming more forward-looking and legislative in nature. Thus, making an argument as to whether recognizing a foreign holographic will in Mexico City breaches the latter's public order; (ii) the right to life includes the right to quality of life and the enforcement of strict maximum noise levels in urban spaces; or, (iii) health emergencies' compulsory confinement policies breach individual freedom, entails in all cases engaging a complex process of cultural semiotics since the signifieds of the markers are deeply contested and, ultimately, justified by the kinds of worlds we envision, wish, and would like to live in.
