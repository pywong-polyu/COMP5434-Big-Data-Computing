The PCSS worked daily to address frontline staff concerns regarding PPE, testing, highrisk exposure, and quarantine/isolation policies for exposed staff. The unique 1-on-1 capability of the PCSS to field questions, review updated hospital guidelines, and attend daily HICS meetings to learn about potential upcoming changes proved invaluable to frontline staff.

Many patients required home oxygen and that process was made more efficient by linking the home oxygen order and home oxygen evaluation orders in the EMR, creating a system of backup respiratory therapists (RTs) so that RT staffing could be flexed up as needed, and offloading RTs by relieving them of other duties such as albuterol administration.",

Many practical considerations raised by frontline staff were addressed by the PCSS in real time. For example, as more patients were tested for COVID-19 and became people under investigation (PUIs), the PPE process required streamlining to prevent unnecessary exposures and conservation of PPE. Examples included regular staff and processes to build and maintain isolation carts in dedicated locations on COVID-19 units and in the emergency department (ED). Furthermore, many patient rooms did not have disposable stethoscopes requiring staff to leave the room to obtain a stethoscope thereby using more PPE and wasting provider time rather than focusing on patient care. Protocols were established to ensure a standard location for hanging the stethoscopes in patient rooms and to ensure stethoscopes would travel with patients from the emergency room to their hospital room or between units once admitted to the hospital. Finally, protocols were established for provider and staff safety, especially when transitioning home to minimize any exposure to their family. This included shower access at the on-campus exercise facility 7 d per wk from the hours of 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM so staff could shower after their shift. Scrub deposit was made available at the showers so staff could easily return soiled scrubs. Additional call rooms were also opened for the added staff working in the intensive care unit (ICU) at night.",

To improve communication, we provided translation devices in rooms for non-English speaking patients to facilitate communication while preserving PPE. We also provided patients with iPads to interact with family members with those devices dedicated to a specific patient room to reduce cleaning and PPE use. In addition, we preferentially placed patients with COVID-19 in rooms with windows to the hallway, thereby allowing providers to call into the room to talk to the patient, but still maintain interpersonal distance.

Two home oxygen coordinators facilitated discharging patients on oxygen, performing a pilot study using the Masimo\u2122 device to monitor oxygenation after discharge for high-risk patients; postdischarge phone calls ensured patients received adequate follow-up. Leveraging the electronic patient portal (MyHealthConnection\u2122), an app allowing individuals to access their own medical record, while they were in the hospital facilitated the use of virtual health visits after discharge. For uninsured patients or underinsured patients without a primary care provider, we built a process where a nurse would call the patient on discharge to ensure the transition home was safe if we were unable to establish follow-up care with a clinic. Many discharge delays were secondary to lack of placement options for COVID-19 patients; therefore, physical therapy began triaging all COVID-19 patients and appropriately deploying resources to provide more intensive services for patients similar to the services they would receive if they were discharged to a nursing or rehab facility. Furthermore, physiatrists opened a rehabilitation unit within the hospital to transition COVID-19 patients to a service who required ongoing but few other medical needs to offload medical services so they could care for patients who required hospitalization.",
