A convenience sample was taken from all patients who were COVID-19 confirmed, symptomatic, and non-hospitalized. Demographic information, medical and travel history, general symptoms, and clinical examination results of the oral cavity were collected. Results: This study included a total of 109 patients. Loss of taste was the most common oral manifestation of COVID-19 (43.4%), followed by erythema/desquamated gingivitis and coated tongue (7.3% each) and ulcers/blisters (6.4%). Loss of taste was the only symptom persisting for 10 days. Oral manifestations appeared as a single symptom (79.3%), and dorsum of tongue was the most common oral location (72.4%). Conclusion: Loss of taste was the most prevalent specific reported oral manifestation. Other nonspecific oral lesions/symptoms are controversial. It has been suggested that oral examinations of COVID-19 patients should be conducted as part of routine examinations to investigate any possible correlation between the disease and the oral cavity.",

            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is still a pandemic persisting after about more than one year. It has affected almost 240 million people worldwide with more than 4.8 million deaths. 1 The most commonly reported symptoms are fever, loss of taste, tiredness, and dry cough. [2] [3] [4] [5] The majority of cases were mild (80%), and 3% maximum of cases may become serious and critically ill. The total number of recovered/discharged cases was 97%. 1 Updated research shows that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect human cells through ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptors. 6, 7 This process can in turn cause an inflammatory reaction in the mucosal membrane of the tongue, salivary gland tissues, and other affected organs and tissues. 2, 8 SARS-CoV-2 may also alter taste bud sensitivity. 9 Therefore, COVID-19 could contribute to several oral signs and symptoms, such as taste loss, nonspecific ulcers, blisters, desquamative gingivitis, and co-infections with fungal infections such as candida, 10, 11 and few studies have been published regarding oral manifestations in specific. [12] [13] [14] However, it is still controversial whether these symptoms/signs are specific to COVID-19 disease as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 infection or as a result of other underlying conditions and consequences, such as co-infections, immune system impairment caused by the virus, or adverse effects of COVID-19 medications. 15 Moreover, the prevalence of clinical oral manifestations remains unclear. For this reason, oral manifestations of COVID-19 are a rising topic of interest in the field of oral health care, and more research with better study design is needed to clarify the association between COVID-19 and oral manifestations. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the types of oral manifestations and their prevalence in patients with COVID-19 in a crosssectional study.",

The most common specific oral symptom in patients with COVID-19 was loss of taste. 2 However, during the previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pandemics, loss of taste was not among the reported symptoms. 18 In this study, the prevalence of taste loss was similar to that of a recently published systematic review and meta-analysis reporting the overall prevalence to be 45%. 2 This confirms that the loss of taste may be considered a specific COVID-19 symptom in Saudi Arabia as well. Several hypotheses are explaining how the loss of taste may be related to COVID-19. 9, 12, 13, 19 One of these hypotheses suggests that the normal function of taste buds can be affected by rhinitis triggering a related local inflammatory response, 19 although loss of taste may happen without any nasal mucosal inflammation. 2 Another hypothesis states that the loss of taste could be attributed to COVID-19 drug treatment side effects. 12, 13 However, it still appeared in COVID-19 patients who were found to be drug-free.",

A study by Vieira found that only severe cases of periodontitis may worsen COVID-19, while mild cases of COVID-19 may not show any oral manifestations, and vice versa. 14 They suggested a possible link between oral manifestations and the inflammatory process, which can trigger the coagulation cascade and increase levels of fibrinogen degradation products (eg D-dimer). 29 Moreover, Patel suggested a possible relationship between necrotizing periodontal disease (NPD) and COVID-19 due to bacterial co-infections occurring intraorally. 21 An abnormally high bacterial read of the major etiological bacteria of NPD was detected frequently in those infected with SARS-CoV-2 using metagenomic analyses, in addition to several other acute periodontal bacteria species, such as Fusobacterium and Treponema. A recent review identified 18 studies with 25 cases. However, there were nonspecific symptoms, such as taste alteration, loss of taste, burning sensation in the mouth, mucosal ulceration, dry mouth and halitosis, or even pseudomembranous nodules, maculae or plaque mucosal lesions. 30 Crusted lips, multiple rashes, targeted lesions, blisters and vesiculobullous lesions were reported in some cases. 30 This study showed there were no specific oral manifestations related to COVID-19 patients. To our knowledge, few case reports and letters to the editor have been published on this topic, and this is the first study conducted in Saudi Arabia. However, all the results reported in this article should be interpreted with caution: most oral manifestations may go unnoticed and some variables were self-reported which may underestimate these variables, in addition to the difficulty in registering the oral findings, which can impose exposure and contamination risk during photographic image conduction. Moreover, loss of taste was measured based on patient reporting, which is a subjective method and may not accurately diagnose this condition. In addition, we need to classify the taste disorder to understand the effect of COVID-19 on gustatory buds. Lastly, all patients were examined only once. It would be better if the patients were examined daily, from day 1 to day 10. However, it is not feasible due to the nature of the disease.",
