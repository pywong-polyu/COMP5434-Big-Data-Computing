[10] [11] [12] In addition to these intrinsic and extrinsic factors, the contribution of specific subunits of the face have been shown to disproportionately affect our perception of age. The midface, including the central facial triangle, is shown to be an important determinant of perceived attractiveness and age. 13 Artificially aging the lower third of the face with computer-based photo editing significantly increases the perceived age of a person and is among the most determining of the facial subunits. 13 To date, there have been no studies that have explored how covering subunits of the face with a mask affect the perception of age.",

However, as the respiratory virus causing COVID-19 began to spread worldwide with increasing morbidity and mortality, the use of face masks in the public setting became more common as many state governments began issuing mask mandates. 14 Despite there being evidence to support the use of face masks in preventing disease transmission, it remains a controversial topic driven by political divide, individualism, and distrust of authority. [15] [16] [17] The purpose of our study is to better understand the effects of wearing a mask on the perception of facial age. We hypothesize that based on our own observation, and well documented A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t and studied contribution of the lower third of the face to our perception of age, 13 face masks make individuals appear younger. The implications of appearing younger extend beyond physical attractiveness. Looking younger than chronological age is associated with increased trustworthiness, competence, and warmth, 12, 18 whereas looking older correlates with decreased optimism, relationship satisfaction, and mental health. 19 Even cognitive function has demonstrated a stronger correlation with perceived age than with chronological age. 20 This study may also provide more insight into how the morphological features of each subunit of the face contributes to the perception of age, and if mask wearing makes one appear more youthful, the results of this study may highlight a benefit of mask wearing.",

When a mask concealed a portion of the subject's face, the wrinkles that were not visible were not scored and excluded from analysis. This was the overall wrinkle assessment score. We also compared wrinkle assessment scores for wrinkles that were visible in all patients, including the forehead, glabella, periorbita, preauricular rhytids, and neck. This was the visible wrinkle assessment score. Each judge appraised each patient once, either masked or unmasked, but never saw the same patient masked and unmasked. The mask status of the patients was randomized to the judges with equal weight by a biostatistician from the Department of Biostatistics and Informatics biostatisticians using R software.

One reason is that the aging lower third of the face contains vertical lip rhytids, nasolabial folds, and jowls, which have been demonstrated to contribute significantly to our perception of facial aging even in isolation. 3 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t While all subgroupsexcept patients whose BMI was greater than 35 and patients aged 18 to 40demonstrated a significant mask effect to variable degrees, there was no significant difference between subgroups for either perceived age or wrinkle scores. With a larger study powered to detect differences between subgroups, the variable mask effects may be significant. For example, females demonstrated a mask effect of 3.41 years (95% CI = 2.36-4.46, P < 0.0001), which was not significant when compared to the 2.17-year mask effect in males (95% CI = 0.59-3.76, P = 0.0077). Our study was not powered to determine the difference in mask effect based on gender. However, women invest more in \u2017anti-aging' products like skin care products, hair coloring, and make-up. 26 Male-pattern baldness may also have been a tell of age that was not concealed by a mask (Figure 5 ), though there was not a correlation between degree of baldness and overestimation of age demonstrated in one photometric study. 27 So, it is possible that a larger study with equivalent numbers of males and females may detect a larger mask effect in females. There was also an insignificant effect for wrinkle assessment score in males (mean difference = 0.08, P = 0.4706). This may be due to the fact that subgroup analysis in the study was underpowered to detect this difference, or it may be due to facial hair obscuring lower third facial wrinkles in men.",

Unfortunately, too few patients in our study population have had cosmetic surgery or injectables to see if glabellar and forehead Botox \uf0d2 increased the mask effect or a prior facelift reduced the mask effect. However, the dramatic effect of prior upper face Botox\uf0d2 can be seen in one patient (Figure 4). According to annual procedural statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the number of treatments with botulinum toxin type A increased from 786,911 in the year 2000 to 7,697,798 in 2019almost a 10-fold difference. 1 Anecdotally, non-surgical aesthetic treatments such as Botox\uf0d2 and fillers have grown remarkably during the pandemic. A plausible reason for this is the amount of time many patients now spend in virtual meetings where they can see their own faces magnified on a screen, potentially increasing a sense of self-consciousness. The mask effect, understood consciously or unconsciously, is another possible reason.",
