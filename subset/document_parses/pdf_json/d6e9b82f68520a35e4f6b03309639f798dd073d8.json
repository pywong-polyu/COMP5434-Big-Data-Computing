Further studies should explore whether familiarity and exposure to masked faces results in better emotion recognition skills. The present work has its limitations. Participants come from a single study centre limiting the generalizability. The use of static and digitally modified photos can reduce the ecological validity of the task. Although the sample size is adequate for the analysis reported, the response rate was relatively low (13%) corresponding to the first waves of respondents of a larger study with ongoing recruitment at time of analysis. As such, our respondents may present more positive attitudes towards the study topic compared to reluctant respondents [13] . However, a recent study exploring whether attitudes towards mask wearing affect emotion recognition in masked faces did not find any correlation [14] . The homogeneity of ethnicity and culture of the study sample did not allow to assess the role of these variables on the emotion recognition task.

            "text": "Our findings suggest that masks significantly disrupt emotion recognition accuracy amongst medical and nursing students. In light of the current widespread usage of facemasks in healthcare settings, emotion recognition ability in healthcare students should be assessed, and awareness of students' own abilities in this area promoted. Communication curricula with specific training and interventions aiming to improve the recognition of others' emotional cues could be instrumental to foster effective communication and functional relations in healthcare settings. The efficacy of real and simulated patients with facemasks to train students to the complexity of communication under such a condition should be explored. Although facial emotion recognition can be improved with specific training [7] , further investigation to clarify whether training for interpreting masked faces is similarly beneficial.",
