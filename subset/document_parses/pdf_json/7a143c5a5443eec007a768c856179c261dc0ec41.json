Further, we depict the location and characteristics of epitopes in the membrane proteins since the late appearance of neutralizing antibodies may lead to persistence, a characteristic hallmark of arterivirus infection. Some molecular features of the arteriviral proteins are rare or even unique from a cell biological point of view, particularly the prevention of signal peptide cleavage by co-translational glycosylation, discovered in EAV-Gp3, and the efficient use of overlapping sequons for glycosylation. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of these cellular processes.

Gp2/3/4 form a disulphide-linked heterotrimeric complex in virus particles, and Gp5 is disulphide-linked to M.

If either Gp5 or M is deleted from the viral genome, no virus particles are released from infected cells. Thus, Gp5 and M are required for virus budding (which does not exclude additional functions, e.g. during virus entry). If expression of either Gp2 or Gp3 or Gp4 is abrogated, virus-like particles bud from cells, but the particles are not infectious, indicating that cell entry is disturbed in the absence of the minor glycoprotein complex (Wieringa et al., 2004; Wissink et al., 2005) . Furthermore, the Gp2/3/4 complex governs cell tropism: When the ectodomains of EAV and PRRSV are swapped, the cell tropism of the resulting recombinant virus is altered, but not by exchanging the ectodomains of Gp5 and M (Dobbe et al., 2001; Lee and Yoo, 2006; Tian et al., 2012; Verheije et al., 2002) . Interestingly, the Gp2/3/4 complex interacts either physically or functionally with E. Removal of E from the viral genome completely prevents incorporation of the Gp2/3/4 complex into virus particles, whereas in the absence of either Gp2, Gp3 or Gp4, the amount of E in virions is greatly reduced (Wieringa et al., 2004) .

Sialoadhesin is supposed to be required for clathrin-dependent endocytosis of virus particles and their vesicular transport to early endosomes (for review, see . In an elegant biochemical study, it was shown that upon incubation with virus particles, purified sialoadhesin binds to Gp5, but not to Gp3 and Gp4, which, however, are also sialylated. The difference in the specificity was attributed to differences in the type of linkage between sialic acid and the following sugar residue and to a multivalency effect (binding of sialoadhesin to the glycoprotein that is more abundant on the virion surface, i.e. Gp5) . However, the essential role of sialoadhesin for virus entry is controversial, since cells and even transgenic pigs lacking sialoadhesin are efficiently infected and support virus replication (Prather et al., 2013) .

The results revealed that the signal peptide of Gp5 can be cleaved at two sites, between alanine 26 and valine 27 (site 1), or between alanine 31 and serine 32 (site 2). As a result, a mixture of Gp5 proteins exists in virus particles, some of which (cleaved at site 1) still contain the \"decoy epitope\" sequence. The mass spectrometry data are not quantitative, but SDS-PAGE migration patterns suggest that the majority of Gp5 molecules in transfected cells is cleaved at site 2 (Thaa et al., 2013) .

One report claims that the short transmembrane region of PRRSV-Gp4 may serve as a signal sequence for replacement by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which would result in peripheral membrane attachment of Gp4 rather than transmembrane anchorage. In that study the TMR of a glycolipid-anchored protein was replaced by the TMR of Gp4 and the resulting construct could be released from transfected cells by phosphatidylinositolspecific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), a characteristic hallmark for a GPI-anchored protein (Du et al., 2012) .

Signal peptide cleavage from Gp2 and Gp4. Using in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes, it was demonstrated that the signal peptide is cleaved from both Gp2 and Gp4 of EAV (de Vries et al., 1992; Wieringa et al., 2002) . In order to identify the signal peptide cleavage sites by mass spectrometry, we coexpressed the ectodomains of both proteins, C-terminally fused to either a HA-tag (Gp2-HA) or a Strep-tag (Gp4-strep) with a baculovirus expression system in insect cells. Gp2-HA was co-purified from the supernatant of infected insect cells with Gp4-strep using a Strep-tactin column (Fig. 7A) . From this result, we conclude that both proteins were secreted as a disulphide-linked complex. Following digestion of glycans with PNGase F and SDS-PAGE, protein bands corresponding in size to deglycosylated Gp2 and Gp4 were excised from the gel and digested with either elastase or chymotrypsin. The resulting peptides were eluted from the gel slices and subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Processed Gp2 and Gp4 were identified with high confidence in all samples as these proteins were the first hits in the MASCOT search, where mass spectrometric fragments are matched with database entries to determine protein identity. No peptides corresponding in mass to the N-terminal (signal peptide) region were detected for both proteins. This implies that the signal peptide was completely cleaved from both Gp2 and Gp4. In the Gp4 samples, digested with elastase, various peptides starting with threonine 22 were identified (Fig. 7C ). As this is not a cleavage site for elastase, the result indicates that Gp4 was cleaved after cysteine 21 by signal peptidase (LPCCWC\u2193TFYPCH). The most N-terminal peptides detected in chymotrypsin-digested Gp2 samples started with arginine 32, which is preceded by two tryptophan residues in the amino acid sequence (Fig. 7B) . Since tryptophan is a chymotrypsin cleavage site, the two residues were most probably removed from the mature Gp4 protein during sample preparation. This suggests that signal peptide cleavage occurred after alanine 29 (GSLLPSAAA\u2193WWRGVHEVRV). Results from digestion of Gp2 with elastase and Gp4 with chymotrypsin (not shown) are consistent with the conclusion that Gp4 is cleaved after alanine 29 and Gp2 after cysteine 21. No evidence was found for alternative signal peptide cleavage sites such as L24 (GSLL\u2193PSAA. . .), predicted in an older report (de Vries et al., 1995a) . Thus, the signal peptide is cleaved from both Gp2 and Gp4 at a single site and, since the proteins are secreted from cells after removal of the C-terminal hydrophobic region, both Gp2 and Gp4 are typical type I transmembrane proteins, which corroborates earlier investigations (de Vries et al., 1992; Wieringa et al., 2002) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 193, "end": 216, "text": "(de Vries et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 217, "end": 239, "text": "Wieringa et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 2467, "end": 2491, "text": "(de Vries et al., 1995a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2771, "end": 2794, "text": "(de Vries et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2795, "end": 2817, "text": "Wieringa et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 608, "end": 617, "text": "(Fig. 7A)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1586, "text": "(Fig. 7C", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1905, "end": 1914, "text": "(Fig. 7B)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "The Gp2/3/4 complex"}, {"text": "Gp4.

Non-reducing SDS-PAGE showed that Gp2 runs as several monomeric bands which are likely to be conformational variants (de Vries et al., 1995b) . Mutation of individual residues revealed that cysteine 48 forms an intramolecular bond with cysteine 137, whereas cysteine 102 links Gp2 with Gp4. Incorporation of Gp2 into virus particles is reduced to 10-20% upon mutation of one of the cysteine residues. This suggests that transport of the Gp2/4 complex to the viral budding site is rendered inefficient or retarded by mutating the cysteines, probably due to a folding defect. The viruses that are produced are greatly impaired in replication (C48S, C137S) or are completely non-infectious (C102S).

This is a unique observation in glycobiology, since only one asparagine per molecule is usually used in overlapping sequons (Karamyshev et al., 2005) . The signal peptide is retained in the mature protein. However, the signal peptide of Gp3 is cleaved upon deletion of both (but not one) glycosylation sites of the overlapping sequon or when glycosylation is inhibited pharmacologically. This indicates that co-translational attachment of carbohydrates prevents access of the signal peptidase to the cleavage site of Gp3 (Matczuk et al., 2013 ). An identical result was obtained when the overlapping sequon was exchanged in the context of the viral genome (Matczuk and Veit, 2014) . Table 5 Gp3 proteins from arteriviruses contain at least one glycosylation site near the signal peptide, which is predicted to be cleaved by bioinformatic analyses. Since glycosylation usually does not occur close to membranespanning segments (Nilsson and von Heijne, 1993) , we analysed the topology of Gp3. Membrane fractionation and secretion experiments revealed that the signal peptide does not act as a membrane anchor, suggesting that it is completely translocated into the lumen of the ER. Membrane attachment is caused by the hydrophobic Cterminus of Gp3, which however does not span the membrane, but rather attaches the protein peripherally to the membrane ( Fig. 6 ; Matczuk et al., 2013) . This conclusion is supported by investigations with recombinant viruses with disabled glycosylation sites. When the signal peptide of Gp3 is cleaved (upon mutation of the overlapping sequon), the infectivity of the recombinant EAV is not impaired, and Gp3 with cleaved signal peptide associates with Gp2/4 in virus particles.

Whereas the E-protein of EAV, expressed and labelled in parallel, was clearly [ 3 H]-myristoylated, no myristoylated band with the size of Gp3 was detected (Fig. 11) . Gp3 was even not myristoylated when arginine at position 3 was changed to alanine, a mutation that greatly increases the confidence level with which myristoylation of Gp3 is predicted by a bioinformatics tool (http://web.expasy.org/myristoylator/). Thus, the N-terminus of Gp3 is probably shielded from the cytosolic N-myristoyltransferase by binding to the signal recognition particle (SRP), which associates with the signal peptide as soon as it emerges from the ribosome. In the case where myristoylation of an N-terminal signal peptide for a viral glycoprotein was reported (glycoprotein C of arena virus; Schrempf et al., 2007) , the signal peptide is much longer (58 amino acids), giving the N-myristoyltransferase more time for interaction until the site for recognition by SRP emerges from the ribosome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1225, "end": 1247, "text": "Schrempf et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 113, "end": 120, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 603, "end": 612, "text": "(Fig. 11)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "EAV MGRAYSGPVALLCFFLYFCFICGSVG SNNT TICMHTTSDTSV"}, {"text": "2.4.2.2.

Some signal peptides are cleaved very slowly, which affects subsequent folding and N-glycosylation of the respective protein (Land et al., 2003) . It is also possible that a signal peptide interacts only weakly with the translocon such that a fraction of the protein remains cytosolic. After cleavage from the protein, the signal peptide can have post-cleavage functions, especially in the life cycle of viruses: Some cleaved signal peptides are relevant for virus particle egress (e.g. in the retrovirus Foamy virus (Lindemann et al., 2001) or as cofactors for protein maturation (of the Lassa virus glycoprotein; Eichler et al., 2003) ). Typically, the signal peptide is further processed by the intramembraneous signal peptide peptidase; the resulting peptide fragments can be loaded onto MHC class I and presented on the cell surface to inhibit natural killer cells (Hegde and Bernstein, 2006) . N-glycosylation is performed by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), a multimeric membrane protein complex with the active site facing the ER lumen. A preassembled core oligosaccharide (glycan) is transferred from the membrane-embedded lipid dolichol to asparagine residues in the target proteins. The asparagine has to be in the context of the sequence motif (sequon) N-X-S/T, where X can be every amino acid except proline. Importantly, only about 2/3 of the potential sites are used as substrate by OST. The residues in and around the sequon affect the efficiency of glycosylation, e.g. NXT is preferred over NXS (Aebi, 2013; Kelleher and Gilmore, 2006; Yan and Lennarz, 2005) . Further, folding of a protein can prevent accessibility of a potential glycosylation site. In addition, steric hindrance generally prevents glycosylation of sequons that are too close to a transmembrane span (<13 amino acids; Nilsson and von Heijne, 1993) or too close to another sequon (a distance of at least two residues is required to achieve partial glycosylation of both sites). Overlapping sequons (e.g. NNTT) are either not used or glycosylated at only one site per molecule (Karamyshev et al., 2005; Kelleher and Gilmore, 2006; Reddy et al., 1999) . The only known exception are the glycoproteins Gp3 and Gp5 of arteriviruses, which often contain overlapping sequons that are used quite efficiently at both sites (see main text, Section 2.4.2.1). Along the secretory pathway, the core glycosylation (as attached by OST) gets sequentially processed by a multitude of enzymes. In consequence, the glycans usually become resistant to digestion with the enzyme Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) upon passage of the protein through the medial-Golgi, whereas all N-glycosylations can be removed from proteins with Peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 298, "end": 317, "text": "(Land et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 690, "end": 714, "text": "(Lindemann et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 788, "end": 809, "text": "Eichler et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1070, "text": "(Hegde and Bernstein, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1697, "text": "(Aebi, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1725, "text": "Kelleher and Gilmore, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1748, "text": "Yan and Lennarz, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 1977, "end": 2006, "text": "Nilsson and von Heijne, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 2234, "end": 2259, "text": "(Karamyshev et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2260, "end": 2287, "text": "Kelleher and Gilmore, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2288, "end": 2307, "text": "Reddy et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Addendum."}, {"text": "Disulphide bonds are formed by oxidation of sulfhydryl ( SH) groups of two cysteine residues, resulting in a covalent bond ( S S ) between the two cysteines.
