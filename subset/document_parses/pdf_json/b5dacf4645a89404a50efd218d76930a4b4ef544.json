The diffusion of this pandemic has triggered a series of exceptional measures to curb the transmission of the virus: the shutting down of public places, businesses and schools, closures of borders between countries, restrictions on mobility and access to certain regions/territories, massive use of teleworking, strict lockdown, and the banning of all organized and social gatherings. These measures have allowed us to \"flatten the curve\" of the progression of the disease, and to curtail the toll of daily deaths in some countries, although other countries and states are experiencing a sharp increase in cases where the measures have been lifted/eased too early or even abandoned. On the other hand, these measures have had a high cost on economic activity around the world.",

[3] reported that dietary habits significantly changed during the confinement in Spanish adults in a negative direction. Confinement can be accompanied by symptoms of anxiety, depression and negative emotions [4] , which are risk factors for food restriction, emotional feeding, and hyperphagic access [5] [6] [7] . To date, all aspects of people's lives have been profoundly affected and impaired, resulting in a marked uncertainty and making people become aware of the fragility of life. Amongst these aspects of people's lives, of paramount importance are their psychological states [1] . On the other hand, Di Renzo [8] found improved dietary habits during the COVID-19-induced restrictions: a sample of 3533 Italian participants aged 12-86 years, 76.1% of which were females, tended to adhere to the Mediterranean diet, especially those between 18 and 30 years of age, with an increased uptake of organic foods, including fruits and vegetables. According to a study conducted in Kuwait, in a sample of 415 participants aged 18-73 years, changes in eating practices could be reported, including reduced consumption of fast-food and junk food, and increased ingestion of fresh, healthy food, such as fish and seafood [9] . During confinement, people have greater access to food because they work and live in closer proximity to their homes and kitchens. Greater access during a stressful situation likely leads to increased emotional, uncontrolled eating, and depressed mood [10] . Additionally, increased exposure to food advertisements (through increased media exposure) may be accompanied by people experiencing increased cravings for food and weight gain, both short and long term [11] . Behavioural changes may be complex, reflecting attempts and efforts to cope with rather challenging and unprecedented situations [12] .",

The SLIQ is a health measurement scale, which comprises of five dimensions, including dietary habits, physical activity, alcohol ingestion, smoking, and stress. The diet and physical activity dimensions are made up of three questions each. Alcohol, smoking, and life stress components have one question each. Raw scores can be calculated for each lifestyle dimension; for example, the diet raw score is the sum of three questions, concerning consumption of vegetables, fruits, and grains and their uptake frequency, which are each scored from 0 to 5. Then, raw scores can be categorized from zero to two (0 = score 0 to 5, indicating poorly dietary habits, 1 = score 6 to 10, indicating an intermediate healthy diet, and 2 = score 11 to 15, indicating healthy dietary habits). This categorized score is known as the \"diet category score\". Questions related to physical activity explore the type, intensity (light, moderate and vigorous), and frequency of physical activities practiced by the individual. Physical activity-related scores can be categorized into 0 (unhealthy lifestyle for physical activity), 1 (intermediate lifestyle for physical activity) and 2 (healthy lifestyle for physical activity). This categorized score is known as the \"physical activity category score\". Alcohol ingestion-related questions explored alcohol consumption in terms of alcoholic drinks ingested per week. The raw score can be converted into the \"alcohol category score\" applying the following formula: in the case of 14 or more drinks per week, the score is coded as zero and indicates unhealthy drinking habits; in the case of 8-13 weekly drinks, the score is categorized as 1 and indicates an intermediately healthy lifestyle for alcohol ingestion; and finally, in the case of 0-7 drinks per week, the category score is 2, indicating healthy lifestyles for alcohol intake. Smoking related questions investigated current and former smoking habits. The score is categorized as 0 if the participant is a current smoker, 1 if the individual is a past smoker, and 2 if the person has never smoked. Finally, life stress is measured on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (\"not at all stressful\") to 6 (\"very stressful\"). Scores from 1 to 2, from 3 to 4, and from 5 to 6 indicate unhealthy, intermediate, and healthy stress lifestyles, respectively.",

Participants were asked to scan each line and cross out only the characters containing the letter d with two dashes during 20 s. After completion of the d2 test, two variables were calculated: concentration performance (CP) and total number of errors made by the participants (E). CP is calculated as the number of correctly marked d2-symbols minus the number of incorrectly marked symbols (symbols that are not d2-symbols). The total number of E is assessed as the number of errors made by failing to correctly identify a d2-symbol plus the number of errors made by incorrectly marking symbols that are not d2-symbols. We considered both CP and E in the current study.",

Pearson product-moment correlation tests were used to assess possible relationships between variables during and before confinement. The magnitude of the Pearson's correlation coefficient was interpreted utilizing the rule of thumb developed by Hinkle et al. [21] ; the strength of the correlation was considered negligible if the r coefficient ranged from 0.00 to 0.29, whereas it was deemed low in the range from 0.30 to 0.49, moderate from 0.50 to 0.69, high from 0.70 to 0.89, and very high from 0.90 to 1.00. To shed light on the relationship between variables under study, both mediation and moderation analyses were carried out. All statistical analyses were conducted utilizing the commercial software \"Statistical Package for Social Sciences\" (SPSS version 24.0, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), except for the mediation and moderation analyses which were run by means of XLSTAT (version 2020.5.1., Addinsoft, New York, USA). The partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) approach to structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized, in that PLS-SEM is a technique that enables researchers to compute complex models that employ latent variables, being a component-based estimation method. We chose PLS-SEM since, contrary to other techniques, it is particularly flexible, reliable, statistically robust, and can be used also in cases of relatively small sample sizes. Results with p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were two-tailed.",

The authors showed that home confinement increased physically inactivity (+15.2), social isolation (+71.15%), poor sleep (+12.8%), and unhealthy diet behaviours (+10%). Containment implies a lower possibility of recourse to usually effective adjustment strategies, even though the possibility of recourse to food-centred adjustment strategies and associated stimuli are more frequent (i.e., less physical activity and therefore more fear of gaining weight and more dietary restriction; less social contact and therefore less eating with others, hence the risk of reinforcing rigid and stereotypical eating habits). Finally, anorexia and bulimia are associated with altered cellular immunity [24] ; binge eating frequently complicates obesity, which is a major risk factor for a severe form of COVID-19 [2] . This can increase perceived stress and therefore increase the risk of relapse in the adoption of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours.",

It may also be explained that participants were more stressed at the second assessment (during the confinement) because they had been exposed for longer to the pandemic and news of mortalities, etc. A multi-country survey has investigated the effect of COVID-19 induced confinement on psychological states in 1047 participants (54% of which were women) [25] . The study reported that quarantine had a negative impact on mental wellbeing, mood, and feelings, with a statistically significant reduction in the total scores of the mental wellbeing and depressive symptoms questionnaires. Moreover, confinement was associated with an increased risk for developing insomnia symptoms [26] [27] [28] . Insomnia itself is characterized by repercussions on diurnal functioning, such as fatigue or diurnal drowsiness, attention disorders, depressive symptoms [29] , anxiety, and addictive disorders [30] . It should also be noted that a reduction in sleep time was associated with a change in the circadian rhythm, a high level of stress, or both, which in turn can (a) make participants more vulnerable and prone to viral infections [31] , (b) increase the risk of psychological disorders [32] , (c) have a negative impact on cognitive performance and decision-making, and (d) increase the risk of addiction and impulsivity [33] . Hawryluck et al. [34] observed a 29% increase in moderate symptoms of PTSD in \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" (SARS)-confined individuals upon release from confinement. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 4.6% of participants in a sample of 2032 participants from the general population reported a high level of PTSD related symptoms [35] .",

In contrast, another study showed an equal level of physical activity intensity during the lockdown, compared to the pre-pandemic period in citizens of the United Kingdom (20 years old) [39] .

These findings suggest that healthy lifestyle behaviours, including healthy dietary intake, being physically active, not smoking, and not consuming alcohol, were associated with decreased stress and improved cognitive function during the COVID-19 induced confinement. Accordingly, previous studies have also reported that confinement may reduce physical activity and increase unhealthy diet, depression, anxiety, stress [41] , negative mood states [42] , and negative mental health [43] . Given the importance of physical activity in counteracting the negative impact of a sedentary lifestyle during confinement, various home-based activities are recommended [44] .",

The WHO and other scientific institutions and researchers have recommended that communities should practice different types and intensities of physical activity, such as dancing, body-weight strength and balance training [44] [45] [46] , skipping ropes, walking up and down the stairs [46] , amongst others, for 30 min per day for healthy adults and 1 h per day for children with mild to moderate intensity [47] to reduce the negative feelings of confinement.",

In addition, compliance with government guidelines was self-reported. Based on our results, we concluded that the COVID-19-induced confinement has a negative effect on stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours. However, this may not be a direct causal connection, and we have to acknowledge that there may be other explanations; e.g., participants may simply be more stressed at the second assessment because they have been exposed for longer to the pandemic and news of mortalities, among others.",
