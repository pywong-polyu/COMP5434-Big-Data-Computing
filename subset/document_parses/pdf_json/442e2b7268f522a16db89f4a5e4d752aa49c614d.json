A critical metric in the performance evaluation for a diagnostic test kit is the analytical sensitivity, which is measured by the limit of detection (LOD). Commercial RNA stocks with known titers are used to determine LOD. We identified a problem with the titer reported for the commercial stocks when examining the analytical sensitivity of the reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) protocol that is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using plasmid DNA from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), synthetic RNA from BEI Resources (BEI), and extracted genomic RNA from BEI. We detected 3/3 positives for reactions containing synthetic RNA at a concentration of 0.1 copies/reaction (based on the supplier's label concentration). The apparent better-than-single-molecule performance is a statistically highly unlikely event, indicating a potential inaccuracy in the supplier's quantification of the stock material. Using an ultrasensitive and precise assay, reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR), we independently quantified concentrations of commercial SARS-CoV-2 plasmid DNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA stocks. For plasmid DNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR was 11% of the nominal label concentration. For synthetic RNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 770% of the label concentration and for a different lot was 57% of the label concentration. For genomic RNA, the concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 240% of the label concentration and for a different lot it was 300% of the label concentration. This SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA from BEI Resources has been used in at least 11 approved FDA Emergency Use Authorizations as of April 27, 2020. Such deviations of reported RNA or DNA stock concentrations from true concentrations can result in inaccurate quantification and calculation of LOD. Precise and accurate reporting of DNA and RNA stock concentrations by commercial suppliers will enable accurate quantification of assay performance, which is urgently needed to improve evaluation of different assays by diagnostic developers and regulatory bodies.",

            "text": "As of April 27, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has reached 185 countries/regions, with more than 3 million infected individuals, and more than 210,000 deaths. [1, 2] The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and the large proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals has led to widespread demand for diagnostic test kits. To meet the massive demand, on February 4, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) secretary declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detecting SARS-CoV-2. [3] Since then, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has fast-tracked 49 Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for SARS-CoV-2 test-kit manufacturers and commercial laboratories. [4] The application to receive an EUA requires a description of the assay and an evaluation of its performance. [5] A key metric in evaluating assay performance is the analytical sensitivity, which describes the ability of a test to detect very low concentrations of the target analyte. Analytical sensitivity is typically measured using the limit-of-detection (LOD), which is the concentration of target analyte that can be consistently detected at least 95% of the time (19 of 20 replicates are positive). It is important for test kits to demonstrate a low LOD, which indicates good sensitivity of the test and the ability to detect samples containing very low viral RNA concentrations. Thus far, many diagnostic test kits for SARS-CoV-2 RNA have reported good LODs, with some reporting down to as low as 40 copies/mL.",

A priori, we expect all NA stocks to have similar LOD. We also expect that the RNA LOD may be slightly worse than the DNA LOD because RNA must be transcribed prior to amplification. Contrary to these expectations, we observed that both RNA stocks outperformed the DNA stock. The first non-detects (reactions failing to amplify) appeared at 31.6 copies/reaction for plasmid DNA (Fig. 1A) , at 0.0316 copies/reaction for synthetic RNA (Fig. 1B) , and at 0.316 copies/reaction for genomic RNA (Fig. 1C) .

Better-than-single-molecule assay performance is highly unlikely based on statistics. Using the Poisson distribution, [8] which accounts for the stochasticity in loading a reaction well, when loading a solution into a well at an average target RNA concentration of 0.1 copies/reaction there is a ~9.5% chance that a reaction well actually contains at least one RNA copy.

We obtained an additional lot of synthetic RNA (lot 70034198) and an additional lot of genomic RNA (lot 70033320) from the same supplier (BEI). For each, we diluted the label concentration down to what should have been 63.3 copies/\u00b5L and measured the concentration with RT-dPCR (n=1). The synthetic RNA stock (lot 70034198) measured 38 copies/\u00b5L. From this, we calculated a concentration of 1.7x10 5 copies/\u00b5L, which is 57% of the label concentration of 2.9x10 5 copies/\u00b5L. We note that lot 70034198 was much closer (57%) to the label value as compared with lot 70033953 (770%). The genomic RNA stock (lot 70033320) measured 193 copies/\u00b5L. From this measurement, we calculated a concentration of 1.4x10 5 copies/\u00b5L, which is 300% of the label concentration of 4.8x10 4 copies/\u00b5L. We found that the RT-dPCR measurements for genomic RNA stocks were similarly higher (240% for lot 70033700, 300% for lot 70033320) than the supplier's label concentration.",

For example, 3 of 10 wells turned positive for a label concentration diluted to 0.0316 copies/reaction with synthetic RNA (lot 70033953), whereas we would expect (based on statistical calculations) for 3 out of 100 wells to be positive.

Performing an ultrasensitive digital PCR method, RT-dPCR, revealed there are likely errors in the supplier-reported concentrations. Specifically, using RT-dPCR, the measured concentration of plasmid DNA (IDT, lot 508728) was 11% of the label concentration. For synthetic RNA (BEI), the measured concentration by RT-dPCR was 770% of the label concentration for lot 70033953, whereas it was 57% of the label concentration for lot 70034198. For genomic RNA (BEI), the measured concentration by RT-dPCR was 240% of the label concentration for lot 70033700 and 300% of the label concentration for lot 70033320. An underreporting of the stock concentration could lead to an artificially improved LOD for a diagnostic assay. Such discrepancies in how NA suppliers quantify their stock can introduce significant biases and impair proper development and evaluation of in vitro diagnostics being considered for regulatory approvals and mass production. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Nevertheless, it is possible to come close using an assay which yields the highest NA concentration, has low background, and produces statistically plausible results. For this, here we have successfully used ultrasensitive digital RT-dPCR. We suggest that RT-dPCR or a similarly improved methodology is implemented for quantification of all RNA stocks used for SARS-CoV-2 assays being submitted for emergency use authorization or equivalent regulatory approval. We also encourage independent evaluations of in vitro diagnostic assay performance using the same quantified standards by unbiased sources. [11] ",

All samples were made to 50 \u00b5L and duplicates were run by adding 22 \u00b5L to two sample wells in the DG8 Cartridge (1864008, Bio-Rad). Dilutions were quantified using the QX200 droplet digital PCR system (Bio-Rad) and droplet generation, droplet transfer, and foil sealing followed manufacturer's instructions. Thermocycling took place on a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) with an RT step at 55 \u00b0C for 10 min, pre-melt at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 68 \u00b0C for 30 s, and a stabilization at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min, 90 \u00b0C for 5 min, and a hold at 12 \u00b0C until droplet analysis. A temperature ramp rate of 2 \u00b0C/s was used for temperature transitions. Droplets were read according to manufacturer's instructions. Analysis thresholds were manually set to 10,000. Final concentrations were determined using the merge setting on the QuantaSoft analysis software (Bio-Rad). Measured stock concentrations were calculated by subtracting background (signal average of 16 no-template controls) and multiplying by the dilution factor.",
