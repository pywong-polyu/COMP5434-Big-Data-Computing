To test this hypothesis, we developed and compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of 2 subunit vaccines, 1 systemic and 1 mucosal, in the rhesus macaque model.",

            "text": "Effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are urgently needed. Although most vaccine strategies have focused on systemic immunization, here we compared the protective efficacy of 2 adjuvanted subunit vaccines with spike protein S1: an intramuscularly primed/boosted vaccine and an intramuscularly primed/intranasally boosted mucosal vaccine in rhesus macaques. The intramuscular-alumonly vaccine induced robust binding and neutralizing antibody and persistent cellular immunity systemically and mucosally, whereas intranasal boosting with nanoparticles, including IL-15 and TLR agonists, elicited weaker T cell and Ab responses but higher dimeric IgA and IFN-\u03b1. Nevertheless, following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, neither group showed detectable subgenomic RNA in upper or lower respiratory tracts versus naive controls, indicating full protection against viral replication. Although mucosal and systemic protective mechanisms may differ, results demonstrate both vaccines can protect against respiratory SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In summary, we have demonstrated that the mucosal vaccine was safe after multiple doses and cleared the input virus more efficiently in the nasal cavity and thus may act as a potent complementary reinforcing boost for conventional systemic vaccines to provide overall better protection. The systemic strategy is an intramuscularly (IM) administered vaccine composed of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) protein adjuvanted with alum. Subunit vaccines with alum have been traditionally used for vaccine development owing to their safety profile and effectiveness against viral infections (17) (18) (19) . The mucosal strategy is a mucosal vaccine primed with IM-alum and boosted with IN-administered spike protein nanoparticles adjuvanted with TLR agonists and IL-15, analogous to vaccines we have used in HIV-1 studies (20) (21) (22) . In light of the possibility that these vaccines could be used as a complementary booster vaccine after the administration of 2 doses of front-runner vaccines such as mRNA vaccines, adenovirus-vectored vaccines, or inactivated vaccines, we addressed the safety concerns and investigated the protective efficacy after 3 or 4 doses. The studies here indicate that after SARS-CoV-2 viral challenge, these 2 subunit vaccines could mediate full protection against viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and interestingly, the IN vaccine could also clear the input challenge virus more rapidly to prevent viral transmission in the upper respiratory tract, which was only rarely achieved with most of the COVID-19 vaccine studies in macaques.",

Several vaccines, including 2 mRNA strategies by Moderna and Pfizer, several adenovirus-vectored vaccines, and 2 inactivated vaccines, showed protection in phase III trials, and obtained or are close to obtaining license or Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). However, the durability of the protective immunity of these approaches is still unknown (23) , so subsequent boosts may be necessary. Based on the previous experience with other coronaviruses, it is more likely that 1 or more additional boosts will be needed to induce long-lasting protective immunity after the waning of the induced Ab responses (24) . Furthermore, recent emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the United Kingdom and B.1.351 in South Africa, which are more transmissible and the latter more resistant to convalescent plasma and vaccinee sera, calls for additional modified vaccine boosts (25, 26) . Thus, safe and convenient booster vaccines, which could be given multiple times to humans, will likely be urgently needed in the future. Given the importance of respiratory mucosal immunity (12), our subunit mucosal vaccine could possibly be an ideal candidate to provide a potent and complementary reinforcement for any systemically induced immunity.",

A total of 100 \u03bcg WT S1 protein per dose was used in both vaccines. The protein dose was chosen based on our previous HIV vaccine studies, whereas S1 protein was chosen because it is more immunogenic than receptor-binding domain (17) but has fewer other epitopes to compete than the full-length spike protein. All the animals were primed at week 0 and boosted at week 3 ( Figure 1 ). An extra IN boost was given to group 2 at week 6. The first 2 IN boosts were in PLGA nanoparticles.

Two weeks after the second vaccination, robust S1-specific Ab responses, including serum IgG, BAL mucosal IgG and IgA, were elicited in group 1 animals, whereas much lower serum IgG and barely any BAL IgG and IgA responses were detected in group 2 animals ( Figure 2 , A-C). Group 1 reached a median serum ED 50 of 25,209, whereas group 2 was significantly lower at 845 (Figure 2A ). The IgG and IgA titers in BAL followed similar patterns (Figure 2 , B and C). No significant boosting anamnestic effects were observed even with an extra IN boost at week 6 for group 2. In group 1, we observed declining Ab titers in serum and BAL over time, with about a 10-fold decrease of serum IgG titer (to 2596) at 9 weeks, compared with the peak at 2 weeks after the second vaccination.",

This last vaccination also resulted in the induction of mucosal IgG and IgA in BAL in group 2 ( Figure 2 , B and C). Nevertheless, after this boost, group JCI Insight 2021;6(10):e148494 https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.148494 1 still had higher IgG responses in serum and BAL compared with those in group 2. Both groups had similar IgA responses in BAL. Dimeric IgA present at the mucosal surface has higher binding affinity to pathogens, and therefore is more potent than monomeric IgA, and thus may provide greater protection against mucosal pathogens (27, 28) . We therefore assessed the S1-specific dimeric IgA responses in BAL samples. Notably, we found that group 2 had significantly higher dimeric IgA in BAL than group 1 (roughly 5-fold) after the last boost ( Figure 2D ). All but 1 animal in group 1 had only the same level of dimeric IgA as naive controls. This indicated that the total S1-specific IgA responses were different in the 2 groups, with group 2 having mainly dimeric IgA and group 1 having monomeric IgA. We hypothesized that the higher dimeric IgA responses in the lung mucosa of macaques receiving the mucosal vaccine might provide better protection against viral challenges with SARS-CoV-2 than the monomeric IgA responses.",

The geometric mean titer (GMT) of Nab ID 50 was 374 in group 1 and 18 in group 2 ( Figure 2E ). Interestingly, although the binding Ab titer in serum had a 10-fold decrease from 2-9 weeks after second vaccination, the PRNT titers maintained similar levels ( Figure 2E ). At day 8 after the last boost, even though the S1-binding Ab titer (11, 977 and 824 for groups 1 and 2, respectively) was still lower than or comparable with that of the 2-week after second vaccination level (25, 209 and 845, respectively), the ID 50 of PRNT in group 1 (GMT greater than 4047) was so high that 5 out of 6 animals exceeded the upper detection limit of 4860. The GMT of PRNT in group 2 was also increased to 374. The ID 90 of the PRNT data followed the same trend (Supplemental Figure 1 ; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi. org/10.1172/jci.insight.148494DS1). Thus, the 2 platforms of S1 subunit vaccines induced robust S1-specific Ab responses in blood and BAL, including potent neutralizing capacity in blood. Based on the prior challenge studies using macaque models, protective effects were usually observed in animals with PRNT titers higher than 100 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) .

Although the mechanisms are not known, one hypothesis is that the interval of 2-3 months between the vaccination doses might give the Ab-producing B cells more time to interact with antigen-specific T helper cells and thus facilitate B cell maturation to high-affinity/Nab-producing plasma cells. Therefore, whether the vaccines could induce high-quality antigen-specific T helper cell responses was a key question.",

Similar Th1 cell responses in BAL were seen in both groups at early time points but dropped significantly in group 2 at later time points despite the mucosal immunizations that group 2 animals received ( Figure 3D ).

            "text": "In other viral respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, the presence of Th1 cell responses is more favorable to control disease, whereas the induction of Th2 and Th17 cell responses has been linked to immunopathogenic lung diseases in animals or clinical trials (32) (33) (34) . When evaluating S1-specific Th2 (IL-4-, IL-13-secreting cells) and Th17 (IL-17A-secreting cells) responses, we did not find significant differences between the 2 vaccinated groups after the vaccination or in the prevaccination levels (Supplemental Figure 3) . However, since the frequencies of antigen-specific T cell responses were low, we further assessed the kinetics of total Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets after stimulating the samples with PMA and ionomycin. In these more robust assays, we observed a slight downtrend of Th1, an uptrend of Th17, and no change for Th2 in PBMC (Supplemental Figure 4) . This was in sharp contrast to the scenario in BAL, where Th1 response increased over time, and especially the frequency of TNF-\u03b1-secreting cells was almost doubled compared with prevaccination levels (from 40% to 80%) (Supplemental Figure 4) . Total TNF-\u03b1-secreting CD8 + T cells (Tc1) also increased markedly from 60% to 85% after stimulation with PMA and ionomycin (Supplemental Figure 5 ). This increase of Th1 and Tc1 responses in BAL for both vaccine platforms suggested that a redistribution of the Th cell and CD8 + T subsets might occur during the vaccination. The high frequency of Th1 and Tc1 subsets in BAL might be beneficial to the host, suggesting a further benefit of the local respiratory mucosal route of vaccination. The S1-specific CD8 + T cell responses were also induced in some of the vaccinated animals from both groups but with less magnitude and persistence (Supplemental Figure 6) .",

The challenge virus was obtained from BEI Resources and has a reported infectious titer in Vero E6 cells of 3 \u00d7 10 6 (Figure 4) . Similar to other studies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in macaque models, the input VLs were much higher than the replicating VLs. At day 2, a VL of log 7 in nasal swabs and a VL of log 5 in BAL fluid were detected. One animal, DFKL, in the naive group, did not shown any signs of infection. Even the input virus, as shown in gRNA VL, was negative in all samples tested. It is worth mentioning that DFKL previously had been exposed to 8 repeated challenges of SIVmac251, but never showed any VLs for SIV, suggesting that this animal might have unique innate immunity, which allowed it to quickly clear the input virus. Indeed, we found that this animal had unusually high levels of IFN-\u03b1, SCF, I-TAC, IL-1R-\u03b1, and PDGF-BB in serum. The high level of IFN (undetectable in naive uninfected samples) might explain the resistance of DFKL to SIVmac251 and SARS-CoV-2 viral challenges (Supplemental Figure 8) .",

Since full immunity against sgRNA had been achieved for both vaccines, we could not identify the immune correlates of protection at the sgRNA level. However, we further analyzed the immune correlates with peak gRNA data after the mucosal vaccine, which is a surrogate marker of efficiency of clearance of input virus. Since group 1 and 2 animals had different immune responses and might have different protection mechanisms, it was more logical to analyze them separately in order to have the capability to compare between the 2 groups. Since most of the immune responses in group 1 were very similar to each other, there was not enough spread to find significant correlations within that group (data not shown). We did observe several significant correlations or trends of significance in group 2 ( Figure 5, A and B) . Notably, both serum S1-specific IgG and PRNT responses positively correlated with antigen-specific CD4 + T cell responses in PBMCs (R = 0.94 and 0.87; P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively), suggesting the importance of antigen-specific Th1 responses to induce humoral responses. Importantly, we noticed that gRNA in BAL inversely correlated (or showed a trend) with S1-specific IgA titers and IFN-\u03b1 production in BAL samples ( Figure 5 , C and D, R = -0.94 and -0.76; P = 0.02 and 0.12, respectively), suggesting that local respiratory mucosal immunity might participate in clearing of the input virus more efficiently ( Figure 5 ). We did not find a correlation between dimeric IgA and gRNA clearance after viral challenge. One possible explanation is that whereas dimeric IgA, as an ideal mucosal defender, can efficiently neutralize virus by immune exclusion to prevent the virus from contacting epithelial cells, or trapping the invaders on the luminal surface, dimeric IgA is a poor opsonin and a weaker activator of complement system and thus is not capable of clearing the virus-Ab complexes as quickly as IgA does. However, the higher dimeric IgA titers in group 2 ( Figure 2D ) may contribute to inhibiting viral replication by preventing the virus from infecting the target cells. Thus, both mechanisms may play a role and are worth further investigation.",

As there were not enough staff to have all the animals necropsied in 1 day, we performed the necropsies on either day 7 or 10 (Supplemental Table 1 ). One-half of the animals in each group were euthanized on day 7 and the other half on day 10. The distribution is evenly divided, and therefore, the histopathology results/lung inflammation scores are comparable. The timing was also dependent on the need to first collect BAL fluid on days 2 and 4 after challenge. Sections of lung and lymph node (axillary and inguinal) from animals necropsied on day 7 were evaluated histologically and immunohistochemically for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen, respectively. Most lung sections were negative for virus antigen immunoreactivity, but in some cases, rare positive foci of virus antigen were observed in samples from 2 control animals ( Figure 6, A and B) . The severity of inflammation, when present, ranged from mild to moderate severity. The inflammatory changes observed were characterized by a mixed polymorphonuclear and mononuclear (predominantly macrophage) cellular infiltrate present within alveolar capillaries and, less frequently, present within the alveolar spaces. Inflammatory lesions were most associated with regions surrounding small bronchioles and small-caliber blood vessels. Perivascular infiltrates were largely composed of small lymphocytes and fewer histiocytes. Significant inflammation was largely absent in the sections of lung examined for this cohort. Each animal was given an inflammation score based on the evaluation of lung infiltration (Supplemental Table 1 ). In accordance with the VL data, the scores from the SARS-CoV-2 naive control group were significantly higher than those from the vaccinated groups ( Figure 6C ). There was no evidence of significant inflammation or virus antigen observed in the sections of lymph node examined. The 2 naive animals that showed positive virus antigen staining in the lung had the highest gRNA VL and highest inflammation scores, consistent with the fact that the inflammation was induced by viral infection. However, we also observed prominent lung inflammation from 1 vaccinated animal from group 2, which did not show any gRNA or sgR-NA in either nasal swabs or BAL at any time points tested, suggesting the inflammation was sometimes induced by factors other than viral infection. Interestingly, the only animal that did not become infected in the naive group also demonstrated a certain level of inflammation in the lung (Supplemental Table 1 ).",

Furthermore, the mucosal vaccine seems more efficient at rapidly clearing the input virus (gRNA) in the upper respiratory tract than the systemic counterpart, providing a potent strategy to prevent viral transmission. However, since the protection against sgRNA was so complete, we were not able to assess the potential immune correlates for the full immunity against replicating sgRNA, but we did find 2 correlates of clearance of input challenge virus -BAL IgA and IFN-\u03b1, induced by the mucosal immunization. Different animal models like hamsters or ferrets, which are more sensitive to viral transmission and disease, might help to identify the immune correlates of protection in the future studies. Indeed, in a recent study using the hamster model, we observed that the IN mucosal vaccine mediated significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, whereas the systemic vaccine only showed a trend of significant protection compared with naive controls (our unpublished observations).",

Even though our early Nab titers were comparable (Alum-IM) or not as good (CP15-IN) as those of an mRNA vaccine (4), the last boost increased the Nab titers higher (Alum-IM) or to a level (CP15-IN) comparable to that of the mRNA vaccine. Compared with macaques vaccinated with 10 and 100 \u03bcg mRNA-1273, which induced Nab titers of 501 and 3481, respectively (4), after the last boost, the mucosal vaccine described here induced a lower Nab titer of 374. Yet, our mucosal vaccine demonstrated outstanding protection in both upper and low respiratory tracts. In the nasal cavity, 0 of 6 animals had detectable viral sgRNAs, a measure of viable replicating virus, and only 1 of 6 animals had detectable viral gRNAs, a measure of residual challenge virus, 2 days after viral challenge. With the systemic vaccine, which induced a much higher Nab titer (more than 4047), 3 of 6 animals had gRNA in their nasal swabs. Therefore, although we cannot identify the exact mechanisms of protection for the mucosal vaccine, Nab titer cannot be the only protective mechanism for virus clearance, and other mechanisms should be examined in future COVID-19 vaccine trials.",

            "text": "Two parameters might account for the complete protection against viral replication (sgRNA) by the mucosal vaccine without high titers of Nab or T cell responses. The mucosal vaccine induced a qualitatively different response in the lung, with more dimeric IgA compared with monomeric IgA. This qualitative difference might outweigh the total quantity of IgA or IgG measured. Another parameter was the higher frequency of CD14 -CD16 + cells in the lung after boosting via the mucosal route, which was associated with higher production of IFN-\u03b1 upon restimulation with a viral infection mimic (S1 protein + Poly I:C dsRNA). IFN-\u03b1 and/or dimeric IgA may be critical for the mucosally vaccinated animals to control viral replication and rapidly clear input virus, especially at the mucosal surface. This is consistent with reports that low IFN-\u03b1 in human patients correlates with more severe COVID-19 disease (42) , and inborn defects in type I IFN or autoantibody against type I IFN leads to life-threatening COVID-19 disease (43, 44) . Thus, these results suggest that the qualitatively different responses induced in the lung by the mucosal vaccine boosts may be valuable to complement immunity induced by conventional systemic vaccines against respiratory virus transmission. However, there were limitations in the study design. Since we proposed the use of the subunit vaccine as a potent reinforcing IN boost, it is ideal to give the IN boost after the conventional EUA-granted systemic vaccines, such as mRNA vaccines and adenovirus-vectored vaccines, which may be a future direction. Nevertheless, group 2 animals received an S1 prime in alum followed by mucosal boosts with nanoparticles, so the systemic prime and mucosal boost strategy was indeed tested here. Moreover, control animals should include naive animals, as well as placebo animals receiving a proper placebo, e.g., irrelevant protein with adjuvant. However, owing to the lack of rhesus macaques available in the market, in this study, we only have SARS-CoV-2-naive control animals that have been exposed previously to HIV-1 envelope protein/peptides (which are irrelevant proteins to SARS-CoV-2) and adjuvant alum (one of the adjuvants used in this study), but not exposed to another adjuvant CP15.",

These vaccines are safe with 1 or 2 doses. However, the durability of the protective immunity of these vaccines is still unknown and may need more boosts in the future. The newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, which could escape the vaccine-or infection-induced neutralizing activity, may reduce the vaccine efficacy. Thus, booster vaccines, which will be administrated as a third or more doses, are urgently needed as well. Heterologous boosts may be more effective. Here, we demonstrated as a proof of concept that the adjuvanted subunit vaccines serve as an ideal booster candidate, especially with the mucosal nanoparticle delivery. Both vaccines appear safe, and we did not observe any vaccine-induced immune pathology even after 3 or 4 doses. Most importantly, we demonstrated in the macaque model that the third or fourth doses of adjuvanted subunit vaccine mediated full protection against viral challenges. Specifically, the mucosal boost induced local respiratory mucosal protection and potently complemented or synergized with systemic immunity to quickly clear the virus in the nasal cavity, preventing viral transmission. The ability of vaccines to prevent transmission is an important concern from a public health standpoint. Local respiratory mucosal immunity that can clear the virus inoculum at the site of transmission before it disseminates systemically could also potentially prevent serious complications of COVID-19, such as blood clotting disorders and kidney, heart, liver and brain damage. Although our approach is early in preclinical testing, we believe that it may provide a novel strategy to boost local vaccine immunity for the next generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",

Seven or 10 days after SARS-CoV-2 viral challenge (when VLs on BAL specimens from day 4 could be obtained and because it was not feasible to necropsy all on the same day), one-half of the animals from each group were necropsied on each day, and the lower respiratory (lung) tissue specimens were collected, fixed, processed, and embedded in paraffin blocks and sectioned at a thickness of 5 \u03bcm. Immunohistochemistry was used to study sections from animals necropsied at day 7. The sections were stained with H&E and examined by light microscopy. Multiple sections of lung and lymph node (axillary and inguinal) were evaluated histologically and immunohistochemically for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-related inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen, respectively. A rabbit polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 Ab (GeneTex) was used for immunohistochemical staining. The inflammatory cellular constituents were largely similar for all groups where inflammation was observed (mixed polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells), so severity is based on percentage tissue affected and the presence or absence of other indicators of inflammation and tissue damage (fibrin/edema/luminal debris/ hemorrhage/necrosis). In addition to lesion severity, lesion distribution and the location were recorded",

The assay lower limit (50 copies) is shown as dashed lines. In each panel, Mann-Whitney U tests corrected for multiple comparisons by the Hochberg method were used to compare the viral load AUC differences between vaccinated groups and the SARS-CoV-2 naive control group. n = 6 for group 1, group 2, and naive group. Each animal has a unique symbol with different shape and color, which is consistent throughout (A-D).JCI Insight 2021;6(10):e148494 https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.148494",
