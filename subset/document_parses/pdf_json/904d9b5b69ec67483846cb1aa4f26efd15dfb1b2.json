            "text": "Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread worldwide, causing many infected patients and deaths. The total number of cases and deaths related to COVID-19 are more than 212 million and 4.4 million in the world [1] . Because of the rapid increase of COVID-19 patients, medical institutions suffer from a human resources shortage. To prevent further infection, a quick inspection method for COVID-19 infection is pressing required. Such quick inspection enables providing appropriate treatments to patients and curbs the spread of COVID-19. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is used as an inspection method of COVID-19 cases. However, it takes some hours to give a diagnosis result. Furthermore, its sensitivity is not high, ranging from 42% to 71% [2] . As another choice of COVID-19 cases, CT image-based diagnosis is helpful. The sensitivity of CT image-based COVID-19 diagnosis is reported as 97% [3] . Furthermore, a CT scan takes only some minutes. A CT image-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for COVID-19 is expected to provide a quick and accurate diagnosis to patients. For such CAD systems, a quantitative analysis method of the lung condition is essential. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations are commonly found in the lung of viral pneumonia cases, including COVID-19. We call them infection regions. Automatic segmentation of them is an essential component of CAD systems. Related Work of COVID-19 Segmentation: Previously, deep learningbased automatic segmentation methods of infection regions from CT volumes of COVID-19 cases were proposed [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . Fan et al. [4] proposed an infection region segmentation method using the Inf-Net. The Inf-Net utilizes reverse attention and edge attention to learn features to differentiate infection and other regions. However, because they employ 2D image-based process, 3D positional information is not utilized in their segmentation method. Other papers also employ 2D image-based process [5, 6, 7] . Yan et al. [8] proposed a fully convolutional network (FCN) to segment infection and normal regions in the lung. The FCN has contrast enhancement branches to extract features of infection regions that have various intensities. However, because contrast information of segmentation targets is not explicitly provided to the FCN, the contrast enhancement branches' contribution to improving segmentation accuracy is limited. Scale Uncertainty on Patch-based Process: Infection regions contain many small regions. Segmentation processes hardly segment them from whole 2D slice image or 3D volume as performed in the previous methods [4, 8] . To segment such small regions, a patch-based approach is practical. Patch-based approach is commonly employed in segmentation methods from images of large data size such as 3D CT volume [9, 10, 11] or pathological images [12, 13, 14, 15] . The approach is advantageous to perform deep learning-based segmentation under the limitation of GPU memory size. In patch-based approaches, patch size is an essential factor of segmentation accuracy. The patch size defines the size of the receptive field of segmentation models. Also, original images or volumes can be scaled before patch clipping to change the receptive field size. In summary, (a) the resolution of original volume (VRes) and (b) the size of patch (PSize) are essential factors for the segmentation accuracy in patch-based approaches. In a multi-organ segmentation method [9] , the use of a relatively large PSize resulted in the achievement of high segmentation accuracies among large organs (liver, spleen, and stomach). However, their segmentation accuracy of small organs (artery, vein, and pancreas) was low. Other paper [10] reported that the use of small PSize is effective for small organ (artery) segmentation. VRes and PSize should be selected to patch covers the segmentation target from their results.",

If we apply a segmentation process using multiple VRess and PSizes, we can obtain multiple prediction maps having variation among them. The variation can be considered as uncertainty among scales. The scale uncertainty represents useful information to obtain an accurate segmentation result. Scale uncertainty-aware aggregation process of multiple prediction maps is essential for segmenting infection regions with various sizes. Proposed Method and Contributions: We present an infection region segmentation method from a chest CT volume of a COVID-19 patient. We developed a patch-based FCN for infection region segmentation called infection segmentation network (ISNet) to perform segmentation. Also, we propose a scale uncertainty-aware aggregation method of prediction results. These methods enable the segmentation of infection regions of various sizes. ISNet has multiple encoder and a single decoder style structure. The use of the multiple encoders enables feature extraction from infection regions with a variation of CT values. Deep supervision is employed to improve the decoder's ability to decode the prediction result from feature value. ISNets having various receptive field sizes are trained and used to generate prediction maps from the CT volume. The scale uncertainty-aware prediction aggregation is applied to the multiple prediction maps to generate a final segmentation result considering uncertainty among the prediction results related to the receptive fields' size.",

Multiple volumes are generated from an input CT volume by applying CT value normalization by multiple value ranges to improve the segmentation accuracy of infection regions with various CT values. Patch volumes clipped from the volumes are input to ISNet. ISNet has multiple encoders corresponding to the multiple inputs to extract features in the CT value ranges selectively. The encoder has dense pooling connections [16] that prevent loss of spatial information by pooling layers. We employ deep supervision [17, 18] in the decoder to improve its decoding performance from feature values. Multiple Range Normalized Patch: An input CT volume is converted to a volume having an isotropic resolution in three dimensions. Then, the volume is scaled to v \u00d7 v \u00d7 z voxels maintaining the aspect ratio. The number of voxels along the body axis z differs for each CT volume depending on its scanning range. CT values of infection regions distribute widely. CT values of consolidations range from -300 to 100 H.U.. GGO has a lower and broader range of CT values than the consolidations, ranging from -800 to 0 H.U.. CT value normalizations by multiple ranges are adequate for such a target. We apply CT value normalizations to the scaled CT volume using two CT value ranges, including; normalized volumes, including WRange volume and NRange volume, are generated from this process. We clip patch volumes from them at random positions. Patch volumes clipped from the WRange and NRange volumes are described as I W v,p , I N v,p \u2208 R p\u00d7p\u00d7p , respectively. Multiple Encoding Paths: Inputs of the ISNet are patch volumes. We use two independent encoders to process I W v,p and I N v,p . Feature values extracted by the encoders are concatenated at the bottleneck layer.",

The bottleneck layer connected after the encoder cannot receive enough spatial information. It causes segmentation results having incorrect boundaries. To reduce the loss of spatial information in the encoder, we adopt dense pooling connections [16] in the two encoders of ISNet. The dense pooling connections provide spatial information at each resolution in the encoder to the bottleneck layer. In the dense pooling connections, mixed poolings [16] are used instead of max poolings to reduce the loss of spatial information. Furthermore, we use dilated convolution [19] to utilize sparsely-distributed features in convolution operations. Dilated convolution block was implemented by connecting dilated convolutions of multiple dilation rates in parallel to obtain multiple-scales convolution results. Some dilated convolution blocks are inserted into ISNet.

The aggregation FCN with trainable aggregation parameters was successfully built using training data. The evaluation result obtained in the cross-validation proved that the trained aggregation FCN has a high generalization ability to perform segmentation from prediction volumes. This paper proposed a segmentation method of infection regions in the lung from a CT volume of a COVID-19 patient. To segment infection regions having variations of CT value and size, we proposed ISNet and the scale uncertaintyaware prediction aggregation process. In our experiments, the aggregation process improved segmentation accuracy from individual ISNet results. Future work includes increasing variety of the receptive field sizes to process in the prediction aggregation process and development of a CAD system for COVID-19 diagnosis.",
