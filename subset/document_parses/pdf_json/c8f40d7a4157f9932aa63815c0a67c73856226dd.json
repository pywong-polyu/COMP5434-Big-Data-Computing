[6] [7] [8] This maximizes in-person time and allows the learner an opportunity to apply what they learn independently. 7, 8 The educational method has gained popularity in medical education and has been effective in improving knowledge and satisfaction outcomes. 7, 8 In a metanalysis by Vall\u00e9e et al 8 comparing blended learning to traditional learning (defined as all non-blended learning), blended learning was found to have a positive effect on learners' knowledge. Similar findings were found in an earlier review by Liu et al. 7 We sought to assess whether a brief blended educational course would improve non-ICU nurse practitioners' (NP) knowledge and comfort in practicing in an intensive care setting. The purpose of the course was to teach NPs how to evaluate and 2 Journal of Medical Education and Curricular Development formulate a thoughtful management plan for critically ill patients with COVID-19. We also strived to create an evidence-based critical care educational resource that augments NP's bedside training in the fundamentals of critical care medicine.

We gathered data about course content that they were already familiar with (e.g. palliative care and breaking bad news) and other topics they were less familiar with (e.g. critical care ultrasound). The needs assessment from critical care physicians was obtained by an open response survey and were based on common recurring themes. In addition, we conducted a knowledge multiple choice question (MCQ) test that highlighted areas of deficiency, which influenced the course content. Questions were adapted from Self-Assessment in Adult Multi-Professional Critical Care to make them relevant for core topics related to the critical care management of COVID-19 patients. 9 The curriculum proposal and its planned evaluation were submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

The bulk of learning was self-directed in the form of reading and online learning. The course ran in tandem with NP's direct clinical work in the ICU. Their clinical responsibilities were reduced to allow time for the learners to complete their coursework. For example, each NP would be responsible for only 1 to 3 ICU patients as the course began and would later care for 4 to 5 patients as they became more skilled in managing these patients. We covered the various modules in 1 to 3-week blocks and each had separate learning objectives outlined in Appendix 1.",

To assess the skills and affective learning objectives, faculty directly observed the NPs and provided the course director with written or verbal feedback about the learners. Lastly, NPs gave feedback on both the curriculum as well as their medical ICU experience in an anonymous survey. The pre and post course surveys included 3 or 5-point Likert scale responses (agree-disagree, satisfied-dissatisfied) as well as open-ended free responses.

Ultrasound imaging interpretation comfort level increased across the board and that could be explained by the daily integration of point-of-care ultrasound in our institution and its routine practice with procedures. Interestingly, confidence with procedures did decrease after the course indicating that there may have been a gap in the perceived difficulty with actual practice.

Attributable educational efficacy is difficult to study because while we assume that all NPs completed the online curriculum and learned from it we cannot control for what is learned independently. We also acknowledge that since this was a once-off course the learners would be susceptible to knowledge decay over time and a repeat assessment of their knowledge and skills would be necessary to determine competency particularly if there are gaps in critical care practice.
