            "text": "Urogenital schistosomiasis is a common experience among children in Zanzibar. There is a paucity of behavioural science-based, health education and behaviour change (HEBC) interventions for school-aged children, those at greatest risk for urogenital schistosomiasis. We assessed the influence of a HEBC intervention, guided by the Health Belief model, among rural schoolchildren on Pemba and Unguja islands in Zanzibar, Tanzania. From 2012 to 2016, a cluster-randomized trial to assess three different interventions against urogenital schistosomiasis was conducted in 90 schools and shehias across Zanzibar. The HEBC intervention was implemented in 15 schools per island. In 2017, at the trial conclusion, we administered written questionnaires to schoolchildren from 4 HEBC intervention schools and 4 not HEBC exposed schools on each island, respectively. Responses were compared between students that were exposed or not exposed to the HEBC intervention using a Fisher's exact test. A total of 1451 students, 708 from intervention and 743 from non-intervention schools completed the questionnaire. Noting some between island differences, students who had received the HEBC interventions reported significant improvements in knowledge about Schistosoma haematobium transmission and personal risk, strategies for schistosomiasis prevention, and self-reported changes in risk behaviours: stopped washing laundry/dishes 49.4% (350/708) versus 5.8% (43/743), stopped bathing in streams/ponds 49.4% (350/708) versus 4.2% (31/743), and stopped playing in streams/ponds 40.8% (289/708) versus 10.8% (80/743). HEBC exposed children also reported a significant increase in swallowing tablets during mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns (when they had not before) 30.2% (214/708) versus 4.6% (34/743). The school based HEBC interventions were associated with desirable positive behaviour change among students. Data suggest that scaling up HEBC interventions to all schools in high-risk areas, augmented with bi-annual MDA, can help to reduce prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis in Zanzibar, strengthening the possibility for future disease elimination.",

School-aged children living in endemic areas are particularly vulnerable to infection and disease due their frequent contact with natural open freshwater containing intermediate host snails that contribute to parasite transmission. The urogenital form of schistosomiasis is caused by the blood fluke species S. haematobium. The adult female parasite deposits its eggs in the veins around the bladder from where they can be easily transported to the genital and reproductive tract, potentially causing lesions that can result in female infertility or facilitate transmission of sexual infections (Gryseels, 2012) . Urogenital schistosomiasis, if left untreated, can lead to severe health consequences such as female and male genital schistosomiasis, infertility, renal failure, and bladder cancer (Kjetland et al., 2012; Colley et al., 2014; Bustinduy et al., 2017) .",

Formative research findings obtained in Zanzibar in 2011 were shared with community members and helped to inform the intervention co-design process (Person et al., 2016b) . This participatory process resulted in three community co-designed intervention components deemed as potentially useful for preventing S. haematobium transmission among students and community members (Celone et al., 2016; Person et al., 2016b) : 1) school-wide, classroom-based HEBC interventions focusing on new interactive teaching methods and classroom-based tools, materials, and activities for teachers to educate students about S. haematobium transmission, treatment, prevention, and behaviour change options; 2) school-wide, outdoor-based interventions focusing on safe play with HEBC about S. haematobium transmission, treatment, prevention, and behaviour change options; 3) community-based structural interventions dedicated to the provision of urinals to avoid contamination of natural open freshwater bodies with parasite eggs contained in urine and laundry washing platforms to prevent infection of humans with S. haematobium cercariae.",

Among them, the HEBC intervention was implemented in 30 schools, i.e. 15 schools per island and is described elsewhere in detail (Person et al., 2016b) .

Four schools on each island belonged to the HEBC study Arm 3, and two schools to Arm 1 and Arm 2, respectively, which had not received the HEBC. For inclusion, in a first step, 6 primary schools on each island, with the highest S. haematobium prevalence in 2016, were identified from the 15 study schools that received the HEBC in Arm 1. Subsequently, in a second step, 4 among the 6 schools were randomly selected. Additionally, two primary schools in Arm 1 and two schools in Arm 2 with the highest S. haematobium prevalence that had not received the HEBC intervention were selected to serve as comparison group.

In order to reduce, control, and ultimately eliminate schistosomiasis, there is an increased recognition that HEBC interventions should be: 1) created in partnership with community members from the targeted population; 2) based on social and behavioural science to trigger behaviour change; 3) sustained over time; and 4) complimented by regular MDA with praziquantel (Asaolu and Ofoezie, 2003; Bruun and Aagaard-Hansen, 2008; Aagaard-Hansen et al., 2009; Glanz and Bishop, 2010) . When piped, clean water is unavailable, such inclusive interventions along with regular MDA can provide risk mitigation to reduce prevalence of disease. Previous research has noted that top down approaches for designing and implementing HEBC and behaviour change interventions are often a poor fit for the population at risk for disease (Mwanga et al., 2004; Parker et al., 2008; Allotey et al., 2010; Parker and Allen, 2014 ). Lack of attention, especially to children's social, cultural, religious, environmental, and physical context, often results in inadequate intervention efforts that at best, only increase knowledge (Lewis et al., 1997) . Increases in knowledge alone are rarely adequate to change a person's attitude and risk behaviours (Lewis et al., 1997) .",

In the HEBC intervention we wanted students to feel personally threatened by the disease, meaning they must feel personally susceptible to urogenital schistosomiasis and made aware of the serious or severe health consequences. Secondly, they must believe that the benefits of making change outweigh the perceived barriers to or costs of the change, and finally they must feel confident and capable of making the change with support of others (Glanz and Bishop, 2010) . When these beliefs are held, cues to action such as songs, games, and drama can trigger behaviour change actions. Our previous qualitative research findings identified lack of knowledge about the blood fluke and the life cycle of the blood fluke associated with disease transmission and serious health consequences in the body as reasons for non-compliance with anthelminthic drug uptake and persistence of ongoing risky behaviours before the behavioural interventions were implemented (Person et al., 2016a ).",

In the past the Schistosoma blood fluke was characterized a worm. There was an existing social norm that everyone gets worms which were not perceived as a threat because there were few perceived significant health consequences of having worms (Celone et al., 2016; Person et al., 2016a; Person et al., 2016b) . So, it was important to have children and adults be aware of the negative health outcomes associated with the urogenital schistosomiasis blood fluke, for the health outcomes to be severe, to perceive themselves to be susceptible to those negative outcomes, and to believe in the advantages of the recommended protective behaviours (Glanz and Rimer, 1995; Champion and Skinner, 2008; Painter et al., 2008) . Therefore, we rebranded the Schistosoma \"worm\" into the \"blood fluke\" schistosome. We represented urogenital schistosomiasis with actual images of the blood fluke schistosome that students and adults found particularly scary. The image was accompanied with messages as to the serious health consequences caused by the blood fluke such as possible bladder cancer and reproductive problems when desiring children in the future. These images and messages were used for all educational tools, materials, games, and other teaching aids, which can be found on the Global Schistosomiasis Alliance website (https://www.eliminateschisto.org/resources/teacher -toolkit-for-urogenital-schistosomiasis). The schistosome was viewed as a very scary, ugly and disgusting creature and the perceived benefits of staying out of contaminated water and taking the medicine meant that you would not have these in your body. The prospect of a person taking action on a health recommendation often relies upon the perceived benefits minus perceived barrier to taking that action (Glanz and Rimer, 1995; Abraham and Sheeran, 2005; Champion and Skinner, 2008; Painter et al., 2008; Aagaard-Hansen et al., 2009; Orji et al., 2012) . A group of Pemba boys in 3 among the 4 NHEBC schools reported being exposed to the HEBC blood fluke picture, the snail board, and safe play games for prevention of disease. Among them, 66.8% reported that the blood fluke lived in the body causing illness. When exploring these unexpected findings, we found out that an MDA health worker had taken materials from the HEBC intervention and used them in a stand-alone fashion with these boys. Despite the increasing recognition for the need of science-based HEBC interventions to complement preventive chemotherapy, snail control, and improved water and sanitation for the prevention, control, and treatment of urogenital schistosomiasis, few exist (Utzinger et al., 2009; Rollinson et al., 2013) . More science-based HEBC interventions need to be conducted and evaluated in order to provide an evidence-base for other countries that aim to reduce schistosomiasis as a public health problem.",

Students may have exaggerated their responses or reported socially desirable answers. Identifying and/or validating the most critical construct for change went beyond the scope of this study. The HEBC intervention, while tailored to the Zanzibari schoolchildren, was predicated upon teachers trained by the HEBC team returning to their school and training all the other teachers in that school and may not be generalizable to all schools in Zanzibar. Despite the limitations stated above, we do believe that results were less likely to be influenced by those limitations.",
