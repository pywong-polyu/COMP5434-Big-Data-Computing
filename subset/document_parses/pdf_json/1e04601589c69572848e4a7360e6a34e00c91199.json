A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells that correlated with use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct and implicate CD8 T cells in clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C.",

Translational studies in adult COVID-19 identified T cell lymphopenia in particular, with a preferential decrease in CD8 T cells compared to CD4 T cells [21] [22] [23] . In those lymphocytes remaining, marked activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells was observed, and T cell activation correlated positively with severity of illness 22, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .

Our results demonstrate that although the immune landscape in pediatric COVID-19 is similar to adults, MIS-C represents an exacerbated T cell activation state, particularly for CD8 T cells, including a highly activated vascular patrolling CD8 T cell subset, and follows a distinct temporal immunological trajectory. Specifically, these features of profound T cell activation decrease concurrently with clinical improvement. Together, our findings provide a broad immunologic 7",

            "text": "To interrogate the immunologic features of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection, we collected peripheral blood from patients admitted to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from April through July 2020. Patients were initially approached for consent after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In May, enrollment criteria were expanded to include any patient diagnosed with MIS-C, regardless of PCR status (see Methods for MIS-C clinical inclusion criteria). Fifty-seven patients were enrolled during the study period, and 30 of the 57 patients had samples collected and processed for cellular immunophenotyping. Of the 30 included patients, 16 were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 14 were diagnosed with MIS-C ( Fig   1A, Supplementary Table 1 ). Of the patients with COVID-19, 4 were determined to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The remaining COVID-19 patients were classified as non-ARDS and included those intubated for lung-extrinsic disease or respiratory pathology not consistent with ARDS; those requiring non-invasive ventilation; patients requiring nasal cannula alone; or patients who were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive incidentally during routine screening procedures. Patients with MIS-C were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and most were treated with steroids (Supplementary Table 1 ). Consistent with previous reports [34] [35] [36] 43 , the maximum values for clinical measures of inflammation (including LDH, ferritin, CRP, etc) varied but were elevated in most subjects (Fig 1B) . Although inflammatory markers in COVID-19 and MIS-C were comparable, measures of inflammation were more often obtained for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and for patients with MIS-C; as a result, patients with less severe COVID-19 and possibly lower inflammation are underrepresented (Supplementary Table 1 ). We next investigated relationships between clinical markers of inflammation, demographics such as age, sex, and race as well as clinical disease measures including the need for vasoactive medications and hospitalization length. As expected, clinical measures of inflammation tended to correlate with one another (Fig 1C) , but the clinical 8 diagnosis of MIS-C, while less likely in someone with other comorbidities, was not distinguished from pediatric COVID-19 (ARDS or non-ARDS) by correlation with individual laboratory measures, with the exception of hyponatremia, which was nominally correlated with MIS-C ( Fig   1D) . Further, the white blood cell counts with differentials were variable (Fig S1A, 1B) , as was the lymphocyte nadir (Fig 1E) . Nevertheless, both the ALC and platelet nadir did have nominal correlations with clinical disease metrics consistent with severe illness (i.e. with hospitalization length and vasoactive requirement, respectively) (Fig 1D) . A low ALC was associated with higher D-dimer as well as a longer hospitalization length, and a low ALC was less likely in pediatric COVID-19 subjects who did not have ARDS. A low platelet count was nominally correlated with D-dimer and ARDS as well as with PCT, CRP, and requirement of vasoactive medications (e.g. epinephrine). Taken together, these clinical values suggested heterogeneity in pediatric patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C, with inflammatory marker elevation and cytopenias occurring in both groups.",

Although CD8+ MAITs were decreased in both pediatric cohorts compared to healthy adults, innate lymphocyte (ILC) frequencies appeared similar to healthy adults ( Fig   S1C, Fig 1G) 25 . Unlike adult COVID-19, pediatric COVID-19 with or without ARDS was not consistently associated with reduced T cell frequencies (Fig 1H, Fig 1I, dark blue circles). In contrast, patients with MIS-C displayed reduced T cell frequencies compared to healthy adults, particularly for CD8 T cells. It is possible that these comparisons could differ slightly if compared 10 in parallel to flow cytometry performed on freshly isolated samples from healthy pediatric subjects, but recruitment of healthy pediatric subjects was not permitted during the study period.",

Because of this difference in the proportion of naive T cells, all comparisons of T cell populations focused on non-naive subsets. For both CD4 and CD8 T cells, the frequency of central memory (CM, CD45RA-CD27+CCR7+) and the effector memory 1 (EM1, CD45RA-CD27+CCR7-) subsets was similar between adult and pediatric cohorts, whereas the effector memory 2 (EM2, CD45RA-CD27-) subset was slightly lower in children (Fig S2A-C) .

MIS-C patients were similar to pediatric COVID-19 patients in CD4 T cell 11 proliferation (Fig S2D) . In contrast, a higher frequency of Ki67+ CD8 T cells was observed in MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 patients (Fig S2E) . Moreover, the proliferation of CD8 T cells in MIS-C patients even exceeded that observed for the vast majority of adult COVID-19 samples (Fig S2E) . The co-expression of HLA-DR and CD38 in humans can also be used to identify recently activated T cells likely responding to viral infection 22, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . Indeed, populations of HLA-DR+CD38+ CD4 and CD8 T cells were often increased in pediatric COVID-19 patients compared to HD (Fig 2C-D) .

            "text": "We next investigated the relationships between conventional lymphocyte activation and T cell exhaustion or dysfunction has been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infected adults 24, 25, 76 . The inhibitory receptor PD-1 is often expressed by exhausted T cells but can also be expressed by 13 recently activated CD8 T cells [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] , and in CD4 T cells PD-1 is a marker for T follicular helper cells (Tfh) [82] [83] [84] [85] . In adult COVID-19, PD-1 expression by CD4 T cells was elevated, reflecting changes in both CD4 T cell activation and circulating Tfh 22 . For most pediatric patients, the frequency of PD-1+ CD4 T cells was similar to adults; however, PD-1+ CD4 T cell frequencies were substantially higher in MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 (Fig 3A) . For CD8 T cells, a similar increase in the frequency of PD-1+ cells was observed, with a substantially higher PD-1+ CD8 T cell frequency in MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 (Fig 3B) . To better assess potential CD8 T cell exhaustion versus PD-1 expression associated with recent activation, we used CD39 expression, where co-expression of PD-1 and CD39 often identifies exhausted or chronically stimulated CD8 T cells [86] [87] [88] . Indeed, although CD39 expression by CD8 T cells alone was not significantly higher in MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 (Fig 3C) , the coexpression of both PD-1 and CD39 by CD8 T cells was substantially increased in MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 (Fig 3D) . The frequency of PD-1+CD39+ CD8 T cells in MIS-C was high even compared to severely ill adults, though there was considerable variation. The increased frequency of PD-1+CD39+ CD8 T cells in MIS-C suggests a role for prolonged antigen stimulation in the inflammatory syndrome, but the precise history or antigen exposure in the MIS-C will require further investigation.",

Although MIS-C and Kawasaki disease are now appreciated to be clinically distinct, both are associated with vascular involvement and shock-like presentations, though shock is less common in Kawasaki disease than in MIS-C 37, 39, 40, 91, 94, 95 . Given this vascular presentation, we investigated whether MIS-C was associated with changes in the CD8 T cell population that expresses the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1. CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells can interact with and adhere to fractalkine-expressing activated endothelium, and these interactions foster 14 the ability of CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells to patrol the vasculature [96] [97] [98] [99] . The overall frequencies of CX3CR1+ CD4 and CD8 T cells were not increased in MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID ( Fig   3E, Fig 3F) . However, CX3CR1+ CD4 and CD8 T cells were both more highly activated and proliferating than CX3CR1-CD4 and CD8 T cells, based on CD38 and HLA-DR (Fig 3G, Fig   3H) and Ki67 expression (Fig S4A, Fig S4B) . Moreover, compared to pediatric COVID-19, CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells in MIS-C were markedly more activated and a substantially higher proportion were Ki67+ (Fig 3H, Fig S4B, Fig S4C) . Although CX3CR1-T cells were also more activated in MIS-C, the substantially elevated activation and proliferation of CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells in MIS-C suggested a potential role for vascular patrolling CD8 T cells in MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 patients.",

This relationship was driven by MIS-C status where both the frequency of CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells and the need for vasoactive support were more common, but the association was observed in all groups (Fig 3J) .

PB frequencies were nominally correlated with plasma IFN\u03b3, and naive B cells were inversely correlated with IFN\u03b3 ( Fig S5D) [111] [112] [113] . Furthermore, a shift from naive B cells towards CD27-IgD-was associated with IL-6. In contrast, there were no significant associations between activated or proliferating T cell subsets and cytokines (Fig S5E) .

The frequency of activated cTfh was also similar to healthy adult donors (Fig S6B) . Moreover, total or activated cTfh populations did not correlate with the PB response in either pediatric cohort (Fig S6C-E) . Of note, both the frequency and gMFI of CXCR5 were reduced in pediatric COVID-19 (gMFI only) and MIS-C compared to healthy adults Fig 4D) 122 . Due to different clinical courses, pediatric COVID-19 patients and patients with MIS-C did not have the same availability for additional research blood draws. While patients with ARDS remained hospitalized for weeks, the median duration of hospitalization in MIS-C was 8 days. Patients with ARDS had stable antibody responses into weeks three and four of hospitalization, although it is unclear whether these humoral responses were due to induction of host immunoglobulin production or reflected antibody from the convalescent plasma, as we previously reported 122 . In MIS-C, the frequencies of both total PB and Tbet+ PB consistently decreased during hospitalization, with PB responses similar to healthy adults by the second draw in every case (Fig 4E) . In pediatric COVID-19, PB changes were more varied. Although PB frequencies decreased to the HD range in many cases, in two individuals these frequencies increased during the first 15 days of admission. A similar pattern was observed for Tbet+ PB.

To further investigate this possibility, we examined the duration of elevated PB frequencies in our previously published cohort of recovered adult donors (RD). RD were symptomatic individuals who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR, never hospitalized, and then experienced resolution of all symptoms (Fig 4F) 22 . For these subjects, we collected the date of symptom start and were therefore able to plot a cross-sectional analysis of individual measures of humoral responses relative to self-reported symptomatic disease. Over the course of 17-69 days since symptom initiation, the quantity of S-RBD-specific IgM decreased, whereas S-RBD-specific IgG was detectable in every RD and remained relatively stable over time (Fig 4G) . However, PB frequencies in RD were similar to adult healthy donor PB frequencies (grey bar), even within the first month after symptom start (Fig 4H) , suggesting rapid resolution of the PB response in recovered adult COVID-19 patients. The high PB frequencies at clinical presentation for MIS-C, together with the notion that MIS-C clinical presentation occurs at least 3-4 weeks post infection 35, 110, 123, 124 suggest a scenario where either the initiation of the adaptive immune response in MIS-C is delayed relative to infection and peaks 3-4 weeks post infection or is prolonged, remaining detectable upon hospitalization. In either case, patients with MIS-C resolved these PB features as they clinically improved.",

We next sought to understand the global immune landscape of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection and in particular MIS-C. To ask in an unbiased manner whether the pediatric immune landscape was distinct from COVID-19 adults, we built a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to distill 207 immune features into two-dimensional space. In comparison to our previous study of only adults 22 , here the data used to generate the UMAP included pediatric patients in addition to the healthy and COVID-19 adults. Furthermore, as in Fig 2 and 3, features included in this UMAP were restricted to non-naive T and B cells to eliminate the strongest source of age-associated bias. Consistent with the prior model 22 , adult HD and COVID-19 adults were immunologically distinct (Fig 5A) . Notably, the immune landscape of pediatric MIS-C and most pediatric COVID-19 patients was generally located with COVID-19 adults rather than adults who were healthy.

One patient with ARDS demonstrated a stable immunophenotype over time, with all 5 timepoints in close proximity on the UMAP, whereas two other patients displayed considerable movement in UMAP space indicating temporal changes in the overall immune response.

The immunophenotypic changes corresponded to correcting lymphocyte and platelet counts, although in one patient the absolute lymphocyte and platelet counts rose above the normal range towards the end of the hospitalization (Fig 5I) . Elevated CRP, D-dimer, PCT and ferritin all declined over time in MIS-C (Fig 5J) , although only CRP declined to the normal range by the second research blood draw. Therefore, these clinical measures in concert with cellular measures of immune dysregulation suggest an ongoing resolution of pathology, though this resolution remains incomplete near the time of discharge. Together these data reveal a profound immunologic perturbation in MIS-C that, although overlapping with features of adult patients and pediatric patients with ARDS at clinical presentation, appear to begin resolving immunologically coincident with clinical improvement.",

CX3CR1 is a chemokine receptor expressed by microglia, myeloid cells and lymphocytes that binds the ligand CX3CL1 125, 126 . For lymphocytes, CX3CR1 expression is highly biased to cytotoxic, effector-like CD8 T cells and NK cells and, in particular, expressed by a CD8 T cell population that patrols vasculature with a proposed role in control of persisting and/or reactivating viral infection 96, 98, 127 . Moreover, this CX3CR1-CX3CL1 axis has a key role in cardiovascular disease, where CX3CL1 is expressed and presented by vascular endothelial cells to mediate adhesion and then subsequent extravasation of leukocytes 128 . CX3CL1 expression can be increased by inflammatory cytokines present during viral infections including TNF, IFN-and IL-1 and, in cardiovascular disease, this increase in chemokine in the vasculature leads to increased recruitment of CX3CR1+ T cells 128 .

            "text": "The identification of CX3CR1+ CD8 T cell activation was possible because of the dichotomous classification of pediatric COVID-19 versus MIS-C presentations. However, these data also point to potential mechanisms of disease in adults. Several studies suggest that severe COVID-19 in adults is, in part, a vascular disease [129] [130] [131] [132] , and a MIS-C like presentation has also been observed in adults 33, 133 . Although the age of patients with MIS-C (median of 8 years 40 ) likely provides a clue to MIS-C pathogenesis, it is possible that similar mechanisms of disease can occur across the age spectrum. In particular, our studies identify a potential relationship between thrombotic complications in adult COVID-19 patients and activation of CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells. Although these data suggest a possible common feature of these SARS-CoV-2 illnesses, it should be noted that the definition of thrombotic complications in adults is substantially more broad than for MIS-C, highlighting the need for further studies investigating these potential relationships. Nevertheless, inhibitors of CX3CR1 exist, have been used in preclinical models 134 , and could be interesting options for clinical development. Moreover, genetic polymorphisms in CX3CR1 are associated with risk of coronary artery disease 135 , further highlighting the potential role of this pathway in immune connections to vascular disease, perhaps providing insights for MIS-C and adult cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. It will be interesting in the future to investigate potential genetic associations with cardiovascular risks in COVID-19 patients and these genetic variants.

The current studies also highlight the potential temporal differences in humoral immunity in MIS-C, compared to acute pediatric COVID-19 and resolved adult disease. In US cohorts, patients with MIS-C are almost universally seropositive, unlike pediatric and adult presentations of COVID-19 40, [108] [109] [110] . Seropositivity is consistent with the notion that MIS-C is a delayed event, presenting weeks after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. with enough time for antiviral antibody to develop). The substantially elevated PB frequencies we observed in MIS-C are, therefore, perhaps surprising. In adults who recover from COVID-19, PB frequencies return to baseline 2-4 weeks after symptoms resolve, whereas the PB responses in a subset of adult COVID-19 patients who remain hospitalized can be prolonged 22 . The reasons for increased PB frequency in MIS-C at admission are unclear but could reflect either aberrantly sustained PB production or a newly initiated response. The presence of a higher proportion of T-bet+ PB in MIS-C could be consistent with an aberrant or extrafollicular response 113, 115, 116 , but in other settings T-bet expression in B cells is required to control viral infection and aids in the development of antibody secreting cells [136] [137] [138] . One study of MIS-C suggested altered quality of humoral responses with low antibody breadth and decreased antibody neutralizing activity 109 ; however, increased T-bet expression in our study was not accompanied by altered antibody breadth or neutralization in this cohort when compared to pediatric COVID-19 108 . Of note, PB and T-bet+ PB frequencies in MIS-C declined rapidly after hospitalization. This decrease could reflect the idea of a temporally more advanced immune response in MIS-C that resolves with time or reflect a response to immune modulation with IVIG and/or steroids. Together our data support skewed B cell responses in MIS-C, but future studies will be necessary to dissect whether and how germinal center reactions are altered in this novel inflammatory syndrome.

Our findings provide several key insights into the potential drivers of immune pathogenesis in MIS-C. One possibility suggested by our data is continued activation of adaptive immune responses, driven by persisting antigen. In this context, MIS-C may reflect the latter stage of a poorly controlled primary infection. Indeed, CD8 T cell activation, elevated frequencies of PD-1+CD39+ CD8 T cells, and robust PB in the blood at clinical presentation in MIS-C are all consistent with prior reports of responses to persisting antigen [86] [87] [88] . The potential role for T cell exhaustion in COVID-19 remains poorly understood and it is often challenging to distinguish true exhaustion from recent T cell activation. However, the long pre-symptomatic phase and rapid development of severe MIS-C may be inconsistent with a chronic or indolent infection.",

            "text": "Rather, these clinical observations suggest a second possibility: an additional trigger occurring ~2-3 weeks after the initial infection with SARS-CoV-2. This new event could either be virologic (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 localizes to a new tissue type), due to a secondary or perhaps pre-existing infectious trigger, or auto-reactive (e.g. prolonged asymptomatic infection or inflammation ignites auto-reactive responses). Whatever the cause, one consequence is marked lymphocyte activation, and particularly activation of CX3CR1+ vascular patrolling CD8+ cells. Future studies will be necessary to investigate the clonality and specificity of activated lymphocytes in MIS-C compared to COVID-19, to identify the targeted SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and to determine the potential contribution of bystander activation, homeostatic proliferation following lymphopenia, or auto-reactive cells 29, [139] [140] [141] [142] . Third, our observation of a sustained PB response with increased expression of T-bet highlights a potential role for antibody in MIS-C pathogenesis. Further studies are required to assess whether such sustained PB responses are SARS-CoV-2 specific or an auto-reactive antibody response. However, dysregulated and/or auto-reactive antibody responses could be linked to the observed disrupted germinal center architecture in SARS-CoV-2 infection, perhaps through increased extrafollicular activity 115, 143, 144 . Taken together, studies of antigen specificity will be critical in understanding lymphocyte activation and immune dysregulation in MIS-C. All rights reserved.

Unless otherwise noted, non-parametric tests were used throughout this study to accommodate for the heterogeneity of clinical and research data. Correlation was quantified by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1). Associations between ordered features (e.g. continuous features measured by flow cytometry or a clinical laboratory value like D-dimer) were evaluated by Spearman's rank correlation test. Associations between discrete unordered features (e.g. patient sex or binary encoding of comorbidities such as obesity) were evaluated by Fisher's exact test. Associations between mixed ordered versus unordered features were performed by unpaired Wilcoxon test. Discrete unordered features with > 2 categories (e.g. ABO blood type) were expanded into binary \"dummy\" variables prior to testing by the methods described immediately above. To test for a difference in the Spearman rank correlations between COVID-19 and MIS-C for specified features in Figure 2G , a non-parametric permutation test was used.",

In the pediatric COVID-19 cohort, there was a positive relationship between many clinical markers of inflammation and measures of T cell activation, though only the correlation between Ki67+ non-naive CD8 T cells and LDH achieved nominal significance (Fig 2G, top panel). In contrast, the relationships between T cell activation and clinical measures of inflammation trended in the opposite direction in MIS-C (Fig 2G, middle panel), although these negative associations were not statistically significant. Given the difference between groups, we next compared the directionality of the pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C relationships. Indeed, a direct comparison demonstrated significant differences between COVID-19 versus MIS-C in how T cell activation was correlated with D-dimer or LDH (Fig 2G, bottom panel). These data further supported the notion that immune activation in MIS-C displays a different relationship with clinical inflammation compared to pediatric COVID-19, and together these analyses of T cell activation highlight distinct immune signatures in MIS-C.
