The follow-up data from recovered SARS patients showed radiological and functional changes including pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. 5 Although many studies have been carried out about early findings of COVID-19, the potential problems that patients with severe clinics may face in the future are not clearly known. There are few studies showing the medium and long-term consequences of the disease. In this study, patients who recovered from COVID-19 severe pneumonia were evaluated 6 months after discharge from the hospital. When we examined the chest CT of patients, from minimal changes to advanced changes including honeycombs were observed. Deterioration in respiratory function of patients and statistically significant deterioration in health-related quality of life were detected. COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs and respiratory tract and can cause respiratory failure. 15 It was observed that 6MWT measurements were low in the long-term follow-up of patients with severe SARS and MERS infections and in the examinations of patients who survived ARDS 5 years after the illness. 16,17 Guler et al. and Anastasio et al. have worked with patients with COVID-19 in the fourth month of their discharge. They found 6MWD lower in groups",

            "text": "and Fumagalli et al. 23 spirometric values were found lower than expected. These three studies were carried out 6 weeks after acute infection. Although the 6-week results are valuable for the follow-up of patients, we think 6 weeks is not enough to show the long-term consequences of COVID-19. In the third-month study of Zhao et al., 24 which included 55 patients, respiratory function abnormalities in 24,45% of the patients were detected. The medium-term study of Anastasio et al. 19 revealed lower spirometry results in patients who suffered the disease severity. This study had 379 patients. In our study, spirometry was applied in the sixth-month controls and 18 of the 59 patients (30.5%) had lower FEV1% values and 27 of the 59 patients (45.8%) had lower FVC % values. The uncertainty about the disease, the possibility of being reinfected at any time, the fear of spreading the virus around, and prolonged isolations made it necessary for us to use health-related quality of life scales in COVID-19 patients. Chen et al. 25 evaluated 361 patients with the SF-36 test in the first month of discharge. physical role difficulties (RP), SF, and RE values in patients were lower than those of the normal population and these values were lower in women than in men. Sar et al. used the SF-36 test in their studies and found physical function (PF), energy vitality (VT), and RP parameters low.21 Truffaut et al. 26    performed SF-36 tests at the end of the third month of the patients' recovery after treatment in the intensive care unit and recorded that scores were lower than expected. They also stated that the longer the patients' time in intensive care is, the lower the SF-36 scores are. A recently published study showed that there is no deterioration in mental health parameters in patients recovering from COVID-19 but in parameters associated with physical health, there is regression.19 We used the SF-36 scale in our study. PF, VT, SF, pain, and general health perception parameters were found lower. These results show us that despite long-term isolation, there is no significant deterioration in the mental health of patients although decreased physical health is at the forefront of our study. The SF-36 parameters of our patients, exercise capacity, and spirometric measurements were studied to see if there was a correlation between the scores. Physical health parameters were also found lower in those with low 6MWD and low spirometry measurements.As a result of our past and present experiences with coronavirus infections, pulmonary fibrosis findings of different shapes and proportions can be expected in chest CT after COVID-19. We performed Chest-CT in the sixth-month control. Han et al., 27 showed the development of pulmonary fibrosis-like changes in the chest CT of approximately onethird of severe COVID-19 patients after 6 months of their discharge. Guler et al. identified lesions of different proportions from weak mosaic patterns to honeycombs in their study in which they included 113 people.",

When the CT findings of the patients were correlated with spirometry and 6MWD findings, and FVC% and FEV1% values of Groups 3 and 4 were found lower than expected.This study has some limitations. Firstly, spirometric measurements, predisease data of the 6MWD, and SF-36 scales of patients included in the study were not available. Since the basal data results are Abbreviations: 6MWD, 6 min walk distance; FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1 s; FVC, forced vital capacity; SF-36, short form of healthrelated quality of life scale. unknown, the lower results detected may not be directly attributed to COVID-19. Previously undiagnosed pulmonary and other system diseases may affect our results. The other limitation is that this study could not cover all the severe COVID-19 pneumonia cases we followed. Due to the continuing pandemic, some of the patients refused to come to health facilities due to the risk of transmission and isolation rules. A group of patients also had temporarily migrated to rural areas from Istanbul, the country's most crowded city.",
