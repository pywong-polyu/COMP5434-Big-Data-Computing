This study aimed to investigate the production, inflow and outflow, maldistribution and inefficiencies, and private sector regulations of the nursing labor market in Indonesia. Patients and Methods: This study used descriptive qualitative and document analysis approaches via focus group discussion (FGD) among various stakeholders in Indonesia. The FGD was conducted once attended by representatives from various sectors, including health, education, manpower, professional associations, and private. Policies on training, inflow and outflow, maldistribution and efficiencies, and private sector regulation were analyzed. Document analysis was used to triangulate the qualitative data. Results: There is a structured policy regarding production, inflow and outflow, distribution, and involvement of the private sector. The number of nursing production shows an excess when entering the labor markets; however, the health-care providers reported a nursing workforce shortage. Policies on outflow encourage the deployment of Indonesian nurses overseas despite various challenges. Private sector involvement cannot be denied, especially in the placement of Indonesian nurses abroad. In addition, there is an absence of an integrated nursing labor market platform which may lead to inaccurate supply and demand. Conclusion: Establishing an integrated and comprehensive platform of the nursing labor market in Indonesia is imperative. Addressing the surplus and shortage of nursing workforce requires reliable data to inform the policy. These analyses highlight the need to understand how the existing environment affects the market for Indonesian nurses nationally and globally.",

            "text": "Nurses are the largest workforce group in the health-care sector, totaling 27.9 million personnel or around 59% of total health professions worldwide. 1 Despite the enormous number within the health-care group, the shortage of nurses and midwives is estimated to be about 9 million in 2030. 2 Many countries are struggling in terms of the availability, distribution, and performance of health workers, including nurses. 3 Achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and universal health coverage (UHC) requires a sufficient number of competent nurses. According to the World Health Organization, an approximately 4.45 health workers including doctors, nurses and midwives are required to serve every 1000 population in order to achieve the SDGs. 1 The importance of nurses in the global market landscape shows us that the world needs investment in the nursing area, particularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 4 Resolving nursing resources constraints should rely on robust nursing labor market analysis, a deeper understanding of which would inform the intersectoral policy to operate in effective, efficient, and sustainable ways. 5 Although globally there is a nursing workforce shortage, some Asian countries including China and the Philippines experience surpluses due to a high number of graduates from nursing schools. 6 Indonesia reported to experience the similar situation. 7 The most recent published data from the Ministry of Health (MoH) confirmed that Indonesia has an adequate supply of nurses and is likely to encounter a temporary excess. 8 The national target of the nursing workforce density of 2 nurses per 1000 population by 2025 has been surpassed at 2.46 nurses per 1000 population in 2018. 8 However, the MoH acknowledged that the sufficiency of nursing workforce supply is still challenged by the imbalanced distribution across regions. 9 It means that some health facilities in certain regions may experience shortages while other regions reported having surpluses. The MoH estimated that an additional 5000 nurses are required in 2019, while in 2020 approximately more than 4000 nurses are required to meet the minimum staffing standard in public health centers. 9 The persistent shortages of nursing workforce in public health centers are attributable to the lack of hiring capacity by the local government. Health is a decentralized affair to the local government, yet the hiring capacity has been a great challenge for the local government due to the budget constraint and the dependency of civil servant quota from the national government. 10 The Indonesian nursing labor market analysis reported that there was 219,757 net excess of nurses supply in 2018. 11 This finding was based on the data retrieved from the Indonesian National Labor Forces Survey by calculating the gap between the total nursing labor forces and ideal demand based on the target ratio of 180 nurses per 100,000 population. 11 However, due to various data related to nursing labor market analysis in Indonesia the situation may not be captured correctly.",

            "text": "As found in Indonesia's case, formulating human resources for health (HRH) policies based on the number of health workers required to meet the population needs is actually common in many low-and middle-income countries. 14 Although this needs-based approach can inform the demand of health workers, it is insufficient to capture the dynamics of the health labor market. As the result, the HRH policies often overemphasize the training of more health workers. Consequently, if the country does not have sufficient capacity to absorb the newly trained health workers into the labor market, it could end up with an oversupply situation and potentially increase unemployment, brain drain and the loss of competent HRH. 15 Therefore, instead of relying on one simple parameter, ie, population needs, the HRH planning should consider the dynamics of the labor market analyzed by an evidence-based approach. 16 Nevertheless, there was no current labor market analysis that comprehensively portrays the policy dimensions of the nursing workforce management in Indonesia. There is a framework that summarizes policy groups that affect health labor market situation. The framework was initially developed to determine the supply of HRH, 17 and later generally used to formulate policies concerning health workforce in the UHC era. 15 This framework has been used in some high-level documents on HRH planning and the labor market. 16, 18 The health labor market framework incorporates dimensions related to the production of qualified health workers and the health labor market dynamics. 15 In the Indonesian context, the existing evidence has yet to discuss this framework as the basis to explore the HRH policies, particularly in the development of the nursing labor market. Therefore, we are interested to see the interplays of various aspects in shaping the Indonesian nursing labor market and how the policies affect the current situation of the nursing workforce. This paper provides some insights on the interplays of various aspects in shaping the Indonesian nursing labor market and how the policies affect the current situation of the nursing workforce.",

For instance, there is no specific policy to prevent nursing graduates to opt-out of the nursing occupation and attract them back into the health sector. In the United States and Australia, there are various reasons why nurses give up nursing jobs, among them personal reasons, workplace conditions, retirement, and low interest in a nursing career. 22, 23 In the Indonesian context, it could be induced by nurses' oversupply, which limits the availability of decent nursing jobs and encourages nursing graduates to take any job opportunities available. Furthermore, the absence of policies regulating this issue may be related to the consideration that nurses taking a job outside nursing is a better option than unemployment.

The HEIs can provide three types of education: vocational, academic and professional. The establishment, change and discontinuation of public and private colleges, including the study programs, are operationalized through Minister of Education and Culture (MoEC) Regulation No. 7th of 2020. 25 The nursing education in particular is specifically regulated through Laws No. 38th of 2014 on Nursing. 26 The types of nursing education and degree still refer to the Higher Education Laws, with an exception that the vocational nursing program must be at least Diploma 3 degree. Accordingly, all types of HEIs except community academy (only for Diploma 1 and 2) can provide nursing education. The student admission quota on each program is determined by the HEIs after considering the infrastructures, staff, services and other resources. Meanwhile, the Nursing Laws has mandated that the enrolment of nursing students must follow the national admission quota regulated by the education minister in coordination with the Minister of Health (MoH), which has yet to be enacted.",

            "text": "Despite the numerous types of programs available, based on the Nursing Laws, there are only two pathways to get registered as a nurse in Indonesia: the vocational and professional pathways. After completing the nursing degree, the vocational or professional program graduate has to take a competency examination to obtain a competency or profession certificate, respectively. 26 This certificate is a requirement for getting the nurse registration certificate (STRP) from the Nursing Council, which is part of the Indonesian Health Profession Council (KTKI). 26 This registration requirement is also mandated by the Health Workers Laws. 37 The possession of STRP is the parameter by which the nurse is officially recognized and pooled as a qualified health worker and eligible to get a nurse license to practice certificate (SIPP) from the local authority. The nurses are allowed to have a maximum of two SIPPs, which means they can undertake dual practice. This dual practice can increase the nurses' working hours and the number of patients treated. However, in many cases, it can reduce the quality of public health services and induce conflict of interest. Many health workers working in public service refer their patients to be treated in private practice. 38 The implementation of nursing registration and practice is operationalized through MoH Regulation on the Implementation of Nursing Laws 39 and on Health Workers Registration. 40 The foreign nurses and foreign-educated Indonesian nurses can obtain the STRP and SIPP after passing the competency evaluation process. The empowerment of foreign and foreign-education nurses is regulated through the Government Regulation on Health Workers Management. 41 Furthermore, Laws No. 44th of 2009 on Hospitals obligates every health worker working in hospitals to have registration and license to practice certificates. 42 According to AINEC representative, the nurse graduates cannot directly take a nursing job because they have to take the competency examination first, which is normally held at least three months after the graduation. The examination process can hinder the graduates to enter the labor market considering its fail rate is fairly high. Between 2015 and 2020, 44.6% of professional graduates and 30.2% of diploma graduates did not pass the nursing competency examination. 43 The competency examination is operationalized through an MoEC Regulation concerning the Procedures of Competency Examination for Health Students. 44 Policies on inflows should consider the stock of nursing workforce from upstream to downstream. The flows of nursing human resources affect the current and future workforce over the country and should be seen as critical point. ",

Despite the oversupply situation, Indonesia has not aggressively changed its nursing education and management orientation \"for export\", such as the Philippines, 46 especially considering the country has a so-called \"temporary surplus\", in which it is expected that, at some point, the government has capacity to absorb all nursing graduates into the labor market. 10, 11 The HRH Development Plan 2011-2015 reveals that Indonesia has ratified the WHO Global Code of Practice, which discourages member states from actively recruiting health workers from countries with critical shortages of health workers. 47 In 2006, Indonesia was included in the list of 57 countries facing critical shortages of health workers. 48 This inclusion has become a barrier for the international deployment given the list is often used as a reference for decisionmaking concerning health workforce in recent years though it was reported nearly 15 years ago. 49, 50 Despite being included on the list, Indonesia has sent nursing workforce to some countries. Between 2013 and 2018, 3438 Indonesian nurses were deployed overseas, though the quantity was drastically reduced since 2015.

The total state budget allocated for HRH agendas in 2020-2025 is 15,523.3 billion rupiahs. The RJPMN 2015-2019 also mandated the establishment of nursing academies and health polytechnics in the frontier, outermost, and underdeveloped regions, 53 while the RJPMN 2020-2025 planned to provide scholarships and continuing education for health workers from these underserved areas. 54 These approaches correspond with the authors' previous study, which found students from underserved areas were more likely intended to work in these areas than students from outside these areas. 55 A good management and a conducive working environment are two factors why Indonesian health students are willing to work in underserved areas. 56 The approach is not to push the students to go out and find nursing education elsewhere, but to provide affordable and accessible nursing education in their areas. It is more sustainable than the current Nusantara Sehat program, which is intended as temporary solution due to its short-term deployment. The deployment of nurses has been done through several initiative approach focusing on rural and remote areas. Policies on maldistribution problems especially in urban areas need to be done to ensure fair and equity access to the population.",
