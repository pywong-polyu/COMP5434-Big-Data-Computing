Health professionals are facing new challenges and looking for new ways to provide care in the context of lockdown and physical distancing. The Saint Vincent de Paul Hospital has leveraged its recent post-emergency teleconsultation solution (TELE-SCOPE), to address some COVID situations. Thanks to the usual follow-up teleconsultation within 24 h after their emergency discharge and the introduction of an additional one six days after, the eligible patients are able to return home earlier. This article provides feedback on how teleconsultation helps manage such a crisis. We also present an analysis of the treated population.",

The patients included by Steel et al. 6 were COVID patients with a saturation of between 90% and 94%. These patients went home with oxygen and a pulse oximeter. After this study, the American National Institute of Health classified COVID-19 patients with a SpO 2 <94% as severe and requiring hospital management. Our inclusion criteria therefore seem to be more suitable and safe. A French team also followed patients discharged from hospital with nasal oxygen therapy. 7 Seventy-three patients were monitored using a remote questionnaire that allowed automatic and early detection of complications. The results were encouraging as no deaths or unplanned emergency hospitalisations were reported. In this study, early discharge home of patients who still required low-oxygen therapy seems to be safe.",
