Symptoms and severity of COVID-19 vary drastically. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, fatigue, headache, myalgias, and diarrhea. The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe [2, 3] . Around one in six infected individuals present with no symptoms at all [4] . Approximately 10% of people infected with COVID-19 experience symptoms' that persist beyond three weeks in what is known as \"long haul COVID-19\" [5] . The cause of the large variance in COVID-19 severity and length is not fully understood, and research into this topic is of great importance to learn how to prevent long haul COVID-19 [6, 7] . In more severe cases of COVID-19, the innate immune system fails to stop viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, leading to a substantial immune response from immune effector cells which has previously been characterized by a large amount of cytokines in the body. This hyperinflammatory condition manifested as a 'cytokine storm' is called COVID-19 ARDS, and this is one of the most dangerous and potentially life-threatening events related to COVID-19 [8] .",

The lung microbiome has been shown to play an important role in maintaining lung homeostasis and plays a role in prompting an adequate immune response to pathogens, preventing a hyper-inflammatory response via crosstalk between microbes and receptors on immune cells within the lungs, while some microbes/microbiota compositions appear to prompt more inflammatory responses to pathogens [11] [12] [13] [14] . Previous study has found that severity of COVID-19 disease is correlated with the predominance of opportunistic pathogens in the gut [10] . Building upon this prior research, we wished to investigate the microbiome further by correlating microbe abundance, both fungi and bacteria, to COVID-19 severity, immune cell abundances, and inflammatory and immune-associated gene pathways, and investigate, in addition to the lung microbiome, the effect the blood microbiome may have in modulating the immune response to COVID-19. Thus, in this study we aimed to characterize the lung and blood microbiome and their implication on COVID-19 prognosis through analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples, lung biopsy samples, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples.",

If there is a vertical or near vertical slope and the counts of all the microbes are substantially above zero, then the microbe is likely a contaminant. If there is a slope close to zero or less than zero, the test is inconclusive.

We demonstrate significant associations between many bacterial and fungal species from the lungs and blood and COVID-19, suggesting that the lung and blood microbiota could play a role in modulating host immune response and potentially influence disease severity and outcomes. Specifically, the depletion or enrichment of above listed key bacterial and fungal species in COVID-19 patient samples were associated with downregulation of the anti-inflammatory IL-4 signaling and associated with upregulation of IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-20, IL-22 and IL-23 signaling, IFN\u03b1 signaling pathways, TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways, inflammatory pathways, and immune dysregulation.

JF54, Ochrobactrum anthropi, and uncultured beta proteobacterium correlated to upregulation of TCR activation, IFN\u03b1 signaling, activation of the complement system, tumor necrosis factor signaling, and several inflammatory interleukin signaling pathways. Burgos-Portugal et al. demonstrated that IFN\u03b1 causes cells to produce significantly greater amounts of IL-8 and thus inflammation, and cells infected with Campylobacter ureolyticus produced even higher levels of IL-8 and thus more inflammation [26] . Ochrobactrum anthropi is emerging as an opportunistic pathogen that causes infections in severely ill or immunocompromised patients [27] and has been reported as the cause of diverse inflammatory ailments including infective endocarditis [28, 29] , endophthalmitis [30] , meningitis [31] , and osteomyelitis [32] . This previous research lends support to our findings that these microbes may be implicated in modulating the immune response to COVID-19 producing a pro-inflammatory environment and thus worse outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Fungal sp. JF54 and uncultured beta proteobacterium, while not thoroughly studied before, had similar associations as Ochrobactrum anthropi and Campylobacter ureolyticus. Ochrobactrum anthropi and uncultured beta proteobacterium additionally correlated to decreased gamma delta T cell abundance. Gamma delta T cells play an important role in immunosurveillance in mucosal and epithelial barriers in the lungs and have been demonstrated to play a critical protective role in response to both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [33] . This may be another potential mechanism by which opportunistically pathogenic microbiota modulate the response to COVID-19, by disrupting the balance between a sufficient antiviral and hyper-inflammatory response by decreasing the appropriate antiviral function of gamma delta T cells. Furthermore, Streptococcus sanguinis has previously been found to be opportunistically pathogenic when the host already suffers certain inflammatory ailments [34] . This lends support to our findings that Streptococcus sanguinis SK1 = NCTC 7863 may influence the immune response to COVID-19 by upregulating inflammatory IL-6 signaling and downregulating IL-4 signaling. Interestingly, all other differentially abundant Streptococcus species did not have significant correlations to inflammatory pathways, which does not support the findings of other studies that have demonstrated Streptococcus species correlating to COVID-19 severity [35] .",

Pluriproliferum, Candida parapsilosis, and Histoplasma capsulatum were correlated to upregulation of TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways and inflammatory interleukin signaling pathways. These four microbes also correlated to increased M1 macrophage abundance. Incidentally, other microbes had similar associations but have been previously shown to be only pathogenic to plants. It has previously been shown that in severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 triggers a chronic immune reaction instructed by TGF\u03b2, which contributes to chronic upregulation of IL-6 signaling and B cell activation leading to worse COVID-19 outcomes [36] . By modulating inflammatory interleukin pathways and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways, the above microbes may promote a pro-inflammatory response to COVID-19 worsening patient outcomes. Syncephalastrum monosporum var. Pluriproliferum also correlated to the local acute inflammatory response pathway. These particular species of Syncephalastrum and Saccharomyces have not been thoroughly studied, other species have been found implicated in other pulmonary ailments and inflammation in immunocompromised patients and are emerging as opportunistic pathogens. Histoplasma capsulatum and Candida parapsilosis are also emerging as opportunistic pathogens, as demonstrated in past studies [37] [38] [39] [40] . The above four microbes in addition to Tremella mesenterica DSM 1558 correlated to upregulation of RIG-I-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors detect viral RNA and mediate the host antiviral response by inducing IFN 1 transcription [41] . Additionally, these microbes may contribute to a hyperinflammatory response by overactivation of the inflammatory M1 macrophages and fewer macrophages differentiating to the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage mediated by upregulation of inflammatory cytokine signaling and downregulation of IL-4 signaling, as excessive M1-polarized immune responses has been shown to lead to tissue damage in inflammatory diseases [42] . Interestingly, Fungal sp. 57 was found inversely correlated with local acute inflammatory pathways and inflammatory interleukin signaling and may play a beneficial role in immunomodulation in COVID-19. Previous study has found that SARS-CoV-2 allows anaerobic bacteria to colonize the lungs and consequently disrupt lung homeostasis [43] . We found four Haemophilus influenzae species, two Bacteroides species, and Chlorobium phaeobacteroides BS1, all being anaerobic bacteria, to have greater abundance in COVID-19 samples in BALF tissue; however, the majority of our data does not corroborate the previous finding that anaerobic bacteria colonize the COVID-19 effected lung, as we found that the majority of bacterial abundance in both lung biopsy tissues and BALF tissues are facultative anaerobic bacteria in both normal samples and COVID-19 samples, and the anaerobic species Veillonella parvula DSM 2008 and Haemophilus parainfluenzae T3T1 abundance was greater in normal samples in lung biopsy tissue. Other studies characterizing the COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes have found that Streptococcus and Veillonella dominate the upper respiratory tract and Streptococcus and Haemophilus abundance are the most important features for segregating COVID-19 clinical outcomes [35, 44] . Our findings do not corroborate that Streptococcus and Haemophilus are most associated with COVID-19 severity nor do Streptococcus or Haemophilus dominate the lung microbiome in our study. This may provide evidence of some difference between the upper respiratory tract microbiome and the lung microbiome or that the particular identity of commensal microbes populating the lung microbiome may be less important than the severity of differential abundance of commensal microbes. This conclusion may be supported by other studies finding decreased microbiota alpha-diversity in the lung of COVID-19 patients [45] . Our study does corroborate the finding of dysbiosis of commensal microbes and increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens.",

Dysregulation in metabolism and transport of retinol may contribute to inflammatory responses to infection. Furthermore, this dysregulation of retinol metabolism and retinoic acid biosynthesis may play a role in the upregulation of RIG-I-like receptors that was observed in the BALF samples, as retinoids induce RIG-I expression in concert with IFN signaling to lead to the secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines [46] . Bacillus sp. PL-12 abundance correlated to decreased plasma cell abundance and correlated to upregulation of IFN\u03b1 signaling, inflammatory interleukin signaling, and TGF\u03b2 signaling, whereas Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168 inversely correlated to IFN\u03b1 signaling and inflammatory interleukin signaling, which may explain their correlations to disease severity. Additionally, Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168 correlated to increased plasma cell abundance and memory B cell abundance and microbes correlated with COVID-19 severity, namely E. coli, Pseudomonas sp. I-09, and Bacillus sp. PL-12 correlated to decreased plasma cell abundance and memory B cell abundance. Previous study has found an association between plasma cells in the blood in patients with severe COVID-19 and improved survival [47] . In corroboration with all of our methods and correlations involving Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168, in addition to the strength and linearity of correlation in our Spearman's Correlation results make us believe future study of this microbe in particular may potentially be useful in immunotherapy for treating COVID-19. Campylobacter hominis ATCC BAA-381 and Pseudomonas sp. I-09 have not been previously thoroughly studied; however other species of Campylobacter hominis and other Pseudomonas have been found to induce inflammation in other diseases such as gastroenteritis lending support to our findings that they may modulate the host immune response to COVID-19 [48] [49] [50] [51] . However, it remains unknown if the above inflammatory-associated lung and blood bacterial and fungal species enriched in COVID-19 do in fact play an active role in the prognosis of COVID-19 or simply flourish opportunistically due to a depletion of other lung and blood microbes, but our correlations to immune dysregulation suggest they do in fact play a role in the prognosis of COVID-19.",

First, our study used a fairly small sample size for each sample type with 17 PBMC COVID-19 samples and 17 PBMC normal samples, 12 BALF COVID-19 samples and 20 BALF normal samples, and 8 lung biopsy COVID-19 samples and 8 lung normal samples. While enough samples were used to identify numerous dysregulated microbes, further studies with greater sample sizes could be used to increase statistical power and confirm our results. Secondly, metadata of age and disease severity were only available for the PBMC samples used. Further studies correlating microbe abundance to COVID-19 severity using BALF samples and/or lung biopsy samples to identify microbes of the lung microbiome directly correlated with COVID-19 severity should be performed. Thirdly, our study used samples sourced from three different hospitals, and as the human microbiome is highly impacted by geography, our findings may not necessarily reflect the lung and blood microbiome of COVID-19 patients from different geographies. Regardless of these limitations, our study demonstrating associations between microbes found in the lung and blood to immune dysregulation pathways and our associations between microbes in the blood to COVID-19 severity suggests that the lung and blood microbiome are likely implicated in modulating host inflammatory responses to COVID-19 and thus COVID-19 severity. Data Availability Statement: RNA sequencing data for PBMC samples are available at Gene Expression Omnibus (accession code GSE152418). RNA sequencing data for lung biopsy samples are available at Gene Expression Omnibus (accession code GSE147507). RNA sequencing data for BALF samples are available at Genome Sequence Archive (accession code HRA000143 and CRA002390).",
