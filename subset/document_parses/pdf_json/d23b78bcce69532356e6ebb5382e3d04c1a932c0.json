            "text": "The novel coronavirus is spread from person to person (human-to-human transmission) through respiratory droplets (aerosols) or close contact. The virus infects people of all ages. However, current evidence suggests that two groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe disease, namely, older people and those with underlying medical conditions. Therefore, the WHO emphasizes that all people should protect themselves from. [2] Transmission of the disease in health facilities is a very serious threat. Of 138 patients infected with COVID-19 in a hospital, 40 (29%) were reported to be medical personnel. Although further studies are needed, asymptomatic people are also careers of CoV-2019. [3] WHO recommends that people should wear masks in public areas because face masks have restricted transmission of respiratory droplets from patients with respiratory infections (e.g., flu) to healthy people in earlier times. Face mask usage as a public health intervention by asymptomatic infected people could interrupt the transmission chain given the high viral load in early phase of the disease. [4] Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the transmission of certain respiratory viral diseases including COVID-19. However, masks alone do not prevent and protect people from the disease and other measures including hand hygiene should also be taken. The use of medical masks can create a false sense of security if proper usage was not taught to people who could easily neglect other preventive measures including hand hygiene. There is not adequate evidence supporting this recommendation that wearing a surgical mask would significantly reduce the risk of disease transmission to a healthy person. [5] The WHO called for a 40% increase in the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) including face masks. Meanwhile, health authorities should optimize face mask distribution to prioritize the needs of frontline health-care workers and the most vulnerable groups of society including older adults (particularly those older than 65 years) and people with underlying health conditions. [5] Outbreak of a respiratory infection is associated with huge human and economic costs including illness of healthcare workers. Therefore, planning and strategizing in response to such crises should put on the agenda health-care services and preventive measures. Infection prevention and control are the most important measures taken during epidemics given the available evidence. Therefore, the optimal use of PPE including masks by health-care workers and the general population is the first solution to protect against respiratory pathogens and prevent transmission of the diseases while caring for infected patients or attending public places. However, little is known about general population awareness, attitudes, decisions, and practice of wearing protective masks. [6] Use of PPE and masks by general population has dramatically increased in Iran since the COVID-19 pandemic. The proper use of masks is a crucial point in this crisis. Various guidelines on how to wear face mask and assessment of health behaviors help to make practical health policies that would allow development of effective prevention and protection training programs as well as rational use of masks and financial resources. Therefore, the study aimed to assess Iranian general population knowledge and performance regarding the use of masks during the COVID-19 epidemics in Iranian general population.",

It is used as a unique tool to distinguish advanced societies from backward societies. Awareness affects health behaviors of people. It encourages people to acquire knowledge, affects their interests, beliefs, and actions, creates incentives to make more productive decisions, and helps people to control their behaviors. Awareness is also an important factor in health promotion and help people to recognize their health problems, resolve these problems, and preserve their health. [12] Effective control and prevention of viral diseases are the most important measures in COVID-19 pandemics. [13] However, fake news and misleading information on COVID-19 on different social media and websites obliged WHO to design a discussion forum in its official website to interact with people on social media and answer their questions about COVID-19. [14] Awareness is an important step in disease control and prevention. The Chinese government put on the agenda effective measures to develop training courses for general population to control and prevent the COVID-1.
