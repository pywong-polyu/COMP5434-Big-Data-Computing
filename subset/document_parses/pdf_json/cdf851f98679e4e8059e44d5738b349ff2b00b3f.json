There is urgent need to characterize the coping styles associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes in perinatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic to help mitigate the potential for lasting sequelae on both mothers and infants. This study uses a data-driven approach to identify the patterns of behavioral coping strategies that associate with maternal psychosocial distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large multicenter sample of pregnant women (N = 2876) and postpartum women (N = 1536). Data was collected from 9 states across the United States from March to October 2020. Women reported behaviors they were engaging in to manage pandemic-related stress, symptoms of depression, anxiety and global psychological distress, as well as changes in energy levels, sleep quality and stress levels. Using latent profile analysis, we identified four behavioral phenotypes of coping strategies. Critically, phenotypes with high levels of passive coping strategies (increased screen time, social media, and intake of comfort foods) were associated with elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and global psychological distress, as well as worsening stress and energy levels, relative to other coping phenotypes. In contrast, phenotypes with high levels of active coping strategies (social support, and self-care) were associated with greater resiliency relative to other phenotypes. The identification of these widespread coping phenotypes reveals novel behavioral patterns associated with risk and resiliency to pandemic-related stress in perinatal women. These findings may contribute to early identification of women at risk for poor long-term outcomes and indicate malleable targets OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ for interventions aimed at mitigating lasting sequelae on women and children during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The impact on pregnant and postpartum women is of particular concern given the established adverse effects of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders on the intrauterine and postnatal development of their offspring 4-6 . There is an urgent need to characterize the mental health outcomes of perinatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify risk and protective factors to minimize potentially harmful consequences during this global public health emergency. Leveraging a large, multicenter sample of pregnant and postpartum women in the United States (N = 4,412), we use a datadriven approach to (1) classify behavioral phenotypes of coping strategies that perinatal women are engaging in to manage pandemic-related stress, (2) isolate associations between coping phenotypes and demographic characteristics, and (3) identify coping phenotypes that are associated with risk and resiliency for adverse mental and physical health outcomes.",

The COVID-19 pandemic presents several stressors that may make perinatal women especially vulnerable to experiencing mood and anxiety disorders. For example, uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 infection or vaccination on fetuses and infants, changes or disruptions in birth plans or postpartum care, and reduced access to childcare may create additional risk for maladaptive outcomes in perinatal women. Women are also more likely to work in professions that have increased virus exposure risk, such as healthcare and teaching in the United States 9 . School and childcare closures have also led to increases in unpaid domestic and childcare responsibilities taken on by women 9,10 , and have contributed to a disproportionate loss of employment in women 9 .",

Anxiety and depression during pregnancy is associated with a number of detrimental outcomes, including increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, postpartum depression, and long-term adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in infants 6,11-13 . Importantly, prior systematic reviews indicate elevated rates of maternal mental issues following widespread disasters 14 . Importantly, this meta-analysis found that the severity of exposure was one of the strongest predictors of perinatal mental health outcomes following disasters. These findings elevate concerns about the impact of COVID-19-related stressors on mental health outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women, particularly given the chronic and widespread nature of these experiences. Indeed, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies across the globe have observed high rates of depression and anxiety in perinatal women [15] [16] [17] [18] . Preventing or attenuating perinatal mood and anxiety disorders is essential for preventing a sequelae of intergenerational transmission and negative developmental consequences.",

            "text": "Insight into strategies to prevent potentially harmful short-and long-term consequences of pandemic-related stress and associated mood and anxiety disorders may be gleaned by exploring factors that are associated with risk and resiliency. For instance, emerging reports indicate that psychological flexibility and increased tolerance of uncertainty are associated with resiliency to pandemic-related stress 19, 20 . Another, large-scale online survey of adults (N = 3,042) found that psychological resiliency was associated with lower COVID-19 related distress 21 . More generally, coping strategies used in response to stressful life events may increase vulnerability or resiliency for mood and anxiety disorders during the perinatal period 22 . For example, passive coping styles for managing stress (e.g., avoidance, denial), as well as social isolation and substance use, are associated with increased depressive symptoms during the prenatal and postpartum periods [23] [24] [25] . In contrast, more active coping styles (e.g., planning of action, support-seeking) and increased social support have been linked with lower perceived stress levels and resiliency to negative mental health outcomes 26-28 . Moreover, adaptive (e.g., positive appraisal) and maladaptive (e.g., avoidant) coping strategies also predict decreases and increases in emotional distress from the second to third trimester of pregnancy, respectively 29 . However, associations between maternal mental health and behavioral coping strategies, which are more immediately modifiable than psychological characteristics, have not been well characterized in perinatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Filling this empirical gap is critical for helping identify women most at risk for experiencing untreated mood and affective disorders and for informing scalable interventions to help mitigate lasting sequelae on women and their infants.",

During the time this data was collected, very little was known about how the virus was spread, potential treatments, or impacts of infection on fetuses or infants. The majority of geographic regions in the United States and across the world imposed lockdown measures to contain virus spread, and the ability to get tested for COVID-19 infection was limited. Pregnant and postpartum women also experienced widespread disruptions in perinatal medical care and birth plans, which was tightly coupled with the severity of cases 30 . Thus, the time in which this data was collected reflects a particularly tumultuous period of the pandemic, with high collective uncertainty and stress. Understanding individual differences in behavioral coping patterns and associated mental health measures during this time may inform long-term impacts of early pandemic-related stress and uncertainty on women and their children.",

We then use a person-oriented latent profile analysis to isolate heterogeneous subgroups of pregnant and postpartum women categorized based on similar patterns of latent coping strategies.

The impact of pandemicrelated stress on perinatal women is of heightened concern, given the established intergenerational transmission of maternal stress-exposure 5, 6 , and the disproportionate burdens experienced by women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying behavioral phenotypes that are related to risk and resiliency for negative outcomes is essential for targeting resources and interventions for those most vulnerable. To address this urgent need, we use a data driven approach to identify four distinct behavioral phenotypes of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies in a large, national sample of perinatal women in the United States (Fig. 3) . We found that engaging in passive coping strategies (increased screen time, social media, and intake of comfort foods), social support, and self-care were key factors differentiating these behavioral coping phenotypes, and that profile membership also differed by sociodemographic characteristics. Relative to the low-coping reference profile, pregnant women in the active-coping and high-coping profiles were more likely to have fewer children. In addition, greater educational attainment was associated with high-coping and passive-coping in pregnant women, as well as high-coping and active-coping in postpartum women. When considering race and ethnicity, we found that pregnant women in the active-coping and passive-coping profiles were less likely to identify as Black, and those in the active coping profile were less likely to identify as Asian. These findings demonstrate that the probability of belonging in a particular coping phenotype varies by race/ethnicity and sociodemographic characteristics of our sample, which is noteworthy given differential associations between profile membership and mental and physical health variables. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution given that our sample was skewed towards higher SES and White participants (see Table 1 ).",

We add novel insights into potential behavioral risk and protective factors for adverse psychosocial functioning by showing that these associations differ based on behavioral coping phenotypes. Women who reported high levels of vegging out (the high-coping and passive-coping profiles) also reported the largest negative change in energy and stress levels, as well as the highest levels of global psychological distress scores relative to other profiles. In contrast, women who primarily reported engaging in active-coping behaviors also reported fewer negative changes in sleep quality and energy levels relative to other women, particularly among pregnant women. Similarly, women who reported lower levels of all coping behaviors also reported fewer negative changes in mental and physical health outcomes, as well as lower levels of distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Both pregnant and postpartum women in the passive-coping and high-coping phenotypes reported greater symptoms of both anxiety and depression relative to women in the active-coping and low-coping profiles (Fig. 4) . Postpartum women who supplemented passive-coping with more active strategies (high-coping) exhibited fewer depression symptoms relative to women who only engaged in passive strategies (passive-coping). In contrast, in both pregnant and postpartum, supplementing passive coping strategies with active coping strategies was not associated with fewer anxiety symptoms relative to women who only engaged in passive strategies. While we cannot estimate prevalence of probable clinical diagnoses of depression or anxiety in our sample, given that the BSI-18 is not a standardized measure for clinical evaluations during the perinatal period, these findings suggest robust associations between behavioral coping phenotypes and symptoms of depression and anxiety during the perinatal period. Our results are largely consistent with recent evaluations of perinatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic, which suggest stark increases in probable clinical depression and anxiety. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of mental health in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic across the glove estimated that worldwide prevalence rates of depression and anxiety to be 25.6% and 30.5%, respectively, with few differences based on geographic region, maternal characteristics, or timing of data collection 35 . This is contrast to pre-pandemic meta-analyses, which estimated prevalence rates of perinatal anxiety and depression in the United States to be approximately 20.7% and 11.9%, respectively 36, 37 .",

However, we cannot ascertain that our findings are directly tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, given the lack of a matched pre-pandemic comparison group. Indeed, these behavioral phenotypes may not be unique to the COVID-19 pandemic but may reflect more generalizable patterns of coping strategies in response to stressful life events. For instance, prior work has similarly observed that engaging in passive psychological coping styles, such as avoidance or denial, is associated with depression symptoms during the prenatal and postpartum periods [23] [24] [25] 40 . Maladaptive coping is also predictive of increases in emotional distress from mid-to late pregnancy in pre-pandemic samples 29 . Yet, it is noteworthy that in our sample of women recruited during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a concerningly large percentage of both pregnant and postpartum women in the passive-coping behavioral phenotype (33% and 41%, respectively).",

            "text": "In pregnant women, supplementing high levels of passive coping strategies with active strategies (i.e., the high-coping profile) was not associated with fewer depression symptoms relative to women who only endorsed passive strategies. This result is in contrast to our findings in postpartum women, where we observed fewer depression symptoms among women in the high-coping profile relative to those in the passive-coping profile. These differences could relate to pregnant versus postpartum women's motivation for engaging in active coping strategies. For instance, pregnant women may engage in active strategies such as increased physical activity and www.nature.com/scientificreports/ healthy eating for the wellbeing of their unborn baby, whereas postpartum women may be more likely to engage in these activities for their own health and wellbeing. Nonetheless, these findings indicate that \"vegging out\" may be an important behavioral marker for adverse outcomes, particularly in pregnant women. This knowledge can be used to target interventions, possibly even prior to the emergence of clinically elevated symptoms. For instance, clinicians could use wearable activity monitors or ask questions probing physical activity and nutrition to help identify and target interventions for women at risk for adverse outcomes. Clinicians could additionally use information regarding engagement in positive coping strategies, such as social support and self-care activities, in determining potential protective factors when evaluating risk for perinatal mood disorders. In addition, future clinical assessments could evaluate the efficacy of interventions aimed at treating mood disorders through increasing activity, such as behavioral activation therapy, in peripartum women at risk for poor outcomes. This information may be especially relevant given that a number of women often do not report symptoms or seek treatment for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, in part due to stigma or fear of teratogenic effects with medication use 41 . These findings should be interpreted within the limitations of our data. First, we lack evidence of prior psychiatric diagnoses, as well as data on the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in our sample, given that the majority of data were collected at the start of the pandemic when PCR or antigen tests were difficult to obtain. It is possible that some differences in coping strategies, and associated depressive and anxiety symptoms, could be due to COVID-19 infection. Indeed, increasing evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection may increase risk of developing mood disorders 42 . This is an important topic to consider in future work. In addition, our sample was relatively homogenous, with the majority of subjects identifying as White and from higher income households. Moreover, these findings are only representative of perinatal women in the United States, and future work is needed to assess the generalizability of these patterns across different geographic regions and cultures. Importantly, our findings also reflect a data-driven descriptive analysis of behavioral coping phenotypes and their associations with symptoms of depression and anxiety, rather than an experimental or longitudinal investigation of these questions. Thus, we cannot ascertain whether these findings are specific to the pandemic or whether women's depression and anxiety symptoms were higher than what they may have experienced prior to the pandemic. As such, these correlational findings should not be used to infer causal assumptions, but rather should be used to inform future hypotheses and experimental studies examining associations between behavioral coping strategies and physical and mental health during the perinatal period.",

Women were recruited using medical records or through existing participant pools, depending on site of recruitment.

The survey items probed a broad spectrum of adaptive and maladaptive behaviors, including social support mechanisms, physical activity, nutrition, substance use, healthcare utilization, news consumption, screen time, and self-care related activities (Fig. 2) . One additional item (\"using other recreational drugs\") in the original survey was removed for analyses due to fewer than 5 responses to this question across participants. The survey items were selected by the research team during the initial rapid design of the COPE: COVID-19 & Perinatal Experiences-Impact Survey in March 2020. The coping items were selected to encompass a range of physical, emotional, and social support mechanisms that were accessible during the pandemic and that were hypothesized to have predictive value for risk and resiliency for poor mental and physical health outcomes. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Mental and physical health outcomes. We collected data on how the COVID-19 pandemic changed women's sleep, energy levels, and overall stress by asking women to report \"How has the COVID-19 outbreak changed your stress levels or mental health/sleep/daily energy levels?\" using 5-point Likert scales (1 = worsened significantly, 2 = worsened moderately, 3 = no change, 4 = improved moderately, 5 = improved significantly). We also collected data on women's overall COVID-19 related distress by asking women to report their \"Overall level of stress related to the COVID-19 outbreak\" using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = nothing, 7 = extreme). Anxiety, depression and global psychological distress symptoms were measured using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), which is a standardized questionnaire of psychological symptoms 44 . The BSI asks subjects to indicate how much distress they have experienced from each symptom in the past two weeks on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = not at all; 4 = extremely). The suicidality item was omitted in survey administration, leaving five items probing depressive symptoms, six probing anxiety symptoms, and six probing somatic symptoms. Depression and anxiety symptom scores were calculated by averaging across each subscale, and global BSI scores were calculated by averaging across all 17 items. Reliability was high for the overall scale (Chronbach's alpha = 0.894, 95% CI Analytic plan. We first conducted an exploratory principal components analysis to reduce the survey items into composite variables representing different dimensions of coping strategies using SPSS version 21.0. We then used latent profile analysis in Mplus Version 8.1 to identify groups of pregnant and postpartum women categorized based on similar patterns of coping strategies. Separate models were fit for pregnant women and postpartum women to account for potential differences in patterns of coping strategies. Each model was initialized 200 times, with 50 iterations for the final stage of optimization. Using established guidelines for model selection, the best fitting model was determined by: a low Bayesian information criterion (BIC), a high entropy value (indicating low classification error), at least 5% of the total participant count in a given profile, and a significant Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (LMR) 45 . Note that a significant LMR test does not identify good model fit alone, but rather suggests that a model with one less profile is a better fit of the data. Thus, LPA models were fit until the LMR test became non-significant. We examined demographic and socioeconomic variables that were predictive of latent profile membership using the 3-step procedure for predictor variables (\"R3STEP\" command for multinomial logistic regression in Mplus). Finally, we used the 3-step auxiliary approach for outcome measures with unequal means and equal variances (\"DE3STEP\" command in Mplus) when examining associations between profile membership and distal outcomes (stress levels, sleep quality, energy levels, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and overall COVIDrelated distress). This approach accounts for measurement error associated with most likely profile membership and is shown to be superior to other methods 33 . However, note that these analyses cannot make causal assumptions about predictors or outcomes, given that all data were collected cross-sectionally.",
