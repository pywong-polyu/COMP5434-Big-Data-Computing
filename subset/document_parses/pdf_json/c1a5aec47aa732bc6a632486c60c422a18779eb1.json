            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak began in December 2019 and soon became a global pandemic, resulting in major public health consequences for countries across the world. As the COVID-19 outbreak evolved, individuals were challenged to understand the risk of COVID-19 and to identify ways to stay safe. This understanding was accomplished through COVID-19 communication ecologies that consist of interpersonal, organizational, and mediated communication resources. In the current study, we examine the U.S. COVID-19 communication ecology in September 2021. We introduce the communication ecology network (CEN) model, which posits that similar useful communication resources will cluster in a communication ecology, and we use network analysis for visualization of the ecology. Our results indicate a robust COVID-19 communication ecology. The most important communication resources in the ecology were partisan and organizational communication resources. We identify and discuss five clusters within the COVID-19 communication ecology and examine how use of each of these clusters is associated with belief in COVID-19 misinformation. Our use of network analysis illustrates benefits of this analytical approach to studying communication ecologies.",

Macro-level resources can include international or national mediated sources, such as television networks and newspapers (e.g., The New York Times, BBC, Al Jazeera) that provide significant coverage of events occurring across the nation or world. Conversely, a micro-level communication resource can include hyperlocal websites and interpersonal communication with friends and family. The different levels of resources in a communication ecology can be useful, but in terms of understanding one's local community (town, neighborhood), more micro-level communication resources may often be most relevant (Ball-Rokeach et al., 2001) . This is because macro information sources do not typically address local conditions, issues, or occurrences. At the same time, macro-level communication resources may usually prove most helpful for individuals seeking information about national events or issues (Kim et al., 2002) .",

A public health crisis is one example of a collective event that may increase dependence on and use of communication resources. The heightened threat and uncertainty resulting from an emerging disease is likely to motivate individuals to construct communication ecologies to gain information about the illness. The case of COVID-19 is a novel case in which to explore a communication ecology, because while it constitutes a local, community (micro) crisis (in that COVID-19 affects the local community), it also receives significant national and international (macro) media coverage as a global pandemic. Thus, all levels of communication resources are potentially useful. For this reason, the current study considers the different levels of communication ecologies during a global pandemic. Per media dependency theory, we expect individuals to be highly engaged with communication resources at multiple levels related to COVID-19 in order to make sense of the crisis. We utilize network analysis in this study, providing a preliminary demonstration of a novel approach to studying communication ecologies.",

Networks are models of systems, wherein individual entities (nodes) are connected (by edges) that can be graphed to visualize a system (Newman, 2010) . A network approach to analyzing communication behaviors can capture and represent the interactive or reciprocal nature of communicative actions. For example, the use of Facebook to gain information about an issue or event may facilitate the use of an online newspaper that a Facebook post links to, or Facebook use may foster interpersonal discussion with others (online or in-person) about an issue or event addressed in a post. These common patterns of communication resource behavior may become visible with network analysis.",

With regard to communicative behaviors, Yun et al. (2018) used network analysis to explore empathetic communication behaviors (with patients) among medical students. This analysis detected several behavioral and cognitive hubs for fostering empathetic communication among medical students, with the most important being stress management strategies (to address feelings of agitation that impeded empathetic communication among participants). These results indicate the utility of a network approach to conceptualizing complex and multifaceted human communication behaviors. To our knowledge however, network analysis has not yet been applied to the study of a communication ecology, even as scholars have called for new analytical methods to assess communication ecologies (Shah et al., 2017) .",

Participants were recruited via a Qualtrics Panel aggregator system. Potential respondents were sent an email invitation with a secure URL to review the study's purpose and access the survey. An electronic informed consent indicated that participation was voluntary and responses would be anonymous. After consenting to the study, participants were directed to the online survey. Participants were compensated for their time with incentives through the Qualtrics incentive program, which includes prize drawings and cash incentives.",

A Pairwise Markov Random Field model approach estimates a network wherein the nodes (communication ecology survey items) are connected by edges with no arrowheads (undirected edges; Epskamp et al., 2018) . When an edge connects nodes, this indicates a conditional dependence. When nodes are not connected, then they are independent of each other. To develop a parsimonious and more interpretable CEN, we converted our communication ecology question items into binary data for network analysis (Yun et al., 2018) . To do this, we recoded all communication ecology responses of never and rarely to 0 (absence of that behavior), and we recoded all responses of sometimes, often, and regularly to 1 (presence of that behavior).",

For network estimation, the IsingFit (van Borkulo & Epskamp, 2015) package produces a weight adjacency matrix that contains the edge weight for each set of nodes in the network (Dalege et al., 2017) . We then plotted the estimated network using the R package qgraph (Epskamp et al., 2016) . The network is plotted with the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm (Fruchterman & Reingold, 1991) , which positions nodes that are strongly connected to each other more closely together. Thicker lines in the plot represent stronger connections between nodes, while thinner lines indicate weaker connections.

Strength is the sum of the absolute value of all of the edges connected to a network, which indicates the influence a specific node has on that network (Dalege et al., 2017; Dubois et al., 2017) . Betweenness indicates how often a node sits on the shortest path between two other nodes in a network. Closeness is the average distance from one node to all of the other nodes in a network. Thus, closeness is an assessment of how often a node might be activated in a network as part of overall activity, and betweenness is a measure of how often a node might disrupt or facilitate activity flowing through the network (Dalege et al., 2017; McNally, 2016) .

For example, individuals who identified as political conservatives perceived COVID-19 to be less severe and reported less personal vulnerability to the disease compared with liberals (Calvillo et al., 2020) . U.S. state public health responses to the pandemic have also differed based on partisanship. Democratic governors moved more quickly to make emergency declarations related to COVID-19 than did Republican governors (Fowler et al., 2020) . Thus, if COVID-19 beliefs and behaviors are observed to organize according to political ideology, it makes sense that partisan communication resources would be important in COVID-19 communication ecologies. And we observe this importance in our results, as both conservative and liberal communication resources were found to exert strong influence on the network and facilitate communication activity across the network. Additionally, during a public health emergency, local organizations may be important and trusted sources of information and resources (Weinberger-Litman et al., 2020) , which explains their importance in the COVID-19 communication ecology observed here.",

We found a strong negative relationship between these two measures (r = \u2212.785, p < .001). This indicates that the communication resources that were used most frequently tended to be connected to fewer other resources in the network, and that communication resources that were reported to be used much less frequently were generally connected to more resources in the model. In the case of COVID-19 then, some communication resources such as television news were used more often, but using these resources was not associated with using many other sources of information. This lack of connection may be structural, in that the act of watching television may be an activity that does not lend itself easily to using other communication resources. Or the lack of connection may be related to the limits of attention, in that when individuals spend more time with a single information source, they have less time to use other sources. Or viewers of television news might believe that they receive all or most of the information they need from this source (e.g., Shearer, 2020) and that they trust this news (Jurkowitz et al., 2020) , and thus do not seek out additional information from other sources. Future research should examine the mechanisms of communication resource connection within a communication ecology to explore these and other possibilities.",

Even though communication ecologies are conceptualized as networks of communication resources (Broad et al., 2013) , a network approach has not been used as an analytical approach to understand ecologies prior to the current study. In the CEN analysis presented here, we illustrate how the use of different communication resources are connected using survey data of individuals reporting that use. We began this analysis with the CEN proposition that use of different communication resources by individuals will cluster within the ecology when those resources are more similar. Clustered communication resources means that individuals are more likely to use these different communication resources together, as the use of one communication resource in the cluster may be associated with (or lead to, and or result from) the use of another. Similarly, when communication resources are less clustered with other resources, they are less likely to be used with other resources. As discussed previously, our results indicate the most central communication resources (partisan communication resources and local organizations) in the ecology were not the communication resources that were most frequently used to find out about COVID-19 (television news). In this way, a network analysis approach to analyzing a communication ecology illustrates something about the nature of communication resource use that is not available from other more traditional metrics (e.g., descriptive statistics, factor analysis). As such, it provides another methodological tool in the toolbox.",

Additionally, communication ecologies may vary based on the purpose (or goal) of the ecology. Thus, the communication ecology identified here might not be the same as a communication ecology related to another public health topic (e.g., the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States) Moreover, COVID-19 communication ecologies are likely to change over the course of the pandemic. Our results are based on data collected in September 2020, and analyses of communication ecologies earlier or later in the crisis might indicate differences in the COVID-19 communication ecology overall.",

First, our data were collected at one time and thus represent a cross-sectional view of communication behaviors in two U.S. states. To better understand the interactions and interdependencies in a communication ecology, longitudinal data are needed to examine how relationships between communication behaviors strengthen or weaken over time. Second, our participants represent a convenience sample and thus our results cannot be generalized back to the population. Third, our exploration of the COVID-19 communication ecology was limited to the items we assessed, and thus other possible communication resources are not represented. Fourth, a comparison of communication ecologies (network) was not included in our analysis and should be included in future research. In the case COVID-19, it would be useful to compare the communication ecologies of liberals and conservatives or younger and older individuals as there may be meaningful differences.",
