Instead of following from the stands or on television fans are choosing to follow, for example, via social media. The emerging unified theory of brand equity offers a framework to examine the mediating role of attendance and local television and the moderating role of Twitter followers on the relationships between MLB marketing assets (MA) and team financial performance. Publicly available secondary data are analyzed with PLS-SEM. The results indicate attendance and local TV partially mediate the relationship between non-seasonal MA and team financial performance, whereas attendance and local TV fully mediate the relationship between in-season MA and team financial performance. Furthermore, the number of Twitter followers for each MLB team moderates various relationships within the MLB brand equity research model.

One journalist recently suggested the attendance decrease may be a result of a culmination of factors, including ticket prices, a sophisticated secondary ticket market, and the poor performances of teams (Brown 2019) . This study seeks to uncover the practical, marketing-related antecedents of game attendance and local television (TV) viewership within the unified theory of brand equity (Davcik et al. 2015) . Specifically, we examine marketing assets for MLB teams, their relationship with stakeholders, and the relative influence of those marketing assets, game attendance, and local TV viewership on team financial performance. These relationships may have key implications for the sales and marketing efforts of MLB teams. For example, if declining ticket sales are more than offset by other sources of rising revenue, then sales and marketing teams need not be concerned with small ticket sales decreases. However, if declining ticket sales have a large impact on team revenue or are the result of an eroding fan base, more effort should be placed on driving game attendance.

Given the longevity of MLB teams, such as the Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, and Boston Red Sox, brand equity plays a vital role as an intangible asset in the organization.

First, marketing assets, both tangible and intangible, help drive customer value and deliver advantages for the firm, thus growing brand equity (Srivastava et al. 2001) . Yoo et al. (2000) noted that brand equity could be affected by any marketing endeavor, such as advertising, price promotions, or distribution, since each new marketing action only adds to the organization's previous investments in the brand.

The micro approach examines brand equity at the individual brand level to assess the impact specific marketing decisions have, whereas the macro approach evaluates at the firm level using an objective, mathematical formula.

For example, if changes in club revenue are greater (lesser) than an attendance increase (decrease), this could indicate that attendance is becoming a less critical issue for the sport.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 184, "text": "(Lemke et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 306, "end": 326, "text": "(Beckman et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Attendance"}, {"text": "Attendance is primarily driven by key non-seasonal and in-season marketing assets.

Whether responding to non-seasonal MA or in-season MA, fans choose to attend a game and receive some level of stakeholder value. When fans spend money on tickets, they generate firm value to the ball club. Ticket sales are not the only source of revenue generated by attendance. Fans also purchase concessions and memorabilia. Some portion of gate sales, concessions, and memorabilia are retained by local authorities and the remaining amounts are sent to the team. For these reasons, a portion of team revenue generated by the effectiveness of a team's marketing assets is indirectly paid to the team via ticket sales.

Local TV viewership represents an alternative to game attendance by solving fan barriers such as limited stadium capacity and geographic boundaries. Regional sports networks (RSN's) obtain exclusive contract rights to show local MLB games on their networks (Kunz 2017) . These contracts allow RSN's to earn additional revenue through exclusive advertising sales with some portion of that revenue offsetting the cost of the contract paid by RSN's to the local MLB team. Overall TV viewership in MLB and other professional sports was still growing through 2016 (Chung et al. 2016 ).

RSN contracts generally include a fixed and variable amount and may last for many years (Kunz 2017) . As such, there is a floor on any revenue decrease to the local MLB team if local TV viewership declines. However, there may be some ability for a team to increase local TV revenue to the club based on various factors of team success if they choose to structure an agreement with that benefit.

This change happens as a result of the uncertainty of outcome hypothesis (UOH) whereby fan interest in the game increases as the game draws closer to an end with an unexpected winner or loser (Neale 1964) . Thus, fans with no initial interest in a ballgame may still monitor game progress for an interesting twist at the end. It may not be feasible to get to the ballpark during an exciting game, but fans instead may choose to watch the end of the game on television.

The second reason is that teams with very large followings may also face significant geographic barriers in attending a game and instead root for their team on Twitter and perhaps watch the game on television.

First, the effect sizes from in-season MA on attendance, local TV viewership, and team financial performance are all smaller relative to non-seasonal MA. Thus, non-seasonal MA are a more influential part of team brand equity than in-season MA. For this reason, MLB sales and marketing personnel should perhaps begin to look for ways to maintain fan interest in their teams through the emphasis of non-seasonal MA, rather than a focus on in-game team performance. However, some non-seasonal factors (i.e., # of division titles, pennants, etc.) are based on cumulative, multi-season success. As such, team owners and managers can support sales and marketing efforts that promote brand equity growth through a balanced plan, which includes an emphasis on a long-term culture of winning (not necessarily a power offense), while still maintaining some level of in-season offensive excitement.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sales and marketing implications"}, {"text": "Second, while it may be important for marketing and sales teams to continue efforts toward activities that increase game attendance, such as giveaways and memorabilia, the results in this study demonstrate that some fans are making a choice to follow their favorite MLB teams in a different way, involving more Twitter and less in-person game attendance. Likewise, and according to UOH, when games get interesting, these same Twitter followers seem to be drawn more strongly toward their local RSN broadcast to watch their team. While not specifically researched in this study, it is plausible that many of the Twitter followers represent those already in the brand community of their local team, and do not necessarily represent potential new fans who could become part of the brand community in the future.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sales and marketing implications"}, {"text": "Ticket sales initiatives, therefore, could be designed in ways that not only promote attendance but, more importantly, build upon non-seasonal sources of team brand equity. For example, promotions that develop a nostalgic habit of coming to the ballpark many times in a season for new customers may be more beneficial than sponsoring the traditional one-off bat-days or hat-days. Ballpark development partnerships focused on excellent fan experiences regardless of the actual results of any one game, such as the new park in Atlanta, GA, are another potential path to increase long-term brand equity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sales and marketing implications"}, {"text": "Clearly, MLB will continue to increase revenue through future media contracts based on the recent agreement signed and set to begin in 2022 (Ozanian 2019). Thus, sales and marketing personnel should begin to think bigger. Technology is shrinking the world. As such, teams should not see themselves as geographically bound in the marketplace. Instead, it may be time for MLB sales and marketing managers to more fully shift toward additional sources of revenue by redirecting marketing asset management toward new technologies such as web-enabled interfaces and the coming opportunities available through augmented and virtual reality. In order to do so, MLB teams may need to focus on developing new competencies, for example, the development of a social CRM capability (Kim and Wang 2019) .

We fully recognize that MLB has access to other variables of interest that could help deconstruct and provide understanding about additional sources of non-seasonal MA. From a sales perspective, one useful source of data from MLB would be information about the structure of team incentives for ticket sales. Recent research highlighted the differential preferences of varying sales incentives among salespeople (Said 2019) .

With the substantial amounts of revenue reportedly coming from revenue sharing agreements and television contracts, to what degree does winning contribute to value creation? For example, if payroll and operating expenses are not a concern, ownership may be disincentivized, have a lowrisk profile, or lack the ambition to make marketing investments that could promote long-term brand equity. Additional future research could also involve an analysis of the game attendance effects within certain divisions or rivalries. In these situations, according to UOH, game attendance may not be the result of the home team's seasonal success but instead attributed to the intrigue associated with the visiting team.
