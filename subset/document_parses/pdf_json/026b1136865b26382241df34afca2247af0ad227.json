            "text": "Purpose: This study aimed to estimate utility values for health states relating to oral immunotherapy (OIT) for peanut allergy (PA), for children with PA and their caregivers. Patients and Methods: Two methods were used: an online survey and structured interviews. Both methods assessed current utility/ untreated PA (health-related quality of life, HRQoL) and HRQoL in different health states: \"up-dosing phase of treatment\", \"maintenance phase\" and \"able to tolerate 6-8 peanuts if accidentally ingested\". The survey was conducted in individuals with and without experience of OIT; data collected included the EQ-5D-Y (child states) and EQ-5D-5L (caregiver states). Results: In total, 100 caregivers and 38 adolescents completed the treatment-na\u00efve survey, a separate sample of 50 caregivers participated in structured interviews. Seven caregivers and two adolescents with experience of OIT for PA completed the survey. Data from the three samples were pooled, the mean utility values were untreated PA: 0.796 (child), 0.855 (caregiver); up-dosing: 0.711 (child), 0.806 (caregiver); maintenance: 0.821 (child), 0.849 (caregiver), tolerate 6-8 peanuts: 0.859 (child), 0.884 (caregiver). The results show a gain in utility of 0.063 for children and 0.029 for caregivers between the untreated and tolerate 6-8 peanuts health states. Conclusion: This study is the first to assess utilities relating to OIT for PA. The results show the potential benefit of OIT for individuals with PA and their caregivers and provide values for use in cost-effectiveness evaluation.",

In December 2020 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (PDAH, previously known as AR101), making it the first approved oral immunotherapy (OIT) for PA with the goal of desensitizing patients to peanuts in case of accidental ingestion. Treatment with OIT involves the controlled daily ingestion in the home setting, of precise amounts of peanut protein, involving an \"up-dosing\" phase, where the dose is gradually increased over time under clinical supervision, until reaching a consistent \"maintenance\" dose.",

            "text": "Research has found that the vigilance required to avoid peanuts in everyday life as well as fear of life threatening reactions can have a negative impact on children's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). 3, 4 Similarly, individuals with PA experienced greater impacts on social, psychological and physical aspects in comparison to their non-PA siblings. 5 For example, peanut avoidance can cause emotional issues such as anxiety and stress, 5 feelings of frustration and isolation, 6 and experiencing restrictions on activities, 7 which can include socialising and going on holiday. 6 Recent research has explored the impact of peanut allergy on children and adolescents in Europe, illustrating the wide-ranging impact of peanut avoidance and fear of reactions in a conceptual model. 4 A systematic review of caregiver burden associated with paediatric food allergy found considerable evidence that caring for a child with a food allergy has a negative impact on parents' HRQoL. 8 In particular, parents reported poorer emotional HRQoL, stress and trait anxiety than their comparison groups. 8 Research on PA specifically has also shown that caregivers of individuals with PA can experience a negative impact on their own HRQoL. 4, 9, 10 A recent study investigated the impacts of PA on caregivers through the use of validated HRQoL instruments. The survey found that caregivers experience psychosocial and productivity burden 10 and found that greater caregiver reported child burden was associated with higher caregiver anxiety. 11 The study also measured caregiver and child HRQoL using the EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-Y (proxy-reported) and found that caregivers of children with severe PA report worse HRQoL for themselves and their child than caregivers of children with mild or moderate PA (caregiver perceived severity). 10, 11 Qualitative research has explored the impact of PA on caregivers' HRQoL, demonstrating an impact on their emotions, social activities, relationships and work. A conceptual model showed that many factors can moderate the impact, particularly the level of control over the child's food and environment which can have a positive impact (eg the caregiver has a high level of control and therefore feels less anxious about their child having an accidental ingestion) or negative impact on caregivers' HRQoL (eg the caregiver has little control and therefore worries when their child is out with friends).",

Utility values are preference weights, where preferences reflect years of life that someone is willing to sacrifice to avoid a health state that is worse than full health 12 and are measured on a cardinal ratio scale of 0 to 1, where 0 is equal to being dead and 1 indicates full health. 13 Utilities are typically captured using preference-based measures such as the EQ-5D; 14 the score weighting of the EQ-5D was developed using the time trade-off technique, which establishes participants' willingness to trade years of life to avoid a health state.",

HRQoL was measured using the EQ-5D-5L for caregivers, and EQ-5D-Y for individuals with PA. For treatment na\u00efve participants the final section of the survey included different scenarios describing individuals with PA at different stages of treatment with a PA OIT (up-dosing, maintenance, being able to tolerate up to 8 peanuts); for each scenario, participants were asked to imagine their child in that scenario and provide a proxy evaluation of their child's and their own HRQoL in that scenario. In the adolescent survey, participants answered questions about their current HRQoL and were then asked to imagine themselves in each of the scenarios described and rate their HRQoL in each scenario. The scenarios described the treatment requirements and reaction risks associated with each health state. See Figure 1 for an example scenario and Scenarios 1-3 The draft survey and health state scenario development included reviews by two clinicians with experience of treating patients with PA in clinical trials of PDAH, a PAG and an individual with PA. The health state scenarios were also piloted in 4 interviews with caregivers of children with PA. For treated participants the survey asked participants to recall and rate their and their child's HRQoL before participating in the trial, during up-dosing, during maintenance and at the time of the survey.",

The data also shows a utility gain (of 0.029) for caregivers of children who can tolerate 6-8 peanuts compared to caring for a child with untreated PA. The table summarises the pooled child and caregiver utility values from the three samples, including adolescent self-report data rather than the caregiver proxy report data where available. The child values are from N=40 adolescent self-reports and N=117 caregiver proxy-reports. Table 4 shows the values from the N=38 un-treated and N=2 treated adolescents who completed the surveys and the proxy-reported values from their caregivers. The table shows that the self and proxy reported ratings are very similar, particularly for the \"current\" and \"tolerate 6-8 peanuts\" health states, however adolescents perceive a slightly larger increase in HRQoL between untreated PA and the \"tolerate 6-8 peanuts\" health state than caregivers report. The alignment between the adolescent self-report and caregiver proxy values suggests that pooling the adolescent selfreport data with the caregiver proxy reported values, when self-report is not available, is reasonable but may provide a conservative estimate of the child utility gain from PA OIT. Table 5 shows the mean child and caregiver values estimated from the three different methods. The table shows the \"current HRQoL\" values are very similar from the two treatment na\u00efve samples (child values: survey: 0.802; interviews: 0.810) and all three caregiver samples (mean utility: 0.852-0.856).

Although the current HRQoL is similar, the treatment-na\u00efve survey sample appears to be a less severe PA sample than the structured interview sample, as a higher proportion of caregivers reported a milder PA severity than the interview sample, therefore the treatment-na\u00efve survey participants may have perceived less benefit associated with desensitization when factoring in the requirements of the treatment. The structured interview methodology also means that participants were engaged with the task of health state valuation as they were questioned about their ratings throughout and were given the opportunity to change previous responses if they wished to. Survey participants were excluded if they completed the survey in less than 15 minutes, therefore anyone rushing through the survey would have been excluded, however unlike the interviews, the level of participant engagement with the survey could not be judged.

The published estimates in FA range from 0.803 15 to 0.91. 16 The lower value of 0.803 is very close to the value estimated in the current study for untreated PA (0.796 overall) which adds face validity to the value from the current study. In addition, the utility gain associated with going from untreated to being able to tolerate up to eight peanuts in the current study (0.063) is very closely aligned with the estimate used by ICER in their cost-effectiveness review (children: 0.060; adolescents: 0.054 17 ). The similarities with the published values provide face validity for the values estimated in the current study. Furthermore, the difference in utility before and after successful OIT (0.063) is similar to the difference in values seen in children with Type 1 diabetes with and without complications or comorbidities (0.05). 23 This similarity also applies to the caregiver values, with the difference in caring for a child before and after successful OIT from the current study (0.029) being almost the same as the difference in utility for caregivers of children with and without complications or comorbidities of Type 1 diabetes (0.02). 23 Currently in the UK there is limited guidance about how to estimate utilities for child and adolescent health states. Recent reviews of health technology appraisals including pre-school children, older children and adolescents found that most submissions used HRQoL measures designed for adults. 24, 25 Although child-specific preference-based measures are available, there are several challenges in collecting utility values directly from children. For example, the health states in the current study included children aged between four and 17, with the younger children being too young to self-report using the EQ-5D-Y as it is validated for children aged eight and older. In addition, the data collection took place during the COVID-19 pandemic at a time when the UK was under lockdown restrictions, therefore all data collection took place remotely which would be less appropriate for collecting data from children. Due to these challenges the majority of the data collected was proxy-reported, however adolescents were also invited to complete the surveys and therefore selfreported values have been used where available. Future research should collect utility data from children, adolescents and their caregivers while undergoing OIT for PA. Other future research could explore utility differences between those who would and would not consider OIT for their PA.",
