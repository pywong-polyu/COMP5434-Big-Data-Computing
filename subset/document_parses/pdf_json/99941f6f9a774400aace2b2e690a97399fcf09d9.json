Smart transformation is critical for manufacturing enterprises in the development of smart manufacturing. This study addressed the gap between maturity models and project management by designing an effective assessment framework for smart transformation. It adopts the Smart Industry Readiness Index, created by the Singapore Economic Development Board, as a maturity assessment model to analyze enterprises' smart transformation and formulate project management strategies. Enterprises can use this model to examine the maturity level of their transformation and assess scope for improvement in their project strategies and implementation barriers. This study focuses on Taiwanese enterprises using data collected from 165 valid questionnaires and subjected to a cluster analysis. Enterprises were divided into three categories. The results reveal that, first, most enterprises' smart transformation is at an immature or medium-maturity level, and is therefore amenable to further improvement. Second, inconsistent with research findings, many enterprises invest in transformation projects but fail to advance these projects to maturity. Third, most enterprises' project management plans fail to meet actual transformation needs. Using the thematically oriented maturity model proposed in this study, Taiwanese enterprises can effectively evaluate the maturity of their transformation projects. In conclusion, the study highlights that Taiwanese enterprises must identify more effective external resources to strengthen their competitiveness.",

            "text": "Since Industry 4.0, the development trend for emerging industries and disruptive technology has extended to industrial reforms through potential markets. Automation and smart manufacturing are key contributing factors in the improvement of market competitiveness. While traditional manufacturing mainly aims to develop large-scale production capacity, smart manufacturing focuses on the development of production technologies for advanced application fields. There is a growing demand for cross-domain integration and technical service customization as per consumer requirements. The strategies for smart manufacturing significantly differ from those applied in traditional manufacturing. Automation and smart application effectively reduce labor demand and considerably enhance production efficiency [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Such changes in the ecological system have led to gradual yet notable changes in the manufacturing industry. Manufacturing enterprises engage in smart transformation to increase their competitiveness and to optimize all practical applications, including operations, production, customer service, and delivery [6, 7] . Smart transformation introduces new ways for enterprises to present their products in the market. Smart transformation has become the key to measure the enterprise capability and competitiveness. It involves organization design [8] , dynamic capability identification [9] , business model establishment [10, 11] , discovery of new strategies [12] , and seizing market opportunities by introducing new digital technologies. It is also defined as \"all aspects of business and society that fundamentally affect business and society by applying digital technology\" [13] . Instead of focusing on a single product, service, or technology, it is committed to cross data and cross domain transformation. In fact, with the development of digital technology, the components of perception, thinking, connection and action ability have become the key to smart transformation. However, enterprises planning for transformation, particularly project managers in charge of technology, budgets, or development, are faced with various uncertainties [14] . While enterprises have been pursing transformation for several decades, many have failed to transform successfully, and some have even claimed bankruptcy. Established organizations such as Nokia Corporation, The Eastman Kodak Company, General Electric Company, and Koninklijke Philips N.V. seem to be diminishing in their influence. Similar trends have been reported for Tsann Kuen and Datong enterprises in Taiwan, which were once the leading information technology firms.",

Their results reveal that smart transformation readiness is considerably low among the sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry, with semiconductor companies accounting for the highest proportion. Most smart transformation leaders have exceeded consumer requirements, and thus, they face higher pressure from their competitors than from their customers. In addition to such pressure, the industry is confronted by not only the costs of replacing old machines with smart ones but also the uncertainty of smart transformation. The transformation of business scope and operations into smart manufacturing is key in complex project planning, budget considerations, and resource management [7] . These conditions make it increasingly difficult for Taiwan's manufacturing industry, which is predominantly composed of small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to keep pace with smart transformation. Smart manufacturing is challenging because numerous advanced technology projects must be completed in the production environment. At this transformation stage, the roles of project management involve more dynamic production environments and components, including products, people, and machines. Existing research on maturity assessment models for smart transformation projects and management is insufficient for effecting smart transformation. Because the optimization of manufacturing capabilities is integral to adapting to a fast-changing manufacturing environment, enterprises should seek an effective maturity model for implementing smart manufacturing transformation. Thus, this study uses a maturity assessment model to analyze Taiwanese enterprises in terms of resource availability. In addition, it modifies the Smart Industry Readiness Index created by Singapore's Economic Development Board by adding the dimension of project management to form a new thematically oriented maturity model. This study is guided by the following research questions:",

After accumulating certain project resources and experience, enterprises begin to transform hand in hand. The transformation process can be divided into short-term inventory management, medium-term technology incubation, 5-10 year prediction according to the time, and it can be divided into different blueprints according to the enterprise blueprint. Prahalad and Oosterveld [32] put forward five factors that influence transformation. Firstly, enterprise must focus on new opportunities, not just reducing costs, improving profitability, or redesigning products. Secondly, the top managers of the enterprise must lead the transformation project. Thirdly, the transformation project must have a clear vision. Fourthly, transformation projects must aim at developing new organizational capacities and skills to maintain competitiveness. Finally, the transformation project should be incorporated into the new management strategy and process to achieve changes in performance, remuneration, occupation, and product development. Therefore, the realization of smart transformation requires not only the development of new value in the market, but also the improvement of enterprise profits. To achieve this goal, enterprises must have innovative capabilities, create new business models, implement transformation projects, and finally realize smart manufacturing.",

An evaluation system helps transform an abstract concept into practical application tools. The maturity model will enable enterprises to determine their capabilities and systematically realize their vision of smart manufacturing. Santos and Martinho [50] report that maturity model is a tool to measure the maturity level of enterprises to achieve their ultimate goals. It can also be used to evaluate the initial development stage of the enterprise and to develop the future development strategy [51] . The paper thinks that project managers should adopt maturity model to evaluate the different levels of project management, equipment efficiency, process improvement and organization management, so as to overcome their weaknesses and promote the transformation of smart manufacturing. Schumacher et al. [52] pointed out that maturity model is the appropriate tool to assess the level of resources of an organization and helps organizations take appropriate action. Backlund et al. [53] asserted that maturity models are essential in the evaluation of organizational standards. Maturity model can evaluate the capability of enterprises and establish the path to implement smart manufacturing strategy [35] . Zvetko et al.

The above research shows that various maturity models or assessments (see Table 1 ) have certain validity on the maturity level of smart manufacturing [6, 7, 52, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] .",

PwC [6] provides an online tool to assess the level of maturity of the enterprise to determine the next step of improvement actions. Most studies describe the degree of readiness to build maturity models or evaluation methods to assess the degree of readiness for enterprise transformation. From Table 1 , the majority of the literature describes how to construct an assessment method to measure the smart readiness of manufacturing enterprises. Manufacturing enterprises perform the steps to review their level of smart readiness and explore their opportunities for smart transformation. However, the existing models are designed for applications in large enterprises and take SMEs only partially into consideration when examining organisational dimensions. These models do not explain or design a suitable strategy path for project guidance or transformation project in the smart transformation procedure after assessing maturity.

The advantages of the maturity assessment model are that it evaluates various dimensions and is easy to be used for the actual assessment of government sponsored Multinational Corporation (MNC) and Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) [20] . Another characteristic of this maturity evaluation model is that it is suitable for the evaluation of Taiwan enterprises, promotes continuous improvement and has a wide range of industrial applications [20] . But Lin et al. [20] also suggests tools to identify next steps in the transformation project to enhance the ability of enterprises to guide them to achieve smart manufacturing transformation. This paper proposes a new topic-oriented maturity assessment model based on the framework of Singapore maturity model, which combines the functional areas of project management and transformation projects, including requirements and implementation, resource allocation and required capabilities. We divided our model into four core areas, of which three originate from the Singapore maturity model: (1) equipment intelligence; (2) process intelligence; (3) organizational intelligence; and (4) transformation project, the new element in our model. Therefore, we separated core content and related applications into four functional blocks (Fig 2) . Fig 2 illustrates the proposed model, including four internal loops: transformation project, equipment intelligence, process intelligence, and organizational intelligence. The architecture of the new model consists of four functional blocks and 11 key pillars that measure the different levels of application of the enterprise for practical evaluation. The new assessment model focuses on each stage of technology development and the required capabilities and helps to identify follow-up actions to improve enterprise value. In addition, similar to Singapore maturity model, the new model is validated by applying it to enterprises with different business models, including SMEs and transnational corporations [62] . Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to propose a project-based maturity assessment model to evaluate the maturity level of Taiwan enterprises and verify its application in practical application.",

Data were collected from 165 Taiwan-based enterprises, and the respondents were asked to rate questionnaire items on a five-point Likert scale. This questionnaire is anonymous. If you agree to complete this questionnaire, you acknowledge that you have understood the relevant details of this research and consent to participating. Respondent contact information (including email addresses) is collected in accordance with Taiwan's Personal Information Law. These enterprises were classified into the technology industry category based on their technological intensity, according to the statistical classification of economic activities in the European community, (NACE Rev 2) [29] . They were categorized into high-technology, mediumhigh-technology, medium-low-technology, and low-technology industries ( Table 2 ). In addition, traditional manufacturing enterprises with fewer technological features and who were in the process of introducing advanced solutions were surveyed. At the time of the survey, a majority of the enterprises' smart manufacturing projects were either in the planning or implementation stage. These surveyed enterprises included SMEs, MNCs, and group-based units, with some having their own production lines or related manufacturing facilities in Taiwan and overseas. All constructs demonstrated appropriate reliability and validity. According to the model classification, five definitions of maturity level and status were proposed ( Table 3 ). The maturity model enables enterprises to re-evaluate or assess their transformation status and capabilities for further enhancement. The proposed model helps determine five levels of maturity (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) in the project, equipment, process, and organization aspects: level 1 (initiated) has a score range of 1-26, level 2 (performed) has a score range of 27-53, level 3 (managed) has a score range of 54-80, level 4 (optimized) has a score range of 81-107, and level 5 (implemented) has a score range of 108-130. This study administered 26 questionnaires for the survey; hence, the highest accumulated maturity score was 130 (26 \u00d7 5) ( Table 3) . Furthermore, levels 1 and 2 were defined as immature levels, levels 3 and 4 as mid-mature levels, and level 5 as a completely mature level. The scores were aggregated to obtain the overall value of the maturity level.",

In total, 45% of respondents were from large-scale enterprises and 55% were from SMEs. Of the respondents, 69% were senior executives (including CEOs, GMs, and VPs); 17% were in the IT, engineering, or operation positions; and others (14%) were in project-related positions. The respondents' work experience certainly contributed to the quality of this study. On average, they had work experience of over 13 years in engineering, project management, production management, and senior executive operations in the surveyed companies. Of the total number of firms surveyed, 40 were immature (0 at level 1 and 43 at level 2), 113 were mid-mature (82 at level 3 and 31 at level 4), and 12 were mature (level 5; Fig 3) . This finding indicates that Taiwanese enterprises intensively invested in smart manufacturing transformation, and the number of mid-level mature and mature enterprises increased; moreover, enterprises invested in transformation plans or executed the plan from 2018 to 2021. Our study results revealed that most Taiwan-based enterprises were in the transformation plan planning and execution stages in 2021, whereas Lin et al. [20] indicated that most Taiwanbased enterprises were still in the beginning or planning stages in 2018. Thus, Taiwan's manufacturing industry has undergone major changes in the past 3 years, especially in terms of investment in smart manufacturing transformation projects. The structure of the manufacturing industry has obviously changed, which has promoted the upgrade of the entire industrial supply chain system to a new ecosystem of smart manufacturing. Table 4 presents the contributions of the project, equipment, process, and organization aspects to smart transformation. The descriptive statistics indicate that the dispersion of the process dimension was higher than that of the other dimensions among the groups, with a higher concentration. Table 5 illustrates K-means cluster analysis results for the classification of the 165 surveyed enterprises into three groups.",

Adopting a maturity model can guide project managers in the process of transformation. Manufacturing enterprises must develop transformation plans with support from top management at the project execution level. The vision of a company's top management also has a positive effect on project purpose and success and is considered the vision of the project leadership team [73] .

Enterprises are increasingly adopting project management as a tool for enhancing productivity [74] and focusing on project benefit realization [75] . Project management plays a critical role in the transformation project plan, and thus influences the successful delivery of projects. Project managers must measure each step involved in the project and self-assess internal potential risks in project management, equipment, organization, and process aspects for successful project delivery. Project managers must evaluate the project status and assess maturity levels, verify the transformation processes, and evaluate current resources and capabilities to detect possible insufficiencies or problems in the processing of the transformation project. In the management of manufacturing transformation projects, potential problems such as design changes should be identified as early as possible at the design stage to reduce manpower reallocation and schedule control in the manufacturing stage. These factors affect the project success rate. In our survey, most enterprises agreed that project management was one of the critical processes for project managers to secure resources and budgets with the support of top management. Therefore, we incorporated project management into our project-based maturity model to enable the assessment of potential crises and opportunities for enterprises (Fig 1) .",

The grouping was performed on the basis of industry feature and application as follows: group 1: system integration, design-oriented SMEs, and mechanical equipment; group 2: traditional manufacturer (including parts, component, accessory, plastic, and metal processing); group 3: EMS, information service providers and automation. Our analysis revealed that 59% of the enterprises considered adopting external system solutions to assist in the implementation of transformation projects and 55% reported that their current transformation project does not meet their requirements because the project process was too complex and implementation steps were not clearly illustrated. Enterprises may seek guidance from external consultants to obtain development technologies, increase visibility, and take advantage of the trend to obtain resources to further invest in industrial transformation and use the opportunity for smart transformation to retain core technologies, thereby overcoming the challenges arising out of a shortage of human resources. Moreover, the surveyed enterprises reported that technical expertise and budget are critical factors influencing the execution of transformation projects. Hence, enterprises should use external project transformation plans to meet their current project requirements and consider important influencing factors of expertise and budget in their next step toward smart transformation.",

Our study developed a project-based maturity model providing an evaluation and assessment framework that enables organizations to identity their best practices and those of their rivals to design an optimal path to implementation. We validated the project-based maturity model as being suitable for measuring maturity levels in real environments for Taiwanbased enterprises. This model allows enterprises to identify factors influencing project management implementation and helps make priority improvements within the enterprise. For manufacturing enterprises, smart transformation is not as simple as the digitization of manufacturing process. When cost is no longer the only competitive advantage, creating a \"transformation value\" becomes crucial. Enterprises should use technological tools or external resources to achieve smart transformation. For this purpose, enterprises can adopt the proposed maturity model (Fig 1) to analyze their maturity levels and then identify key areas that must be strengthened to achieve a competitive edge. Therefore, it is essential to build the foundation for the operations and expertise of enterprises and then extend the service process to further innovate the products and business models.",

The implementation of smart manufacturing is challenging for enterprises because it requires a continuous strategic commitment to attain an appropriate level of maturity and improvement of organizational capabilities in terms of project management execution, technical equipment introduction, and process optimization. This commitment yields important benefits and value creation for enterprises, especially in terms of production efficiency, increased quality, and short lead time to market. Moreover, smart manufacturing is expected to stimulate sales growth, enlarge market opportunities, and increase profitability of enterprises. The purpose of this study was to examine challenges in the smart transformation of enterprises. First, enterprises should choose a suitable maturity model as an assessment tool for self-evaluation, which can help them transform their capabilities to face the competitive environment. Enterprises must prioritize the introduction of smart transformation plans into their operational needs and then implement them step by step to achieve smart transformation goals. After the assessment, enterprises will be better equipped to handle the changing competition in the business environment and employ practical strategies involving digital technologies.",

In addition, this study contributes to the literature in the context of smart manufacturing by proposing a project-based maturity assessment model that incorporates project management to assist enterprises in assessing their levels of transformation projects and developing strategies toward achieving smart manufacturing. The proposed assessment model comprises four blocks and 11 pillars of items identified from the extant literature and through our online survey. The proposed maturity assessment model is useful for project managers in the practical analysis of the project stages. It enables project managers to monitor the progress of the project at each stage of its implementation process and identify any requirement for resource allocation and capability improvement. This study evaluated the reliability and validity of the proposed model in enterprise transformation. Through assessment using this maturity model, enterprises can transform their processes by diagnosing potential issues and accordingly defining strategies toward achieving smart manufacturing.",

Enterprises can identify existing operational challenges and capacity gaps and then establish future manufacturing strategies using the proposed maturity model as a digital tool to overcome these bottlenecks and hidden barriers [76] . This will enable them to accelerate smart transformation in the project, equipment, process, and organization aspects.
