One feature of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that is not present in related, common coronaviruses is ORF10, a putative 38-amino acid protein-coding gene. Proteomic studies found that ORF10 binds to an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing Cullin-2, Rbx1, Elongin B, Elongin C, and ZYG11B (CRL2 ZYG11B ). Since CRL2 ZYG11B mediates protein degradation, one possible role for ORF10 is to \"hijack\" CRL2 ZYG11B in order to target cellular, antiviral proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Here, we investigated whether ORF10 hijacks CRL2 ZYG11B or functions in other ways, for example, as an inhibitor or substrate of CRL2 ZYG11B . While we confirm the ORF10\u2212ZYG11B interaction and show that the N terminus of ORF10 is critical for it, we find no evidence that ORF10 is functioning to inhibit or hijack CRL2 ZYG11B . Furthermore, ZYG11B and its paralog ZER1 are dispensable for SARS-CoV-2 infection in cultured cells. We conclude that the interaction between ORF10 and CRL2 ZYG11B is not relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.",

In an effort to understand the molecular basis for the virulence and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, proteomic experiments have been performed on viral SARS-CoV-2 proteins in order to identify host processes that are regulated or usurped by SARS-CoV-2 (2) (3) (4) . These studies have identified novel viral\u2212host interactions. Some of these host factors can be modulated by existing drugs, and these drugs have been suggested as possible therapeutics in the treatment of COVID-19 (2) .",

One unique feature of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is ORF10, a small putative protein that was hypothesized to promote infection by hijacking a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase, CRL2 ZYG11B . Here, we investigate whether ORF10 hijacks CRL2 ZYG11B or functions in other ways, such as to inhibit CRL2 ZYG11B or be degraded by it. We do not find evidence that ORF10 regulates or is regulated by CRL2 ZYG11B , and, furthermore, we find that ZYG11B and its paralog are dispensable for SARS-CoV-2 infection in cultured cells.

A hijacking scenario would allow ORF10 to impact viral replication by recruiting host antiviral protein(s) to the CRL2 ZYG11B complex for ubiquitylation and eventual degradation. Ubiquitin ligase hijackers need not be large, since they typically do not encode any enzymatic activity themselves, but instead tether proteins to host E3 ubiquitin ligases. The potential role of the CRL2 ZYG11B \u2212ORF10 complex during infection has led one group to propose Pevonedistat (MLN4924), an inhibitor of CRL activity, as a possible therapeutic for treating COVID-19 (2) . Viral hijacking of host ubiquitin ligases has been described in numerous viral infections. For instance, the RNA virus HIV-1 encodes VPU, VPR, and VIF which each hijack different Cullin\u2212RING\u2212ligase complexes in order to degrade host antiviral proteins and thereby promote infection (6, 7) . Additionally, the hepatitis B protein HBX hijacks a Cullin-4-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (8) , while adenovirus E4(orf6) hijacks a Cullin-2 complex (9) .",

In these experiments, we were unable to directly detect ORF10, likely owing to its small size and few tryptic peptides, but we were able to detect the affinity tag that it was fused to, suggesting that it was expressed and purified (Fig. 1A) . We performed two experiments with different vector backbones and protein elution strategies. The first experiment used a pLVX backbone, and proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample loading buffer ( Fig. 1B and Dataset S1), while the second experiment used a plasmid cloning DNA 3 (pcDNA3) vector, and proteins were eluted using biotin ( Fig. 1C and Dataset S2). Each experiment included three technical replicates with ORF10 and three with the empty vector control expressing the tag only.

An inhibitor of CRL2 ZYG11B could help promote SARS-CoV-2 infection if CRL2 ZYG11B functions to antagonize the virus. To investigate this hypothesis, we used the Global Protein Stability (GPS) system ( Fig. 3A) (14, 15) with reporters for CRL2 ZYG11B and CRL2 ZER1 activity. In this system, a lentivirally integrated transgene expresses a peptide fused to EGFP and also contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that drives DsRed expression. DsRed is an important component of GPS, since it controls for most perturbations that would affect transcription or translation generally. The amount of peptide\u2212EGFP fusion that is expressed, relative to the DsRed control, is a reliable metric for the stability of the EGFP fusion. Since CRL2 ZYG11B recognizes N-terminal degrons, we used GPS constructs that were used previously and that allow us to precisely control the N terminus. These constructs contain a ubiquitin moiety fused to the N terminus of the peptide which is rapidly cleaved following translation to reveal the native N terminus of the peptide.",

            "text": "There are four pieces of evidence from the recent literature that suggest that the ORF10 protein may have little functional impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, transcriptome analysis of infected cells found limited or no evidence for a distinct subgenomic messenger RNA (mRNA) containing a 5\u2032 ORF10, in contrast to the other accessory genes which possess their own mRNA (4, 19) . Second, while efforts to identify the abundance of ORF10 using mass spectrometry may miss ORF10 because it is small and contains few tryptic peptides (4), ribosome footprinting studies can also report on whether an RNA is translated (20) . A recent ribosome footprinting study found that there was a small peak at the start codon of ORF10 in the presence of harringtonine or lactimidomycin, drugs that stall the ribosome. However, the overall ribosome occupancy of ORF10 was lower than for every other canonical accessory gene and was similar in occupancy to the 3\u2032 untranslated region (21) . These results suggest that ORF10 is translated less than the other accessory genes. Since we found that ORF10 is not well expressed in many contexts (Fig. 4) , these data suggest that the ORF10 protein may only be fleetingly present during infection, if expressed at all. Third, a strain of SARS-CoV-2 in which ORF10 contains a premature stop codon at residue 29 was isolated, and it can still replicate in vivo and in vitro (22) . While most of ORF10, including the N terminus used to bind ZYG11B, is still retained in this strain, this nonetheless implies that the full open reading frame is not required for infection. Fourth, while ORF10 is conserved in SARS-CoV-2, the protein coding sequence is not conserved in diverse Sarbecovirus genomes, suggesting that the RNA sequence may play a regulatory role rather than a coding function (23) . These results in the literature, together with our findings, should collectively be interpreted in assessing the functional importance of ORF10. ",

Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min; the supernatant was used for purification with Streptavidinconjugated magnetic beads (IBA #2-4090-002). Elution of the purified proteins was carried out with elution buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Biotin) and incubated with constant rotation at room temperature for 15 min. Sample preparation. Affinity-purified pLVX samples were separated on SDS/ PAGE gels, and pcDNA3 samples were prepped using S-Trap microcolumns (Protifi) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were reduced, alkylated, digested with trypsin, and desalted as previously described (26, 27) . An aliquot of each sample was loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap trap column (75 \u03bcm in diameter [ID] \u00d7 2 cm, 3-\u03bcm bead size, 100-\u00c5 pore size) in line with an EASY-Spray PepMap analytical column (75 \u03bcm ID \u00d7 50 cm C18, 2\u03bcm bead size, 100-\u00c5 pore size) using the autosampler of an EASY-nLC 1000 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Thermo Fisher) and solvent A (2% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid). The peptides were eluted into the Orbitrap QExactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or the Orbitrap Eclipse Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the following gradient: 5 to 35% solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid) over 60 min, followed by an increase from 35 to 45% solvent B over 10 min, followed by an increase of 45 to 100% solvent B in 10 min. Mass spectrometry settings. The pLVX samples were acquired on the Orbitrap Eclipse using the following parameters: full mass spectrometry (MS) spectra resolution of 240,000 (at m/z 200), an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 1e6, maximum ion time of 50 ms, and scan range from 400 m/z to 1,500 m/z. Following each full MS scan, low-resolution MS/MS spectra were acquired for a 1-s duty cycle. The MS/MS spectra were collected in the ion trap in rapid scan mode, with an AGC target of 2e4, maximum ion time of 18 ms, one microscan, 2-m/z isolation window, normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27, and a dynamic exclusion of 30 s. The pcDNA3 samples were acquired on the Orbitrap QExactive using the following parameters: full MS spectra resolution of 70,000 (at m/z 400), AGC target of 1e6, with a maximum ion time of 120 ms, and scan range from 400 m/z to 1,500 m/z. Following each full MS scan, 20 data-dependent MS/MS spectra were acquired using a resolution of 17,500, an AGC target of 5e4, maximum ion time of 120 ms, one microscan, 2-m/z isolation window, fixed first mass of 150 m/z, dynamic exclusion of 30 s, and NCE of 27. Data analysis. All acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against a UniProt human database using Sequest within Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific). The search parameters were as follows: precursor mass tolerance \u00b1 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance \u00b10.4 Da for ion trap MS/MS and \u00b10.02 Da for Orbitrap MS/MS, digestion parameters allowing trypsin 2 missed cleavages, fixed modification of carbamidomethyl on cysteine, variable modification of oxidation on methionine, and variable modification of deamidation on glutamine and asparagine. Peptides were filtered to better than 1% FDR using a target\u2212decoy database strategy, and proteins require at least two unique peptides to be reported. To identify potential binding partners of ORF10, the data were further analyzed using the SAINT algorithm (11) . Here, 13 control affinity purifications from previous HEK-293T experiments acquired in-house were included as negative controls for comparison.",

Frozen 293T cell pellets (biological triplicate) from 10-cm plates were lysed in 8M Urea pH 8.5 in 200 mM 3-[4-(2-Hydroxyethyl) piperazin-1-yl]propane-1-sulfonic acid (EPPS), supplemented with a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Following vortexing to disrupt the pellet, samples were incubated on ice for 20 min to achieve lysis, then incubated with benzonase for 15 min at room temperature to disrupt chromatin. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 21,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min, and supernatant was transferred to a new tube for determination of protein concentration via a bicinchoninic acid assay (ThermoFisher Scientific). Proteins were reduced with 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for 15 min at room temperature, followed by alkylation with 15 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature (protected from light). Samples were quenched with 5 mM DTT for 15 min protected from light. Then 100 \u03bcg of each sample was subjected to methanol chloroform precipitation, and protein pellets were dried at room temperature, then digested with LysC protease (100:1 protein: protease ratio) in 200 mM EPPS at 37\u00b0C overnight. Trypsin protease was added at a 100:1 protein:protease ratio, and digestion continued for 6 h at 37\u00b0C. TMT labeling. Following trypsin digest, samples were cooled to room temperature, and anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN) was added to each sample to a final concentration of 30% (vol/vol). Isobaric labeling of peptides was performed using TMT nine-plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TMT reagents (5 mg) were dissolved in 256 \u03bcL of anhydrous ACN, and 10 \u03bcL of each TMT reagent was added to 50 \u03bcg of digested peptides (half of digest volume). Following incubation at room temperature for 1 h, samples were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. Samples were thawed the following day and pooled across all nine TMT-labeled channels. The pooled sample was vacuum centrifuged to near dryness and subjected to a C18 solid-phase extraction column with a capacity of 100 mg (Sep-Pak, Waters). Off-line basic pH reversed-phase fractionation. The desalted peptide sample was fractionated using basic pH reversed-phase HPLC (28) and an Agilent 1200 pump equipped with a degasser and an ultraviolet detector (set at 220-and 280-nm wavelength). Peptides were subjected to a 50-min linear gradient from 5 to 35% acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min over an Agilent ZORBAX 300Extend C18 column (3.5-\u03bcm particles, 4.6 mm ID and 250 mm in length). The peptide mixture was fractionated into a total of 96 fractions, which were consolidated into 24 fractions. Final samples were prepared for every other fraction (12 samples in total). Fractions were acidified with 5% formic acid and vacuum centrifuged to near dryness, followed by desalting via StageTip. Dried samples were reconstituted in 5% acetonitrile/5% formic acid for LC-MS/MS analysis. Data acquisition. Mass spectrometric data were collected on an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer coupled to a Proxeon NanoLC-1200 ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). The 100-\u03bcm capillary column was packed with 35 cm of Accucore 150 resin (2.6 \u03bcm, 150 A; ThermoFisher Scientific). The scan sequence began with an MS1 spectrum (Orbitrap analysis, resolution 120,000, 350 to 1,400 Th, AGC target 5 \u00d7 10 5 , maximum injection time 100 ms). Data were acquired \u223c120 min per fraction. MS2 analysis consisted of collision-induced dissociation, quadrupole ion trap analysis, AGC 2 \u00d7 10 4 , NCE 35, q value 0.25, maximum injection time 120 ms), isolation window at 0.5 Th, and TopSpeed set at 3 s. For field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry, the dispersion voltage was set at 5,000 V; the compensation voltages used were \u221240, \u221260, and \u221280 V; and the TopSpeed parameter was set at 1 s. Data processing. A compendium of in-house software was used to convert files to mzXML format, as well as to correct monoisotopic m/z measurements and erroneous charge state assignments. Assignment of MS/MS spectra was performed using the Comet algorithm (v.2018.01 rev.2). Database searching included all entries from the human UniProt Database (August 2019), supplemented with all SARS-CoV-2 protein entries. Searches were performed using a 50-ppm precursor ion tolerance, and the product ion tolerance was set to 0.9 Da. Trypsin protease specificity was required, allowing up to two missed cleavages. TMT tags on peptide N termini/lysine residues (+229.1629 Da) and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.0215 Da) were set as static modifications, while methionine oxidation (+15.9949 Da) was set as a variable modification. Peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) were adjusted to a 1% FDR (29, 30) . PSM filtering was performed as previously described (30) using an in-house linear discrimination analysis algorithm considering the following parameters: XCorr, peptide ion mass accuracy, charge state, peptide length, and missed cleavages. For TMT-based reporter ion quantitation, the signal-to-noise ratio (S:N) for each TMT channel was extracted, and the closest matching centroid to the expected mass of the TMT reporter ion was identified. PSMs were identified, quantified, collapsed to a peptide FDR of 1%, and then collapsed further to a final protein-level FDR of 1%. Protein assembly was guided by principles of parsimony to produce the smallest set of proteins necessary to account for all of the observed peptides, using an inhouse protein assembly algorithm. Peptide intensities were quantified by summing reporter ion counts across all matching PSMs using in-house software, as described previously (31, 32) . A 0.003 Th window around the theoretical m/z of each reporter ion was scanned, and the maximum intensity nearest to the theoretical m/z was used. PSMs with MS3 spectra with TMT reporter summed S:N of <100 were excluded from quantitation, and isolation specificity of >0.7 was required (31, 33) . Protein quantitation values were exported, and student's t tests were performed in R (v4.0.2). FDR scores were calculated using the p.adjust function, and plots were generated in R as well. Coronavirus Infection in KO Cell Lines. Cells were plated onto 96-well plates coated with ECL Cell Attachment matrix (Millipore Sigma) diluted to 20 \u03bcg/mL in serum-free DMEM to enhance cell attachment. Cells were infected at an MOI of 0.4 and incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C, then fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Samples were assessed for infection efficiency via immunofluorescence. Samples were imaged on a Cytation 1 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek) and were evaluated using CellProfiler (34) . Infection efficiencies were calculated from the percentage of viral nucleoprotein positive cells in each sample.",
