ABO(H) expression on platelets and plasma VWF was studied in a series of 541 healthy blood donors. Overall, 5.6% of our study cohort were classified as HXP, whilst 4.4% satisfied criteria for LXP. We demonstrate that genotype at the ABO blood group locus plays a critical role in modulating the platelet HXP phenotype. In particular, A 1 A 1 genotype is a major determinant of ABO high-expresser trait. Our data further show that ABH loading on VWF is also affected by ABO expresser phenotype. Consequently, A antigen expression on VWF was significantly elevated in HXP individuals and moderately reduced in LXP subjects (P < 0.05). Collectively, these findings suggest that ABO expresser phenotype influences primary hemostasis though several different pathways. Further studies will be required to define whether inter-individual variations in ABO(H) expression on platelets and/or VWF (particularly HXP and LXP) impact upon risk for cardiovascular disease.",

            "text": "The ABO blood group system was first recognized by Landsteiner in 1900. Subsequent studies have shown that the ABO gene locus is located on chromosome 9 and elucidated the genetic basis underlying different ABO groups 1 . In blood group A, B or AB individuals, alleles at the ABO locus encode glycosyltransferase enzymes which catalyze addition of either N-acetylgalactosamine (blood group A) or galactose (blood group B) as capping sugar moieties onto preformed glycan structures 1, 2 . In blood group O individuals, the ABO locus does not encode a functional transferase enzyme. Consequently, these subjects express unmodified H antigen precursor structures. The presence of ABO(H) blood group antigens on the surface of red blood cells, and their clinical relevance in blood transfusion, is well recognized 3 . Importantly however, ABO(H) antigens are also expressed on other human cells types including endothelial cells (EC) and epithelium 4 . In addition, ABO(H) determinants are expressed on platelets, where they have been identified on a variety of different glycoproteins known to play important roles in hemostasis (including GPIb, GpV, GpIIb/IIIa and PECAM-1) 5 . Recent studies have demonstrated that these ABO(H) glycans on the platelet membrane surface significantly influence normal platelet function [5] [6] [7] .",

            "text": "In addition to their cellular expression, covalently-linked ABO(H) structures have also been described on a number of plasma glycoproteins, including von Willebrand factor (VWF), factor VIII (FVIII) and \u03b1 2macroglobulin 8 . ABO(H) expression on VWF has been characterized in detail 9 . Mass spectrometry (MS) studies have confirmed that ABO(H) determinants are present on both the N-and O-linked glycans of human www.nature.com/scientificreports/ plasma-derived VWF [10] [11] [12] . Interestingly, although H antigen is expressed on platelet-derived VWF, there is no A or B antigen expression 13, 14 . ABO(H) expression on VWF is important because it has been shown to regulate multiple aspects of VWF biology 15, 16 . First, ABO affects plasma levels of the VWF-FVIII complex, with significantly lower levels in blood group O compared to non-O subjects 17 . This difference is likely attributable to enhanced VWF clearance in group O individuals 18, 19 , ABO expression on VWF modulates susceptibility to proteolysis by ADAMTS13, with significantly enhanced cleavage in blood group O subjects 20, 21 . Third, accumulating recent evidence suggests that ABO antigens on VWF also influence its functional ability to interact with platelet GPIb 6, 22 . Given the biological importance of ABO(H) expression in regulating platelet and VWF function, it is interesting that marked inter-individual variability in quantitative ABH antigen expression has been reported in healthy individuals [23] [24] [25] . Furthermore, several studies have described a so called ABO 'High Expresser Phenotype' (HXP), wherein some normal donors express unexpectedly high levels of A or B blood group determinants on their platelets 23, 24, 26 . Although first described in a cohort of Japanese blood donors 26 , HXP has subsequently been identified in other different ethnic groups with a reported population prevalence of approximately 5% 23, 24, 27 . This high expresser trait has been observed in subjects with each of the non-O blood groups (A, B and AB respectively), and has been shown to constitute a stable characteristic over time in affected subjects 23, 24 . Despite the prevalence and potential translational importance of ABO HXP, the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for mediating increased platelet A or B antigen expression in these individuals remains poorly defined. However familial clustering of HXP has been reported, suggesting that inherited factors contribute to its etiology 23 .",

For all blood group A subjects, ABO genotype was also determined. In brief, genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using Gentra-Qiagen Autopure (Alameda, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was then performed to amplify exons 6 and 7 of the ABO gene using oligonucleotide primers as previously described 28 .

Consistent with this concept, platelet A antigen expression was significantly increased in group A 1 compared to A 2 healthy donors and all of the subjects classified as HXP were A 1 ( Fig. 2A) . Interestingly however, the amount of A antigen expressed on platelets varied widely between the different individuals ( Fig. 2A) Fig. 2B ). Furthermore, 7 of the 10 individuals classified as HXP were also found to have genotype A 1 A 1 . Surprisingly, given the limited A transferase activity associated with the A 2 allele, two of the other HXP donors genotyped as A 1 A 2 (Fig. 2B) . The prevalence of HXP amongst A 1 A 1 subjects was significantly increased compared to the total A donor population (28% versus 4.3%; P < 0.05). In contrast, the prevalence of HXP was markedly reduced in heterozygous A 1 O 1 donors (0.7%). All the LXP subjects identified in our cohort had an A 1 O 1 genotype.

Given these data, we investigated whether there was a relationship between ABO blood group and sialic acid expression on platelets. Similar to A antigen expression, significant inter-individual variability in platelet sialylation was observed (Fig. 3A) . However, unlike the bimodal pattern observed for platelet A antigen expression, SNA platelet-binding demonstrated a single positive unimodal distribution (Fig. 3B) . The difference in \u03b12-6 linked sialylation compared to A antigen expression on platelets is interesting, since both are characterized by single terminal sugar moieties on the end of complex glycan chains. Critically however, unlike in erythrocytes, no significant relationship between ABO group and \u03b12-6 linked sialylation on platelets was seen (Fig. 3C) .

Using a previously optimized modified sandwich Elisa 28 , AVWF was measured for each individual in our group A cohort. Although marked inter-individual variability in AWF was observed, a significant effect of ABO genotype was also seen (Fig. 4A) .

            "text": "In addition to influencing platelet function, ABO(H) blood group antigens are also expressed on VWF and FVIII in normal human plasma 35 . Importantly in the context of the association between ABO group and vascular disease, ABH determinants expressed on VWF glycans have been shown to influence VWF functional activity; VWF susceptibility to proteolysis and VWF clearance 35 . Thus, in keeping with their reduced thrombotic risk, plasma levels of the VWF-FVIII complex are significantly lower in blood group O compared to non-O individuals. Our findings demonstrate that similar to platelets, ABH expression on plasma VWF also varies widely between normal subjects. For the first time, we further demonstrate that ABH loading on VWF is also affected by ABO expresser phenotype. Consequently, although the number of subjects was limited, A antigen expression on VWF was significantly elevated in HXP individuals and moderately reduced in LXP subjects. Current evidence suggests that addition of ABO(H) determinants occurs during post-translational modification within EC rather than in the peripheral circulation 15, 40, 41 . Consequently, our findings suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying HXP and LXP are likely shared across a number of different cell types. Despite the significant effect of www.nature.com/scientificreports/ high expresser-trait in regulating ABO expression on plasma VWF, we observed no significant effect on plasma VWF:Ag levels. This may be attributable to the small number of HXP individuals in our cohort. Alternatively, it is possible that the relationship between ABO blood group and plasma VWF clearance rate is not regulated via ABH determinants expressed on VWF glycans. To investigate mechanisms that may contribute to expresser-traits, we performed ABO genotyping for subjects in our cohort. A antigenic loading on both platelets and VWF was significantly increased in homozygous A 1 A 1 compared to heterozygous A 1 O 1 individuals. In addition, minimal A antigen expression was present on platelets or VWF in A 2 subjects. Importantly, 7/10 of the individuals with ABO HXP had an A 1 A 1 genotype. However, the majority of individuals with an A 1 A 1 genotype did not have evidence of abnormally elevated A antigen expression on either platelets or VWF, and were not classified as HXP. Moreover, 3 HXP subjects were shown to have genotypes A 1 A 2 or A 1 O 1 respectively. Collectively, these data highlight that ABO genotype is an important factor in determining HXP. Given the known dosage effect of the ABO gene 28 . we postulate that increased glycosyltransferase expression represents at least in part the likely causal mechanism 23 . This hypothesis is supported by a previous study that reported elevated glycosyltransferase enzymes in the serum of HXP subjects. Nevertheless, since not all A 1 A 1 individuals exhibit elevated platelet A antigen expression, clearly additional and as yet unrecognized mechanisms must also be involved in contributing to ABO HXP pathogenesis.",

Thus, in the same individual at the same time point, some platelets demonstrated strong A antigen expression whilst other platelets had low A antigen. Although these findings are consistent with several previous studies 23, 24 , the underlying mechanism remains unknown. To gain further insight into factors that might modulate ABO(H) loading on platelets and VWF, we measured \u03b12-6 linked sialic acid expression on platelets. Similar to ABO(H) determinants, \u03b12-6 linked sialic acid is expressed as a terminal capping sugar moiety at the end of glycan antennae 42 . Although recent studies reported a relationship between ABO blood group and terminal sialylation on human red cells 32 , we found no evidence that \u03b12-6 linked sialylation influences quantitative ABO(H) expression on either platelets or VWF respectively.",

This concept is important when considering potential biological pathways that may explain emerging GWAS data identifying ABO as a disease-associated locus. Additional studies will be required to define whether HXP and LXP also influence ABH expression in other tissues. In addition, further research will also be necessary to elucidate whether inter-individual variations in ABO(H) expression on platelets and/or VWF (particularly HXP and LXP) impact upon risk for cardiovascular disease (e.g. bleeding, thrombosis, TTP) 8, 43 , or indeed susceptibility to specific types of sepsis. www.nature.com/scientificreports/",

Previous studies have demonstrated that amongst A 1 donors, ABO genotype exerts a dosage effect, such that A transferase levels are significantly higher in A 1 A 1 compared to A 1 O 1 individuals 28 . Consequently, we further investigated the relationship between ABO genotype and expresser phenotype. Using PCR-RFLP analysis, ABO gentoype was defined for each of our 231 group A donors. Overall 25 individuals were homozygous A 1 A 1 , 12 subjects were A 1 A 2 , and 143 donors were A 1 O 1 . Consistent with the red cell phenotyping data, ABO genotyping confirmed that 50 donors were A 2 O 1 and 1 subject was A 2 A 2 . In keeping with the concept that there is a dosage effect of the ABO locus on enzymatic activity, platelet A antigen expression was significantly higher in homozy-",
