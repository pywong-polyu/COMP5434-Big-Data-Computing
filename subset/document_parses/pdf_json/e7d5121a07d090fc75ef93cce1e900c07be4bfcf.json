            "text": "Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused huge disruptions worldwide affecting most people including university students. The impact of the pandemic lockdown on pharmacy students' stress levels and quality of life (QoL) is not well studied. This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on perceived stress levels and QoL among final-year undergraduate pharmacy students at Ajman University, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods: A cross-sectional electronic survey was conducted among final-year Bachelor of Pharmacy students at Ajman University during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The perceived stress scale and World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) were administered through Google Forms. The filled responses were exported to IBM SPSS statistics, Version 26, scored as per the standard scoring procedures, and analyzed to answer the study objectives. Since the data were not distributed normally (p=0.000, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test) were performed to compare the median (IQR) scores with demographic parameters at an alpha value of 0.05. Results: Of the eligible 94 students, 81 (male=16, 19.8%, female = 65, 80.2%) responded. The perceived stress level due to COVID-19 among the participants of a score of 24 suggests that the students suffered a \"moderate\" level of stress with no statistical significance between genders regardless of the place of residence in the seven Emirates (p=0.371) of the UAE. During the previous month of conducting the survey, 40.7% (n=33) of the respondents \"very often\" felt nervous and 22% (n=18) \"fairly often\" felt nervous with a median (IQR) score 3 (2-4); 3 denotes 'sometimes'. Of the respondents, 6.2% (n=14) \"very often\" and 21% (n=17) \"fairly often\" felt that things were going their own way. Regarding the QoL statements, a median (IQR) score of 3 (3-4) was obtained for the question on \"How much do you enjoy life?\", and the median scores were \"4 (very much)\" for more than half of the statements overall denoting a better QoL. The study reported females to have more physical pain, which may prevent them from carrying out their daily activities, than males (p=0.001) reflecting a better QoL among males over females during the lockdown. It also reflects a higher need for medications among females compared to males (p=0.014). All participants showed negative feelings, which is more apparent among male participants (4, 3-4.5) when compared to female participants (3, 2-3) (P = 0.001). Conclusion: The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on perceived stress and self-reported QoL is minimum. Age, gender and other demographic factors had little or no effect on stress levels, but gender influenced \"experience of physical pain\" and \"requirement for medications\", with more likelihood in females. Student friendly educational approaches and proper implementation of educational reforms can help minimizing student stress and improving QoL during vulnerable times like lockdowns.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID- 19) , pandemic has affected everyone with no exception to university students. As of 21st of November 2021, there were 257,502,647 reported COVID-19 cases and 5,165,730 deaths. 1 The COVID-19 outbreak was considered stressful among people, worldwide, which led to fear and anxiety. 2, 3 Healthcare members, in particular the frontline workers dealing with the pandemic, felt even more stress due to fear of catching the disease from patients, overwhelming number of admitted patients, shortage of personal protective equipment, etc. 4 Many countries worldwide responded to this crisis quickly and implemented extreme measures such as complete lockdown and allocating more resources to handle the pandemic. Lockdowns caused more disruptions to the world, which was already reeling from the pandemic. Universities, in particular, face multiple challenges as they provide not just teaching, but often additional sanctuary to students. 5 The first and foremost concern for higher education authorities during the crisis was to focus on the welfare and safety of the faculty, staff, and students. 6 In the process, academic institutions had to shut down campuses and shift from traditional teaching/ learning process to newly acquainted virtual/online modes. Universities adopted different types of digital virtual tools for their staff and students to perform their activities and assessments. 7, 8 Although these measures and efforts have yielded positive outcomes, isolating people at their home for a long time and closure of schools and universities might have had negative effects on students' physical and mental health. 9 Students are more vulnerable as they have lost access to their friends, their campus communities, and the structure and rhythm of the academic year. Many students might experience additional worries, including how to help their families financially and how to completely transition to online education, sometimes in regions with poor internet access. In addition to being worried about the disease and their families and loved ones being at risk, it is worth mentioning the stress of paying tuition fees due to parents' job loss, business shutdowns, etc. 10 Student plans changed drastically during the lockdown and cutoff of their peers and mentors. These factors collectively are expected to impact their QoL. Subsequently, recording the full impact of the pandemic on education is fundamental as it provides useful insights on existing problems and offers recommendations. 11 Like other universities, as the COVID-19 situation continued to change rapidly, Ajman University (AU) moved the teaching and assessment processes to online considering students and staff's health as its first priority and to limit the spread of COVID-19. Prior to the implementation of the lockdown period, the final-year undergraduate pharmacy students were undergoing experiential learning at hospitals and community pharmacies as part of the Spring-2020 academic semester. As the pandemic worsened, lockdown was implemented in the country, and students were forced to halt training and undergo virtual training sessions. The final-year students are considered especially vulnerable to stress and more worried due to the fact that they are graduating soon and looking for job options. Furthermore, there were doubts and uncertainties surrounding virtual sessions as they felt online sessions were inferior and not as strong as face-to-face sessions. They were also worried about their possible delay in pharmacist licensing and admission to higher studies, etc. All these negative factors posed by the lockdown collectively could have had a negative impact on the mental health wellbeing of the students. In such a situation, it would be important to study the negative impact of the lockdown on students' stress levels and QoL, which could have been compromised. Hence, the present study was undertaken to assess the perceived stress and QoL among the final-year pharmacy students during COVID-19 lockdown and to correlate their stress levels and QoL with selected demographic variables of the student respondents.",

During the last month, it seems that most students leaned towards very often 33 (40.7%) when they were asked about nervousness and stress level. The median score for the statement was 3 (2) (3) (4) . Regarding feelings of anger, many participants choose fairly often and very often 37 (45.7%). The median of the total score of perceived stress level is 24 (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) with the curve positively skewed towards the higher level. The total score of 24 suggests the students suffered a \"moderate\" level of stress. There was no statistically significant difference between male 23 (20-26.75 ) and female 25 (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) participants when the median of stress perceived level was compared (P value: 0.067).",

The COVID-19 pandemic had further catalyzed the existing stress levels, as an outcome of health, economic and other indirect consequences, and did not spare anyone, including students. 15, 16 Stress, a causative factor for multiple health conditions, is also known to play a significant role in determining the QoL of an individual. 17 This research is the first one to evaluate pharmacy students' perceived stress and QoL during the COVID-19 lockdown. Pharmacy students surveyed under this research were the senior students preparing for the job market in the months to come and were unsure of the course of damages likely to be caused by COVID-19. High perceived stress among students can largely negatively influence their QoL, leading to poor learning experiences, lower examination performances and failure to achieve future goals. Generally, on occasions other the COVID-19 situation, stress in student life is related to examination, examination results, studying for exams, and too many tasks to be completed etc. 18 In the current research, students reported a moderate level of stress at a time when they were not attending regular classes and were taking virtual sessions for both didactics and experiential trainings. The level of students' stress reported in the current research is much lower than that reported among frontline health professionals involved in caring for COVID-19 patients, who had higher risk of mental disorders. 19 This stress suggests a clear demarcation existing between actual practitioners and future practitioners. Though one would expect a high level of stress among these students considering the timing of the research, in reality that was not the case, the reason for that may be because of the support of the university and parents. Although current research reported slightly higher median scores for females, no statistically significant difference existed between genders, suggesting the existing level of stress being uniformly present between student genders. Of the previously reported studies examining pharmacy students stress, two reported females to have high stress levels, 20, 21 whereas the current one and three others found no gender variations. [22] [23] [24] Not having a gender influence can be attributed to the fact that any factors that could potentially lead to stress are beyond gender or have uniformly affected both the genders.",

The university had set up a student counseling center to help students to cope with stress related to COVID-19 and also implemented virtual learning in a student-centered and student-friendly manner. Both could have further contributed to a reduced stress level. Similarly, it can also be viewed that students lived with their parents during lockdown, which could have probably helped in adapting to the lockdown situations. This finding is supported by another study from China that recommended extended family and professional support for health professional students during the time of At this point in time, it is worth examining the unique culture of UAE students compared to their counterparts in other countries, which could probably be the reason behind the surprising results noticed in this research. In Middle Eastern countries, students spend more time with family members and only a small percentage of them generally live in hostels. Staying with parents could thus lessen the negative impacts of lockdown considering the lockdown enabled them to spend more time with their family members. Family size in Middle Eastern countries is also generally bigger, and a circumstance like COVID-19 lockdown although it limited them to meeting friends, provided them with more time and opportunity to interact with family members, thus defeating loneliness. Most of the student respondents in this research are foreign nationals whose parents were employed or running a business in the country giving students an opportunity to stay with them. The university support is also important as students can reach out to their faculty mentors anytime during the day using emails, phone calls and even social media.",

While the location was assessed, this research did not assess the living arrangements of the students, as living arrangements (students living independently versus those living at home) could be a contributing factor to stress. 26 COVID-19 had caused multiple problems including travel, meeting friends, and recreation facilities, such as movies and thus undoubtedly affecting the QoL of most people, if not everyone's. In the wake of the current pandemic, healthcare students in some countries were asked to graduate and serve the community as health professionals without any delay, thus making them more stressed. 27, 28 However, such a decision was not taken in the UAE.",

In the current research, as regard to medication needed for daily activities, a gender gap was noted with females requiring more medications. Again, the nature of medicines used was not studied. In a broader preview of student responses, students had better QoL on various aspects, such as \"enjoyment in life\", \"meaningfulness of life\", \"ability to concentrate\", \"feeling of safety\", \"physical environment\", \"energy for everyday life\", \"bodily appearance\", and so on, assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire ( Table 2 ). Further assessments revealed students had experiences of blue mood, despair, anxiety and depression during the lockdown days, and those negative feelings were more common among male participants when compared to female participants, an observation requiring further introspection.",

On the contrary, negative feelings were more common among male students. The research findings can be used by other academic institutions in handling any future situations like COVID-19 lockdowns. Future research can be conducted to identify vulnerable student populations and provide more counseling and social support. Smooth implementation of online educations, flexible academic approaches, ease of approachability of faculty mentors, better student orientation and offering social support to students are proven valuable.",
