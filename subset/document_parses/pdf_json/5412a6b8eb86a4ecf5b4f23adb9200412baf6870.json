The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein is a major target to develop candidate vaccines. \u03b1-Galactosylceramide (\u03b1GalCer), a potent invariant natural killer T cell (iNKT) agonist, was site-specifically conjugated to the Nterminus of the RBD to form an adjuvant\u2212protein conjugate, which was anchored on the liposome surface. This is the first time that an iNKT cell agonist was conjugated to the protein antigen. Compared to the unconjugated RBD/\u03b1GalCer mixture, the \u03b1GalCer-RBD conjugate induced significantly stronger humoral and cellular responses. The conjugate vaccine also showed effective cross-neutralization to all variants of concern (B.1.1.7/alpha, B.1.351/beta, P.1/gamma, B.1.617.2/delta, and B.1.1.529/omicron). These results suggest that the self-adjuvanting \u03b1GalCer-RBD has great potential to be an effective COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and this strategy might be useful for designing various subunit vaccines.",

Some commonly used chemicals to inactivate viruses are potentially carcinogenic such as \u03b2-propiolactone, which inactivate viruses at both the protein and nucleic acid levels, and thus may lead to destruction of the crucial antigenic protein structures. 10 However, the major drawback of protein subunit vaccines is their weak immunogenicity; thus, an adjuvant serving as a \"danger signal\" is often utilized in subunit vaccines to elicit robust humoral and cellular immunity. 11 \u221213 Among the subunit vaccine candidates against COVID-19, several adjuvants, including aluminum, 8, 14 STING agonist cyclic di-GMP (CDG), 15 toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists such as the TLR7/8 agonist, 16 and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG), and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), 17\u221219 have been utilized to successfully improve the immunity in mice.

For the first time, the iNKT cell agonist was conjugated to a protein antigen as a built-in stimulator. As the RBD is an immunodominant antigen of SARS-CoV-2 and accounts for 90% of the immune serum-neutralizing activity, 37 the RBD (S protein residues 319-541) was chosen as the protein antigen to develop the conjugate vaccine. Using a pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP)-mediated transamination reaction, the N-terminus of the RBD protein was converted to the ketone and sitespecifically conjugated with the adjuvant molecule via the oxime reaction ( Figure 1B) . 38, 39 Herein, a single \u03b1GalCer molecule was covalently linked to the N-terminal amino acid (Arg) of the RBD, which was further prepared as liposomes for the use as a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The co-delivery of the adjuvant and antigen was guaranteed by stable covalent conjugation; hence, the antigen-specific immune response could be boosted not only by the indirect CD4+ and CD8+ T cell stimulation but also by direct help toward B cells from iNKT cells. 40 Meanwhile, the conjugation approach would also affect the physical properties of the adjuvant. There are three major advantages of this conjugate vaccine: (1) simple and well-defined composition with a site-specific conjugation, (2) no interference of immunogenic epitopes on the antigen protein, and (3) potent efficiency with low adjuvant doses of liposomal formulation. In this study, we explored the effect of conjugation on humoral and cellular immune responses in mice and assessed its potential for developing an effective vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern (VOCs).",

            "text": "Preparation of Site-specifically Conjugated \u03b1GalCer-RBD. Our previous study has indicated that the immunogenicity of the antigen is significantly enhanced when the adjuvant molecule of the TLR7 agonist is covalently conjugated to the antigen-loaded protein. 41 In this study, the Difference between the traditional protein vaccine design and that used in this work. (B) First, the RBD protein is incubated with pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP), which transaminates the N-terminus of arginine to form a ketone. Second, the keto-protein reacts with alkoxyamine (\u03b1GalCer-linker) to form an oxime-linked protein\u2212lipid conjugate. (C) Liposomal formulation of \u03b1GalCer-RBD was prepared before mice vaccination. 6\u22128 week old female BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) were immunized subcutaneously on days 1, 15, and 29. Mice sera were collected on day 0 before initial immunization and on days 14, 28, and 35 after immunizations and splenocytes were isolated from vaccinated mice on day 35. iNKT agonist \u03b1GalCer was covalently linked to the Nterminus of the protein for the first time. This site-specifically conjugated vaccine has minimal interference on immunogenic epitopes with a well-defined component. Although several studies have conjugated lipids on the protein using peptide ligation strategies to fuse lipopeptides on protein fragments 42, 43 or chemical reactions to randomly attach adjuvants on the residues of protein, such as functionalization of lysine side chains, 44\u221248 these protein modification approaches can be difficult to control and need additional purification and the protein antigen epitopes are unavoidably interfered with, to a certain extent. Therefore, to prepare the \u03b1GalCer-RBD vaccine using a relatively simple transamination approach, the 6position of \u03b1GalCer was modified with a linker with an alkoxyamine group (Scheme 1). First, to synthesize a alkoxyamine-modified linker, compound 3 was prepared by reacting 2-[2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethoxy] ethanol with sodium azide. The subsequent reaction of 3 with ethyl bromoacetate gave intermediate 4. The azide was then reduced by the Staudinger reaction followed by a reaction with Boc-aminooxy acetic acid to afford 5. Then, acid 6 was obtained by the hydrolysis of 5. For the 6-position modification of \u03b1GalCer, compound 7 was first synthesized according to the method given in a previous report. 32 Then, the 6-OH group was effectively converted to an azide group by TsCl and NaN 3 to give azide-modified \u03b1GalCer 8. After the removal of the Bn groups and the reduction of the azide group of 8 with Pd(OH) 2 /C, acylation with linker 6 led to the \u03b1GalCer analogue 9. The Boc group of compound 9 was removed to give \u03b1GalCer-ONH 2 1, with a high purity of 95% ( Figure S11 ).",

The remarkable IgG antibody response initiated by \u03b1GalCer-RBD suggests that the conjugation of \u03b1GalCer with the RBD significantly improves the immunogenicity of the protein antigen, which might be due to the co-delivery of the glycolipid adjuvant with the full protein to prime both B cells and T cells through cognate and noncognate help of iNKT cells. 54 High IgG titers in the \u03b1GalCer-RBD-administered mice after the first immunization indicate that adaptive immune responses were rapidly activated. Meanwhile, the \u03b1GalCer-RBD-immunized mice had elicited exceptionally higher IgG antibody titers than those of RBD-(33-fold), RBD/Al-(37fold), and RBD/\u03b1GalCer (10-fold)-immunized mice on day 28 ( Figure 3A ). The rapid and strong humoral immune responses provoked by \u03b1GalCer-RBD after the second immunization suggests that a two-dose vaccination is enough to induce highly effective humoral immunity. \u03b1GalCer-RBD also showed high efficacy in inducing antibody class switching from IgM to RBD-specific IgG. These results indicate that covalently conjugating \u03b1GalCer and the antigen protein induces rapid and potent immune responses. In addition, the efficacy of \u03b1GalCer-RBD was still well-promoted by iNKT cells after restimulation, as the IgG titer increased 7.4-fold between the second and third immunizations, which is distinctive from the blunted antibody response of boosting immunizations with \u03b1GalCer-containing vaccines. 32, 33 The IgG subclass distribution of each group was primarily IgG1 ( Figure 3B ). Meanwhile, \u03b1GalCer-RBD-administered mice showed a more balanced enhancement of the Th1/Th2 response, with the IgG2a and IgG2b responses elicited being approximately 12-and 16-fold higher than those in the RBD/ Al (Th2-biased)-immunized group, respectively. Hence, it is beneficial to use the \u03b1GalCer-RBD conjugate as a vaccine candidate against viral infections because the immune responses induced by such conjugate vaccines feature a broad IgG subclass distribution for effective protection.",

An effective vaccine against COVID-19 should induce not only humoral specific antibodies but also cellular immune responses to provide a full range of protective immunity. 55 To evaluate the RBD-specific cellular immune responses, splenocytes were collected from vaccinated mice one week after the last immunization, and the antigen-specific responses were measured by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay. The splenocytes were stimulated with 50 \u03bcg/mL overlapping peptide pool (spanning SARS-CoV-2-S RBD) for 18 h before forming IFN-\u03b3 spots. As shown in Figure 4A , \u03b1GalCer-RBD vaccination significantly increased the number of IFN-\u03b3 spots, with \u223c4and \u223c26-fold increases in the number of IFN-\u03b3 spots compared to that after immunization with RBD/\u03b1GalCer and RBD/Al, respectively. Therefore, the conjugate vaccine enhanced cellular responses with increased numbers of antigen-specific cytokine-producing cells. To further characterize the contribution of these vaccine candidates to RBD-specific cellular immunity, cytokineproducing CD4+ ( Figure 4F \u2212H) and CD8+ ( Figure 4C \u2212E) T cells of splenocytes from immunized mice were evaluated by flow cytometry on day 35. As indicated in Figure 4C , 2.57, 1.32, and <1% CD8+ T cells derived from \u03b1GalCer-RBD-, RBD/\u03b1GalCer-, and RBD/Al-immunized mice, respectively, produced both IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 cytokines following the stimulation of the overlapping peptide pool (spanning SARS-CoV-2-S RBD). A similar trend was observed for CD4+ T cells ( Figure 4F ) and IFN-\u03b3+ or TNF-\u03b1+ cytokine-secreting cells (Figures 4D,E,G,H and S7 ). The specific cellular responses toward the RBD collectively confirmed that \u03b1GalCer-RBD provoked a potent cellular and humoral immune responses, implying that the \u03b1GalCer-RBD conjugate is a promising and effective candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine.",

A mixture of compound 8 (34 mg, 0.027 mmol) and Pd(OH) 2 /C (20% wt on carbon, 16 mg) in MeOH (3 mL) and CH 2 Cl 2 (3 mL) was stirred for 8 h at rt under a H 2 atmosphere and then filtrated through a short pad of Celite with MeOH/CH 2 Cl 2 (3:1). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give a crude amine as a white solid. To a solution of the amine in anhydrous MeOH (2 mL) and CH 2 Cl 2 (2 mL) were added 6 (20 mg, 0.054 mmol, 2.0 equiv), HBTU (15 mg, 0.041 mmol, 1.5 equiv), and NMM (30 \u03bcL, 0.27 mmol, 10 equiv) under an argon atmosphere at rt for 2 h. After the completion of the reaction, monitored by TLC, the solvent was evaporated under the reduced pressure. The resultant mixture was purified by silica gel flash column chromatography with CH 2 Cl 2 \u2212MeOH (15:1) to give 9 as a white solid (17 mg, 53% yield over two steps, >95% pure by HPLC): 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 / CD 3 OD = 1:1, reference peak TMS at 0.00 ppm): 174.91, 172.24, 170.73, 158.80, 100.16,  82.68, 75.82, 74.83, 72.83, 72.39, 71.36, 70.83, 70.70, 70.62 (((2S,3R ,4S,5R,6R)-6-(16-(Aminooxy)-3,15-dioxo-5,8,11-trioxa-2,14-diazahexadecyl)-3,4,5-trihydroxytetrahydro-2Hpyran-2-yl)oxy)-3,4-dihydroxynonadecan-2-yl)hexacosanamide (1). Compound 9 (4 mg, 3.28 \u03bcmol) was dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2 /TFA (10:1, 2 mL) at 0\u00b0C, and the mixture was stirred for 0.5 h at rt under an argon atmosphere and then concentrated to dryness. The excess of TFA was removed by co-evaporation with CH 2 Cl 2 under reduced pressure to give compound 1 as a white solid (3.6 mg, quantitative yield, >95% pure by HPLC), used in the next step without further purification. 1 \u03b1GalCer-RBD. The preparation of \u03b1GalCer-RBD was carried out according to the method in a previous report. 38, 39 The RBD protein solution and PLP stock solution were combined in equal volumes to give a final concentration of 10 mM PLP and 10 \u03bcM RBD protein in PBS at pH 6.5. The reaction mixture was briefly agitated to ensure mixing and then incubated without further agitation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Following the reaction, the PLP was removed using Amicon Ultrafiltration 0.5 mL units with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 10 kDa (Millipore). The sample was then concentrated to 100 \u03bcL after buffer exchange, and the process was repeated three times. The resulting 100 \u03bcL of keto-protein was treated with compound 1 (2 mM) in 1 mL of PBS/DMF (4:1, v/v, pH 5.5) and incubated at rt for 48 h. Buffer (containing 10% DMF) exchange steps were again repeated to stop the reaction and remove the excess adjuvant compound 1. Since the lipid moiety of compound 1 is hydrophobic in aqueous buffer, the \u03b1GalCer-RBD conjugate and unreacted RBD protein were separated through centrifugation (1000g, 10 min, rt). The unreacted RBD in the supernatant was detected to calculate the conjugation reaction yield, which showed that the total yield was more than 85%. The high yield was in agreement with that of RhB-RBD ( Figure S2 ). The purified \u03b1GalCer-RBD conjugate was then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used for the vaccine preparation.",
