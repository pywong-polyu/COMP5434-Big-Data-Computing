The fractured porous medium consists of two domains, namely, matrix blocks and fractures. The fractures are more permeable than the matrix blocks, but they contain very little fluid than the matrix. Different scales are therefore invoked in fractured porous media such as discrete fracture models (DFMs) and dual continuum models, can describe flow and transport in fractured porous media. The model of solute transport in fractured and porous media has been solved analytical by Park and Lee [1] and Roubinet et al. [2] . In order to model solute transport in fractured porous media, Bodin et al. [3] and Graf and Therrien [4] have used the discrete network model; and Refs. [5] [6] [7] have used equivalent continuum models, while Refs. [8, 9] have used the continuum model. In order to represent the fractures explicitly in the fractured porous media the discretefracture model (DFM) has been used.
