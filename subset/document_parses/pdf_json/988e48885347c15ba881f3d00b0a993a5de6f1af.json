This infection can affect either a single or both lungs and can cause mild to life-threatening effects in people of all ages. Notably, there are increased risks for those with preexisting health conditions or in adults with more than 65 years, and is the largest worldwide infectious cause of death for children; accounting for 15% of children deaths in 2017, according to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics. Among the possible sources, viruses and bacteria are the most common pneumonia infection causes [1] and, depending on the pathogen, the illness shows a different behavior. In particular, for viral agents, the infection is generally diffused across all lungs [2] , while for bacterial ones it usually concentrates on given areas [3] . Therefore, due to intrinsic dif-ferences between viruses and bacteria, as well as their potential treatment, a key aspect is to correctly diagnose the pneumonia source. The latter has become even more crucial since the discovery of a novel coronavirus in 2019 [4] , that has resulted in the SARS-CoV-2 virus and related COVID-19 disease pandemic outbreak. Indeed, while many works are addressing this diagnosis task [5] , there is still a need for increasingly more general research that might be used to oppose the possibly already endemic SARS-CoV-2 [6] , its future variants [7] , or completely new diseases that might result in other pandemics [8] .",

            "text": "To address the pneumonia classification task and help clinicians with their diagnoses, an effective solution is to analyze chest-x-rays images. Indeed, as can be observed in Fig. 1 , the infection spread can be clearly visible through the x-ray technology, especially for severe conditions such as the one associated to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. To fully exploit information found in such images, deep learning approaches are being explored since they can already obtain significant per- formances in several heterogeneous medical fields [9, 10, 11, 12] . In detail, many solutions focus on the binary classification between COVID-19 patients and healthy people [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] . For instance, the authors of [15] design a custom deep neural network (DNN) model with a hybrid diagnose strategy (HDS) and fuzzy inference engine to identify COVID-19 patients, while in [18] transfer learning is applied to 4 pre-trained networks to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 infected and healthy people. Although a binary classification allows a given model to completely focus on the COVID-19 disease, several works try to build more general models by also differentiating pneumonia patients with other sources (i.e., bacterial or virus) through the use of deep learning methods [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] . In [21] , for example, the authors devise a stacking ensemble method to leverage several Ima-geNet pre-trained architectures and discern between healthy, COVID-19 and other pneumonia-affected patients; while a custom architecture based on long-short term memory (LSTM) units is trained from scratch in [19] to achieve a similar purpose. Finally, different works propose yet another abstraction step by recognizing 4 different classes, i.e., healthy, COVID-19, as well as pneumonia patients infected via bacterial or other viral pathogens [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] . In particular, the authors of [25] introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN), called CoroNet, specifically designed and trained to discriminate between the aforementioned categories. In [28] , instead, 5 Ima-geNet pre-trained architectures are combined via the ensemble technique to increase their system classification performance. An important aspect for methods addressing the pneumonia classification in COVID-19 affected patients and, more in general, of new illnesses is the lack of datasets, especially when diseases are first discovered. In this context, approaches based on few-shot learning (FSL), where models are trained on an extremely small number of annotated samples, can be developed and prove useful as early diagnosis tools [31, 32, 33] . In [31] , for instance, an encoder is trained over a small number of samples to extract image embeddings via contrastive learning. This low-dimensional representation is then fed to a prototypical network that can diagnose the COVID-19 infection. The authors of [32] , instead, exploit FSL to train in a self-supervised way an architecture organized as an encoder-decoder and perform segmentation of CT scans to detect a SARS-CoV-2 contagion more easily. Although FSL can considerably help diagnose new- found illnesses, a relevant problem that can arise when using few samples is the privacy of the corresponding patients, which should always be guaranteed. To this end, several approaches exploit the federated learning (FL) technique when implementing their solution to diagnose COVID-19 [34, 35, 36] . In particular, FL enables devices to collaboratively learn a shared global model without sharing their local training data with a single server, therefore ensuring data privacy through a decentralized approach. The authors of [35] , for example, address the segmentation and classification of COVID-19 while preserving user privacy by developing a capsule network that is trained through the blockchain FL. Differently, the scheme in [36] presents a custom strategy where a shared model can maintain data without physically exchanging them and train several known networks on the COVID-19 diagnosis using the developed methodology. While many literature works focusing on the SARS-CoV-2 infection introduce specific architectures that handle its classification, or design models that can keep learning following the continual learning paradigm [37, 38, 39] , others simply focus on transfer learning capabilities by fine-tuning known architectures on pneumonia datasets [40, 13, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45] . Following the latter methodology, we performed a transfer learning study by fine-tuning 12 models on an extended collection derived by combining two public datasets presented, respectively, in [46] and [13] . In particular, we froze all Imagenet pre-trained models up to their respective classification component, as summarized in Fig. 2 , which was instead modified to handle the classification task of the 4 available categories, i.e., healthy and pneumonia derived from bacterial, viral and SARS-CoV-2 pathogens. This allows to train even complex models in less time and enables the presented architectures to be ready to handle a complex task such as medical image classification. Furthermore, we also present qualitative experiments to explain the networks choices by directly observing what they focus on inside the chest-x-ray images via the Grad-CAM algorithm [47] . Presenting such a comprehensive transfer learning overview helps to choose better backbone architectures to build custom models upon, and offers a strong methodology for possible future diseases which might require to be diagnosed as early as possible, and for which it might be difficult to design good performing neural networks right away.",

            "text": "The intuition behind transfer learning is to use a model pretrained on a large and heterogeneous dataset, so that its generic world representation can be exploited on a new and different task [48] . In particular, when analyzing images, this learning approach takes advantage of feature maps learned by a network, without requiring to train the model from scratch and, therefore, avoiding a time-consuming and resource-intensive procedure. To transfer previous knowledge to the new task, there are two possible approaches. In the first one, a pre-trained model is treated as a feature extractor by freezing its internal weights. A classifier is then trained on top of this frozen architecture to achieve the knowledge transferal, and retain as much information as possible from the previous field. Notice that the classifier is usually implemented either via one or more dense layers, with the last one using the softmax function to obtain the probability distribution over the available classes; as a completely distinct deep learning architecture; or through machine learning algorithms such as the support vector machine (SVM) or random forest (RF). In the second approach, instead, the whole architecture, or a subset thereof, is fine-tuned on the new task. In this case, the pre-trained model weights are used as a baseline instead of starting from a random initialization. This generally allows a network to reach training convergence faster, and to specialize its entire structure to the new field. While both methodologies can be effective, in this work, we explore the former approach and assess the capabilities of various networks used as feature extractors; and train the original classifier component of each model, which is implemented as one or more fully connected layers, on the collected dataset. This training strategy allows to emulate the scarcity of data, typical when new illnesses are first discovered, but still enables to correctly train otherwise data hungry networks [49] . In more detail, we performed experiments on a combined collection derived from datasets presented in [46] and [13] uate 12 well-known ImageNet pre-trained models briefly discussed later in this section, i.e., AlexNet [50] , DenseNet [51] , GoogleNet [52] , MnasNet [53] , MobileNetv2 [54] , MobileNet v3 (Large) [55] , ResNet50 [56] , ResNeXt [57] , ShuffleNet [58] , SqueezeNet [59] , VGG16 [60] and Wide ResNet50 [61] . Moreover, each model M was modified and adapted to the new task by changing the output layer M o nodes number, by exploiting the following equation:",

In detail, each network was trained for up to 40 epochs using the Adam optimizer, a learning rate of 1e-3, and a batch size of 100, which allowed for a good sample mixture. Moreover, for each model, weights associated to the highest performing epoch, with respect to the development set accuracy, were selected as a final configuration to be used for inference. In addition, we also implemented the standard data augmentation strategy used for ImageNet which automatically handles input images with different dimensions by altering them as follows: random resize crop to a dimension of 256\u00d7256, random rotation up to 15 degrees, color jitter, random horizontal flip, and center crop of size 224\u00d7224 to match the network input size. Finally, several common classification metrics, i.e., precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score were used to evaluate the networks performances. Notice that, being in a multiclass classification scenario, a weighted average of the aforementioned metrics was used to estimate the models performances so that the dataset distribution would also be taken into account. Concerning the architectures implementation, we employed the PyTorch framework and PyTorch Lightning library, with a 16-bit floating-point precision to speed up the computation. Furthermore, ImageNet pre-trained models were imported from the TorchVision library to exploit the transfer learning paradigm. Finally, all tests were performed on the Google Colab infrastructure with an Intel CPU x86-64 architecture using 25GB of RAM, along an NVIDIA Tesla V100 with 16GB of VRAM. The required training and test time using this configuration are summarized in Table 3 . Notice that training times are affected by the underlying architecture but are not strictly correlated to the number of available parameters, i.e., more parameters do not necessarily require longer times to be trained. Contrary to this phenomenon, test times over the entire test set, i.e., 725 images, are similar across all models, indicating that each network, independently from its performance, can analyze a chestx-ray and provide a feedback to the clinician in roughly 3 ms.",

            "text": "In this section, we evaluate all of the presented models both quantitatively and qualitatively by means of sheer performances, for the former, and through an explainable visualization of the output, for the latter. Concerning the quantitative assessment, a graphical representation of the accuracy metric is illustrated in Fig. 4 , while relevant classification metrics are reported in Table 4 . As shown, almost all networks can achieve satisfactory results with a score higher than 70% across all metrics, indicating that transfer learning can be an important tool for the early screening of new diseases. Moreover, all models achieve high specificity scores, implying that, for each class, there generally is a low number of false positives, i.e., pneumonia sources tend not to be mixed during predictions. More interestingly, the top performing architecture is the MobileNet v3, even though it is one of the models with the lowest number of parameters since it is optimized for mobile devices. This outcome highlights that more recent and advanced architectures can have an edge over older ones (e.g., AlexNet) and, as a consequence, may perform better using significantly fewer parameters without loss of generality. While networks with less parameters can still obtain remarkable performances, the opposite result can also be observed. Examples of this behavior are the MnasNet and, in particular, SqueezeNet, which do not perform well during inference as they cannot effectively transfer previous knowledge to the new task due to both their architecture and parameters number; an expected outcome since these networks are mainly focused on significantly reducing pre-existing models sizes and can have a lower accuracy as a trade-off. Furthermore, the reduced performances are also confirmed by the average accuracies and losses, which are reported in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 , respectively. As can be observed, most networks start converging well before the 40-th epoch, apart from the best performing DenseNet and MobileNet v3 that kept improving across the entire training procedure. This implies that previous knowledge, although useful, can saturate fast during its transferal. What is more, the SqueezeNet architecture actually diverges when adapting its classifier to the new task, thus resulting in loss values outside the reported range, and further justifying the low performance obtained on the pneumonia classification task. This outcome suggests that using an extremely low number of parameters can result in issues when exploiting the transfer learning paradigm, especially in the case of complex tasks such as the classification of chest-x-ray images. These results are also confirmed by the AUROCs reported in Fig. 7 . As shown, most models obtain remarkable areas on each class, with the highest one be-ing associated consistently with COVID-19, most likely due to the extreme effects of pneumonia spread inside the lungs derived from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such an outcome indicates that the models can correctly distinguish healthy patients from those affected by pneumonia and, for the latter, also individuate the correct source, further highlighting the effectiveness of the transfer learning paradigm to classify new illnesses. Concluding, notice that the only exception is the SqueezeNet architecture, i.e., Fig. 7 .(j) since it did not converge during training. On a different note, we performed several experiments to evaluate the robustness of each model by reducing the training set size. In particular, we used 50%, 20%, and 10% of the collected training images to simulate a real case scenario where chest-x-rays would be limited upon the illness discovery. The results, obtained on the same test set described in Table 2 , are reported in Table 5, Table 6 , and Table 7 training set reduced to 50%, 20%, and 10%, respectively. Notice that this percentage is computed per class, following the training set described in Table 2 , to ensure samples from each source would be included in the training set. As expected, performances naturally decrease for all networks by reducing the training set size, with the smallest size, i.e., 10%, resulting in the lowest scores across all metrics. More interestingly, the best performing model with the entire training set, i.e., Mo-bileNet v3, suffers from the highest decrease in performance, reaching almost 56% less F1-score. On the one hand, this indicates a possible limit with the architecture itself, especially noticeable compared to its previous version MobileNet v2 which has a 17% performance drop. On the other hand, it demonstrates that models with low performances can achieve higher results when provided with enough samples. Contrary to Mo-bileNet v3, AlexNet has the smallest reduction in performance, with only a 3.39% decrease in F1-score when using 10% of the training set, suggesting that this convolutional network extracts robust features. In this context, another model that obtained remarkable scores across all metrics and training set sizes is the DenseNet architecture, implying that the internal configuration of a model can influence the computation of meaningful features, which is a relevant factor when analyzing newly discovered illnesses.",

Nevertheless, there is a robust COVID-19 recognition across the architectures, even though viruses, and especially other SARS pathogens, fall into a different category.

As can be observed, the former model, reported on the second row, concentrates on the lungs for pneumonia cases deriving from bacteria, virus, and COVID-19, i.e., Fig. 9.(b-d) ; while the architecture internal weights have a higher response, i.e., red areas on the Grad-CAM image, on both collar as well as rib cage bones for a normal chest-x-ray, i.e., Fig. 9.(a) . This outcome is most likely due to the pneumonia absence from the input, which resulted in the model focusing on other points of interest to learn the right category. Even more interesting, the activated areas in pneumonia images seem to confirm the illness propagation described in [2, 3] . Specifically, bacterial pathogens present a concentrated activation on specific spots, while viral sources present a diffused activation throughout the lungs. This effect is especially visible on COVID-19 pneumonia, i.e., Fig. 9.(d) , where bigger lungs areas have a higher response dur-ing inference, indicating that the model could also learn differences between viral and SARS-CoV-2 pathogens. Differently from the MobileNet v3, the SqueezeNet architecture tends to focus on bones and edges from all chest components by focusing on smaller details, most likely due to the smaller kernel filters of the network. Consequently, this model mixes normal chest-x-rays with either a bacterial or other generic viral pathogens, as expected from the diverged confusion matrix presented in Fig.8.(j) . A similar issue for this second network, albeit to a lesser extent, is also presented when examining activated areas in the bacterial and COVID-19 images, i.e., Fig. 9.(b) and Fig. 9.(d) . In both cases, the model responds to wider regions of the chest-x-ray in conjunction with rib cage bones, suggesting that the architecture is not analyzing pneumonia effects on lungs and resulting in the sensibly lower reported performances as well as training divergence. What is more, a comparable scenario can also be observed in Fig. 10 , where misclassified images for the MobileNet v3, i.e., the best architecture on the presented dataset, are reported. As shown, for each category, the model has a strong response on other points of interest, such as collar or rib cage bones, as well as external lungs locations. Furthermore, for the healthy chest-xray, i.e., Fig. 10 .(a), there are active areas within the lung in correspondence with image artifacts. Such behaviors indicate that, as mentioned, the architecture fine-tuning could be further improved, especially since it did not reach convergence on the training dataset. Moreover, it highlights the complexity of the task since even proficient networks have difficulties handling these information-rich images. Regardless of these issues, qualitative experiments corroborate the quantitative effectiveness of transfer learning to diagnose pneumonia sources.",

The scope of this study is to describe a comprehensive evaluation of different models when addressing the classification of a specific illness, in order to show both limitations and effectiveness of many remarkable architectures when applied to a new task. In particular, a dataset was organized from several public collections of chest-x-rays for the pneumonia classification derived by bacteria, generic viral or SARS-CoV-2 pathogens. Moreover, quantitative and qualitative experiments were reported to assess all models, which managed to reach up to 84.46% average f1-score at inference time. As shown by the results, one of the smallest architectures, i.e., MobileNet v3, achieves the best performances and, when applying the Grad-CAM algorithm, it exhibits similar patterns with respect to the corresponding pneumonia source, i.e., high internal weights responses in concentrated or diffused areas for bacterial or viral and SARS-CoV-2 sources, respectively; demonstrating that previous knowledge does indeed help to address a new task, and suggesting that transfer learning can become a fundamental tool when diagnosing future unknown illnesses. Furthermore, the robustness of each model was assessed by reducing the training set size to 50%, 20%, and 10% of its orig-inal dimension. The results highlighted both limitations and effectiveness of the tested architectures when provided with a reduced amount of samples. For instance, MobileNet v3 had a considerable 56% F1-score decrease while AlexNet showed a reduction of 3.39% when using the smallest training set.",
