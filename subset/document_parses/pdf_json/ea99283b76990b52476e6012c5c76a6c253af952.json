After the emergence of this virus, it became a global public health concern and quickly evolved into a pandemic. Mexico is currently in the third position in the number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2. To date, there have been several lineages of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide; in the Mexican population, two variants of the spike protein (S-protein) are found, localized at H49Y and D614G, which have been related to increased infectivity with respect to the wild-type S-protein. To understand how these differences impact the structural behavior of the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as binding with ACE2, we performed MD simulations combined with the molecular mechanics generalized Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMGB(PB)SA) approach starting from X-ray crystallography data. Energetic and structural analysis showed that the differences in infectivity can be explained by differences in affinity of the protein-protein interface between the wild-type and mutant S-protein with ACE2. Conformational analysis showed that molecular recognition between the S-protein and ACE2 is linked to a decrease in the conformational flexibility of wild-type and mutant S-protein; however, an increase in the conformational mobility of ACE2 could also contribute to the binding affinity observed using the MMGB(PB)SA method.",

It was first discovered in Wuhan, China after an extreme outbreak of pneumonia-like symptoms [1, 2] . While it is the seventh discovered coronavirus species that affect humans, if we compare its infection speed and fatality rate, it's undoubtedly the first among its peers [3, 4] . Even though the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS-CoV-2, a global pandemic due to the extreme viral propagation and the global authorities made no delay in taking immediate countermeasures (including travel bans) afterward, the viral spread is hardly showing any signs of slowing down. According to the Worldometer by April 27th, new infections are being reported still above 800,000 daily globally, with the death toll being no less than 14,000 daily (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) [5] . While some countries, after a strict quarantine period, have become free of COVID-19, the situation in some others have relapsed. SARS-CoV-2 infection generally causes fever, coughing, sneezing, and pneumonia-like breathing difficulties in most cases [1] , although recent studies have also reported the occurrence of kidney dysfunction and myocardial injury due to viral proliferation [6] [7] [8] .",

It belongs to the Betacoronavirus order of the Coronaviridae family under the Nidovirales order, and evidence suggests that the virus originated from bats, not unlike that of its brethren, 2002 SARS-CoV and 2012 MERS-CoV. Genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed 96% similarity with bat coronavirus and 80% sequence similarity with 2002 SARS-CoV [9] . As the majority of coronaviruses that infect humans share common zoonotic origins, researchers and health officials share common concerns in terms of understanding their natural source and evolutionary mechanism to better prepare prevention mechanisms for future outbreaks.",

            "text": "Amongst the 14 ORFs of SARS-CoV-2 ORF, 1a/b plays the most vital role in viral replication as it consists of two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are cleaved into 16 major non-structural proteins. The remaining one-third of the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 translates into the major structural proteins, including N (nucleocapsid protein), M (membrane protein), E (envelope protein), and spike glycoprotein (S-protein) along with other accessory proteins [10] [11] [12] [13] . The S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays the most substantial role in infecting humans. The S-protein is built in a trimeric conformation in which each monomer consists of two subunits. S-protein monomers are built of an N-terminal, S1 (residues 13-685) subunit that mediates binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE2, including to the receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 319-541) and the S2 subunit (residue 686-1273) that mediates fusion with the host cell, thus mediating host invasion in humans [14] . SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 79% sequence similarities [15] , and both employ ACE2 as their cellular receptors. As the S-protein plays the most vital role in viral propagation, it bears considerable importance in understanding the virus's evolutionary mechanisms which led to its increased infectivity against humans [16] . Studies suggest any change or mutation in the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a substantial impact on the respective strain's infectivity [17] . To date, the major mutations detected worldwide have been localized on the viral S-protein [18] [19] [20] [21] ; in the Mexican population, two of three viral lineages have been reported [22] , however, structural insight into how these mutations impact the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its molecular recognition of ACE2 is still missing. In a recent computational study, it was identified that H49Y, D614G, and T573I mutations in the Mexican population differently impact the affinity of some potential inhibitors of the S-protein [23] . In addition, it has been reported that the H49Y mutation is linked to a reduction in total free energy, while the D614G substitution has a more stabilizing effect [21] . In this study, these two mutations (H49Y and D614G) of the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, discovered among the Mexican population for which increased infectivity has been observed, were studied using a computational approach that combines molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation using the MMGB(PB)SA approach, here we attempt to discover the potential variations in their infectivity.",

This analysis indicates that only S-protein WT exhibited high flexibility of residues (residues 331-504) involved in forming the RBD (residues 319-541), indicating that both mutations contributed to a decrease in mobility at this region involved in the molecular recognition. This lower mobility at RBD for mutants may be responsible for the differences in affinity for potential S-protein inhibitors as previously reported [23] . For free ACE2, it was observed that high mobility was localized along with residues 71-86, 146-186, (Fig. 3B) , of which one region (residues 330-370) is directly involved in forming protein-protein interactions with the S-protein. Comparison of the free and bound ACE2 states suggest that a decrease in the conformational mobility is present in residues 330-370 upon complex formation with wild-type and mutant S-protein systems.",

The S-protein H49Y -ACE2 complex was the one with the most favorable \u0394G bind value, followed by S-protein D614G -ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-ACE2.

This result also suggests improved accessibility of these two mutants to ACE2 with respect to wild type, which is consistent with greater cell entry of the viruses that carry these mutations [37, 38] . However, considering the standard deviations of \u0394G bind values of S-protein D614G -ACE2 and S-protein WT -ACE2 indicates an overlap of both binding free energy values, indicating that D614G mutation does not impact importantly the binding free energy with respect to S-protein WT -ACE2 system.",

RMSF analysis of free S-protein WT , S-protein H49Y and S-protein D614G systems showed that only S-protein WT exhibited high flexibility in residues involved in forming the RBD, suggesting that these mutations contributed to decreased flexibility at RBD involved in molecular recognition with ACE2, whereas a decrease in the conformational flexibility was present in residues involved in the molecular interaction with RBD of wild-type and mutant S-protein systems.",

In contrast, the free and bound S-protein WT , S-protein H49Y, and S-protein D614G systems indicated decreased heterogeneity that could be linked to unfavorable entropic and favorably enthalpic contributions that favorably impact the binding affinity determined with the MMGB(PB)SA approach.",
