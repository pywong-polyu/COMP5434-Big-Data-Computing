Prevalence of annual suicidal presentations and for selected groups of consumers (by sex, age groups, and ethnicity) was determined from a machine learning diagnostic algorithm developed for this purpose and a Bayesian estimation approach. A linear increase in the number of suicidal presentations over 10 years was observed, which was 2.8-times higher than the increase noted in all ED presentations and 6.1-times higher than the increase in the population size. Females had higher presentation rates than males, particularly among younger age groups. The highest rates of presentations were by persons aged 15-24. Overseas-born persons had around half the rates of suicidal presentations than Australian-born persons, and Indigenous persons had 2.9-times higher rates than non-Indigenous persons. Of all presenters, 70.6% presented once, but 5.7% had five or more presentations. Seasonal distribution of presentations showed a peak at the end of spring and a decline in winter months. These findings can inform the allocation of health resources and guide the development of suicide prevention strategies for people presenting to hospitals in suicidal crisis. Departments (EDs), even if these account for only a subset of the actual community incidence [6] [7] [8] . Trends of presentations with non-fatal suicidal behavior to one Australian hospital (which represents a part of the health service investigated in the present paper) were recently analyzed by K\u00f5lves et al. [9]. The authors found a significant increase in the age-standardized rates of non-fatal suicidal presentations for both males and females, and particularly among the youth. Further, 13.4% of the sample re-presented with within one year after their index episode [9] . Studies with longer follow-up periods reported higher rates of repeated non-fatal suicidal behaviors, such as 21.6% in a study of patients followed for 10 years [10] . Presentations with suicidal ideation have a higher rate of re-presentations than suicide attempts [11] and are more frequent among males than females [11, 12] . Racial and ethnic differences have also been found to impact on rates of suicidal presentations to EDs, with evidence of members of ethnic minority groups displaying a higher risk of suicide yet being less likely to engage with mental health services [13, 14] .",

To overcome the above noted limitations inherent to the use of ED administrative data and to reduce high costs associated with manual identification of relevant cases, a machine learning algorithm was developed to identify suicidal presentations using presentation descriptions in the Emergency Department Information System (EDIS) database [23] . This algorithm was used to obtain data on suicidal presentations between 2009 and 2018 which were analyzed in this paper. The paper has four main aims:",

SERoSP uses an evolutionary algorithm to weight 136 variables from a training dataset of EDIS data (March-May 2015), where suicidal presentations were identified by a psychiatrist. These variables included a range of diagnostic codes and presenting problems assigned at the point of ED triage such as Indigenous/non-Indigenous status of the consumer, score according to the Australian Triage Scale (5-point clinical tool used to establish the maximum waiting time for medical assessment and treatment of a patient), discharge destinations, and 52 different keywords indicative of the presentations being suicide-related. The program then \"learned\" from trial and error, over 150 successive generations, using 100 variations of variable weights per generation, to detect suicidal presentations with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 92%. This algorithm was designated as SERoSP1. Further work was then undertaken to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm by emphasizing analysis of triage text using word and phrase search strategies, and employing basic Natural Language Processing techniques to identify key words and word combinations used in the triage text of suicidal presentations. The modified algorithm was retrained on 23,786 psychiatrist-assessed ED presentations (July-December 2015) and validated on 26,130 psychiatrist-assessed ED presentations (July-December 2017), achieving a sensitivity of 87% for a pre-set specificity of 99%. This algorithm is referred to as SERoSP2.",

Both traditional (frequentist) and Bayesian methods have been developed to estimate true prevalence. When the expected prevalence is low, assumptions required for frequentist approaches may not be met and unrealistic point estimates and wide confidence intervals result [27, 29] . In this work, we use a Bayesian approach described by Joseph et al. [30] and utilized through Epitools (Bayesian estimation of true prevalence from survey testing with one test) [31] . The accuracy of Bayesian estimates is dependent on the quality of prior knowledge regarding sensitivity and specificity of the test and expectation of the prevalence [29] . Prior estimates of the sensitivity and specificity, in all cases, were those obtained from the SERoSP1-SERoSP2 diagnostic combination on the validation dataset. The prior estimate of the prevalence, in each case, was based on a crude adjustment of the observed prevalence based on the proportion of false positives seen in the validation dataset. Probability distributions of these prior estimates were based on the beta distribution with parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, calculated from the point estimate and its 5%CI for sensitivity and specificity or, for prevalence, from the adjusted number of positives, x, and the population total, n (\u03b1 = x + 1, \u03b2 = n -x + 1) [30, 31] .",

A greater likelihood to have more than one suicidal presentation was noted in persons aged less than 15 years (OR = 1.44, 95%CI 1.26-1.66) and those aged 15-24 years (OR = 1.27, 95%CI 1.19-1.35), when compared to other age groups. In contrast, persons whose first presentation was when aged 65 or more were more likely to only have only one presentation during the observed 10 years (OR = 2.93, 95%CI 2.42-3.55). Australian-born persons were 1.42-times more likely to have multiple presentations than overseas-born persons (95%CI 1.32-1.53), and Indigenous persons were 1.61-times (95%CI 1.38-1.87) more likely to have multiple presentations than non-Indigenous persons. The two groups of persons with the highest likelihood of being frequent presenters were youth under 15 years (11.1%) and Indigenous Australians (9.8%). Figure 3 shows the distribution of suicidal presentations across months, combining data for all 10 years. The highest percentage of presentations occurred between October and December, with a distinct peak in November (10.5%, 95%CI 10.1-10.9), which marks the end of spring in the southern hemisphere. This was followed by another, though smaller increase in March (start of autumn) with 9.0% (95%CI 8.6-9.4) of all suicidal presentations. The lowest percentage of suicidal presentations occurred in winter months (June and July) which accounted for 7.2% (95%CI 6.9-7.6) and 7.4% (95%CI 7.0-7.8) of suicidal presentations, respectively. No differences in the monthly distribution of suicidal presentations were observed between males and females (\u03c72(11) = 12.25, p = 0.345).",

This is in contrast with findings by Perera, Wand, Bein, Chalkley, Ivers, Steinbeck, Shields, and Dinh [17] who noted a nearly equal division between males and females. A previously published analysis of a subset of presentations included in this paper [18] found that in 2017, 63.4% of all suicidal presentations to ED were due to suicidal ideation. Considering the emerging evidence that males have higher rates of ED presentations with suicidal ideation [11] , it could be expected that males would account for a larger proportion of suicidal presentations compared to females in our sample, however, the inability to differentiate between types of presentations prevented a more in-depth exploration of these trends.",

Differences between the two groups was higher than reported in the analysis of deaths by suicide by Kolves and De Leo [44] , which could be attributed to immigrants' reluctance to utilize mental-health services for suicide-related concerns [45] . Similarly, many Indigenous people experience significant barriers in accessing culturally appropriate support for mental health more broadly, and in particular for suicidality [46] , which is believed to contribute to the 2.2-times higher suicide rate in Indigenous persons compared to non-Indigenous persons [47] . Despite the previously argued reluctance by many Indigenous Australians to engage with Western-based medical models of treatment [48] , their rates of suicidal presentations to our EDs remained much higher than those of non-Indigenous persons. It is possible that among presentations by Indigenous persons included in our analysis, a greater proportion resulted from suicide attempts, particularly if using methods that are more likely to require medical interventions [14] or were involuntary in nature [49] .",

Persons that were most likely to have repeated presentations belong to the same groups that had the highest rates of suicidal presentations: youth and Indigenous Australians.

            "text": "Analysis of monthly distribution of suicidal presentations to EDs identified a distinct peak at the end of spring (in November) and the lowest frequency during winter months. This finding partially aligns with previously observed seasonal patterns in deaths by suicide in Australia, which typically peak in spring/early summer and dip in autumn (for females) and winter (for males) [50, 51] . However, some studies have found the distribution of non-fatal suicidal behaviors across the year to be less pronounced, arguably due to the predominant use of low-risk methods that have the least pronounced seasonal variations [41] , such as cutting and poisoning, in suicide attempts. Potential variations in the prevalence of suicidal ideation, specifically within the subset of the population that access ED for help, currently remains a little researched topic outside of the debate on seasonal depression, which is believed to be less prominent in tropic areas of the southern hemisphere [52] . It is possible that other factors contributed to the observed trends in our study, such as the large numbers of domestic and international travelers visiting the Gold Coast at different times of the year, which has previously been found to have a significant impact on the volume of ED presentations [53] . The observed peak in suicidal presentations in November could therefore be partly due to the mass gathering of high school leavers (\"schoolies\") in the area, which has been linked to an increase in the number of mental health related presentations to ED during that time [54] . A more detailed investigation of seasonal trends of different types of suicidal presentations, further separated by sex and age groups, is required to disentangle the effects of these associations.",

Any diagnostic test used for surveillance purposes that is not perfect will provide prevalence estimates that come with error. The combined SERoSP1-SERoSP2 test had high levels of sensitivity and specificity, however, when applied to rare events, even tests as accurate as this produce large numbers of false positives and hence require an adjustment of the observed prevalence. The Bayesian method used in this work provided the best available estimates but is very dependent on high quality prior information. For the purposes of this analysis, it was assumed that the accuracy observed in the validation dataset (using 2017 data) provided a good estimate of the test's performance in populations from other years and in specific subgroups. Similarly, it was assumed that the proportion of false positives seen in the validation dataset would be similar in other population groups, enabling a reasonably good prior estimate of prevalence.",

We acknowledge this as a limitation of this paper. It is also possible that the numbers of suicidal presentations by Indigenous people and first-generation migrants are under-estimated in our analysis, as has been noted in some earlier studies [55, 56] , particularly in the early years before GCHHS invested concentrated efforts towards improving the recording of sociodemographic characteristics of its consumers [57] . In analyzing re-presentations to ED, different periods of follow-up were applied to consumers depending on the year of their index presentation. Finally, we could not control for the possibility that some persons died during the follow-up period (particularly those of older age at the time of their index presentation) or have had repeated suicidal presentations to health services outside of the Gold Coast geographical catchment boundaries.",
