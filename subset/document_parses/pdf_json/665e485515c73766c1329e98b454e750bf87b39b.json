Objective: To assess the factors associated with compliance with the public health measures imposed by various SSA countries. Method: Cross sectional study using self-administered surveys distributed on social media platforms between April 18th and May 16th, 2020, corresponding with the mandatory lockdown period in most SSA countries. Multivariate analysis examined the associated factors. Results: The prevalence of hand hygiene, quarantine, self isolation practices, wearing of face mask and attending large gatherings during COVID-19 were 94%, 39%, 31%, 64% and 14%, respectively. In multivariate models, older age 49+ years: adjusted OR 2.13, 95%CI 1.22,3.71), females (OR 1.41,95%CI 1.03,1.93), Central African countries (OR 3.73,95%CI 2.02,6.87) were associated with wearing face mask. Living alone (aOR 1.52,95%CI 1.04,2.24) during the lockdown was associated with avoiding large gatherings including religious events. Female respondents (aOR 1.61, 95%CI 1.30, 2.00), married (aOR 1.71,95%CI 1.33,2.21) and unemployed (aOR 1.62,95%CI 1.25,2.09) SSAs were more likely to practice self-quarantine measures. Conclusion: The low prevalence of mitigation practices suggest the need for targeted education campaign programs to sensitise the population",

A combination of cases detected outside Wuhan, with the detection of infection in at least one household cluster and the documented infections in healthcare workers car risk of much wider spread of the disease 2 . ing for patients with COVID-19, indicated human-to-human transmission of the virus and thus the Globally, as of July 29, 2020, there have been 16, 713, 304 confirmed cases and in Africa, 789,226 cases have been confirmed 1. The first confirmed case in Africa was reported in Egypt on Feb 14, 2020 , with this prompting African preparedness efforts 3 . Due to the lack of vaccines and effective pharmaceutical treatments at the time, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were the most effective way to curb the spread of COVID- 19 4 The WHO interim guidance document of 7th March 2020 provided guidance to countries for responding to community transmission of COVID-19 through implementation of some public health measures appropriate to them 4 . The various public health measures adopted were at the national, community and individual levels. At the national level, governments introduced screening and quarantine of arrivals at airports and seaports as well as restriction of travels from countries highly affected by COVID-19 to finally suspending air travel into their countries 5, 6 . At the community and individual levels, governments introduced several measures some of which were considered draconian. These measures included strict lockdown policy, staying at home to save life campaigns, travel and movement restrictions and prohibition of mass gatherings, regular hand washing under running water, frequent cleaning of surfaces with soap, or disinfectants 7, 8 . Combating misinformation and fake news about the pandemic formed part of the public health measures to minimize the spread of COVID -19 by educating the public on appropriate information for guidance on behaviors and practices 9 . In South Africa, a private firm Praekelt.org created a WhatsApp-based helpline that provided real-time date and automated responses in numerous languages to educate and sensitize people 10 . In spite of the good intentions of the governments, there were factors militating against citizens' compliance to these measures. Central to this was economic hardships resulting from these enforced restrictions. This appeared most impractical in densely populated informal settlements and in economies largely dependent on informal trading. Religious practices, misinformation, and incidents of unrest were other factors implicated in affecting compliances 11 . In another research article, knowledge was quoted to be a prerequisite for establishing prevention beliefs, forming positive attitudes, and promoting positive behaviours, and that individuals' cognition and attitudes towards disease affect the effectiveness of their coping strategies and behaviours to a certain extent 12 . This research was designed to assess the adherence to public health measures adopted in selected African countries on COVID-19 as well as to broadly evaluate the factors that influenced compliance to these measures in order to plan appropriately for the future. Findings from this study will enable public health researchers and policy makers to target sub-population not willing to comply with public health measures put in place by the respective SSA governments to contain and minimise the spread of COVID-19 infection in this region.",

During this time, most African countries were under the mandatory lockdown as implemented by their various governments. As it was not feasible to perform nationwide community-based sample survey during this period, the data were obtained electronically via survey monkey. A structured validated and pretested questionnaire was posted on social media platforms -Facebook and WhatsApp -to facilitate a better response. These platforms were chosen because they reflect the most commonly used social media platforms the locals in the participating countries engage with. Emails were also used. The questionnaire included a brief overview of the context, purpose, procedures, nature of participation, privacy and conidentiality statements and notes to be filled out. The respondents were African nationals from different Sub-Sahara African countries living in their countries of origin or overseas including Ghana, Cameroon (only distributed to the English-speaking regions), Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and other countries which are shown in the Supplementary Figure. To be eligible for participation, respondents had to be aged 18 years or older and be able to provide online consent.",

For example, there was a widespread reference to varying degrees of lockdown across SSA countries, such as 'total lockdown' and 'partial lockdown,' or 'tight lockdown' and 'loose lockdown.' Similar control measures were also important in successfully controlling SARS-CoV in 2003 and was substantially aided by important differences in the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV compared with SARS-CoV-2 13 . As there is currently no effective pharmacological interventions or vaccines available to treat or prevent COVID-19, nonpharmacological public health measures such as isolation, social distancing, and quarantine remain the only effective ways to respond to the outbreak 14 . To discuss measures of controlling spread it is worth noting an established mode of transmission for COVID-19, particularly human-to-human transmission. This kind of transmission has been recognised with the major mode of respiratory tract transmission via droplets and indirectly from fomites and to a lesser extent via aerosols 15 .",

A major component of the government efforts towards containing the spread is self-quarantine 16 , even though different studies have suggested that a major obstacle to compliance with household quarantine is concern over loss of income resulting from prolonged absence from work 17 . Around the world during the coronavirus outbreak, governments implemented economic relief plans to help the people [18] [19] [20] [21] , but this was not so in most SSA countries except for South Africa 18 . In Israel, compensation increased the compliance rate with self-quarantine from 57% to 94% demonstrating that providing people with assurances about their livelihoods during self-quarantine is an important component of compliance with public health regulations 19 . Since the unemployed did not show any association with compliance to other measures, it could mean that their motivation for isolation and quarantine were 'partial'. They probably were motivated by lack of jobs to take them out or the fact that there was no associated cost. With a current mobile phone penetration rate of 75% in SSA 22 , the use of novel mobile cash transfer options such as mobile money should be considered by SSA governments. This channel can reach the informal sector with cash sustenance packages during a lock down, so as to improve on qurantine and self isolation in future pandemics or epidemics.",

These findings could be attributed to the fact that that the messages, enforcement and the levels of compliance to public health measures mandated by government differ between those living in diaspora and people who lived in SSA and these would significantly affect the responses and attitudes of the participants in this study. In addition, their knowledge and exposure to matters related to COVID-19 in particular and pandemics in general will be different between Africans in diaspora and those who lived locally. Despite these differences, Africans still share similar characteristics and this was demonstrated by the loss of significant difference between the groups after adjusting for potential confounding factors.Our study also found that practice of hand washing and avoiding large gathering were optimal while over two-third of the participants wear face mask and about on-third complied with quaran-tine. These findings are similar to the study published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report presented data that showed that nearly two third of the people surveyed complied with the use of face masks, maintaining physical distancing (79.5%) and about 86% avoided gatherings of 10 or more 23 . However, more people reported practicing self-isolation in their study compared with our finding (77% versus 40%), which could be attributed to the relief measures/assistance from the US government which encouraged people to stay more at home compared to most African countries where little, or no help came from the governments.",

Moreover, the Central African region was an early epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, with Cameroon for example confirming its first case as early as 5th of March 2020 25 , thereby creating huge awareness and fear and thus encouraging early compliance with lockdown measures. In this study, females were more likely to comply with self-quarantine and isolation compared with males, which is similar to a recent study where females were more likely to take protective measures during the pandemic 23 . This finding may be related to the employment of more SSA women than males in the formal sector 26 and with the shut down of the formal sector during the lockdown, females likely stayed at home, thus reported self-isolation.",

This indicates that age is an important determinant of compliance with public health measures to control COVID-19. This study has some limitations. First, the survey was only administered online and therefore may not have captured the opinion of non-internet users in the rural areas where the reach of the internet remains low 22 . This may also have excluded respondents from the old-er people in SSA countries who are less likely to use the internet compared to younger ones 29 . Also, the survey was available only in English such that it may have been impossible for some citizens of francophone countries in the SSA to participate. Hence, the results may not generalize to all Sub-Saharan African populations. It is also possible that respondents from some SSA countries like Tanzania may have been affected by the lockdown as the citizens were refrained from giving out information regarding the pandemic, hence the wide variation in the response rate per region. We could not determine the response rate of this study due to the method of dissemination of the survey link (online platforms). Another limitation was the lack of incentives and therefore no assistance from online companies for distribution of the survey may have affected the reach to respondents. The strengths of this study include that, it is the first sub-regional analysis of African respondents with respect to the current COVID-19 pandemic and offers a unique perspective on the SSA countries' compliance with public health measures to contain and prevent the spread of the infection and thus provides a valuable contribution for future interventions across the region. Despite the limited participation of Africans that lived in dispaora, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the willingnss to comply with public health measures among Africans that lived locally and those in Diaspora during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
