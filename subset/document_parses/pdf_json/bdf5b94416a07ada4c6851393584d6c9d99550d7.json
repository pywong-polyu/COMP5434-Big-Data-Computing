The orthopaedic and trauma units have rescheduled their activities to help SARS-CoV-2 units, but trauma patients require also treatment, and no standardized protocols have been established. Methods A single-centre cross-sectional study was performed in a tertiary hospital. Two different periods of time were analyzed: a two week period of time in March 2019 (pre-SARS-CoV-2) and the same period in March 2020 (SARS-CoV-2 pandemic time). Outpatient's data, emergency activity, surgical procedures, and admissions were evaluated. Surgeons' and patient's opinion was also evaluated using a survey. Results A total of~16k (15,953) patients were evaluated. Scheduled clinical appointments decreased by~22%. Urgent consultations and discharge from clinics also descended (~37% and~20% respectively). Telemedicine was used in 90% of outpatient clinical evaluations. No elective surgical procedures during SARS-CoV-2 time were scheduled, and subtracting the effect of elective surgeries, there was a reduction of inpatient surgeries, from~85% to~59%. Patients delayed trauma assistance more than 48 hours in 13 cases (35%). Pre-operative admission for hip fractures decreased in ten hours on average. Finally, surveys stated that patients were more in favour than surgeons were to this new way to evaluate orthopaedic and trauma patients based strongly on telemedicine. Conclusion Detailed protocols should be standardized for surgical departments during the pandemic. This paper offers a general view in how this virus affects an orthopaedic unit and could serve as a protocol and example for orthopaedic and trauma units. Even in the worst scenario, an orthopaedic and trauma unit could offer an effective, efficient, and quality service.

The fact that Madrid has been one of the first big European cities hit by the pandemic has allowed us to share with the orthopedic community our experience in managing orthopaedic health care delivery in such difficult conditions. In this scenario, we have contributed supporting those medical units directly involved in the treatment of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, but we also continued providing healthcare to our patients. We have therefore applied a cross-sectional observational study, evaluating data from specific points in time, allowing us to compare our two very different scenarios, pre-SARS-CoV-2 vs SARS-CoV-2. Results from this type of studies are more generalizable to geographically defined populations, as in this case is redefining orthopaedic activity in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic time.

Only patients requiring urgent care, such as trauma, tumours, and infections have been scheduled as expected. Admissions were also affected, as procedures were performed on an outpatient basis whenever possible, but preoperative and overall average stay of those cases managed inpatient decreased dramatically. It is interesting to note that this finding was strongly influenced by management of hip fractures. Hip fracture is a common procedure that cannot be delayed and has an important influence on the average inhospital stay. Interestingly, average stay dropped sharply from seven days in the same period of March 2019 to less than two days during the pandemic. This reduction was mostly due to a sharp minimization of post-operative stay. Even in-hospital admission time for a hip fracture was in many cases less than 24 hours long. This represents a new scenario, as we do not know what will be the outcome of these fragile patients without post-operative orthogeriatric care. As for the long-term persistence of this shift from inpatient to outpatient treatments, it is hard to predict.

This critical SARS-CoV-2 period and a radical change in our daily practice could be the main reasons for these results. Results from our surgeons are quite rational, as the majority considered that telemedicine was very helpful in this special setting. However, they did not agree with the possibility of continuing this telemedicine system for patient consultation after the pandemic. This is probably due to the fact that the majority of telemedicine consultations corresponded to follow-up appointments of previously evaluated patients, but the system might have limitations for first clinical appointments. An interview differentiating first and follow-up appointments should be performed to clarify this point. The experience reported in this study provides a new insight in outpatient's clinics health care delivery and anticipate a new paradigm in the management of outpatient orthopedic clinics. With regard to patient satisfaction on the other hand, patient survey had better result with a mean of 8.3 points. Although we cannot rule out the potential bias in their answers given the critical situation of the lockdown, this score also proves that our patients are open minded in terms of adoption of new technologies for health care delivery in outpatient clinics. This study has several strengths. First of all, it compares the same time period of the year in two completely different situations (pre-SARS-CoV-2 vs SARS-CoV-2); it studies an important patient series, and it assesses objective and subjective information from surgeons and patients with encouraging results.
