However, the intensity of caregiving is generally higher in southern Europe than in northern Europe. Over 30% of informal care in Mediterranean countries (and 50% of that in Spain) is highintensity care, that is, the caregiver carries out more than 20 h per week of caregiving [2] . The requirement for greater dedication and availability can lead caregivers to often feel a loss of control over their time, and this can negatively affect different aspects of their life.",

The study population consisted of adults (\u226518 years) living in a family home who were providing informal (unpaid) care to a dependent person in the same or another home and who were registered as caregivers with the Primary Health Care District of Granada or enrolled in the social services dependency registry of the Provincial Council of Gipuzkoa created following the Spanish Dependency Law (DL) [27] . The DL, launched in 2007, gave rise to the current System of Autonomy and Care for Dependency, which is the set of services and benefits aimed at promoting personal autonomy, as well as the protection and care of people, through accredited public and private concerted services. These benefits are granted in all cases to the dependent person in all Spanish regions [28] .",

Additional predictors were place of residence, performance of ungratifying tasks, and perceived social support. HRQoL, health-related quality of life. * Statistically significant at 95%; ** statistically significant at 99%. Women were more likely than men to report that they were unable to perform paid work because of their caregiving responsibilities (OR: 3.61) and equally likely to mention difficulties meeting work schedules or financial difficulties (Table S2 , Supplementary Materials). The results for perceived work-related problems (caregivers < 65 years of age) and financial difficulties (all caregivers) are shown in Table 5 . Living in Granada as opposed to Gipuzkoa was associated with a greater likelihood of work or financial problems among both male and female caregivers. The odds of not being able to do paid work because of caregiving duties were high in Granada. Perceived care recipient health and household income were also identified as significant determinants of paid work or financial problems, although gender differences were observed in certain categories. Caregiver age was significant for women only. In the case of men, years spent providing care, level of education, and HRQoL were significant determinants of some of the problems analyzed. Women, but not men, who perceived strong support from their social networks were significantly more likely to report not being able to perform paid work because of caregiving.",

These two strengths of the analysis have allowed the results to be especially novel compared to what is already known in this field. The main finding of this study is that informal female caregivers in the north and south of Spain are more likely than their male counterparts to experience problems as a result of caregiving, particularly in the areas of health and work. This may partly be because women perceive the demands of caregiving more intensely than men [32, 33] . In fact, the literature has consistently shown that greater caregiving burden among women is associated with lower societal recognition of the value of their work and deep-seated gender norms that leave them with little freedom to make decisions on what their role should be [34] . These social expectations mean that women experience the pressure of caregiving more than men and this has a greater impact on their health and other aspects of their life [35] .",

Strong support from one's social networks was associated with a lower likelihood of problems in the three dimensions (health, work/finances, and social/family relationships) for men and in the health dimension for women. This is consistent with the literature, which has shown that social support is an important predictor of population health [36, 37] and can help alleviate stress or make problems seem smaller [38, 39] . A recent study found that women mainly received help from women with a similar profile, while men had broader, more diverse social networks and received more help from outside the family circle [40] . The means by which men and women sought specific help also varied. While women generally sought less help and relied more on support from family members than on formal support or paid help, men made greater use of formal services and shared their caregiving responsibilities with more people [30] . The lower levels of formal support received by women could be linked to the higher prevalence of health, professional, economic, and personal problems attributed to caregiving among female caregivers [41] .",

Caregivers in Granada were more likely than those from Gipuzkoa to have problems in all the dimensions studied. The differences were most pronounced in the work dimension and were particularly evident among male caregivers. One explanation could be the origin of the samples. In Gipuzkoa, the caregivers were identified through the social services registry of dependent persons of the Provincial Council. The registry was created under the Spanish DL, which established that dependent persons may benefit from various in-kind benefits and services, depending on their level of dependency and the availability of services from the competent institution. In Gipuzkoa, the dependents included in the registry received a cash-for-care allowance (PECF)-financial benefit for care in the family setting. In Granada, however, the caregivers were identified through health registries, meaning that the person they were caring for may or may not have been receiving this allowance. Financial support may have mitigated the negative effects of caregiving in the case of Gipuzkoa, as it has been shown that monetary interventions can have a moderating effect on caregiving burden [46] . Socioeconomic differences between the two regions and in the support systems in place may also have had an effect. Implementation of the DL varies considerably from one region to the next as it has been hampered by several challenges that emerged in the context of the recent economic crisis [28] . The PECF, for example, is received by 34% of dependent persons in Andalusia compared with 52% of those in the Basque Country [47] . The lower coverage rates in Andalusia could explain the higher prevalence of problems attributed to caregiving in Granada, as a combination of formal and informal care has been found to counteract some of the negative impacts of caregiving [48, 49] . The labor market is also different in the north and south of Spain. The unemployment rate in Granada (south Spain) in 2020 was 24%, for example, compared with 8% in Gipuzkoa (north Spain) [50] . In fact, greater difficulties finding and keeping a job in Granada could explain why male caregivers in this province perceived more work problems in relation to caregiving, particularly considering the dominant role that paid employment has traditionally played in the construction of male identity [51] . The above aspects highlight the complex relationships between care recipients, caregivers, and caregiving context. More studies are needed to analyze the macro and micro factors that influence caregiving.",

Nonetheless, this limitation was partly overcome by asking the caregivers about \"problems due to caregiving\". Second, our findings cannot be extrapolated to Spain as a whole, as we studied just two regions. One advantage of this approach, however, is that it adds a richness to our analysis as Granada and Gipuzkoa differ both socioeconomically and in terms of coverage of services for dependent people. One particular strength of our study is that we did not focus on specific diseases, as some recent studies have done [52] , but on care recipients with a wide range of needs. A high proportion of our study sample (78%) benefits from the PECF. This differentiates this sample from the general population of unpaid caregivers in Spain. In December 2020 there were 1,385,037 recognized dependents (valued by the system established by the Dependency Law), of which 83% receive some type of provision or service by the Law, and 33% receive the PECF [53] . This benefit has an average monthly amount of EUR 306 and, although the monetary value is clearly insufficient to offset the costs of care, it can help to alleviate some of its consequences on caregivers. We believe that studying the problems involved in caring for this specific group of caregivers can be a strength of the study and contribute new knowledge to the subject. Finally, we only analyzed registered caregivers. Nevertheless, we believe that people who are not registered probably dedicate less time to caregiving. The profile of caregiver in our study thus is that of a male or female caregiver providing long-term high-intensity care. Our findings could, therefore, be extrapolated to caregivers with a similar profile, whom we believe should be prioritized in support interventions.",

Policies and interventions to mitigate the negative impacts of informal caregiving should therefore incorporate differential strategies to meet the specific needs of male and female caregivers in different caregiving contexts.

In addition, a number of recent studies have shown that caregiving during the pandemic has increased the risk of exposure and infection among women [56, 57] . Similarly, the increase in in-home caregiving as a result of the pandemic could exacerbate the unequal distribution of gender roles, further aggravating health inequalities [58] . Although some countries have implemented specific measures to support informal caregivers during the pandemic [59] , more formal resources are needed, as are gender-based policies addressing the specific needs of men and women providing care [60] . Our study confirms that informal male and female caregivers have different profiles and needs, and as they experience problems differently, these differences need to be taken into account when designing policies and support interventions. The current social, economic, and health crisis has made even more evident the need to continue investigating inequalities in caregiving and to incorporate gender considerations into this research.",
