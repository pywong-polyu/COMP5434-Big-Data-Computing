            "text": "The results of this priority-setting exercise were used to inform NACI's prioritization guidance for COVID-19 vaccination. 5, 6 This priority-setting exercise established that there is general alignment in the values and preferences across stakeholder groups. Surveyed stakeholders generally considered the most important vaccination strategy to be that of protecting those who are most vulnerable to severe illness and death from COVID-19 during the period of initial vaccine scarcity. This was followed in importance by the strategies to protect health care capacity and to minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In this supply-constrained context, a vaccination strategy to protect critical infrastructure was considered the least important. The overall rankings in this expert survey mirrored those in surveys of the general public on the prioritization of pandemic vaccination strategies. Canada's COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO Canada) study is a longitudinal study that surveyed a representative sample of about 2000 Canadians from April through September 2020 in 8 waves. 10 When asked in Wave 7 (Aug. 13-17, 2020) which vaccination strategies they would prioritize if COVID-19 vaccine supply is limited, most respondents identified protecting those most vulnerable (51%) and protecting health care capacity (28%) as the most important strategies to determine which groups should receive the vaccine first when there is not enough vaccine for everyone when it first becomes available. 11 This was followed by minimizing transmission (15%) and protecting critical infrastructure (5%). In a 2011 study involving University of Alberta students and staff on the allocation of scarce resources during an influenza pandemic, the top choice for a priority access plan to the pandemic vaccine was to save the most lives. 12 The priority populations for early COVID-19 vaccination that were included in provincial and territorial programs beginning in December 2020 have been consistent with NACI's prioritization guidance, which was informed by this priority-setting exercise (NACI is an independent scientific advisory group to PHAC whose recommendations inform decision-making by provinces and territories, but jurisdictions have discretion on whether or not to accept NACI advice). NACI prioritized populations to protect those who are most vulnerable to severe illness and death and to protect health care capacity. This alignment with previous surveys as well as the field experience with the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in Canada lends confidence to the findings of the present study.",

Stakeholders were required to treat the vaccination strategies presented in the survey as distinct, when, in reality, these strategies are overlapping to some degree. For example, those working in long-term care facilities could be targeted under all 4 vaccination strategies that were presented for ranking. The hypothetical pandemic curve presented in the survey as a visual aid may have biased responses, as the second pandemic peak is lower than the first peak. However, the impact of this response bias may be minimal, as the rankings for scenarios 1 (pandemic in progress) and 2 (possible new wave) were similar. Furthermore, the 4 scenarios to describe the different phases of the epidemic curve were based primarily on our expert opinion.",

The convenience sample is also of limited size. This priority-setting exercise included \"key informant\" stakeholders who acted as a proxy for their organization or stakeholder group. Though respondents were encouraged to consult with others in their organizations, the survey responses may not be representative opinions of the respective organizations or groups. The survey questions presented broad concepts that were open to interpretation. Respondents likely made differing assumptions based on their values and preferences to provide rankings. The overall response rate for surveys included in the analysis is modest (48%) with the highest response rate among representatives of federal government departments (80%) and lowest among representatives of provincial and territorial governments (30%). Although there is risk for selection bias in the findings, a subgroup analysis found that the most important strategy across all stakeholder groups (i.e., to protect those who are most vulnerable) was consistent with the overall analysis.",
