            "text": "With the rapid development of science and technology, the problem of energy load monitoring and decomposition of electrical equipment has been receiving widespread attention from academia and industry. For the purpose of improving the performance of non-intrusive load decomposition, a non-intrusive load decomposition method based on a hybrid deep learning model is proposed. In this method, first of all, the data set is normalized and preprocessed. Secondly, a hybrid deep learning model integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) with long short-term memory network (LSTM) is constructed to fully excavate the spatial and temporal characteristics of load data. Finally, different evaluation indicators are used to analyze the mixture. The model is fully evaluated, and contrasted with the traditional single deep learning model. Experimental results on the open dataset UK-DALE show that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of the whole network system. In this paper, the proposed decomposition method is compared with the existing traditional deep learning load decomposition method. At the same time, compared with the obtained methods: spectral decomposition, EMS, LSTM-RNN, and other algorithms, the accuracy of load decomposition is significantly improved, and the test accuracy reaches 98%.",

Electricity, as the outstanding energy source, is the basic energy source for development, so reducing the consumption of electric energy significantly. The key to the development of an intelligent electricity strategy is to understand the energy consumption distribution and usage habits of electrical equipment of electricity users. To do this, the load must be flexible and the devices the home turns on at a given time should be determined in real-time, a process known as load monitoring [1] . In 1992, Hart proposed non-intrusive load decomposition (NILM) technology [1] , this is an economical and convenient method of monitoring.",

Reference [6] uses an artificial bee colony algorithm to estimate a single power load, which enhances the accuracy of load monitoring and is easy to implement in the existing smart meter technology without modifying the hardware. In reference [7] , a load identification method combining wavelet transform and decision tree is introduced, but this method lacks general applicability in the case of multiple loads. Reference [8] puts forward a method based on V-I trajectory. Different loads are distinguished by the shape and color of V-I trajectory, and knowledge between different fields is combined to enhance the uniqueness of load characteristics.",

            "text": "As an emerging machine learning techniques, deep learning has been successfully applied to sovle various engineering problems, such as line defect recognition [9] , power quality disturbance classification [10] [11] , power system short-term voltage stability assessment [12] and image classfication [13, 14] and wind power prediction [15] [16] . Compared with the V-I image features widely studied in reference [17] , the adaptive weighted recursive graph block is proposed to represent the electrical features in the NILM, which improved the generalization performance and guaranteed the uniqueness of appliance features. LSTM networks are widely used in time series analysis because of their ability to handle long-term dependencies [12] . For NILM problems, LSTM networks have a comparative advantage in detecting load data changes, which have been demonstrated in previous related studies [18] [19] [20] . Due to the powerful feature learning ability, convolutional neural network (CNN) has also been used in the NILM field. For example, reference [21] adopts the successful deep CNN and sets up a data enhancement technology to solve the second type of household appliances problem of NILM. References [22] - [24] propose more advanced deep learning modes to realize NILM, and these modes constitute the most advanced level in this research field. Compared with load decomposition research, reference [25] provides an electrical application on/off state analysis through deep learning, and has a good transfer learning effect. In addition to deep learning-based NILM methods, many researchers have focused on implementing NILM through shallow machine learning methods. Support vector machine (SVM) [26] , decision tree (DT) [1] , Moth-flame optimization algorithm [27] , Random Forest (RF) [28] and decision bagging tree classifier [29] have been used to solve event-based NILM. The hidden Markov model in reference [30] is used to change the problem into a coding and decoding problem, which can retain the dependency between loads and decompose multi-state loads, and the online load decomposition is realized, but the decomposition accuracy is low. Reference [31] improves the Hidden Markov Model and proposes a solution method of piecewise quadratic constrained programming, which can efficiently solve the model and cooperate with existing smart meters. Based on the framework of the additive factorial hidden Markov model, a combined algorithm of active and reactive power is proposed in reference [32] , and the superiority of the result is verified by comparison with the algorithm proposed in reference [1] .",

The advantage of this method is that it takes into account the characteristics of data feature extraction and is based on time series. The network structure is simple but powerful, and the recognition error under-sampling is reduced. In fact, most of this approach utilizes low-frequency data, so it is possible to implement the system using low-cost instrumentation to obtain aggregated load data. 2) In addition, we compare the proposed model with separate CNN and LSTM network models and use the three evaluation indicators of MCC, ACC, and F1-Score to comprehensively evaluate all models. At the same time, Gaussian noise with various signal-to-noise ratios is added to further test the robustness of the mixed model.",

In this respect, we can expand the training data set by generating more synthetic data. Non-intrusive load decomposition makes it possible to know the appliance-level user behavior and measure the demand response potentials of flexible loads, which is beneficial to develop an advanced optimal scheduling method for residential microgrids or community integrated energy systems by considering flexible demand response [53] [54] [55] . In addition, it would be interesting to develop multi-objective NILM via advanced multi-objective heuristic algorithms [56, 57] or design a NILM approach in a privacy-preserving manner by using federated learning [58] . Another interesting topic is to automatically determine the optimal hyperparameters of a deep learning-based NILM model by using automated machine learning [59, 60] .",

The signals at each moment are decomposed in isolation, and the operating status of each electrical appliance is processed separately. Making full use of time information, this article introduces long short-term memory (LSTM) network into the model. In addition, inspired by reference [36], the convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced in order to automatically extract load features and not lose lots of information in the process of dimensionality reduction. A reasonable construction model can enhance the accuracy of the decomposition. For the purpose of better enhance the effectiveness of the deep learning method in the field of non-intrusive load decomposition, the CNN-LSTM hybrid model is introduced into the load decomposition algorithm to realize the extraction of the spatial characteristics and temporal features of electrical power. The main contributions are highlighted as follows: 1) This paper proposes for the first time an evaluation framework combining CNN-LSTM hybrid model, making full use of the spatial features of convolutional neural network and the temporal features of longterm memory network, taking into account the characteristics of data feature extraction and based on time series. The network structure is simple but powerful, and the recognition error under-sampling is reduced.",
