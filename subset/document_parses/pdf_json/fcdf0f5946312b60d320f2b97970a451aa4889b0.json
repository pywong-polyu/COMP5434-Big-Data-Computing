The median (IQR) of age was 42 (27-58.5); 204/817 (25%) were female. Blunt trauma was the most common trauma mechanism (633/800; 79.1%), and patients were often victims of severe injuries (ISS, ). Although there were no differences in severity scores between HICs and LMICs, patients from LMICs were less likely to receive prehospital and admission CPR. Also, a significantly higher proportion of them arrived with a systolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg or less, and with tachycardia (Table 1) . Patients from HICs received significantly higher amounts of red blood cells and plasma and were more likely to undergo angioembolization for hemorrhage control (Table 1) . Table 2 presents REBOA procedure-related information and outcomes. REBOA practice patterns were significantly different between the groups. Patients from HICs got their REBOA inserted more often in the emergency room (n = 520/710, 73.2%); in contrast, a higher proportion of patients from LMICs underwent REBOA insertion in the operating room (n = 44/73, 60.2%) (p < 0.001). While femoral artery cannulation by a blind percutaneous approach was the preferred access technique in HICs (n = 370/721, 51.3%), surgical cutdown was more common in LIMCs (n = 43/73, 58.9%). Access guided by ultrasound was performed in 30.6% and 21.9% of patients from HICs and LMICs, respectively. Overall, the majority of the REBOAs were deployed by a trauma surgeon (547/727, 75.2%).

Although previous studies have shown that REBOA can have a significant effect on the outcomes mentioned above [1, 14] , the differences in pre-hospital medical services between LMICs and HICs offer a more plausible explanation for the results observed. The fact that patients from LMICs had worse outcomes in terms of organ failure may be due, in part, to the pervasive deficiencies in LMICs pre-hospital trauma care [15, 16] , which is often limited by inadequate flow of transportation and lack of protocols for field triage and standards of pre-hospital care. Indeed, patients from LMICs included in this study were less likely to receive pre-hospital and admission CPR. The latter situations could be translated into an inadequate pre-hospital resuscitation of trauma patients, which may result in a poor physiological status on admission and, thereby, a higher chance of organ failure during the hospital stay. On the other hand, although our finding on mortality is not surprising, it should be interpreted cautiously. The same deficiencies in LMICs pre-hospital care could have introduced significant survivorship bias, meaning that in LMICs, the patients with a higher chance of survival arrived in the emergency department and had the opportunity to get a REBOA.

While in LMICs, the insertion and deployment of REBOA occurred more frequently in the operating room and by surgical cutdown, in HICs, these procedures were performed more often in the emergency room and by blind percutaneous insertion. Previous studies have shown a higher incidence of groin access complications when REBOA is inserted by surgical cutdown [17] , and some authors recommend in favor of performing groin access in an operating room controlled setting [18] . Therefore, our findings are of concern because a lack of standardization of surgical procedures for REBOA insertion and deployment can jeopardize clinical outcomes and patient safety. We urge a shift in REBOA surgical practice toward ultrasound-guided access, with surgeons adopting a more cautious, safe, and systematic approach to REBOA insertion and deployment. To this end, trauma surgeons using this endovascular technology should follow published guidelines and recommendations [19, 20] ; however, they should be prepared to adapt these guidelines to make them appropriate for their local trauma-system reality and develop simple, scalable solutions to improve the delivery of REBOA, regardless of the income of their country of origin.",

Also, ultrasound was more frequently used during REBOA insertion in high-income countries, and the proportion of radiologists involved in REBOA use was higher in these countries. It can be inferred that the higher the income, the greater the capacity of the healthcare system to allocate resources to offer more advanced care with better technology.

To date, some guidelines have been published in well-recognized international journals [19] [20] [21] . Of note, however, these guidelines often lack the representation of physicians from LMICs in their list of authors, and only a few studies performed in LMICs are included in the references supporting the guidelines. These disparities raise concerns that the challenges and problems on trauma care and REBOA implementation inherent to LMICs could be inadequately addressed [4, 10] . Moreover, the lack of inclusion of stakeholders from LMICs into REBOA clinical guidelines may be of greater concern because most of the world's population lives in LMICs, where the burden of traumatic injuries is enormous, and outcomes are often poor [22] . Therefore, future international REBOA guidelines should aim to be more globally applicable, with dedicated recommendations for its use in LMICs.

This lack of data granularity could affect risk adjustment, even after using propensity score matching. Second, the lack of uniformity of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches between the reporting centers may have affected the outcomes observed, further comprising the validity of our results and the interpretations derived from them. Third, because we did not perform sample size calculations, this study may not have adequate power to detect the true effect of the countries' income on REBOA-treated patients.",
