            "text": "The web server, MDM-TASK-web, combines the MD-TASK and MODE-TASK software suites, which are aimed at the coarse-grained analysis of static and all-atom MD-simulated proteins, using a variety of non-conventional approaches, such as dynamic residue network analysis, perturbation-response scanning, dynamic cross-correlation, essential dynamics and normal mode analysis. Altogether, these tools allow for the exploration of protein dynamics at various levels of detail, spanning single residue perturbations and weighted contact network representations, to global residue centrality measurements and the investigation of global protein motion. Typically, following molecular dynamic simulations designed to investigate intrinsic and extrinsic protein perturbations (for instance induced by allosteric and orthosteric ligands, protein binding, temperature, pH and mutations), this selection of tools can be used to further describe protein dynamics. This may lead to the discovery of key residues involved in biological processes, such as drug resistance. The server simplifies the set-up required for running these tools and visualizing their results. Several scripts from the tool suites were updated and new ones were also added and integrated with 2D/3D visualization via the web interface. An embedded work-flow, integrated documentation and visualization tools shorten the number of steps to follow, starting from calculations to result visualization. The Django-powered web server (available at https://mdmtaskweb.rubi.ru. ac.za/) is compatible with all major web browsers. All scripts implemented in the web platform are freely available at https://github.com/RUBi-ZA/MD-TASK/tree/mdm-task-web and https://github.com/RUBi-ZA/ MODE-TASK/tree/mdm-task-web.",

Due to the large number of internal degrees of freedom and the complex set of atomic interactions found within proteins, investigating the effect of local differences within them using conventional metrics such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) or the radius of gyration (Rg) may be limiting. Alternative analysis approaches may provide deeper insights.",

            "text": "Network analysis has the ability to abstract out such complexity while maintaining the inter-residue relationships. The term ''centrality\" is used as a measure of how central a residue is in the protein network, and several centrality metrics derived from the social sciences [1] may be applied to investigate protein dynamics. Many research groups have applied residue interaction network analysis on static structures, and have used multiple strategies and tools for summarizing protein interactions using various edge and node modeling approaches [2] [3] [4] [5] to minimize bias and maintain enough variance for determining topological changes in a protein. We previously proposed a post-hoc analysis approach of MD simulations using dynamic residue network (DRN) analysis to probe the impact of mutations [6, 7] and allosteric effects [8] , before setting up the MD-TASK tool suite [9] in 2017. The tool introduced the concept of averaging residue network metrics over MD simulations, as an alternative to examining static networks, to consider the dynamic nature of functional proteins. This decision was made after observing that energy minimization criteria (such as the number of steps and the minimum gradient) influenced network centrality in such a way that related samples aggregated mainly according to minimization criteria. Nevertheless, these residue interaction networks are a faster way of estimating centrality as they utilize single conformations. Besides DRN, the MD-TASK tool suit also includes dynamic cross-correlation (DCC) and perturbation response scanning (PRS) techniques. Both of these techniques provide residue level analysis with different perspectives and none of them are found in commonly used MD packages. Some examples of their usage are given in the Results and Discussion section.",

Although both software suites are relatively easy to use, the required technical knowledge and software dependencies may act as a hurdle against more widespread usage of the tools and techniques, due to the diversity of operating systems and the relatively fast-evolving Python libraries. We aimed to bridge this gap by providing access to both tools while introducing new functionalities in MDM-TASK-web. It has been designed with a simple and intuitive interface that is supported by any recent web browser. The need for additional software, complex dependencies and command line expertise is greatly reduced. MDM-TASK-web includes new features such as additional network centrality metrics for both DRN and Residue Interaction Network (RIN) centrality calculations from single structures, a communication propensity (CP) tool [26, 31] , an aggregator of weighted residue contact maps, comparative ED, an ANM workflow, NMA from MD and integrated 2D/3D visualization.

There are a number of other tools and web servers aimed at facilitating structural analysis and offering features that are additional to, or variations of currently described methods. Some examples are ENCoM [32] , DynaMut2 [33] , LARMD [34] , NAPS [2] , ANCA [3] , RIP-MD [4] and MDN [5] . Yet, MDM-TASK-web which uses and builds on top of algorithms previously described in MD-TASK and MODE-TASK, has many unique features compared to other web servers. These features are detailed in the rest of the article. We also provide a comparative table for some of these web servers and tools, in Section 4. Very briefly, ENCoM factors in amino acid variation in coarsegrained NMA. DynaMut2 integrates graph-based signatures and NMA to predict stabilizing and destabilizing mutations using random forest regression. LARMD is designed to run and analyze up to 4 ns (conventional and steered) MD simulations by running standard protocols mostly aimed at analyzing ligand binding and unbinding. In addition to calculating NMA from static structures, it also calculates PCA, performs community analysis from protein contact networks, MM-PBSA and dynamic cross correlation (DCC) calculations from these simulations. We note that LARMD is based on algorithms described in Bio3D [35] , MDTraj [36] , CAVER3.0 [37] , and tools from the AMBER16 suite. We further provide a comparative table for some of these web servers and tools, in Section 4.",

The workflow used by MDM-TASK-web is shown in Fig. 1 . Compared to servers such as LARMD, CABS-flex [42] and MDWeb [43] , which can be used to both run and analyze MD simulations, no molecular simulation is performed in MDM-TASK-web. Depending on the tool, user inputs mainly consist of a previously simulated protein MD trajectory file and its matching topology, or simply of the PDB file for a single structure. All of the tools perform computations on coarsegrained protein residues, whereby the protein is either entirely composed of alpha carbon atoms (C a ), or alternatively of beta carbon (C b ) and glycine C a atoms. The user should ensure that periodic boundary condition (PBC) corrections have been done prior to using the tools, as these will negatively impact the calculationsthe embedded 3D visualizer may provide assistance in this case, and obvious cases of broken molecules will distort the cartoon representation of the protein.",

This use of a work-flow for this tool was chosen due to the need to repeat the model construction step when the cut-off value is inadequate or if the coarse-graining level is too high. A common indication of this is the lack of the leading zero-valued eigenvalues for the first six trivial modes. Arrows are colored by chain. Mean square fluctuations from all modes and from the first 20 nontrivial modes are separately displayed. NMA can now be computed from MD simulations as well, to represent the first dominant motion. For this calculation, the transpose of the reshaped Cartesian coordinate tensor is mean centered and dotted with its transpose to obtain the covariance matrix of dimension 3 N \u00c2 3 N (where N is the number of residues). This matrix is then diagonalised by eigen decomposition to retrieve the principal components [55] , in descending order of eigenvalue. The percentage of explained variance is then displayed for the first 50 modes, together with the 3D mapping of the NMA using the protein topology file. A multi-PDB file is also produced to show the mode animation. Two parameters (the ignc and ignn parameters) control the number of C-and N-terminus residues to ignore from the structural alignment and the covariance matrix. These were included as a means to decrease possible technical variation from the termini. In our experience with protein MD simulations, we have often observed relatively high levels of fluctuation at the Cterminus.",

Comparative ED features automated conformation extraction from lowest energy basins and applies k-means to sample centroid conformations from the first 2 principal components in standard PCA. N-and C-terminal residues may be deselected before the structural alignment step to reduce unwanted noise and improve performance. Residue selection is also enabled, and is applied post global fitting of the C a atoms. This is to be used only for residue and chain selections. When more than two samples are to be compared, the standalone script is recommended for processing all samples at once (and not as multiple paired runs), and one should also consider the percentage of explained variance captured by the principal axes.

Consequently, this metric is pointing to a known critical part of the HIV protease (the catalytic residues), which relies on the stability of other nearby residues, possibly for maintained function. High connectivity (degree) nodes also tend to have a high eigencentrality, especially when surrounded by other high connectivity nodes, due to their dependence on residue neighborhood. For more experienced users using PyMOL [64] for example, it is straightforward to use the PDBx/mmCIF-formatted files to visualize and compare related metrics for multiple related proteins using the ''spectrum\" command (with the B-factor values) combined with the ''set grid_mode\" command. Furthermore, the computed centrality metrics are all saved as a CSV file, which can be used for customized analyses by the users. For instance, one may use the data for plotting the overall centrality density distribution of a protein. It is also possible to calculate median residue centrality instead of the average, which if significantly different from the default DRN metric type may indicate the presence of skewed or multi-modal centrality distributions among the residues. In such cases, the median option could be a more robust estimate of the DRN centrality.",

For instance, by visualizing the antiparallel regions of high crosscorrelation (across the main diagonal), we find (1) residues 10-24, which form a beta hairpin known as the fulcrum; (2) residues 55-75, in which two beta hairpins (the flap and the cantilever) are connected by a common beta strand; (3) residues 45-55, which form the tip of the flap from a beta hairpin that controls substrate and inhibitor access to the catalytic site; (4) residues 95-105, which partly consist of a beta strand that composes the dimerization region.

By default, mode 7 (1st non-trivial) is displayed, as shown in Fig. 7 (A) , but other modes can also viewed by cycling through. From the ANM, we observe rotational motions within the enterovirus 71 capsid pentamer. Fig. 4 . Estimating contact frequencies around a single residue in a single and in multiple protein structures, using HIV protease mutants as example. The locus of interest is displayed at the center in panel (A), and is surrounded by its neighbouring residues. Additionally, the edge thicknesses and labels depict the residue contact frequencies obtained from the MD simulations. In both panels, residues are depicted by the three-letter residue code followed by the residue position, a dot and the chain label. In panel (B), multiple related contacts (gathered from the contact mapping tool) are stacked on top of each other along the y-axis, with their neighbours spanning the x-axis. NMA was then computed from the MD trajectory of an HIV protease mutant (Fig. 7 (B) ). The decomposition differs from that used in essential dynamics in the definition of the variables. While MD frames are the variables in ED, protein residues are chosen as variables in NMA. From the first dominant motion, we observe a relatively higher amount of motion coming from the outer lateral portion of the fulcrum of the protease; internal motions are significantly smaller, with the flaps traveling only slightly more. The relative extents of motion within each chain also reveal a degree of chain asymmetry within the homodimer. While the back-end script can represent all modes, only one mode is represented in the web server at the moment -others may be shown in a future update. The dominant mode has indeed summarized an important aspect of the protease's functional mechanics -a rotational motion of each monomer, that has been shown to be associated with the deformation and expansion of the active site [65, 66] . A similar strategy in other unknown proteins may lead to significant insights, especially for the design of inhibitors and modulators, and more generally for understanding protein motion.",

In addition to uploading the trajectories and topologies to the web server, substrate binding residues were selected (as an example) using the MDTraj syntax ''residue 24 25 26 41 49) or (residue 140 to 145) or (residue 163 to 168) or (residue 188 to 192)\" including the quote characters. These substrate binding residues were selected from the 1.94 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure (PDB ID: 7MGR [68] ) using any residue found at less than 4 \u00c5 from its bound non-structural protein substrate, using the PyMOL software. The expected number of k-means clusters was set to 3, but is not useful in this case as there is clearly one density maximum in each simulation. A very important criterion for the success and accuracy of this method lies in the correctness of structural alignment, the specification of regions of interest and the choice of equilibrated parts of trajectories. Together these decrease unwanted sources of variation, to focus on what best describes a biological event. As protomer B had displayed the non-canonical PHE140 pose, only this protomer and protomer B from the reference were prepared to be uploaded. The last 10 ns of simulation were selected in each case, using every fifth frame -due to the design implementation, the trajectories need to have the same number of frames. The ignn and ignc parameters were set to their default values of 0 and 3, respectively, to ignore three C-terminal residues, in each chain from the alignment stage onward. One can verify the number of terminal residues to ignore by independently calculating residue root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) plots -this trimming is applied to each chain. By default, the highest probability density conformations (the blue markers) are extracted from the centroids of the highest contour level using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (where k = 1) for the points within that level, while the k-means algorithm is independently used to estimate single conformations from k possible probability density maxima, as specified from the number of clusters. In the example, conformations with the highest probability densities were observed at time t = 97560 ps and t = 98350 ps, respectively for the reference protein (Fig. 8(A) ) and that from SARS-CoV-2 isolate EPI_ISL_420610 (Fig. 8(B) ). The kmeans prediction can be helpful as a rough estimate, when other local maxima are present and are not picked up from the maximum KDE peaks. While this algorithm is partly stochastic, this effect is mitigated by being internally parameterized with a large number of iterations (1000) and by multiple initializations (50) with different seeds.",

While the calculation of a single covariance matrix has higher physical memory footprint, it adequately represents the total variability shared across the trajectories, thus yielding a common set of eigenvector/eigenvalue pairs that explain the total variance. By optimizing for several of the discussed factors, a total explained variance of about 78.5% was obtained from the first 2 principal components prepared from the M pro substrate binding residues of the two M pro proteins, even though such performances may be influenced by the number of selected residues and protein flexibility. From the separate contours in the shared axes, as showed in Fig. 8(A) and 8(B) , we clearly observe that the substrate binding residue dynamics were very different. In Fig. 8(C) , which was obtained by aligning (using PyMOL) the resulting single conformations from each protease, we can see that additional conformational details associated with the non-canonical PHE140 pose were detected, with several distortions from the reference protease around the binding site. Using this tool, one can rapidly obtain equilibrium conformations from various experimental conditions, from which the user may then choose to visualize or to perform other analyses, such as those that use single conformations -for instance in centrality calculations using RIN, in ANM or as a target conformation in PRS.",

Applying the residue perturbation algorithm with this experimental set-up one seeks for possible trigger residues that are associated with a known conformational change of the protease flaps, proceeding from a closed to an opened state. The correlations are mapped on the starting topology, as shown in Fig. 9 , and are also written to a text file. From Fig. 9 , it can be seen that residues (in reddish color) from or in connection to the HIV protease flap region can be perturbed in order to make a transition from a closed to an opened conformation, seemingly with monomer asymmetry. This flap-opening movement has implications in the acceptance or release of its substrate, and similarly for inhibitors designed against it. It is known that the flaps of the protease open to accept or release its inhibitors [73] , and that DRMs can reduce dimer stability and also lead to the release of a bound inhibitor [74] . Therefore, it can be insightful to study the propensity of certain mutations to lead to certain known states.",

It can be seen that the required time of computation of the centrality metrics (especially for averaged BC, CC, L and ECC metrics) escalates quickly (Fig. 10) , ranging from minutes for 99 residues, to a few hours in the case of 1011 residues. This is mainly due to the fact that the number of potential paths to be traversed increases significantly when the number of nodes (residues) in the network graphs increases. In all cases, 101 frames were sampled from 5001 frames by specifying a step size of 50. Alternatively, the same metric can be measured from a single protein structure for a fraction of the time, but at the expense of sampling depth, using the residue interaction network option. The speed of DRN computation will be improved in a future version of the tool. The robustness of the each DRN metric was evaluated by varying the contact cut-off radius (at 6, 6.7 and 7 \u00c5) in triplicate MD simulations, as shown in Fig. 11 . We observe that the values can be influenced by its choice, however we show that centrality distributions obtained at the default value of 6.7 are very similar to those obtained at 7 \u00c5, but experience a shift at 6 \u00c5. Further, in our previ-ous publication, we evaluated averaged BC values at three cut-off distances (6.7, 9 and 12 \u00c5), and observed a change in the usage frequency for the peak BC residues by changing the cut-off, which had no observable trend, even though small values reduced the effect of flexible residues [24] . We therefore recommend a value of 6.7 \u00c5, and reiterate the observations obtained by an earlier study [51] , and which has been applied in numerous cases that used the MD-TASK software, even though values spanning 6.5-7.5 \u00c5 are also common in other studies. The reproducibility of the averaged centrality metrics is also shown in Fig. 11 , using identical colors for each of the triplicate samples evaluated at each cut-off radius.",

By providing access to these tools in this manner also makes it available to more researchers studying proteins dynamics, without spending too much time and resources on setting up specialized hardware and software environments. The possibility of coarse-graining facilitates data transfer over the web, and tremendously reduces 11 . Reproducibility of the MDM-TASK-web DRN metrics. Probability density plots for each of the averaged network centrality metrics were evaluated from triplicate MD simulations of dimeric HIV protease, using varying residue contact cut-off radii (r c = 6, 6.7 and 7 Angstroms). Each metric is labeled along the x-axis in each of the panels (A) to (H). A cut-off value of 6 Angstroms tends to produce more divergent results. the data storage footprint required for the calculations, making the it more likely to be accessible for further analysis without requiring significant additional storage hardware. The novel algorithms and updates to both MD-TASK and MODE-TASK enhance the capacities of each of the tool suites. ",

The flap residue 54 (numbered 153 in chain B) is circled and highlighted in the top panels, showing the decreased averaged BC in the DRV-susceptible mutant, where the residue had mutated.
