            "text": "The UK's COVID-19 epidemic during early 2020 was one of world's largest and unusually well represented by virus genomic sampling. Here we reveal the fine-scale genetic lineage structure of this epidemic through analysis of 50,887 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, including 26,181 from the UK sampled throughout the country's first wave of infection. Using large-scale phylogenetic analyses, combined with epidemiological and travel data, we quantify the size, spatio-temporal origins and persistence of genetically-distinct UK transmission lineages. Rapid fluctuations in virus importation rates resulted in >1000 lineages; those introduced prior to national lockdown were larger and more dispersed. Lineage importation and regional lineage diversity declined after lockdown, whilst lineage elimination was size-dependent. We discuss the implications of our genetic perspective on transmission dynamics for COVID-19 epidemiology and control.",

Whilst individual-level contact tracing investigations can reconstruct the structure of small-scale transmission clusters (e.g. 1-3) they cannot be extended practically to large national epidemics. However, recent studies of Ebola, Zika, influenza and other viruses have demonstrated that virus emergence and spread can be instead tracked using large-scale pathogen genome sequencing (e.g. [4] [5] [6] [7] . Such studies show that regional epidemics can be highly dynamic at the genetic level, with recurrent importation and extinction of transmission chains within a given location. In addition to measuring genetic diversity, understanding pathogen lineage dynamics can help target interventions effectively (e.g. 8, 9) , track variants with potentially different phenotypes (e.g. 10, 11) , and improve the interpretation of incidence data (e.g. 12, 13) .",

Further, larger lineages were observed in more locations; every 100 additional genomes in a lineage increases its observed range by [6] [7] Pearson's r=0.8, . Thus, bigger regional epidemics comprised a greater diversity of transmission lineages, and larger lineages were more geographically widespread. These observations indicate substantial dissemination of a subset of lineages across the UK and suggest many regions experienced a series of introductions of new lineages from elsewhere, potentially hindering the impact of local interventions.",

First, we estimated the TMRCA (time to the most recent common ancestor) of each UK transmission lineage. The TMRCAs of most UK lineages are dated to March and early April (median=21 st March; IQR=14 th -29 th March).

To infer the latter, and quantify the delay between importation and onward within-UK transmission, we generated daily estimates of the number of travellers arriving in the UK and of global SARS-CoV-2 infections (see Methods) worldwide. Before March, the UK received ~1.75m inbound travellers per week (school holidays explain the end-February ~10% increase; Fig. 3B ). International arrivals fell by ~95% during March and this reduction was maintained through April. Elsewhere, estimated numbers of infectious cases peaked in late March (Fig. 3B ). We combined these two trends to generate an estimated importation intensity (EII) -a daily empirical measure of the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 importation into the UK. The EII peaks in mid-March, when high UK inbound travel volumes coincided with growing numbers of infectious cases elsewhere (Fig. 3B, C) .",

The difference between the two represents the \"importation lag\", the time elapsed between lineage importation and the first detected local transmission event (Fig. S2) . Using a statistical model, we estimate importation lag to be on average ) across all transmission lineages. Further, importation lag is strongly sizedependent; average lag is ~10 days for lineages comprising \u226410 genomes and <1 day for lineages of >100 genomes (Table S2 ). This size-dependency likely arises because the earliest transmission event in a lineage is more likely to be captured if it contains many genomes (Fig. S2; see Methods) . We use this model to impute an importation date for each UK transmission lineage (Fig. 3D) . Importation was unexpectedly dynamic, rising and falling substantially over only 4 weeks, hence 80% of importations (that gave rise to detectable UK transmission lineages) occurred between 27 February and 30 March. The delay between the inferred date of importation and the first genomic detection of each lineage was 14.13 \u00b1 5.61 days on average (IQR=10-18) and declined through time (Table S2, S3) .",

The relative contributions of importation and local transmission to initial epidemic dynamics under such circumstances warrants further investigation. We expect similar trends occurred in other countries with comparably large epidemics and high international travel volumes; virus genomic studies from regions with smaller or controlled COVID-19 epidemics have reported high importation rates followed by more transient lineage persistence (e.g. [27] [28] [29] .",

The high heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the individual level (33-35) appears to extend to whole transmission lineages, such that >75% of sampled viruses belong to the top 20% of lineages ranked by size. Whilst the national lockdown coincided with limited importation and reduced regional lineage diversity, its impact on lineage extinction was size-dependent ( Fig. 1E , F). The over-dispersed nature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission likely exacerbated this effect (36), thereby favouring, as Rt declined, greater survival of larger widespread lineages and faster local elimination of lineages in low prevalence regions. The degree to which the surviving lineages contributed to the UK's ongoing second epidemic is currently under investigation. The transmission structure and dynamics measured here provide a new context in which future public health actions at regional, national, and international scales should be planned and evaluated. 20.

Insertions relative to the reference were discarded and site 11,083 (site position relative to MN908947), which is globally homoplasic, was also masked.

The full dataset was subsampled as evenly as possible across epi-weeks and countries with a slight enrichment for samples immediately descended from five large polytomies in the global phylogeny. For each of these nodes, we always included the five oldest genomes, the most recent genome sequence and five other immediate descendants that were randomly chosen. The remaining genomes were sampled by allocating an even number of sequences per epi-week while maintaining a dataset size of <1,000 genomes. For each epi-week, genomes were sampled evenly by country until either its allocation was exhausted or there were no remaining genomes available. This subsampled dataset was analysed in BEAST 1.10 (42) using a GTR+G+F substitution model, with a strict molecular clock model using a non-informative continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) prior (43) and a Skygrid coalescent tree prior (44) with 40 grid points, roughly corresponding to weeks between 1 October 2019 and 2 July 2020. In the analysis, monophyly constraints were used to ensure that the clades corresponding to the large-scale phylogenetic trees identified in the previous step were monophyletic. We combined four independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains that were each run for 40 million steps, discarding the first 4 million steps of each chain as burn-in and resampling states every 4000 steps. Convergence was assessed using Tracer (45).",

This model takes the place of the nucleotide substitution model in a traditional Bayesian molecular clock dating analysis. Briefly, each branch of a maximum-likelihood tree is first scaled to represent the number of substitutions that occurred along that branch. Polytomies are resolved by inserting branches of length 0 substitutions. The likelihood of a branch bi of length si substitutions is defined by a Poisson distribution with mean tim where ti is the length of the branch in years and m is the clock rate. The log-likelihood of the whole tree is then the sum of the log-likelihoods of each branch, which represents a fixed, strict-clock model and follows a commonly implemented approach for scaling phylogenies into time-calibrated trees (e.g. 46-48).",

The first 10% of each run was discarded as burn-in, resulting in 2000 trees with estimates of the ancestral location for each internal node.

The low sampling fraction means that some singletons detected in our dataset likely belong to observed and unobserved UK transmission lineages. Nonetheless, the true number of singletons (importations not resulting in onward transmission) is likely to be significantly more than our estimate, because their small size makes them difficult to detect with a low sampling fraction. Finally, under-sampling of genomes from other countries could result in mistaken aggregation of separate importations, reducing the number of detected lineages. This mistaken aggregation will result in larger, older lineages being estimated. This was the motivation for placing an age limit on UK nodes in the tree. We chose 23 January 2020 as the oldest possible date for a transmission event in the UK as this represents the date that the first patient who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the UK entered the country (53) (tested positive on 30 January 2020). Although older importations into the UK could in theory be possible, if they had resulted in large autochthonous outbreaks, we would have observed this in both epidemiological and genomic data.",

This result is expected, since multiple location state changes along long branches contribute to the total number of state transitions, but do not add to the total number of UK transmission lineages or singletons. The largest number of location state transitions occur on the B.1.1 phylogeny, with the fewest occurring on lineage A, which are the largest and smallest of the subtrees, respectively. Proportional to the number of tips, fewer state changes are inferred on the two B.1 phylogenies than other subtrees, while the number of UK to non-UK transitions on the B phylogeny exceeds that inferred on other lineages.

            "text": "Travel and mobility data To investigate temporal trends in SARS-CoV-2 importation intensity we sought information on the number of travellers entering the UK from each other country for the period from 1 January to 30 April 2020. Incoming travellers comprised both British nationals and resident and visiting citizens of other countries. Estimates were obtained by combining multiple data sources. First, the UK Home Office has provided statistics that describe the number of inbound travellers arriving in the UK by air on each day during this period (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/887655/statisticsrelating-to-covid-19-and-the-immigration-system-tables-may-2020-arrivals.ods). This data set provides the daily number of incoming air passengers but not their source country. Second, we obtained the number of tickets sold for inbound flight journeys to the UK along with their origin location from the IATA (for passengers that transfer, the source location is the country from where the whole journey started). We used these numbers to calculate the percentage of arrivals from each country on a monthly basis from January to April 2020. We multiplied the monthly distribution of source destination by the total number of air passenger arrivals in the UK each day to estimate the number of arrivals from each country. Third, we augmented the above air passenger numbers with estimated numbers of incoming travellers arriving per day by short-sea ferry and through the Channel Tunnel (French: Le tunnel sous la Manche). Numbers of short-sea ferry passengers from France, Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland were estimated from monthly statistics obtained from the UK Department of Transport (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/908445/spas0107 .ods). Within that data set, values are provided for the Republic of Ireland and for \"Other EU countries\". The latter total was broken down by country using data from 2019 showing that 72.7% of UK short-sea journeys are with France, 13.6% with the Republic of Ireland, 10.4% with the Netherlands, and 3.3% with other countries (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/sea-passenger-statistics-2019-short-sea-routes). Eurotunnel Shuttle vehicle movements from France were obtained from publicly available monthly records (https://www.eurotunnelfreight.com/uk/2020/02/shuttle-traffic-for-january-2020). In the absence of other information we assumed (i) inbound and outbound vehicle movements via the Eurotunnel Shuttle services were equally frequent and (ii) one passenger per truck and 1.5 passengers per passenger vehicle. Inbound Eurostar rail passenger numbers from France and Belgium were estimated from available data and adjusted as far as possible for post-pandemic reduction in travel. Specifically, ~2m passengers travelled by Eurostar in the first quarter of 2020 (https://www.breakingtravelnews.com/news/article/eurostar-passenger-count-slips-by-a-fifth-in-early-2020). Monthly Eurostar passenger numbers were then calculated by assuming (i) inbound and outbound journeys were equally frequent, (ii) two thirds of inbound Eurostar journeys originated in France and one third in Belgium, in approximate proportion to the ratio of services, and (iii) the proportional decrease in Eurostar travel volumes during March and April 2020 was equal to that observed for vehicle movements via the Eurotunnel Shuttle. Our estimates do not incorporate estimates of movements across the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. This .

We conservatively assumed that symptomatic individuals cannot initiate a transmission chain in the UK, either through being prevented from travelling or perfect isolation on arrival. Thus, our estimates of daily SARS-CoV-2 prevalence includes only pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Asymptomatic individuals are counted among the PITL as those capable of initiating a transmission lineage at any time while they are still infectious.

Estimates of the latent period (infection to becoming infectious), incubation period (infection to onset of symptoms), the infectious duration, and the time between symptom onset and death (in fatal cases) were used to estimate the number of infected individuals who would go on to die from COVID-19, in each stage of the disease, on each day (Fig. S16) .

Specifically, we assumed that the time from acquiring an infection to becoming infectious is 3 days (56) and the time to symptom onset 5 days (2 days after becoming infectious) (57) . The infectious period for patients who recover from the disease was assumed to end 5 days after symptom onset (56) while those who die from the disease are assumed to do so 18 days after the onset of symptoms (58) . Given the large numbers of deaths we expect that variation in these timings among individuals will be averaged out and is not considered. We further assumed an asymptomatic proportion of 31% (59) and an IFR of 1%, which is broadly consistent with those found in the literature for China, France, and passengers aboard the Diamond Princess (58, 60, 61) . These values correspond to our study period, the spring epidemic of COVID-19; more recent estimates of IFR may vary due to changing treatment regimes and other factors. To examine the sensitivity of our results to the asymptomatic proportion we re-ran our analysis with proportions of 0.18 and 0.78 (the range of published estimates; 62, 63) , and found that our results were robust over this range (data not shown). As our main results are fully determined by temporal trends in EII and not absolute numbers, they are invariant to the value of the IFR and we did not perform a sensitivity analysis on it.

It is likely that the TMRCA of a small transmission lineage is more recent than the first transmission event after the importation and this issue is potentially further exacerbated by non-random sampling of genome sequences from patients in the lineage (64) . We therefore expect shorter lag times for bigger transmission lineages. To account for this sizedependence, we model the average importation lag as a function of lineage size. The functional form of this is given by the equation \u03b1 + \u03b2 / n, where \u03b1 corresponds to the minimal average lag time expected under complete sampling of the lineage and \u03b2 accounts for the increase in lag time as a smaller proportion of sequences are included in the lineage.",

The number of COVID-19 cases in the UK was available via the government website (Coronavirus cases in the UK at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public). Travel advice was also echoed by various news outlets and other information platforms, such as the Public Health Scotland/NHS Scotland Fit for Travel website (https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/). We collected this information by mining archived FCO sites, manually retrieving HTML files corresponding to updates to the URLs provided above and available at the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/). Files were obtained and examined for all dates when changes to the URL were published (18 updates were published in total between 4 February and 23 May 2020). Furthermore, we compared this advice with the Fit for Travel online resource, collected through a similar approach. Where information was insufficient or unclear, we complemented it with data from news outlets to clarify travel advice, which was the case before February 4, when there was no official travel advice (only notifications for novel coronavirus). We collated all the travel advice information into a single standardised table containing types of advice, dates of implementation and countries or geographic regions covered by the advice. The types of advice included both suggestions against specific types of travel versus all but non-essential travel and the recommended period of self-isolation upon return from specific destinations. All of the changes in travel advice were between February 6 and March 23, when specific self-isolation recommendations applied to the general population and not just returning travellers. A summary of the main changes in the UK travel advice across time (in particular, dates when advice for new countries were issued) is presented in Table S5 .",
