Almost every part of the world from which the victim of COVID 19 are, have not yet been able to find out a strong way to combat corona virus. Therefore, the main aim is to minimize the spreading of the COVID-19 by detecting most of the affected people during lockdown. Hence, it is necessary to understand what the nature of growth is of spreading of this corona virus with time after almost one month (30 days) of lockdown. In this paper we have developed a very simple mathematical model to describe the growth of spreading of corona virus in human being. This model is based on realistic fact and the statistics we have so far. For controlling the spread of the COVID-19, minimization of the growth with minimum number of days of lockdown is necessary. We have established a relation between the long-term recovery coefficient and the long-term infected coefficient. The growth can be minimized if such condition satisfies. We have also discussed how the different age of the people can be cured by applying different types of medicine. We have presented the data of new cases, recovery and deaths per day to visualize the different coefficient for India and establish our theory. We have also explained how the medicine could be effective to sustain and improve such condition for country having large population like India.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The declaration of pandemic situation due to COVID 19 on 11 th March by WHO [1] has made almost all the world to lockdown several countries, either partially or fully to control the spreading the virus. The invisible manifestation o f a respiratory infection with symptoms ranging from mild common cold to a severe viral pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress, is potentially fatal for the people having COPD and other lung deceases. The outbreak of such virus was earlier predicted in China [2] . The present time motivation is to find out as much possible number of such infected cases to slow down the contamination chain of the virus. Hence more and more testing were done during the lockdown period to identify the victims of COVID 19. At the same time, it is also an important that we can identify the maximum number of cases with minimum lockdown days, since the lockdown hampers the economical growth. There are lots of societal impact of lockdown which has already been reported [3] . Hence the question is how to minimize the spreading of CoVID-19? Scientists are trying to develop many statistical and mathematical model [4] [5] . Recently a few mathematical models have come across to describe this spread of corona virus to estimate the minimum number of lockdown days to reach base line of the contamination [6] [7] [8] [9] . Almost every natural phenomenon follows an exponential law and hence to saturate the graph we must maintain a long lockdown period.

Now currently we introduce a new concept. We know that the growth of natural phenomena increases exponentially with time. Let us assume that the growth of daily reported case, recovered people increases cubic polynomial of time, whereas the number of people who died varies with linear in time (since the mortality rate in India is very less compared to the other countries).

These assumptions are based on completely realistic point of view. The coefficient plays important roles in controlling the spread of corona virus. If the coefficient of t i.e. a 1 in new cases data, is greater than the coefficient of t 2 , i.e. b 1 than that of c 1 (a 1 >>b 1 >>c 1 ) then with a smaller number of days we have to spend as lockdown to reduce the number. Again, if the coefficient of t 2 i.e. b 1 is less than c 1 then we have to spend more days in lockdown to minimize the number.

Moreover, HCQ is more potent agent than chloroquine due to less toxic nature. Chinese researchers found that chloroquine to be highly effective in reducing viral replication that can be easily achievable with standard dosing due to its favourable penetration in tissues including the lung [12] . Recently an excellent recovery was observed in 68% of the patients treated with one dose of remdisivir daily, according to an analysis published in The New England Journal of Medicine [13] . The recovery takes 18 days of time with single medication and the mortality rate is also very less in such case. Remdisivir is medication of Ebola virus where as HCQ is a for treatment of Rheumatoid Arthurites (RA). In a recent study in Gilead reveals that the average time to clinical improvement was 10 days in the five-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group [14] . More than half of the patients in both groups were discharged from the hospital by day 14. Hence Remdisivir is supposed to be considered as fast recovering medicine for the age group of 30 to 80 years. HCQ application to CoVID-19 patient takes a few days more to recover than Remdisivir ever after 5 days treatment [15] . Hence, Remdisivir and HCQ are both good medicine for CoVID-19 affected people.

Moreover, due to other vaccination (BCG, Hepatitis etc.) among younger age, the immunity power is very good and hence the recovery is faster (till now almost 40%). Wide coverage of BCG vaccination in India may lead to lesser fatal outcome of the decease but researchers are still working on it and relevant research papers are yet to be published.
