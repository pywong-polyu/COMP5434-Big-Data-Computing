            "text": "A Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) is a security enforcement point or cloud-based software that is placed between cloud service users and cloud applications of cloud computing (CC) which is used to run the dimensionality, heterogeneity, and ambiguity correlated with cloud services. They permit the organization to amplify the reach of their security approaches past their claim framework to third-party computer programs and storage. In contrast to other systematic literature reviews (SLR), this one is directed at the client setting. To identify and evaluate methods to understand CASB, the SLR discusses the literature, citing a comprehension of the state-of-the-art and innovative characterization to describe. An SLR was performed to compile CASB related experiments and analyze how CASBs are designed and formed. These studies are then analyzed from different contexts, like motivation, usefulness, building approach, and decision method. The SLR has discussed the contrasts present between the studies and implementations, with planning accomplishments conducted with combinations of market-based courses of action, simulation tools, middleware's, etc. Search words with the keywords, which were extracted from the Research Questions (RQs), were utilized to recognize the essential consideration from the journal papers, conference papers, workshops, and symposiums. This SLR has distinguished 20 particular studies distributed from 2011 to 2021. Chosen studies were evaluated concurring to the defined RQs for their eminence and scope to particular CASB in this way recognizing a few gaps within the literature. Unlike other studies, this one concentrates on the customer's viewpoint. The survey uses a systematic analysis of the literature to discover and classify techniques for realizing CASB, resulting in a comprehensive grasp of the state-of-the-art and a novel taxonomy to describe CASBs. To assemble studies relating to CASB and investigate how CASB are engineered, a systematic literature review was done. These investigations are then evaluated from a variety of angles, including motivation, functionality, engineering approach, and methodology. Engineering efforts were directed at a combination of ''market-based solutions'', ''middlewares'', ''toolkits'', ''algorithms'', ''semantic frameworks'', and ''conceptual frameworks'', according to the study, which noted disparities in the studies' implementations. For further understanding, the different independent parameters influencing the CASB are studied using PCA (Principal Component Analysis). The outcome of their analysis was the identification of five parameters influencing the PCA analysis. The experimental results were used as input for Research Surface Methodology (RSM) to obtain an empirical model. For this, five-level coding was employed for developing the model and considered three dependent parameters and four center values. For more understanding of these independent variables' influence, on the CASB study, RSM analysis was employed. It was observed from the CCD (Central Composite Design) model that the actual values show significant influence with R 2 = 0.90. This wide investigation reveals that CASB is still in a formative state. Even though vital advancement has been carried out in this zone, obvious challenges stay to be tended to, which have been highlighted in this paper.",

            "text": "Cloud Computing (CC) has emerged as the need of every enterprise in recent times and is turning into an integral part of all other technologies such as IoT, Big data, and Quantum computing [1] . Technology Review followed the coinage of the term ''Cloud Computing'' (CC) back twodecade earlier, to November 14 0 1996, and an office park outside Houston by ''George Favaloro'' and ''Sean O'Sullivan'' [2] . Indeed even though numerous individuals accept that CC may be a quite newborn marvel, it has its roots within the thoughts expected in the 1960s. J.C.R. Licklider of ARPANET is generally described as the primary one to present the thought of an ''intergalactic computer network'' in 1969, a machine that can be accessed from any place within the world. But even before him, in 1961, John McCarthy floated the thought of computation being given as open benefit just like any other benefit, a concept he named as ''utility computing'' [3] , and in numerous ways, typically completely what CC is these days. Over the 1960s and'70 s, expansive banks of computers included so-called ''time-sharing'' services to nearby and inaccessible partners. In the 1980s and early 90 s, expansive scattered data centers were installed by huge enterprises. There was not an earth-shattering breakthrough until the Web got to be very common and effortlessly available. In the year 1999, Saalesforce.com was the primary company that was supplying the working application through the web to the clients. In the year 2002, Amazon Web Services (AWS) aws.amazon.com emerged and provided a heap of cloud services such as capacity and computing. Later in 2006, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) also known as EC2 clusters, was introduced by Amazon which helped in setting up small and medium companies and let people rentout their servers for performing pointed computation. In the very same year, Simple Storage Service (S3) was also launched by Amazon which enabled people to use the cloud for storing their information online. After this many tech industries jumped into the business of different cloud services. Google in the year 2009, introduced ''Google Apps'' compatible with its chrome browser which helped engineers to develop their items and also permits them to host them on Google servers as a web application. Simultaneously Microsoft and Apple pushed their cloud capacity items too, i.e. OneDrive and ICloud respectively. Meanwhile, Microsoft started Microsoft Azure too to be utilized by the buyers to fulfill a variety of objectives from online capacity to databases, web APIs to full-grown web applications to fully presented Linux and Windows VM. As time passed, many stakeholders kept entering this field, and cloud computing technology is expected to be more reasonable easily accessible, and useful in the future, particularly by techstartups and administrators [4] . To share imaginative thoughts and developments in this cloud computing field, a premier conference was started in 2009 with the name ''International conference on cloud computing'' (ICCC). The effectiveness of the cloud lies in its boundless supply of services such as servers, the storage of information, and anything as a benefit (XaaS) is conceivable [5] . Cloud computing is a live field. This image remained the toast of conferences and gatherings in the IT spaces these days and we have found boosting clues of its services and acknowledgment within the ventures as well as the scholarly community [6] . Another conference named ''International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing (PDGC -2010)'' has been started in 2010, due to the emerging importance of cloud computing. The ICCC and PDGC conferences emerged as the platform to share the ideas of the academicians and analysts of the zone of cloud computing. Besides these conferences, a separate journal dedicated to cloud computing was introduced to share the ideas within the said field by the name of ''Journal of Cloud Computing: Advances Systems and Applications'', published by Springer. But despite all its buildup and utilization, the ideaof CCis pretty elusive and its definitionis still very unclear. In over simplified terms, the cloud gives further computing and capacity services from a pool of shared assets to its customers. A much more accurate definition is given in Table 1 .",

To fill in the gaps mentioned above, the cloud community has long advocated for CASB to act as a middleman between CSCs and CSPs, reducing the risk of choosing the wrong CSP. A CASB is a middleman between CSCs and CSPs who helps CSCs make decisions and improve service delivery (Barker et al. 2015 ) [39] . The range of difficulties surrounding CASB has prompted so much study that it is necessary to evaluate suggested solutions methodically. Few studies have looked into CASB research initiatives such as methodologies of selection of cloud services [40] , cloud portability and interoperability [41] , and different mechanisms of resource allocation [42] , enhancing the security of cloud environmentwith CASB [43] , different CASB policies [43] , and Fuzzy CASB for requirements negotiation and prioritization [44] . They have discussed CASB from the perspective of a CSP, with a focus on portability and interoperability between CSP cloud services (i.e., IaaS, SaaS, PaaS, etc.). Furthermore, to our knowledge, no SLR on RSM Analysisbased CASB has been conducted, which is essential to assess progress in this subject and recommend dimensions for future research. This article presents the findings of an SLR conducted on the topic of RSM Analysis based CASB. An SLR distinguishes, categories, and changes comparative suggestions of the current research and centers on information exchange within the research community [45] . Moreover, for this article, an SLR was carried out, with the essential aim to make out, taxonomically categorize, and methodically compare the existing research, based on arranging, implementation, and approving the relocation of bequest frameworks for CASB-based programs.",

CASB may be a colossal but ambiguous field. There is a critical conflict between commitments and the expression utilized to depict them in investigation papers. In [35] , Gartner envisions the CASB as a course of activity of four interconnected columns, i.e., ''visibility'', ''compliance'', ''data security'', and ''threatprotection'' as depictedin Fig. 1 . CASBs are a data-key arrangement for securing data end-to-end, from any application to any gadget. Whereas early cloud security solutions were centered on SaaS security, CASBs have advanced into wide stages that ensure information over SaaS, IaaS, and private cloud applications. CASB works as a tool that sits between an organization's-premises framework and a cloud provider's framework. As per the demand of organizations, which are transiting from internal bound-based applications to the cloud, deep visibility over corporate data as well as IT administrators' granular control over data access is provided by CASBs by intermediating or ''proxying'' traffic between cloud applications and end-user devices. The movement of ''packets'' between users and applications essentially changes the strength of cloud and mobility. This has raised a necessity to adjust the list and the expenditure preferences in security controls for exhausting cloud services by any organization. By 2022 (Strategic Planning Assumptions) 60% of tremendous wanders will utilize a cloud CASB arrange for their cloud organizations, which is up from less than 20% these days [65] . Even though 2023, at the smallest 99% of cloud security disillusionments will be the customer's fault [65] . The applications of CC and the encouragement to CASB are portrayed in Table 4 .",

So many techniques are available to achieve security in the cloud, such as Encryption, Authorization, and Authentication. Cloud security risks can be categorized into cloud users and cloud service providers. Some of the cloud security risks are Data leakage, Data breaches, and loss, Hacking, Denial of Service, malicious Cluster Computing insiders attack, and some shared technology issues. Authentication, authorization, data protection, etc., are some of the security aspects that cloud service providers must cover and basic security goals that need to constitute basic security principles, and it became more crucial as data move to the cloud. Trust of the cloud service provider (CSP) and its services is among the principal drivers of a customer deciding to migrate to a cloud platform or conform to the legacy framework [67] . Trust relies upon deciding whether the provider is responsible for all risks such as data protection, VM security, and other regulatory concerns. ''Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability '' are the three considerations considered during the cloud system security review (CIA) [68] . This section's primary objective is to generalize security requirements for the modern cloud infrastructure since the CIA domain is the commonly used method for defining security vulnerabilities in the conventional information system.

The coded condition is valuable for recognizing the relative influence of the components by comparing the figure coefficients. The values predicted from the model as well as actual values can easily be seen from Fig. 10 . The principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess the most influential parameters for vendors outcomes. This PCA has been done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The five components namely Vendor profile, Visibility and Governance, Compliance, Threat Protection, Office 365 security, IaaS, and custom apps security and data security were considered for the analysis. In terms of eigenvalue being greater than one, variance has been extracted as shown in Table 14 . Component 1 i.e., Vendor profile explains about 52.13% of the variance in terms Cluster Computing of the Outcome needed for the Vendor. The variance can be best explained by using the criteria having a cumulative percentage greater than 90, the 6 variables that emerged to be influential are Vendor profile, visibility and governance, compliance, threat protection, and data security have a cumulative percentage of 91.677%. The vendor outcome is predicted from Central Composite Design (CCD) using research surface methodology. The model was randomized so that the best and most appropriate polynomial model can be judged. The model was analyzed using 50 randomized field outputs that were collected from a field study (Fig. 11) . The scree plot (as shown by Fig. 12) is a graphical representation of the component with its eigenvalue. The contribution of a componentis assessed by its eigenvalue. The more the eigenvalue, the more is the contribution of that component in the vendor's outcome. As shown in Fig. 11 , there appears to be a strong contribution of the Vendor profile, visibility and governance, compliance, threat protection, and data security on vendors outcome out of six factors considered for the study. SaaS (software as a service) is becoming popular among businesses. Companies' IT teams must oversee the safety of a potentially huge number of apps that handle sensitive data. Customers are responsible for protecting their data, even while the service provider has a robust security system in place (the provider does not understand the data semantics). The CASB is a newly developed system software type that can coordinate this form of security management (CASB). In addition to limiting application users' access to resources, CASB guards against malicious code infiltrating the system. This system's design pattern.

The tall values of the relationship coefficients moreover speak to the accuracy of the models to anticipate the reactions. The graphs of the 3D space model are as shown in Fig. 14 . The graphs show the independence of variables and the outcome of the model space. The independent variable chosen from the PCA analysis was quite a significant influencing factor on the model and its outcomes. Within the same vein, the need fora fit test was not measurably noteworthy (p [ 0.05) which demonstrated the tall wellness of the models. Concurring to the ANOVA test, a quadratic polynomial demonstration is measurably noteworthy to speak to the genuine relationship between reactions and the factors. Show F values of 13.32 with a little p value (\\ 0.0001) for all three reactions demonstrated the exactness of the show. A tall coefficient of assurance (R 2 = 0.90) demonstratedthe capacity of anticipating the relationship between dependent and free variables.

We focusedoncorrectlycharacterizing the ongoingstate-of-art in CASB and recognizing key accomplishments and challenges with different aspects of any enterprise. To perform the search, twenty main papers were considered for the SLR of CASB. The search was conducted using seven major publication databases. We examined 173 papers from which we have considered 36 outlining worthy significance to the study topic.Understanding the different independent parameters influencing the CASB is studied using PCA. It was agreed that five parameters were influencing PCA analysis. For more understanding of these independent variables' influence, on the CASB study, RSM analysis was employed. It was observed from the CCD model that the actual values showed significant influence with R 2 = 0.90. In this review paper, we have identified some studies which focus on the services of CASB [105] . In expansion to this, CC services [106] , cloud service choice for CASB [106] , and CASB columns [107] are the dynamic states which have gotten consideration by the CC society for modeling with RSM and PCA analysis. The CC Simulators have been created for modeling the ''SAML'', ''DRM'', ''Cloud DLP'', ''SIEM'', ''IAM'' and ''IPSs'' etc. We have distinguished 36 supportive simulators for modeling the security prerequisites [34, . In [35] , it was pointed out that SLR within the state of CASB is disregarded cloud computingstate by SLR. The applications, use cases, best practices, identifying and protecting sensitive cloud data/information of the continuous CASB have moreover been distinguished. Hence, in this article, a challenge has been made to fulfill this research gap. The major findings reveal that CASB has arisen as a crosscloud model, driven by the heterogeneity and dimensionality of present cloud computing services, as well as the singlecloud paradigm's inability to meet the needs of clients. The proposed CASB will be responsible for a variety of functions, including ''assisting clients with decision-making'', ''application deployment'', ''SLA negotiations'', and ''resource monitoring''. Our extensive meta-analysis reveals that CASB is still in its infancy. Even though tremendous progress has been made in this subject, significant challenges remain, which are also noted in this survey.
