So far, no vaccine candidate under development has reached the market and the only licensed product to prevent RSV infection in at-risk infants and young children is a monoclonal antibody (Synagis \u00ae ). Polyclonal human anti-RSV hyperimmune immunoglobulins (Igs) have also been used but were superseded by Synagis \u00ae owing to their low titer and large infused volume. Here we report a new drug class of immunoglobulins, derived from human non hyper-immune plasma that was generated by an innovative bioprocess, called Ig cracking, combining expertises in plasma-derived products and affinity chromatography. By using the RSV fusion protein (F protein) as ligand, the Ig cracking process provided a purified and concentrated product, designated hyper-enriched anti-RSV IgG, composed of at least 15-20% target-specific-antibodies from normal plasma. These anti-RSV Ig displayed a strong in vitro neutralization effect on RSV replication. Moreover, we described a novel prophylactic strategy based on local nasal administration of this unique hyper-enriched anti-RSV IgG solution using a mouse model of infection with bioluminescent RSV. Our results demonstrated that very low doses of hyper-enriched anti-RSV IgG can be administered locally to ensure rapid and efficient inhibition of virus infection. Thus, the general hyper-enriched Ig concept appeared a promising approach and might provide solutions to prevent and treat other infectious diseases.",

The protective effect of polyclonal immunoglobulins administered intravenously (IVIg) is controversial and does not totally prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. High doses of IVIg seem to significantly reduce the number and duration of infections in primary immune deficiency diseases (1) . However, despite the optimal level of IgG (8 g/L) and adequate antibiotics, some patients still develop bowel infections or chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis caused by Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2) . In contrast, human immunoglobulins enriched in target-specific antibodies (1-5%, called hyper-immune) have been and are still being used with success in preventing viral or bacterial infections with hepatitis B virus, tetanus, Cytomegalovirus and rabies virus (3) . Nevertheless, the efficient doses remain high in these specific indications and administration side effects have sometimes been reported. In parallel, the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as anti-infective products is rising (4) . Indeed, the emergence of new infectious diseases, the re-emergence of ancient infectious diseases, the rise of antibacterial resistance to conventional antibacterial agents and the difficulty in introducing and supplying a new pipeline of novel antimicrobial compounds increase the interest for non-conventional approaches. However, this class of immunotherapy using mAbs remains limited by prohibitive costs and pathogen resistances related to the mono-specificity (5) .",

The concept, called Ig cracking, gathers expertises in both plasma-derived products and affinity chromatography. The breakthrough innovation of Ig cracking will provide a product composed of at least 15-20% antibodies specific to a viral or a bacterial target from either normal plasma or purified polyclonal immunoglobulins. This first-in-class product is called hyperenriched immunoglobulin. The advantages of poly-clonality will be conserved, i.e. i) a higher efficacy linked to various functionalities including polyneutralization and heteroligation effects (6) and ii) the risk mitigation against escape mutations. Moreover, with at least 15-20% of specific active substance, the high dose and long infusion, which are major drawbacks of hyper-immune Igs (purity less than 1%) will be addressed. The same batch of plasma could be used to generate several hyper-enriched Igs against different antigenic targets. The depleted material could even be used to purify IVIg for inflammatory disease treatments for which, irrespective of the therapeutic mechanisms currently proposed, pathogen-specific Ig are not required.",

            "text": "As a first proof of concept, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been chosen. RSV is an enveloped virus that belongs to the family of Pneumoviridae. RSV infection has an estimated global incidence of 33 million cases in children younger than 5 years, with 10% requiring hospital admission and up to 199,000 dying of the disease (7) . Recently, the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study demonstrated that RSV was the most common pathogen in severe pneumonia affecting young African and Asian children (8) . In addition, there is growing evidence of a causal relationship between infant bronchiolitis and later asthma (9) . According to recent progress in the diagnosis of RSV infection, this virus is so prevalent that it is estimated to cause a disease burden superior to influenza in the elderly and other fragile (i.e immunocompromised) adults (10, 11) . Given the aging population structure in Western countries, adult RSV-associated mortality is becoming a huge health and economic burden, even greater than RSV-associated bronchiolitis in infants (12) . In contrast, in healthy immunocompetent adults, RSV infection is controlled and ranges from symptom-free to a mild cold (13) . Our aim is to transfer natural molecules able to control RSV infection from healthy adults to fragile patients, like those with impaired mucosal immunity (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), lung transplant or Cystic fibrosis patients), in a highly purified and concentrated form. These hyper-enriched anti-RSV Ig were purified using as affinity ligand a potent antigen for virusneutralization, the RSV fusion protein (F protein). This surface glycoprotein is more conserved than the other surface glycoprotein G (89% versus 53% amino acid sequence identity respectively for these proteins of RSV subgroup A compared with subgroup B) and plays an essential role in infection (14, 15) . The F protein can take two structural conformations, the post-fusion form (postF) which is very stable (16) and the pre-fusion form (preF) which is metastable unless stabilizing mutations are introduced (17) . Both structural conformations display neutralizing epitopes, some shared between the pre-and the post-fusion forms (sites I, II and IV) (18) . Site II is the neutralizing epitope targeted by the monoclonal antibody palivizumab (Synagis \u00ae ). Profiling of RSV antibody repertoire in adults shows that a relatively large proportion of the antibodies binds exclusively to preF and that the vast majority of remaining antibodies binds to both pre-and postF, with highly potent neutralizing antibodies being specific for preF (19) .",

Preparative scale batch was carried out using \u00c4kta Avant instrument (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) controlled by Unicorn 7.0 software. Polyclonal IgG solution (ClairYg \u00ae Intermediate IVIg Product, LFB, France) containing 0.11% for specific anti-RSV IgG content, was used as source material. Intermediate IVIg product process included ethanol fractionation of the plasma pool obtained from blood donation, caprylic acid precipitation to remove impurities, depth filtration and activated carbon adsorption before anion exchange chromatography for IgA and IgM removal. The eluate was thoroughly diafiltered in water and stored in liquid state at + 2/8\u00b0C until used for F-RSV affinity chromatography. Optimal capture was previously determined by Design of experiments (GE Helthcare Life Sciences): 0.7 g F protein (F-11049 V08B, Sino Biological Inc.) per L of gel -5 minutes, the resident time needed for eluting component to pass through the column (1% IgG final concentration) in 10 mM trisodium citrate containing 0.05 M sodium chloride and pH adjusted to 7.4 with 1 M Tris solution allowed 80% of specific antibodies capture. After loading, the column was subjected to an extensive wash with the equilibration buffer until baseline return before elution at pH 2.5 with 100 mM Glycine-HCl buffer in the presence of 30% propylene glycol. The matrix was regenerated after each cycle using 6 M guanidine-HCl buffer. About 60 mg of specific anti-RSV IgG was recovered from 12 cycles using an 11-mL column of F-RSF affinity matrix. Following elution, the pH was neutralized and the pool of eluates was subjected to a polishing step on 1-mL Sartobind-Q nano capsule (Sartorius-Stedim Biotech) in order to reduce potential bacterial endotoxins and aggregates. The flow-through fraction was then concentrated to 1.5 g/L using a Biomax \u2122 50 kDa membrane (Pellicon \u2122 XL, Merck-Millipore) and dialysed against ClairYg \u00ae formulation buffer (vehicle) containing Mannitol and Glycine as excipients for IgG stabilization before a final 0.2 \u00b5m filtration (Optiscale \u2122 , Merck-Millipore), filling in sterile flasks and freezing at < -60\u00b0C.

An intermediate product was obtained from normal plasma after ethanol and caprylic fractionation, a depth filtration and an activated carbon absorption followed by an anion chromatography step. This intermediate product, mainly composed of IgG, was then applied onto an F-RSV affinity sorbent (purple step) to effectively enrich the proportion of anti-RSV Ab. To generate the affinity sorbent, the extracellular domain of the RSV F protein (Met1-Thr529 fused with a polyhistidine tag at the C-terminus, purchased from Sino Biological Inc) was grafted on an NHS-activated Sepharose gel ( Figure 1B) . The starting IgG solution was directly applied on the affinity sorbent using optimized condition for adsorption, wash and elution. The best protocol selected among 13 absorption and 9 elution conditions was the one displaying the higher yield. A final step of concentration and formulation including a filtration step to remove aggregates and endotoxin was performed. The final product recovered, a hyper-enriched anti-RSV Ig fraction, was thus suitable for in vitro and in vivo non-clinical tests. The purification process, including the affinity step, showed a high reproducibility (see Figure 1C for affinity step chromatogram of two batches). Finally, the product was characterized by SDS PAGE (Figure 1D) . The SDS-PAGE data suggested that anti-RSV Ig purity and integrity was highly similar to what is observed for a commercial normal polyclonal immunoglobulin (ClairYg \u00ae ) and notably that the affinity step did not induce any significant aggregation. Thus, several batches of hyper-enriched anti-RSV Ig were manufactured (two of six different batches are represented here, Table 1 ). By MSD multi-array assay, the hyper-enriched anti-RSV Ig solution showed a level of purity of approximately 15-20% of antibodies specific to F-RSV protein in comparison with less than 0.1% in the initial solution ( Table 1) . Therefore, this cracking process lead to an elution fraction with an enrichment of IgG specific to F-RSV protein of at least 163fold, as compared to the starting material (Table 1) .",

As controls, mice were treated with irrelevant antibodies (10 mg/kg, CTL Ig) or vehicle (ClairYg \u00ae formulation buffer). Mice were then infected with a luciferaseexpressing recombinant RSV (RSV-Luc) (20) , and viral replication was simultaneously monitored in the nasal turbinates (NT) and in the lungs by in vivo bioluminescence. As previously described (20) , the peak of replication in the lungs was observed at 4 d.p.i. (data not shown). The replication of RSV-Luc in living mice was detected in the nose and in the lungs of all animals treated with CTL Ig or vehicle (control groups, Figure 3B , depicted images of 2 mice are representative of 4 animals). Intra-peritoneal administration of anti-RSV Ig (1 or 10 mg/kg) or Synagis \u00ae resulted in a mild reduction of luciferase activities in the lungs at 4 d.p.i. as compared to the control groups ( Figure 3B) . Interestingly, the inhibition of viral replication in the lungs was dependent upon the dose of anti-RSV Ig as demonstrated by quantification of luciferase activity in the lung lysates at 4 d.p.i. ( Figure 3C ) and by evaluation of viral N gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR performed from lung RNA at 4 d.p.i. ( Figure 3D) . Interestingly, at the same dose (10 mg/kg), the inhibition of viral replication by preventive administration of anti-RSV Ig was comparable to that conferred by Synagis \u00ae although not significantly different from the control groups ( Figures 3C, D) . Similar observations were made at 3 and 5 d.p.i. (data not shown). It should be noted that the delivery of anti-RSV Ig by I.P. route allowed a diffusion of antibodies into the respiratory tract since there was moderate protection against RSV infection in the lungs. Nasal delivery of anti-RSV Ig was then tested as a way to increase the amount of antibodies in the respiratory tract. When mice received anti-RSV Ig I.N. in 50 mL, luciferase expression monitored in the mouse NT was not affected whatever the dose administered. However, all animals were fully protected against RSV replication in the lungs at the dose 1 mg/kg and some, but ",

Overall, these results indicate that I.N. administration of low doses of anti-RSV Ig provided nearly complete protection against RSV replication in the upper respiratory tract in mice.",

As a proof of concept for the IVIg cracking concept, the details of the anti-RSV product are reported in this study. Using an optimized F-RSV affinity chromatography, a hyper-enriched anti-RSV Ig solution was extracted from ClairYg \u00ae preparation. The purification step was reproducible and resulted in an enrichment of anti-RSV Ig by at least 160-fold, as determined by MSD multi-array assay. The antiviral activity of the purified product was first assessed in vitro by measuring its ability to inhibit RSV infection of HEp-2 cells. These hyper-enriched anti-RSV Ig displayed a strong in vitro neutralization effect on different RSV strains. Noteworthy this effect was stronger than Synagis \u00ae . Considering that the total anti-RSV IgG content of hyper-enriched anti-RSV Ig solution is expected to be at least 15-20% (see Table 1 ), a higher activity could be reached by an improvement of the enrichment step. Moreover, the I.P. or I.N. (50 \u00b5L) preadministration of anti-RSV Ig solutions was able to limit RSV replication in the lungs of treated-mice, demonstrating that these hyper-enriched antibodies provide a successful inhibition of RSV replication in the lower respiratory tract. Chadock's group previously demonstrated that the therapeutic effect of IVIG was dependent on their mode of administration in different strategies for experimental immunotherapy of RSV infection in cotton rats or owl monkeys (24, 25) . Furthermore, a small volume (< 20 mL) of inoculum administered intranasally resulted in a retention of products in the nasopharynx and in a limited distribution in the lungs (21) . Therefore we evaluated the interest of combining the high potency of this product with an intranasal instillation of a small volume (10 \u00b5L) to enhance the nasopharynx distribution of anti-RSV Ig, and to prevent the early step of RSV infection in the upper respiratory tract of mice. Thus, the neutralizing activity combined with a very local administration in the NT led to a nearly complete protection against RSV infection in a relevant in vivo model. Altogether the results reported here clearly demonstrate the interest of the approach we propose, since it allowed an almost complete protection against RSV infection that could not be reached with Synagis \u00ae regardless the doses parenterally given. In addition to their better protection efficacy, anti-RSV-Ig are expected to generate cost-savings as compared with Synagis \u00ae . Owing to the intramuscular administration route of Synagis \u00ae the annual treatment is approximately 5.3 g per year for an adult of 70 kg of body weight. In vivo bioluminescence intensity was evaluated at 1 d.p.i. with IVIS imaging system (dorsal view detection).

The nasal route of administration will allow using much less product per patient and per year (from our current results, annual treatment product quantities are estimated at less that 100 mg/patient/year). Additional savings are expected from the manufacturing process since the plasma starting material and facility cost will be shared with other products (for example, this costing sharing structure allows the plasma fractionation industry to sell for example human IVIG at cost ranging from $ 30 to $ 70 per g which is 10 to 20 folds less than average price of monoclonal antibodies). Finally higher potency, resulting from polyclonal nature of our anti-RSV antibodies is also expected to contribute to the global cost saving. Moreover, we believe that the local administration of Ig requires less product amounts per patient compared to the parenteral route, hence leading to treatment cost savings. The preventive instillation of anti-RSV Igs, even at very low doses, provided a significant reduction of RSV infection in the upper respiratory tract in mice. It will be interesting to associate a mucoadhesive buffer with hyper-enriched anti-RSV Ig in order to enhance the interaction with the mucus layer covering the mucosal epithelial surface and to extend the duration of stay of inhaled products in the NT (26) . Thus, the combination of a local administration and low product amount allowed a level of protection never reached before with very low dose of hyperenriched anti-RSV Ig and suggested a novel preventive treatment that should protect against RSV infections with a very small quantity of product administered daily (or twice daily) during hospitalization (i.e. after graft or any treatment or condition leading to immunocompromised situation) or during all the RSV season.",

The efficacy of our anti-RSV Ig could be improved by using the stabilized preF DS-Cav1 as an affinity ligand (17) . An even better approach would be to use epitopescaffold mimicking the 3D-structure of potent neutralizing F-RSV epitopes (27, 28) .

Altogether, these data suggest that this approach is very promising for further development to protect patients at risk of developing severe RSV disease. Moreover, the general hyper-enriched Ig concept should provide solutions to treat and prevent several other infectious diseases in fragile populations especially in the absence of vaccination. In addition, by protecting the upper respiratory tract, this approach is expected to better limit the virus transmission than any passive or active immunization achieved with systemic administration. This is particularly relevant to break the chain of transmission of respiratory infectious agents. This innovative bioprocess of Ig cracking from either normal plasma or from convalescent plasma constitutes a novel technological strategy to develop new tools to control emerging viral diseases, such as COVID-19.",
