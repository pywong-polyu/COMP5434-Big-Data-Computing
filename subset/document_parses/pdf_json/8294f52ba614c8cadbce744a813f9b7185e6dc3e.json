The term computer-based exam (or computer-based test) encompasses online exam. Online exams (also known as e-exams) may be considered as a sub-class of computer-based exam, wherein the exam is conducted online. Online is used in the sense that the computer being used to take the test is connected to the intranet or the Internet, in a client-server environment. The computer being used for taking the test can be considered a client computer. The server computer is the one that is sitting somewhere on the Internet (or the intranet) and delivering the exam. Usually, in an online exam, there is some form of communication between the server and the client (not necessarily continuous). The exam results are uploaded to the server computer after the exam. The role of the client comes to an end as soon as he/she completes the exam and the results are uploaded. In technical terms, the session ends after the exam is completed.",

In other words, the computer may or may not be connected to a server on the Internet (or intranet). After a computer-based exam (CBE) or computer-based test (CBT), the results may be stored locally on the computer's hard disk or transported online to the web server. Usually, standalone testing is referred to as CBT. Competitive exams are often referred to as online exams because they are delivered in real time simultaneously over the network to several students and the exams are conducted in a client-server environment. A CBT software exam engine may be viewed as an example of CBT. Here a candidate downloads the CBT software from the Internet and installs it on his/her own computer and appears in the exam. Here no server connection is required for appearing in the test/exam. E-exam was introduced in the 1970s. It is used as an effective method for assessing one's level of knowledge, academic performance, and problem-solving skills. It is employed as a research tool by researchers to collect data or by trainers and educators to assess students. It enables teachers to save their efforts while assessing students. E-exam has been increasingly used by higher education institutions worldwide because it provides relatively more accurate results by employing stimuli that may be in an audio, text, graphic, or kinesthetic form [4] .",

Due to the significance of online assessment during this phase of the ongoing pandemic, e-exams are employed at present to assess students' performance. Many students must be assessed in various courses at universities within a limited amount of time through mid-exams and final exams. However, this will require use of a rapid assessment method that will provide scores instantly. Therefore, universities prefer to assess students through e-exams [8] .

However, the implication of such research is arguably limited, provided they were conducted during the pre-pandemic era. Students were mainly asked about their earlier experiences of assessment methods such as online practice tests and quizzes and their responses to various e-learning platforms (Google Classroom, Blackboard, Moodle, etc.). An earlier study was undertaken within a single discipline [9] to investigate the students' perception towards online examinations at Ash-Shobak University College in Jordan. For this study, questionnaires comprising 26 items were distributed to 112 students. Of them, 108 questionnaires were collected and deemed to be adequate for the research. The outcomes were nifty, reflecting no disparity among the students' perspectives concerning GPA or gender. The findings of the study revealed a positive outlook of students towards the online examination. Moreover, their take towards the authenticity and dependability of online exams was approving, stating that the electronic process is competent in evaluating what they intend to evaluate. The study also concluded that the online examination system and the respective regulations were transparent. However, in contradiction, it was discovered that online examinations create higher anxiety among students, and cheating becomes relatively easier. The research also concluded that the duration of online exams is improper, and the process does not help ameliorate the students' performance.",

Their study revealed that the said students were largely content with the exam system. The reason behind their satisfaction includes the ease of participation in an online exam and quickly obtaining the result. In contemplating the learners' presumptions on e-exams, Hillier [15] inspected undergraduate students. The findings of the research revealed that the majority of the students have a positive perception towards e-exams. The students, however, raised doubts, stating that the online exam method will appeal more to technology majors than the others. The research deduced that students believed that those belonging to the computer domain would enjoy the ease of adapting to the new system for having a substantial typing experience. Some of the students also expressed concerns related to possible technical failures and the likelihood of more cheating. A study conducted in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by Elmehdi and Ibrahem [16] revealed a largely assertive outlook of students towards e-exams. Expedited logistics and advanced e-learning were the primary reasons for their positive response. Besides, the study revealed no disparity in their viewpoints concerning age and gender.",

The purposive sampling (also known as judgmental sampling) method is a form of non-random sampling in which researchers rely on their own judgment when choosing members of the population to participate in their surveys. This sampling method requires researchers to have prior knowledge about the purpose of their studies so that they can choose and approach eligible participants for surveys. The purpose of the study was to assess the students' perceptions of e-exams, and for this purpose, the researchers chose the students as per their own judgment of those institutions where the online examinations are being conducted by the universities in India and Saudi Arabia during the ongoing pandemic. Since the researchers have more prior information about the selected university students' level of knowledge and understanding towards e-exams and how they perceive e-exams, it ensures the desired number of sample students that the researchers are going to select. Therefore, the judgmental sampling technique was applied by the researchers to obtain information from 207 students registered in the various universities of Delhi, India, and Saudi Arabia. These institutions were Delhi University (DU), Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI), and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) from the NCT of Delhi, India, and Saudi Electronic University (SEU) from Saudi Arabia. The survey respondents are students enrolled in those universities conducting online exams during this phase of COVID-19 pandemic. The perspective of the learners towards the e-assessment questionnaire [22] was adopted for providing a framework for devising an online questionnaire comprising two principal sections: Sections 1 and 2. The first section required filling up the general information. The second section, however, required students to answer several statements about their views on e-exams. All the statements were set forth positively, classified into six sets, which comprised the method and practices of teaching (also known as pedagogy), authenticity and reliability, practicality, affective factors, and security. Moreover, the section also comprised statements asking the students to choose the critical considerations required to implement e-exams successfully. Three experts in e-learning evaluated the content efficacy of the questionnaire and provided their opinions on the specified items. The experts, furthermore, recommended that specific revisions be made. The said revisions were minor in nature, and necessary rectifications were made accordingly. Besides, the authenticity of the constructs was analyzed using Cronbach's alpha in the degree to which the items in the questionnaire were associated with one another. The alpha value of each construct used in the study is greater than 0.70, which shows that all the statements are significantly correlated with each other [23] . The survey was carried out from January to March 2021. For investigating whether the manifest variables clearly explain their corresponding construct, the CFA technique was conducted in the study with the help of AMOS (version 24) software. The researchers employed the appropriate statistical tools and techniques through SPSS (version 25) software to accomplish the primary objectives of the study.",

            "text": "The above analysis shows that all the measured variables are significantly related to their corresponding constructs since their p-values are less than the recommended limit of 5% alpha level. Furthermore, the standardized regression weight (\u03b2) of each path is more than 0.40, which affirms that the convergent validity of the CFA measurement model discussed earlier is achieved and also illustrates that each manifest variable is highly correlated with its respective latent construct [27] . Table 5 shows that the composite reliability of each variable is greater than the threshold limit of 0.70, indicating that \"strong internal consistency\" exists between the items on a scale. Alternatively, the \"average variance extracted\" of each latent construct surpasses the recommended limit of 0.50. It asserts a \"strong convergent validity\" of the measurement model, as discussed above. This segment of the questionnaire was targeted for acquiring information about the students' viewpoints towards e-exam methods exercised by the educational institutions in India and Saudi Arabia amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The principal headings were Pedagogy, Validity and Reliability, Affective Factors, Practicality, and Security. The respondents were requested to register their answers on a five-point summated scale varying from \"strongly disagree (1)\" to \"strongly agree (5) .\" The respondents recorded mixed experiences of e-exams. Out of the 18 items of the questionnaire, 15 recorded positive mean responses, two recorded negative responses, and one recorded a neutral response ( Table 6 ). The said rating is categorized into three categories: firstly, the mean score of 3 shows the neutral response of students; secondly, if the mean score is more than 3, it depicts the positive perception of students towards e-exams; and lastly, if the mean value is less than 3, it portrays the negative mindset of students regarding the online examination system [22] . The following table depicts the results: Table 6 indicates that the overall mean value is 3.74, and the value of the overall standard deviation is 0.881. It reveals that university students' perception towards online exams is positive as the total mean value is greater than 3 and the total standard deviation is less than 1, which is considered to be stable. In fact, it is consistent with the results of Tella and Bashorun [28] and Da'asin [9] . This may be associated with the fact that respondents have excellent computer skills, enabling them to use the e-exam system with ease.",

Moreover, the questions selected for e-exams must undergo quality assurance standards to make sure the devised questions align with the learning objectives of the course. For instance, concocting multiple-choice questions (MCQs) becomes significantly time-consuming for the management. It requires considerable technical and pedagogical expertise and assistance. When enquired about the convenience of online examination, most of the students acknowledged the same, indicating the superiority of e-exams over the traditional format. That is because e-exams can be attempted from any place and at any time, which is also applicable to online lectures, with smartphones often acting as the carriers; it is essential that formative testing be carried out regularly [32] . Another important circumstance is the notable progression of e-learning, also known as distance education. The institutional infrastructure in Palestine has undergone a significant change whereby universities are, to varying degrees, adopting e-learning and conducting e-exams [32] . As more and more universities adopt this new system, appropriate attention needs to be given to the proper implementation of e-exams.

Students/learners recognized various benefits of e-exams compared to the paper-based method, including critical factors of reliability in scoring and long-term effectiveness concerning time, effort, and cost. The research findings emphasized impartiality, authenticity, and security being the primary challenges meeting the successful implementation of e-exams. Exercising the automated assessment system warrants proper association of the academic and technical units. At first, devising a question bank for e-exams demands extra efforts. The questions must measure up to the proposed level of knowledge. The teachers need to have adequate training to organize online courses and examinations appropriately. The organizational units must promote a teaching-learning environment and provide the requisite structure for the system. Furthermore, e-learning and the online examination system work effectively through modern-day technologies, such as computers, network devices, and so forth.",
