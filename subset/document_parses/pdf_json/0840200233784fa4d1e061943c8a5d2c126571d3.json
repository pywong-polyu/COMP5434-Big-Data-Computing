Based on an analysis of 161 two-stage matched leader-employee dyads, the hypotheses were tested and the results showed that the leader narcissism had a negative direct effect on employee OCB-L, as well as a negative indirect effect on employee OCB-L via perceived insider status. Furthermore, the need for self-esteem was found to moderate the negative effect of leader narcissism on perceived insider status as well as the mediating effect of perceived insider status between leader narcissism and employee OCB-L. The theoretical and practical implications of our research were discussed. Limitations and directions for future research were also offered.",

Studies show that narcissistic individuals tend to stand out and become leaders in the fierce competition within organizations (Brunell et al., 2008; Nevicka et al., 2011; Ong et al., 2016) . In recent years, some successful business \"stars, \" such as Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Jack Welch, who to some extent all have narcissistic personalities, have been labeled as narcissistic leaders by the media (Visser et al., 2017) . In light of this, leader narcissism has gradually become a hot topic in the field of organizational research and has been an issue of wide concern in the academic community (O'Boyle et al., 2012; Owens et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "Given that leader narcissism has been shown to substantially impact employees (O'Boyle et al., 2012) , there is growing interest in identifying its specific effects. Prior studies have focused on the effects of leader narcissism on employees' job performance (Owens et Liu et al., 2021) and workplace behaviors such as voice behavior (Liao et al., 2019b; Huang et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020) , innovation behavior (Yang et al., 2020; Norouzinik et al., 2021) , change-oriented organizational citizenship behavior (Ha et al., 2020) , and counterproductive behavior (O'Boyle et al., 2012; Braun et al., 2018) . Although existing studies have provided valuable insights into the ways in which leader narcissism affects employees' individual-directed and organization-directed behaviors, it does not answer the question of how leader narcissism affects employees' leader-directed followership behavior. Organizational citizenship behavior directed toward leaders (OCB-L) refers to a discretionary extra-role behavior aimed at benefiting the leaders, which includes helping leaders with their work and accepting extra duties and responsibilities at work (Williams and Anderson, 1991; Liao and Rupp, 2005; Li et al., 2018) . This kind of behavior can meet the unique needs of narcissistic leaders (Morf and Rhodewalt, 2001) , and this can not only effectively promote their leadership but can also enable employees to obtain better work support (Allen and Rush, 1998) . In this fashion, it forms a benign interaction between leaders and employees . However, there is still an inadequacy of information on the relationship between leader narcissism and employee OCB-L.",

According to selfconcept theory, employees keep checking and verifying the part that is consistent with their self-concept (including selfconception and self-evaluation) in their interactions with leaders and exhibit behaviors consistent with that self-concept (Shamir et al., 1993; Sun et al., 2014) . Perceived insider status, the self-conception dimension of self-concept (Chen and Aryee, 2007) , refers to the extent to which an individual perceives himself or herself to be an insider (Dai and Chen, 2015) . Relevant studies have shown that leader behaviors and leadership style have a strong influence on employees' perceived insider status (Chen and Aryee, 2007; Liao, 2015; Schaubroeck et al., 2017) , which in turn affects employees' organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs; Podsakoff et al., 2000; Stamper and Masterson, 2002) . Thus, we propose that leader narcissism may threaten employees' sense of value and acceptance at work, so that employees' perceived insider status will be weakened, leading to a series of negative employee behaviors such as lessened OCB-L.",

To some extent, the need for self-esteem is an embodiment of feelings of selfworth and affects the extent to which employees tie their self-concept to their leaders or outsiders (Hill, 1987; Armeli et al., 1998) . Compared to employees with a low need for self-esteem, employees with a high need for self-esteem are more eager to receive positive feedback from their leaders because their feelings of self-worth are strongly dependent on the outsiders' positive evaluations and have stronger cognitive and behavioral responses to negative evaluations. This strengthens the negative impact of leader narcissism (Fuller et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2009 ). Therefore, this study introduces employees' need for self-esteem as a contingent factor in order to examine the utility boundary of leader narcissism.",

First, based on self-concept theory, our study analyzes the relationship between leader narcissism and employee OCB-L. This not only provides an important supplement to prior studies on the relationship between leader narcissism and employee followership behavior but also responds to researchers' appeal to explore leader narcissism from multiple theoretical perspectives (Huang et al., 2020) . Second, our study clarifies how leader narcissism affects OCB-L by revealing the mediating role of perceived insider status. This enriches our knowledge of the internal mechanism by which leader narcissism affects employee OCB-L from the perspective of self-conception. Finally, by examining the moderating role of the need for self-esteem on the relationship between leader narcissism and employee OCB-L, our research contributes to deepen understanding of the contingency factors that influence the outcomes of leader narcissism. Figure 1 presents our theoretical model, which we will explain in more detail in the next sections. ",

            "text": "Leader Narcissism and Employee OCB-L The term narcissism refers to a personality trait encompassing grandiosity, arrogance, self-absorption, entitlement, fragile selfesteem, and hostility (Rosenthal and Pittinsky, 2006) . Narcissistic leaders tend to take credit for their employees' achievements and are more likely to misjudge when evaluating employees' performance (Aquino et al., 2006) . As a result, subordinates of narcissistic leaders often feel unfairly treated and even deprived because their personal interests and achievements are not guaranteed. Narcissistic leaders often resort to manipulation and exploitation to pursue their self-interest (Locke, 2009 ) and treat employees with little care or sincerity (Campbell et al., 2011) . These negative behaviors can lead employees into a crisis of trust in their leaders (Hogan and Benson, 2009) . Studies have shown that trust in leaders have a strong effect on employees' OCBs (Nohe and Hertel, 2017) . Thus, the lack of trust in leaders makes employees reluctant to make extra efforts that are beneficial to their leaders and their organizations (Mayer and Gavin, 2005) . In addition, narcissistic leaders have low empathy and a high tendency toward exploitation (Emmons, 1984) , which will lead to negative emotions, attitudes, and behaviors of employees . Employee OCB-L represents discretionary extra-role behaviors by which employees take the initiative to assist and support their leaders; this will produce immediate benefits to leaders and indirect contributions to the organization (Williams and Anderson, 1991; Liao and Rupp, 2005) . According to selfconcept theory, important individuals (such as leaders) in an organization will affect the self-conception and self-evaluation of employees (Shamir et al., 1993) . Leader narcissism has the characteristics of overconfidence, exaggeration, and unreality and involves behaviors of exploiting employees, blaming, and criticizing employees for their failures (Chatterjee and Hambrick, 2007; Campbell et al., 2011) . The existence of this \"dark side\" makes narcissistic leaders usually act as \"egoists\" and \"dispossessors\" in leader-employee interaction, and it is difficult for them to establish and maintain good interpersonal relationships with subordinates (Campbell et al., 2011) . In such a work environment, over the long term, employees will tend to have a negative evaluation of, and a functional resistance toward their leaders . They may retaliate against their leaders through supervisor-targeted counterproductive work behavior (Braun et al., 2018) . Under such circumstances, it is impossible for employees to voluntarily put in extra effort to do something beneficial for the leader. In addition, narcissistic leaders can abuse their power to reinforce their own needs, and the bullying and oppression of employees can reduce employees' self-perception (Martinez et al., 2008) . In conclusion, the destructive leadership behaviors exhibited by narcissistic leaders will dampen employees' work enthusiasm and seriously threaten their self-concepts, which will further enhance the aggression of employee behaviors and reduce civic extra-role behaviors. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:",

Finally, narcissistic leaders often exhibit negative behaviors, such as bullying, hostility, denial, and criticism of employees, which damages the leader-employee exchange relationship (Haggard and Park, 2018) . A high-quality leader-employee exchange relationship is an important prerequisite for employees to gain personal space and acceptance in the organization (Zhao et al., 2014) . As a result, employees' perceived insider status will be reduced. Combined with the above analysis, the egotism, arrogance, and negative behaviors of the narcissistic leader make employees feel that they are not accepted by the leader or the organization, thus reducing their perceived insider status. Therefore, we present the following hypothesis:",

They are thus less likely to engage in extra-role behaviors (Stamper and Masterson, 2002) . In conclusion, we propose that leader narcissism should weaken employees' perceived insider status.

It can be seen from this definition that the need for self-esteem reflects, to some extent, the psychological intensity of the individual's fear of being rejected or ostracized by others. In other words, the need for self-esteem is an embodiment of feelings of selfworth, which will be affected by the attention and perceptions of others. Studies have indicated that, compared to individuals with a low need for self-esteem, individuals with a high need for self-esteem are more likely to be high self-monitors, to be competitive and to have higher levels of achievement motivation (Hill, 1987; Fuller et al., 2006) . However, individuals vary in the extent to which they need self-esteem (Hill, 1987; Armeli et al., 1998) . Prior studies have shown that, to some extent, employees' need for self-esteem is hidden in their identification with their leaders and organizations and differs among different individuals (Hill, 1987; Armeli et al., 1998) .

When employees with a high need for self-esteem are faced with narcissistic leaders, they are more sensitive to negative behaviors such as exploitation and suppression of employees. Thus, they will feel more ostracized by their leaders (Abrams and Hogg, 1988) , and their perceived insider status will be greatly reduced. Conversely, employees with a low need for self-esteem are not afraid of rejection from others because their feelings of self-worth are based more on self-perception than on external evaluations and opinions (Fuller et al., 2006) . In other words, outsiders' opinions and evaluations are less likely to influence the extent to which employees with a low need for self-esteem tie their self-concept to the organization (Shen et al., 2009) . Thus, employees with a low need for self-esteem do not care as much about rejection and negative evaluation and have a high tolerance for ostracism from the surrounding environment. Therefore, a low need for self-esteem can weaken the negative relationship between leader narcissism and perceived insider status.

Therefore, in light of the above hypothesis and theoretical derivation, we further propose a \"first-stage\" moderated mediation (Edwards and Lambert, 2007) : the mediating effect of perceived insider status between leader narcissism and employee OCB-L is moderated by the need for self-esteem. Specifically, when employees have a high need for self-esteem, their perceived insider status is more likely to be weakened by leader narcissism, thus reducing OCB-L. By contrast, when employees have a low need for selfesteem, the influence of leader narcissism on their perceived insider status is limited, so it does not necessarily reduce OCB-L. Thus, taking hypothesis 3 and hypothesis 4 together, we propose: relationship between leader narcissism and employee OCB-L, such that the mediation effect is stronger when the need for self-esteem is high.",

To ensure the authenticity and accuracy of the data, assurances of anonymity and confidentiality were given to respondents on the front page of the questionnaire, together with a brief outline of how their responses would be used. To decrease common method bias, data were collected in two phases, 1 month apart. Matching questionnaires were distributed to leaders and employees, with each leader rating one employee. At time 1, employees filled out a questionnaire that included items measuring leader narcissism and demographic information. At this stage, a total of 210 questionnaires were sent out and 196 questionnaires were returned. One month later, at time 2, the 196 employees who completed the first-stage survey were asked to evaluate their need for self-esteem and perceived insider status. Meanwhile, their leaders reported their demographic information and rated their employees' OCB-L. At this stage, a total of 196 questionnaires were sent out and 183 questionnaires were returned. After incomplete and invalid questionnaires were eliminated, we finally obtained 161 valid two-stage matched leader-employee dyads, with an effective response rate of 76.7%. For leaders, 72.7% were male, with an average age of 40.2 years (SD = 8.74) and an average tenure in the organization of 9.44 years (SD = 6.80); 64.6% had a bachelor's degree or above. For employees, 60.9% were male, with an average age of 30.8 years (SD = 6.99) and an average number of working years with leaders in the organization of 2.46 (SD = 2.37); 64.6% have worked with their direct leaders for more than 1 year, and the maximum and minimum number of working years with leaders are 15 and 0.08 respectively; 54.7% had a bachelor's degree or above.",

Model 2 showed that after controlling demographic variables, leader narcissism had a significantly negative impact on perceived insider status (\u03b2 = \u22120.458, p < 0.001), supporting hypothesis 2. Similarly, on the basis of Model 4, we added leader narcissism into the model (Model 5). Model 5 showed that leader narcissism had a significantly negative impact on employee OCB-L (\u03b2 = \u22120.181, p < 0.05). Hence, hypothesis 1 was supported. Moreover, Model 6 showed that after controlling demographic variables, perceived insider status had a significantly positive impact on employee OCB-L (\u03b2 = 0.385, p < 0.001), supporting hypothesis 3. Comparing Model 5 and Model 7, after the introduction of perceived insider status, the coefficient of the impact of leader narcissism on employee OCB-L was decreased and insignificant (\u03b2 = \u22120.181, p < 0.05, Model 5; \u03b2 = \u22120.006, n.s., Model 7). Meanwhile, perceived insider status still had a significantly positive impact on employee OCB-L (\u03b2 = 0.382, p < 0.001). The results revealed that perceived insider status had a complete mediating effect between leader narcissism and employee OCB-L. Hypothesis 4 was supported. To verify the robustness of the mediating effect, we used Model 4 in the PROCESS macro of Hayes (2013) to verify the results. Based on 5,000 bootstrapping samples, the results showed that the indirect effect of leader narcissism on employee OCB-L via perceived insider status was significant (indirect effect = \u22120.127, 95% CI = [\u22120.211, \u22120.056], excluding 0), thus hypothesis 4 was further supported. We conducted a three-step hierarchical regression analysis to test the moderation effect of the need for self-esteem. To reduce multicollinearity problems, we first centralized the independent variable and moderator variable before forming the interaction term according to the method of Aiken and West (1991) . As shown in Model 3 in Table 3 , the interaction between leader narcissism and the need for self-esteem was significantly and negatively related to perceived insider status (\u03b2 = \u22120.182, p < 0.05). Hypothesis 5 was supported. Simple slope tests were also conducted to further verify the interpretation of this interaction (Aiken and West, 1991) . Figure 2 plotted the relationship between leader narcissism and perceived insider status at one SD above and below the mean of the need for self-esteem. The results showed that for employees with a high need for self-esteem (one SD above the mean), the negative relationship between leader narcissism and perceived insider status was stronger (\u03b2 = \u22120.541, p < 0.001). Conversely, for employees with a low need for self-esteem (one SD below the mean), the negative relationship between leader narcissism and perceived insider status was weaker and not significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.200, n.s.). These results provided additional support for hypothesis 5.",

Prior studies have explored the relationship between leader narcissism and employees' workplace behaviors, such as helping behavior (Carnevale et al., 2018) , voice behavior (Liao et al., 2019b; Huang et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020) , innovation behavior (Yang et al., 2020; Norouzinik et al., 2021) , and proactive behavior (Liao et al., 2019a) . However, these employees' workplace behaviors are either intended to help their colleagues or to promote organizational development and improvement. By contrast, these studies have neglected leader-directed behaviors. Because employee OCB-L can meet narcissistic leaders' unique needs (Gerstner et al., 2013) and is good for forming a benign interaction between leaders and employees , so it is of great importance to explore how leader narcissism affects employee OCB-L. Our results indicate that leader narcissism will reduce employee OCB-L. This study enriches and supplements prior researches on the dark side influence of leader narcissism and contributes to the literature on leader narcissism and employees' followership behavior. Second, this study proposed and tested the mediating role of perceived insider status between leader narcissism and employee OCB-L and revealed the internal mechanism underlying that relationship. By reviewing the prior literatures on the effects of leader narcissism on employees' behaviors, our study concluded that most scholars have mainly followed three perspectives: the social exchange perspective (O'Boyle et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2019b) , the conservation of resources perspective (Huang et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020; Norouzinik et al., 2021) and the social cognitive perspective Aboramadan et al., 2021) . Although existing studies have helped us to understand the influencing mechanism of leader narcissism on employees' behaviors from different perspectives, no research to date has explored it from the perspective of self-concept. Our results show that employees' perceived insider status plays a full mediating role in the impact of leader narcissism on employee OCB-L, providing an explanatory mechanism for the influencing effect of leader narcissism from the self-concept perspective. Therefore, this study not only expands the research perspective of the leader narcissism literature but also enriches our understanding of the internal mechanism of the influence of leader narcissism on employee OCB-L in the organizational context. Finally, this study examined and confirmed the moderating role of the need for self-esteem and revealed the boundary conditions under which leader narcissism influences employee OCB-L through perceived insider status. Based on the perspective of leaders, many studies have shown that leader humility (Owens et al., 2015) , leader consultation (Carnevale et al., 2018) , and leader effectiveness (Liu et al., 2021) can mitigate the harmful effects of leader narcissism on employees' behaviors and job performance. However, few studies have explored whether the employees' need for self-esteem has a contingency effect on leader narcissism. Because employees have different individual characteristics, the effectiveness of the influence of leadership often varies from person to person. By introducing the need for self-esteem as a moderator variable, our results show that a high need for self-esteem strengthens the negative effect of leader narcissism on perceived insider status and enhances the indirect effect of perceived insider status on leader narcissism and employee OCB-L. This further suggests that employees' traits play a critical role in determining how employees experience leader narcissism. This study deepens our understanding of the complexities underlying employees' reactions toward leader narcissism and provides a new way for employees to deal with leader narcissism.",

            "text": "Our study has significant implications for managerial practices. First, our results show that leader narcissism negatively affects employee OCB-L. Therefore, organizations and leaders should take effective measures to prevent the negative effects of leader narcissism. On the one hand, organizations should prevent leaders from narcissism at the source. For example, narcissistic personality tests can be used in the selection and promotion of leaders to identify candidates with high levels of narcissism and negative traits. Organizations can evaluate and supervise the use of leaders' power and reduce the possibility of narcissistic leaders abusing their power for personal gain. Humility is an interpersonal and epistemic stance (D'Errico, 2020), which plays an important role in crisis management (Scardigno et al., 2021) and has a tempering effect on narcissism (Owens et al., 2015) . Thus, organizations should provide leadership behavior training courses and promote humble leadership behavior. On the other hand, leaders should face up to their own characteristics, correct their attitudes, words, and deeds as leaders, seek advantages and avoid disadvantages, and restrain their narcissism. Moreover, in the management process, leaders should never forget their original intention, be modest and prudent, and trust, support, and affirm the abilities and contributions of employees. Second, our results show that leader narcissism negatively affects employee OCB-L through the mediating role of perceived insider status. That is to say, when employees perceive themselves to be insiders of the organization, they will show more OCB-L. Therefore, organizations should use specific human resource management initiatives to enhance employees' identity recognition as insiders of the enterprise. Enterprise leaders should try to convey supportive signals to employees through human resource management policies and actions, such as providing skills training and encouraging employees to participate in decisionmaking. They should also implement all policies and regulations fairly, treat every employee equally, show more care and trust for employees, and give employees more autonomy and flexibility in their work. In a word, effective measures should be taken to make employees feel valued and recognized by leaders and the organization and to enhance perceived insider status, so as to foster more OCB-L.",

In other words, the higher the need for self-esteem, the stronger the negative impact of leader narcissism on OCB-L through perceived insider status. Therefore, leaders should implement differentiated management for employees and give more trust and positive evaluations to employees with a high need for self-esteem. These actions will mitigate the negative impact of leader narcissism on perceived insider status. In addition, our results indicate that a low need for self-esteem can alleviate the negative impact of leader narcissism on employee OCB-L via perceived insider status. It means that employees with a low need for self-esteem deal with narcissistic leaders effectively. Therefore, organization should pay attention to understand the level of employees' need for self-esteem to better realize leader-member fit and generate positive interactions.",

First, this study was conducted in China, a culture characterized by a highly collectivistic orientation and high power distance (House et al., 2004) . It is questionable, therefore, whether its findings can be generalized to other cultures. For example, in low power distance cultures, employees may have different understandings of leader narcissism and its influence would be different. Hence, future studies could test our theoretical model in different cultures to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of leader narcissism. Second, although we collected leader-employee dyadic data at two time points, causality could not be unambiguously established. Hence, future studies could use an experimental design to better test the causal relationships among the variables we studied. Finally, this study only focused on the moderating effect of the need for self-esteem at the individual level of employees, while the relationship between leader narcissism and perceived insider status may be moderated by many factors at the leadership level and the organizational level. Hence, future studies can build a multi-level model for further exploration.",
