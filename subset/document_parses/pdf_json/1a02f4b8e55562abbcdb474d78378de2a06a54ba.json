            "text": "Background and Aims: An online teaching programme for Core Surgical Trainees (CSTs) was designed and delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and the reception of a fully online teaching programme. Methods: Twenty teaching sessions were delivered either via Zoom TM or were pre-recorded and uploaded onto a Google Classroom TM and YouTube TM website. Online feedback, delivered via Google Forms TM , were completed by CSTs following each teaching session. YouTube Studio TM analytics were used to understand patterns in viewing content. Results: 89.9% of trainees were satisfied with the teaching series. Trainees preferred short, weekly sessions (79%), delivered by senior surgeons, in the form of both didactical and interactive teaching. YouTube analytics revealed that the highest peak in views was documented on the weekend before the deadline for evidence upload on the Intercollegiate Surgical Collegiate Programme (ISCP) portfolio. Conclusion: An entirely online teaching programme is feasible and well-received by CSTs. Trainees preferred live, interactive, procedure-based, consultant-led sessions lasting approximately thirty minutes to one hour and covering a myriad of surgical specialties. This feedback can be used to improve future online surgical teaching regionally and nationally in order to gain training opportunities lost during the pandemic.",

            "text": "The World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11th 2020 causing significant alterations to most aspects of personal and professional life. 1,2 On March 23rd 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) government implemented social distancing rules requiring people to stay at home except for very limited purposes, close certain businesses and stop all gatherings of more than two people in public. 3 Consequently, surgical training was negatively affected nationwide with the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery and reduction in face-to-face lectures, practical teaching sessions and dedicated operative theatre time. 4 Two core surgical trainees (CSTs) alongside the Training Programme Director from the Yorkshire & Humber deanery in the UK designed an online teaching programme aimed at CSTs within the deanery. This was delivered by supervised CSTs, surgical registrars and consultants on a twice-weekly basis commencing April 22nd 2020. A consultant surgeon was allocated as supervising faculty for most teaching sessions. The purpose of the teaching programme was to promote high quality surgical education and facilitate on-going learning while maintaining engagement with the Intercollegiate Surgical Collegiate Programme (ISCP) portfolio. 5 The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of an entirely on-line teaching programme for CSTs. The secondary aims included (i) assessing the reception of the novel teaching method by trainees and (ii) identifying training needs in order to allow organisers to adapt accordingly when designing future sessions.",

            "text": "An entirely online teaching programme was feasible and well received by CSTs in the deanery of Yorkshire, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this survey are consistent with findings in previous educational studies. Current literature indicates that shorter interactive sessions can promote information retention and attentiveness of the trainees since adult attention spans can wane after 15 to 20 minutes and hence, Hopkins et al stated that millennials favour interactive shorter case discussions instead of a lecture in a 'flipped classroom' format. 8 This involves teamwork, debates, application and consolidation to promote a highly level of understanding and information retention. 8 Online teaching can be aided by the use of multimedia resources such as anatomy diagrams, intraoperative pictures and videos, in order to enhance learning. 9 As traditionally known, persons retain only 10-15% of what is read, 10-20% of what is heard and 20-30% of what is seen. However, retention increases to 40-50% with the combined use of audio-visual supplements. 10 In fact, Crawshaw et al stated that an instructional video before performing surgery may reduce the learning curve of trainees and improve patient safety. 11 Gilbert et al highlighted the benefit of educational websites to facilitate unlimited distribution of information to students using web links with the benefits of convenience, efficiency in learning, unlimited viewing, and the ability to access physical distance. 12 Hands-on simulation training is paramount in surgical education and this would form a vital part of resumption to usual trainee skill acquisition. Kolsanov et al highlighted that simulation offers outstanding learning opportunities in a safe environment without negative patient outcomes. 13 Limitations This study has some limitations. The teaching programme was voluntary, aimed to facilitate learning during the pandemic and enable CSTs to deliver teaching sessions as required by the ISCP curriculum. However, reflecting on teaching sessions on the ISCP portfolio as encouraged by the Deanery, appeared to be the major motivating factor as discussed above. This resulted in a low survey response rate. Going forward, the recording of attendance might increase trainee engagement with the programme as well as improve the survey response rate. In addition, issuing certificates of attendance could improve engagement.",

There should be high consultant involvement, from a range of surgical specialties. Teaching sessions should be interactive, procedure-based and examfocused. The utilisation of online platforms, universally compatible with all devices, should aid tailoring of the teaching programme to trainees' learning needs. In addition, incentives in the form of completion certificates and attendance records, can increase trainee engagement. Finally, designated practical skills sessions should continue to be incorporated in the curriculum and the use of simulation models can facilitate this further in the future.",
