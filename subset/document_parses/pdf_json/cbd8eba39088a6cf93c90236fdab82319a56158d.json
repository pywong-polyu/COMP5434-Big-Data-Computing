Yet, the Russian military, rather than assisting to alleviate any pandemic suffering, has taken advantage of this global milieu by invading their sovereign neighbor Ukraine (albeit unlawfully according to international law), and thus regressing the world to a twentieth-century military and humanitarian catastrophe similar to WWII. Worse still, and ironically, the Russian slaughter and maiming of Ukraine citizens took place during the Para-Winter Olympics (March 4-12, 2022 )-a world event to encourage peace, diplomacy, equity and diversity (Bengel, 2022) . Dutta (2022) speculates that like the dogmatic fervor and conquests of Saint Vladimir the 1st, 1 one of the many reasons for this current military exploitation is religious aspirations-that is, to fully reverse the Marxist-Lenin-Stalin failed Soviet Union by attempting to make Russia 'great again' through reclaiming the religious, historical and strategic territory of Ukraine. Whatever the reasons, the consequences, have been horrendous for many Ukrainian Orthodox and Ukraine citizens of other faiths (e.g., Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, Buddhists, Jews, Sikhs and Hindus). Thus far it would seem that the invasion has possibly breached various internationals laws of armed conflict (LOAC: e.g., 'disproportionate' violence-that is, 'laying to waste' land and resources, plus the eradication of people from their homeland for purely political/military advantage-as well as the deliberate 'targeting of civilians' and unnecessary suffering of humanity).

Likewise, (ii) Aiken's research exploring Australian chaplaincy support of healthcare staff at a Women's and Children's hospital in Adelaide, also confirms the important place of chaplaincy, particularly with regard to chaplaincy presence, professional conduct and relational support for healthcare staff. Also, (iii) an article from Poland discusses how chaplains and other spiritual carers are often overlooked and not given credit for the considerable work that they have done and are still doing during COVID-19: 'We are also here': Spiritual care practitioners' experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

It affirms the substantial role that chaplains can have in the rehabilitation of military veterans suffering a moral injury using a developing method called 'pastoral narrative disclosure' (PND). A paper by Fleming (v) on 'complex moral injury' (C-MI), distinct from 'standard moral injury' (S-MI), highlights the challenges of understanding moral injury and affirms the potential role of chaplains. Likewise, an international review by Jones and Phelps et al. (vi) on 'moral injury, chaplaincy and mental health provider approaches to intervention', details a variety of tested treatment programs for addressing moral injury-by clinicians and chaplains.",

It confirms the active involvement of chaplains providing care, but the decision making of who receives that care, is likely to be influenced/biased by healthcare staff. Thus, preferential spiritual care is often 'triaged' to those patients having a religious affiliation and/or prioritized to those of high care need. This suggests that other patients (e.g., non-religious/non-critical) may receive limited spiritual care or completely miss out on the benefit of a chaplaincy referral-even if the patient wanted spiritual care. There is clearly a need for systematic, reliable and valid screening of patients for spiritual needs, but perhaps there is also a need to further educate clinical staff about chaplaincy.",

Also, those with no R/S identity were more likely to report presumed negative assumptions about their R/S needs by hospital staff. The researchers conclude that even for a non-religious population, it is important to consider religious/spiritual needs.

Their review occurs in light of the Western cultural milieu where some have argued that having faith-based chaplaincy limits the utilization of chaplaincy in populations with high rates of 'no religion.' However, according to Layson et al., the premise purported by some that 'non-religious people do not utilize religious chaplaincy within the military'-does not seem to be completely accurate, or at least lacks evidence within the extant refereed literature. Layson et al.'s review acknowledges that there are a number of 'enablers' and 'barriers' for people utilizing religious chaplaincy within the military, which need to be recognized. They report, however, that there is little evidence that religiosity forms a substantial barrier to chaplaincy utilization within the military, other than for those who may lack awareness of what a chaplain is or does. Instead, other factors, such as a lack of availability/access, negative experience with individual chaplains or insufficient integration/recognition of chaplaincy in other military support services, pose a much more significant barrier to chaplaincy utilization than religiosity. Importantly, enablers for utilizing chaplains were found among those who have high acuity distress, are part of minority groups, or have had positive experiences with chaplains. Predominantly, the refereed literature indicates that traditional religious chaplaincy within the military remains very much valued, and indeed, non-religious military personnel will utilize military religious chaplaincy if it is available/accessible.",
