We assessed how this new format influences anxiety and the impact of a targeted course on candidates' confidence levels. Methods: A mixed-methods national teaching programme including online bespoke mock interviews was delivered to prospective Academic Foundation Programme applicants. Preand post-interview questionnaires assessed anxiety levels subjectively and using a Measure of Anxiety in Selection Interviews (MASI) scores. Results: Individuals self-reported greater confidence, experience and preference for interviews delivered in-person as compared to online interviews. Post-course, there was an increase in self-reported confidence specific to online interviews (p = 0.009) and lower MASI scores in three of five domains, indicating reduced anxiety (social anxiety: p = 0.004, performance anxiety: p <0.001, behavioral anxiety: p = 0.003). Conclusion: A structured course can increase confidence and reduce anxiety for online academic medicine interviews.",

Online interviewing among medical trainees has been previously trialled in speciality interviews in the United States and has been well received by both faculty members and prospective applicants, but the impact on the junior and largely unexperienced cohort of final year medical students is currently unclear. 9 Additionally, whilst many resources on improving application scores and maximizing performance in medical interviews have been devised to date, few guides have been published for online interviews and, to the best of our knowledge, no such materials specifically tailored at applicants for junior clinical academic posts in the UK exist. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] In this study, we built on our experience of delivering teaching using an online platform 15, 16 and designed a focused full-day course aimed specifically at improving candidate's performance in academic clinical interviews conducted online in these unprecedented times.

The interviews were followed by 5 minutes of personalized feedback from the interviewer focusing on the aspects of performance unique to the online format.

In contrast to this, interview-based selection may provide a standardized way of comparing the performance of all candidates using the same strictly defined metrics, thus alleviating some of the bias in the selection process. The results of our study suggest that the online format of the AFP interviews imposed for the first time on the 2020/2021 cohort may, at least partially, defeat this goal. We identify that although experience in in-person interviews was ubiquitous, less than half of individuals had ever had an online interview. Individuals concordantly reported significantly lower confidence in online interviews, suggesting that the lower confidence in interviews may be due to unfamiliarity with the format. The baseline scores varied greatly between different individuals, which is expected given that both confidence and self-esteem levels are multi-factorial. 20 Crucially, however, we found that attendance at a oneday structured online course improved confidence in online interview performance and led to a reduction in three out of five key anxiety domains assessed by the MASI tool. As a content-rich course delivered online is an intervention that could be relatively easily executed UK-wide, our study suggests that effective tools to address this problem already exist.",

Thus, a larger study that included more participants of more diverse academic backgrounds might enhance the generalizability of our results. However, the AFP programme itself selects for highly motivated individuals and our results are thus likely to be applicable to the cohort of UK students interested in the academic pathway. 22 Additionally, our course participants came from 17 different medical schools indicating comprehensive coverage across UK universities. Another limitation could be that in a few cases, we could not link the answers to pre-course and post-course questionnaires due to insufficient demographic information. The methodology could be further improved by allocating a unique identifier to each study participant before the commencement of the course, so that answers to all three questionnaires can be reliably linked.",

Furthermore, at present, it is unclear when the in-person interview format for the UK's academic pathways will be restored. As a simple and effective tool to improve confidence and reduce some of the anxiety associated with changes in academic pathway selection that were imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic exist, we believe that implementation of a similar tool in the curriculum of medical schools across the UK could go a long way in reducing the bias and increasing the likelihood of selecting the candi-dates that are most suitable for the academic training posts.",
