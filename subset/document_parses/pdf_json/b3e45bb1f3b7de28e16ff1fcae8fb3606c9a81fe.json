[1] [2] [3] [4] Emphasising this challenge, national UK data were initially collated via the Patient Notification System, requiring a positive swab test up until 28 April 2020 but revised to include clinical definitions given an estimated false-negative testing rate of up to 29%. [5] [6] [7] [8] Wellestablished primary care databases may have significant inaccuracy and do not include hospital secondary care information. 9 A large UK primary care epidemiological study also used national COVID-19-positive (SARS-CoV-2) swab cases for case definition. 2 Conversely, secondary care case series and international registry studies for specific diseases are not linked to primary care data sets. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Numerous studies have described the risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality, which have been from primary care, secondary care and meta-analyses. 15 16 Although these studies describe risk factors for severity, admission and mortality with COVID-19 infection, they typically use either large secondary care or primary care data sources, without amalgamating these data. Therefore, important caveats exist in using and interpreting such data and drawing clinically important conclusions regarding the adverse associations of ethnicity with outcomes. 2 17 Our objective, therefore, was to establish a tightly governed comprehensive, multisource, integrated, quality-assured local structured clinical data set, used for purposes of direct care; to define cohorts at risk; to systematically improve clinical coding and mortality-recording accuracy; to enable an informed understanding of factors influencing hospital activity, including admissions; and especially to describe variations in COVID-19 outcomes in relation to local risks within a well-defined but diverse single-city area. This approach should ultimately inform public health initiatives. We present a proof-of-principle study to evaluate the utility of this approach in relation to a single UK city-wide health district, reporting our findings regarding population-wide factors that may have an association with two key COVID-19 outcomes, hospital admission and mortality, over the first 12 weeks of the pandemic in this city.",

The final total population aged >18 years was 228 632, of whom 1063 were resident but not Wolverhampton General Practitioner (GP) registered, 1521 were registered but not city resident and 1026 were neither resident nor registered from immediately surrounding areas with an emergency admission to NXH, such that 99.5% of the cohort were registered and/or resident constituting 88% of COVID-19 admissions (CA) and 91% of COVID-19 deaths. The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was allocated according to postcode. Unavailable smoking status (15%) was reallocated to 'non-smoker' (recognising that this is an assumption which may potentially introduce slight bias). Missing body mass index (BMI) (22%) was replaced by age-related (5-year band) mean value in the cohort. Ethnicity data from all sources were reviewed, and only unambiguous data were accepted and recoded into Caucasian (white), South Asian, black, mixed ethnicity and Chinese, with 7.5% remaining 'unknown'. Comorbidities were accrued and cross-checked from primary care and hospital coding to include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke and peripheral arterial disease, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cancer, dementia, depression, other mental health disorders, epilepsy, learning difficulties, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and recorded nursing home residency and palliative care status. Nonelective admissions over the preceding 12 months were ascertained. During admission, the COVID-19 clinical status was recorded by the Infection Diseases team or the clinical team in daily updates as 'COVID-19 definite', 'COVID-19 probable' or 'not COVID-19'. Formal end point coding was in duplicate, with a rolling triangulation audit in place comparing the clinical diagnosis, the coded diagnosis and the COVID-19 pathology status for coding accuracy. Mortality and cause of death were certified in our Medical Examiner System and also were continuously cross-checked against the coded status. COVID-19 coding and death certification arbitration were supported by the accountable senior responsible consultant (AV). Further validation against the National Strategic Tracing Service captured deaths outside hospital.",

Directly comparing CHD with NCHD confirmed a significantly increased association with black ethnicity (OR 4.6 (2 to 10.2), p<0.003), diabetes (OR 1.5 (1 to 2.3), p<0.005) and CKD (OR 1.6 (1.1 to 2.3), p<0.004) and an even greater negative association with current or previous smoking (OR 0.1 (0 to 0.3), p<0.002). Specifically for COVID-19 death, table 2 shows numbers, percentages, absolute risk and excess risk with unadjusted ORs for the ethnic minorities compared with the white group, and figure 2A shows the distribution of mortality outcome by ethnic category (\u03c7 2 =126.1, p<0.001). The absolute risk of COVID-19 death was 1.32, 0.73 and 2.2 per 1000 population in the white, South Asian and black ethnic groups, and the excess risk was \u22120.61 (negative) and 0.85 deaths per 1000 population in the South Asian and black versus white group, respectively. Compared with the white population, the unadjusted OR (95% CI) for COVID-19 death for the black and Asian groups was 1.6 (1.2 to 2.3) and 0.5 (0.4 to 0.8), respectively (both p<0.01). The ethnic groups differed significantly in age (white, 50\u00b120; South Asian, 45\u00b116; black, 45\u00b117 years; F=1868.9, p<0.001), and age was the dominant factor associated with hospital admission and death (tables 1 and 3-5). To avoid any potential misrepresentation of mortality outcomes by statistical age adjustment, the absolute effects were considered for the oldest quintile only where 84% of all COVID-19 deaths occurred, in which case the ORs were as follows: black, 3.9 (2.7 to 5.6) (p<0.001) and South Asian, 0.9 (0.6 to 1.4) (p=0.72, ns) (figure 2B).",

In a study Table 5 Multinomial regression of mortality outcomes over the 12-week period for those who died (n=1093) either in the community (n=537) or non-COVID-19-related (n=284) and COVID-19-related (n=272) hospital deaths (HD) (see Open access from New York, there was no adverse ethnicity signal, 12 13 and early reported adverse ethnicity outcomes in the 2009 UK influenza pandemic 24 did not withstand subsequent review. 25 We find that our black population had significantly higher and the South Asian population lower crude and adjusted CA rates compared with the white population, also observing that both ethnic subgroups had lower non-COVID-19 hospital admissions, further contextualising the strong effect in the black cohort. In both groups, their crude and adjusted patterns of COVID-19 mortality mirrored that of COVID-19 hospital admission, but from the numerical base of CA, there was no significant difference between the black and South Asian groups compared with the white group, highlighting pitfalls of examining effects in isolation. Our data in the black population are broadly in keeping with some studies showing excess COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality, but the South Asian group's lower absolute and adjusted rate of admission and death from COVID-19 are strikingly different. Given the variation in findings to date, we do not consider this an 'unexpected finding' and hypothesise that many local population factors are at play, including population density, family size, housing, duration of immigration, country of birth (including UK born) and occupation, and the precise ethnic group within the 'South Asian' population may well be of importance. A recent updated analysis by the UK Office for National Statistics has emphasised that 'ethnic differences in mortality involving COVID-19 are most strongly associated with demographic and socio-economic factors, such as place of residence and occupational exposures, and cannot be explained by pre-existing health conditions', which conclusion is consistent with our locally dictated findings. 26 Otherwise within Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, we find specific individual comorbidities vary in their association with COVID-19 risks: in South Asians, these are diabetes, peripheral vascular disease and atrial fibrillation; in the Black population, hypertension, atrial fibrillation and cardiac failure; in white ethnicity, most comorbidities but in particular COPD, chronic kidney disease and RA.",

            "text": "Combining Wolverhampton's health data enabled us to evaluate our local population's heterogeneous demographic factors and their associations with community or hospital NCA and CA and mortality, by uniquely approaching these outcomes simultaneously. This local nuance complements larger studies, informing appraisal of risk from an urban and multiethnic and deprived setting, highlighting concerns of extrapolation from larger data sets to UK localities. An example of a particular strength of the data quality was the cross-check ascertainment of CA, without sole reliance on COVID-19 testing, permitting specific categorisation of deaths (COVID-19, non-COVID-19 and postdischarge) rather than less accurately into global mortality. Limitations of the study This is a 12-week evaluation spanning the pandemic's upsurge and peak; the population and event number were comparatively small; the cause of death in the community was unknown, and it is likely that people died away from the hospital undiagnosed with COVID-19. A further weakness of the study is that there were some missing data, but this was very limited in magnitude and only affected three variables: BMI, smoking and ethnicity. We are confident that these were dealt with appropriately; for BMI, it is as described in Methods; for smoking, we coded all unknown smoking as non-smokers on the very likely assumption that the vastly greater majority were non-smokers, whereas missing ethnicity was coded as 'unknown' and analysed as such. Given the degree of completeness rather than incompleteness of our data, we consider our approach approximates to a complete case analysis, arising from significant effort on multisource data accrual, integration and quality. We thus do not feel that multiple imputation should be applied to replace missing data, since we do not feel this can possibly improve precision. In so doing, we are thus also avoiding the greater and well-recognised potential to introduce bias from poorly fitting imputation models. 27 We consider this to be a strength of the article. One further consideration is that while being aligned to the population at 99.5% concordance, hospital data were not totally drawn from the city population, which varied by GP registration, residency or admission from immediately surrounding areas, and a small proportion of admissions were non-resident or non-registered, so this is not strictly an epidemiological study but an observational study comparing defined cohorts in tiers of analysis (eg, COVID-19 death among CA) where this caveat does not apply. 28",

At our local level, CA and death were not strongly associated with worsening deprivation, with a novel potential different relationship in the white population. Higher absolute and adjusted CA and mortality occurred in the black population, whereas they were reduced in Wolverhampton's South Asian community. We point out the non-significant association between in-hospital COVID-19 case fatality and ethnicity, raising the probability that COVID-19 mortality relates to differential risks of exposure, susceptibility and disease contraction before hospital admission, let alone the possible avoidance of hospital admission. Two important considerations are the potential excessive use of multiple factors and the disruption of the perspective from a population's base through hospital admissions to COVID-19-specific admission, leading to widely varying conclusions and highlighting the difficulties of using observational data and the potential for collider bias. 29 We support the case for more localised population-based studies of both hospital admission and subsequent death, such as ours, in which the denominator and numerator populations can be clearly linked and are fully and transparently ascertained and characterised. To avoid associations in the data being due to the way in which data are sampled, local health economies should be mandated to link hospital and primary care data across their population level down to the unanonymised individual level; they should, in preparation for future epidemics, have data quality mechanisms in place to ensure accuracy in their demographics, the accrual of important missing data and the triangulation of key outcomes to minimise false-positive and false-negative results. This includes the need to have a robust, systematic, accurate and timely approach to the recording of death whether in the community or hospital setting. A defined data set and its capture in routine clinical systems seem apposite. 30 Accepting that variation in findings in different population subsets is both inevitable and valid, we would suggest the need for the public health and research community to accommodate uncertainty in emergent evidence, learning from the experience of previous viral pandemics. This includes the need to have a robust, systematic, accurate and timely approach to the recording of death whether in the community or hospital setting. 31 The conveyance of risk Public health messages are vital to convey, but populationadjusted risk rates may confuse, adversely impacting behaviours such that, it is feared, hospital admission patterns may change unfavourably. Absolute, absolute excess, relative, unadjusted and adjusted risk is complex to communicate even for healthcare professionals, making them susceptible to reasoning errors and misinterpretation of probabilities, 32 and individuals, with erstwhile health risk, should know about the magnitude of risk in a way that can be conceptualised. 33 34 For our black population, the full modelled OR for COVID-19 mortality was 2.1, with an absolute risk of 2.2/1000 people or an excess risk of 0.9/1000. A black person in Wolverhampton ought to be informed that 'twice as likely to die of COVID-19' compared with the white community can also mean 'a 1 in 1000 excess risk'.",

These are all matters in which the editorial and peer review mechanism of our medical journals have a vital role. Contributors BMS was accountable senior author; BMS, JB, SJD and AV helped with data analysis and manuscript writing; SJD, BMS and JB helped with preparation for submission; AV, BMS and VK ensured database quality and helped with data integration, and data quality and integration.
