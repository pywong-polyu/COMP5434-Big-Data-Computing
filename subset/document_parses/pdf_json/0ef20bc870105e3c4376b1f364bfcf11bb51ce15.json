With this in mind, I believe that this may be a propitious time to examine what I refer to as \"America's Silent Epidemic.\" For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that over 650,000 individuals in the United States will die of heart disease this year (2) . The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that obesity each year causes over 300,000 fatalities (3). Diabetes is listed as the cause of death for over 270,000",

Health disparities have played a role in the alarming racial and ethnic disparities related to COVID 19. Age-adjusted hospitalization rates for COVID 19 among native Americans and black Americans are between four and a half and five times that of white Americans (7). Hispanic Americans have also been disproportionately affected. Hispanic Americans are hospitalized at a rate approximately four times that of white Americans (7) . Moreover, the mortality of black Americans in a number of cities have been more than twice as high as the proportion of black residents in their geographic area. Both obesity and poor nutritional habits have contributed significantly to the disparities in how COVID 19 has affected Americans. Both obesity and poor nutrition are more common in disadvantaged populations than they are in more affluent ones (8) . Thus, COVID 19 has underscored issues of health equity in our country, an area that physicians need to seriously address. A number of medical organizations such as the American College of Physicians (9) and the American Heart Association (10) have already articulated positions in health equity (10) .",

The Dietary Guidelines for Americas 2020-2025 reports that Americans are not consuming enough whole grains, fruits and vegetables while consuming too much salt and sugar (13). In fact, poor diet has now surpassed tobacco use as the leading cause of preventable death (14) .
