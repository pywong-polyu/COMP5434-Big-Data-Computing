Indeed, these risk perceptions predict preventive behaviors in the context of infectious disease outbreaks [30] , including handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing in the context of COVID-19 [31] .

Nevertheless, smokers who perceive health consequences from smoking are more likely to quit [36, 37] . Among the U.S. general population, there is evidence of optimistic bias in relation to risk perceptions of COVID-19 [38] , as has been found for influenza [39] .

Mexico also has reported very low rates of testing, likely resulting in under-reporting of cases [43] . Furthermore, Mexico has a high prevalence of obesity [44] , hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [45] , all of which are risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection.

At each survey wave, approximately 1500 people participated, with quotas used to ensure a range of educational attainment (at least 500 with high school education or lower) and use of e-cigarettes in the prior month (at least 500 participants), with replacement strategies used to replenish the sample and maintain sample size. Dual users (i.e., smokers who also use e-cigarettes) were oversampled to address key research questions in the parent study. The present study included data from two survey waves: the first from March 16-26 of 2020 and the second from July 16-28 of 2020. There were two analytic samples: Sample A included the full sample of eligible participants (March n=1395, July n = 1358, total n = 2753). Sample B included a subsample of participants who responded to COVID-19 perception items (March n = 606, July n = 1193, total n = 1799).

After our data were collected, Mexico implemented a pictorial health warning label for cigarettes that illustrates and describes the increased severity of COVID-19 for smokers [65] .

In our sample, the vast majority of participants believed that COVID-19 would be more severe for smokers, consistent with another study in the USA [66] . This perception remained stable from March to July, perhaps reflecting inconsistent media coverage of the relationship between COVID-19 and smoking. During this time period, coverage included contradictory content both around the severity of COVID-19 for smokers and the potentially protective effects of nicotine against contracting it, which came out of tobacco-industry sponsored research [23] . Nevertheless, we found a significant increase in perceiving COVID-19 to be more severe for oneself compared to others, which may reflect the growing number of COVID-19 cases over this early period of the pandemic. While this perception did not appear to translate into reductions in COVID-19-related optimistic bias, this bias was present in more than half of participants. This result aligns with other studies showing that risk perceptions of COVID-19 among the general population have increased over the course of the pandemic, with findings indicating potential optimistic bias general population samples in multiple countries [31, 67] .",

Higher COVID-19 mortality among older populations has been highly increasingly publicized, which could explain this result [2] . Additionally, as the pandemic has continued to cause excess mortality, it is possible that perceptions are changing as participants witness the impact of COVID-19 on older populations. Female participants were more likely to perceive harm for smokers and for themselves, which is in line with previous research showing that female smokers tend to have higher smoking-related risk perceptions than male smokers [68, 69] . In our sample, daily smokers were more likely to perceive greater COVID-19 harm for themselves and were less likely to have optimistic bias. This is consistent with other research showing that smoking frequency and risk perception for smoking-related diseases are positively correlated [36] . Indeed, more frequent smokers may have experienced more smoking-related health symptoms. We also found that smokers who use e-cigarettes more frequently (i.e., dual users) were less likely to exhibit optimistic bias. One potential explanation for this finding is that more frequent dual users are in the process of switching to exclusive e-cigarette use [70] , perhaps because their perceptions of risk from smoking are relatively higher than exclusive smokers or less frequent dual users. This is an area for future research.",

            "text": "Although this study provides initial insights into how the initial stages of the pandemic impacted Mexican smokers' mental health, smoking behaviors, and risk perceptions, it has some limitations. Our convenience sample was recruited from a non-probability sample that over-represents higher SES consumers, and we included quotas to oversample e-cigarette users. Hence, it is not clear how our results generalize to the broader population of Mexican smokers. Additionally, our sample of participants that responded to risk perception items was significantly older and were more likely to be daily smokers and report a recent quit attempt, which may have biased our results. Future studies should examine these variables in a representative sample of smokers. There were some limitations to our measures as well. Our assessment was limited to perceived severity of COVID-19, not perceived susceptibility, which can be an important influence on behavior, or other dimensions of risk perception (i.e., probability, worry and feeling unsafe) [71] . Future research should consider other dimensions of perceived risk, especially given news coverage of nicotine protecting against contracting COVID-19. Additionally, our measures of perceived stress and depression have good measurement properties [54] [55] [56] but involve relatively few items. More comprehensive measurement of these domains may be more sensitive to COVID-related states. Additionally, we did not assess whether participants had previously contracted COVID-19 prior to the survey; therefore, we were unable to account for this in our analysis, which may have impacted risk perceptions. Nevertheless, the incidence of COVID-19 was relatively low at the time of data collection and would be unlikely to seriously affect our findings. Future studies measuring COVID-19 risk perceptions should evaluate the influence of experience with COVID-19. Additionally, the incorporation of location and differential spread of COVID-19 over time is an area for future research.",

Our results show that depression increased, smoking frequency and intensity remained stable, and quit attempts declined. Furthermore, while the perceived severity of COVID-19 for oneself increased, optimistic bias around the potential severity of COVID-19 infection was stable but prevalent. Together, these results suggest that Mexican adult smokers may face more difficulties with smoking cessation during COVID-19, perhaps partly due to its impact on their mental health. As COVID-19 spreads and cycles in and out, interventions may need to be developed to increase smokers' perceptions of the severity of COVID-19 for themselves, not just for smokers in general. Mexico recently introduced a cigarette pack warning label on COVID-19 severity among smokers [65] , and its impact on smokers' risk perceptions should be evaluated. It may also be important to develop smoking cessation interventions that recognize mental health issues related to COVID-19 and the apparent barriers they present for cessation. However, further research is needed to understand the influence of COVID-caused mental health issues on smoking cessation.
