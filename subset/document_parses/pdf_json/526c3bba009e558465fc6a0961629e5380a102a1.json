Acknowledging the critical role of the EKC for policy formulation and development strategies, this study has examined the validity of the EKC hypothesis by exploring the relationship between economic growth, urbanization, energy consumption, trade openness, human capital and ecological footprints for the period 1972-2018 in Bangladesh. The autoregressive distributive lag bounds testing approach is applied for this purpose, taking into account the structural break in the time series. A fully modified OLS estimation has also been applied as the robustness check of the results. Results from the empirical analysis confirm the existence of the EKC in Bangladesh in both the long run and short run. The causal nexus among the variables is examined by applying the Vector Error Correction Granger causality test. The causality test result shows that economic growth and urbanization cause ecological footprints in both the short run and the long run. Based on this result, it can be inferred that economic growth activities in Bangladesh can be continued and extended with minimal ecological cost through structural economic change and proper environmental management.",

Amidst the growing threat to human health due to the COVID 19 pandemic, the hidden dangers related to climatic and ecological changes should not be ignored since the socio-economic problems often result in socio-ecological problems. High dependence on modern technology, the intensive use of fossil energy, depletion of natural resources, increased industrial activities, rapid urbanization, and globalization are taking their toll by causing environmental damage and stressing the ecosystem. This can be described as the stress of human activity on nature Warner et al., 2010 ) that results in an increased level of pollution, and a decline in biological resources, and food production capabilities (Bagliani et al., 2008) . Therefore, deterioration in environmental quality has become a public concern and is increasingly gaining importance in the formulation of effective policy measures (Rahman et al., 2018) . The relationship between environmental degradation and influencing macroeconomic factors needs to be examined carefully to design effective economic and environmental policies Rahman et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Maximization of 'economic growth' is fundamental for all economies. However, it is also important to be concerned about the causal relationship between economic growth and the environmental degradation indicators since economic growth is often accompanied by environmental degradation (Narayan & Narayan, 2010; Ansari et al., 2020) . The nexus between degraded environmental quality and economic growth can better be described by the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, which has been utilized by researchers since the early 1990s. This hypothesis has provided insights into the economic research suggesting that economies should concentrate on their growth performance and environmental issues will automatically be resolved with the progression of growth (Kaika & Zervas, 2013) . Hence, the EKC hypothesis has been investigated in a number of ways and under different contexts by economic researchers in recent years (Wang et al., 2013) . Some studies have opined that the EKC hypothesis is not applicable to poor countries that are operating in their early stages of economic development and are uncertain about reaching the point where the relationship between income and pollution starts to become negative. These countries often compromise their environmental standards in order to attain international competitiveness and to attract investment for achieving the much-needed economic growth. As a result, economic growth comes with worsening environmental conditions in these low-income countries (See Al-Mulali et al., 2015; Asici & Acar, 2015) . But some other studies have opposed this idea (see Ulucak & Bilgili, 2018; Destek & Sarkodie, 2019) by confirming the EKC hypothesis for countries of all income groups, even for newly industrialized countries. These conflicting results in the application of the EKC hypothesis have caught the attention of economic and environmental researchers and influence them to work further on the EKC hypothesis since it is critical for policy formulation in the context of climate change and sustainable development (Destek & Sarkodie, 2019; Dinda, 2004) .",

The country officially graduated to the category of a lower-middle-income country in July 2015. During the last three decades, Bangladesh has maintained an annual economic growth rate of 6.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) per annum. Industrial growth and urbanization have contributed much to this growth. The target was to reach and then maintain the milestone of gross national income (GNI) per capita of over US$1046. To maintain this standard, Bangladesh needs to keep the annual GDP growth rate at 7-8 percent in the next decade and the target may increase further due to the COVID 19 global pandemic-induced economic downturn since last year (BER, 2019; UN, 2016) . The economic activities that are needed to achieve this growth target will impose a further cost on the environment, while Bangladesh has already scored among the lowests (29.56) in the environmental performance index of the year 2018 among 180 countries of the world (Rahman et al., 2020) . Pollution, environmental health risks, and vulnerability to climatic change are the issues of concern for Bangladesh (WB, 2018). Environmental pollution imposes a multidimensional impact on ecological systems , and hence, the ecological footprint has been considered in this study as an indicator of environmental degradation for Bangladesh.",

            "text": "The EKC hypothesis has been investigated in this study for Bangladesh using the ecological footprint. This study finds it relevant to evaluate the economic growth-environmental degradation nexus at the conjunction of its ongoing effort to ensure economic up gradation. Very few studies are available in relation to Bangladesh's environment and ecology with conclusive results (Islam & Shahbaz, 2012; Rahman & Kashem, 2017; Rahman et al., 2018) . The findings of this study are expected to contribute to the EKC literature with some policy suggestions that will help to minimize the level of environmental degradation during the period of extended economic activities. The major contributions of this research are: Firstly, it will investigate the economic growth and environmental degradation nexus in a more representative manner by using the ecological footprint (EF from hereafter) as a variable of interest which is a superior measure of environmental degradation and able to capture its multidimensional impact . The advantage of this accounting-based indicator is that it is able to capture typically complex resource use patterns, recognize the complementarity between natural capital and economic development where humans are acknowledged as dependent on the ecosystem (Costanza, 2000; Moffatt, 2000) . Therefore, analysis based on ecological footprint is relevant for the countries like Bangladesh that focus more on natural resources to extract the comparative advantage (Sarkodie & Strezov, 2018) . This can provide better policy insights in the context of a faster pace of increase in global ecological footprint, particularly in Asia Danish et al., 2020 , Bilgili & Ulucak, 2019 Lin et al., 2018) . Secondly, using primary energy consumption as an explanatory variable this study will assess the impact of all types of energy consumption on the environment in Bangladesh. Thirdly, adding human capital, based on education and earning capabilities, into the model, the socio-economic aspect is tried to be captured, to find out the overall impact on human ecological demand in Bangladesh. Fourthly, Robust empirical findings will unveil the dynamic impact of economic growth on the ecological degradation process and identify its causal factors to contribute to the environmental impact system (EIS) in Bangladesh which needs to be improved (Kabir & Momtaz, 2012) .",

EF has attracted the attention of the researchers in investigations of the economic growth-environmental degradation nexus where a significant portion of studies have attempted to test the EKC hypothesis mentioned by Grossman and Kruger (1991) . The inverted U-shaped EKC reveals the potential association between a country's economic growth and ecological degradation. The EKC is considered to be a byproduct of the convergence process to the sustainable development path by the 'green Solow model' proposed by Brock and Taylor (2010) . The rudimentary concept of the EKC elaborates that countries at their early stage of development disrupt the quality of environment through their economic activities aiming to achieve growth. These pre-industrial (primary-sector based) countries operate at the initial level (upward sloping) of the EKC. However, when continued economic growth boosts the industrial economy and growth-led increase in income approaches to achieve a threshold level of per capita income, countries (middle-income countries) arrive at the next level of the EKC. Further increases of per capita income in the post-industrial economy (mostly tertiary sectorbased) lead the countries to the desired level of EKC (downward sloping) where the ecological condition starts to improve (Lawson et al., 2020; Suki et al., 2020) .",

The most recent study by Alt\u0131nta\u015f and Kassouri (2020) has examined the EKC hypothesis using both CO 2 and EF for 14 European countries and finds only EF as a compatible tool to predict the EKC. Using EF as an environmental degradation indicator, Ansari et al. (2020) have established the EKC relationship for Central and East Asian countries while using material footprints (MFs) the relationship is established for all other Asian countries under investigation except central Asia. Examining the development dynamics of 11 newly industrialized countries the EKC hypothesis is supported for Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, and South Africa, while U-shaped relation is projected for China, India, South Korea, Thailand, and Turkey by Destek and Sarkodie (2019) . In a study on randomly selected countries by income groups, Ulucak and Bilgili (2018) have confirmed the existence of the EKC hypothesis for low-income, middle-income and high-income countries. The studies of Danish and Wang (2019) and Danish et al. (2020) have found evidence in favor of the Environmental Kuznets relationship between income and EF for the Next 11 countries and BRICS countries, respectively. EKC has also been established in the Malaysian economy by Suki et al. (2020) after investigating the impact of globalization. Natural resources have been found to be helpful in supporting the EKC hypothesis, and these resources have a positive effect on the ecological footprint. The study by Hassan et al. (2019) has revealed this with a bidirectional causal link between natural resources and ecological footprints in Pakistan. Employing the production and import component of ecological footprint data, A\u015fici and Acar (2015) have also detected an EKC relationship between per capita income and footprint of domestic production for 116 countries. Import footprints have been found to be increasing monotonically with income in this study that focuses on the importance of environmental regulations to influence import decisions of the countries.",

(2020b) using EF. Aydin et al. (2019) have also failed to establish the EKC hypothesis between the types of ecological footprints and economic development for 26 European countries. The empirical investigation of this study has found that income changes affect different ecological footprints differently for various sub-footprints and there is a threshold effect of income per capita on types of ecological footprint. Zhang (2019) has failed to find any evidence of EKC for ninety-three countries of Central Asia. Investigating 15 EU countries, found no inverted U-relationship. In Vietnam, Al-Mulali et al. (2015) found no existence of the EKC hypothesis; rather it was found to be positive for both the short run and the long run. Wang et al. (2013) also found no evidence of EKC for 150 countries while investigating the dependence of domestic environmental performance on the characteristics of neighboring states. No evidence of the EKC relationship was found by Caviglia-Harris et al. (2009) , and EF was found to be increasing at an increasing rate due to energy use in both rich and poor countries. A consumption-based line of inquiry on EKC by Bagliani et al. (2008) also found no evidence of inverted U-shape behavior for 141 countries. Rather, this study revealed an unbounded growth of environmental pressure with an increase in per capita GDP. The EKC relationship was also investigated in the context of environmental efficiency and its relation to economic growth by Halkos and Tzeremes (2009) for 17 OECD countries by applying a DEA window analysis but failed to observe inverted U. This study made a claim not only for growth, but also for the path of growth to ensure environmental protection.

Using linear, quadratic and log models, the study has confirmed a monotonic increasing relationship between growth and each of the environmental attributes. However, this study has not controlled the influence of other factors contributing to the environment. Existing studies on the EKC based on carbon emissions level in Bangladesh have provided contradictory results (see Rahman et al., 2020; Alam, 2014) . Moreover, empirical investigation based only on carbon emission may lead to spurious estimates due to its link to the mixture of other effluents (Altintus & Kassouri, 2020). Therefore, this study has found it apposite to track the environmental degradation as portrayed by the EKC in Bangladesh using a comprehensive environmental impact indicator. It has become more relevant in response to the concern of the increased levels of economic activities for the achievement of targeted economic growth (see Rabbi et al., 2015) . Since developing countries use their natural resources to grow and become competitive (Ulucak & Bilgili, 2018) , this study has become motivated to use EF as an environmental degradation indicator that measures the overall demand of human activities on nature. This study expects to fill up the important shortages in the application of the EKC concept in Bangladesh by using a broader proxy of environmental degradation, EF, and at the same time identify the nexus of some socio-economic factors to the environmental degradation process in Bangladesh.",

In this study, affluence is represented by per capita GDP, demographic variable is captured by human capital and technology is captured by trade openness based on recent studies (see Halliru et al., 2020) . Since trade facilitates the import of advanced technology from developed to developing countries, increased level of trade openness indicates technological diffusion, better skill and better utilization of inputs (Halliru et al., 2020; Kwakwaet al., 2020) . Taking into consideration, the two other important factors responsible for environmental degradation namely urbanization and energy consumption Eq. (1) can be modified as follows:",

(2019) and Ulucak and Bilgili (2018) . The other explanatory variables are the natural log transformation of the explanatory variables mentioned above. t is the error term that is distributed normally with zero mean and constant variance. Parameters 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 represent the elasticity of the explanatory variables. Correspondingly, in order to predict the EKC relation in the model, the sign of 1 is expected to be positive and the sign of 2 is expected to be negative. The signs of these two coefficients are jointly expected to project the inverted U-shaped 'Kuznets curve,' that reflects the relative power of scale versus technique effects (Grossman & Krueger, 1991) . But if the signs are altered, a U-shaped relationship will be seen between environmental degradation and economic growth as well. The expected sign for 3 is positive under the consideration that more urbanization will lead to a higher demand for urban ecology and energy consumption that in turn causes more damage to the environment. Evaluating the present trend of energy consumption, it has been predicted that the increase in primary energy consumption will increase the emission of polluting gases and substances to the environment. Therefore, the expected sign of 4 is positive. The sign of trade openness can be either positive or negative depending on the nature of trade and by the nature of technology transferred to the economy via open trade with the global economy. If the economy benefits from efficient technology, the 5 can be negative and contribute positively to the environment; otherwise, a positive 5 increases environmental degradation either by relocation of polluting industries from developed economies or due to a lack of implementation of environmental law, or for both of the reasons (Grossman & Krueger, 1991; Mrabet & Alsamara, 2017) . Environmental issues are mostly humaninduced, and humans have the potential to reduce the ecological footprint by enhancing the quality of human capital. (Ahmed & Wang, 2019; Bano et al., 2018; Zafar et al., 2019) . Hence, the expected sign of 6 is negative.",

In order to obtain a reliable regression result, unit root properties of the variables need to be examined. Though the planned model for application, Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) model, does not necessitate all the variables to be integrated in order of unity, it is important to confirm that none of the variables is integrated to the order more than one to avoid spurious F-statistic (Pesaran et al., 2001) . Therefore, in order to identify the integration order of the variables the present study has applied various unit root tests, viz Augmented-Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (Dickey & Fuller, 1979 ) and Phillips-Perron (PP) unit root test (Phillips & Perron, 1988) . The unit root tests were conducted under two specifications: intercept and intercept with trend in the model. However, in order to address the non-reliability problem in terms of sensitivity to size and to account for the structural break in time series, a Zivot-Andrew (Z-A) unit root test (Zivot & Andrews, 2002) was also performed. The presence of a structural break has been ignored in the standard co-integration test approach. In order to get rid of this problem, the Gregory Hansen (G-H) co-integration test is applied. This test assumes that there is the presence of one structural break in the cointegration vector (Gregory & Hansen, 1996) . The G-H test considers break in trend and intercept. Three alternative unit root tests (ADF, Za, and Zt) are conducted to review the possible shifts in the co-integrating vector.",

To tackle the problem of structural break identified in the series, the ARDL model is estimated including the structural break in year 2007. The ARDL bound test result finds co-integration based on the value of the F-statistic. The null hypothesis of no co-integration is strongly rejected for the ecological footprint, economic growth, urbanization, energy consumption, trade openness, and human capital, which suggests for carrying out the long-run estimation procedure in order to establish the association between ecological footprint and selected socio-economic factors.

The EKC hypothesis is established by empirical investigation in the context of Bangladesh for both the short-run and the long-run when the ecological footprint is considered as a degradation indicator of the environmental quality. This result is consistent with the findings of Alt\u0131nta\u015f and Kassouri (2020), Destek and Serkodie (2019) and Nathaneal et al. (2019) but contrary to the findings of Al-Mulali et al. (2015) and Zhang (2019) in long-run and with the findings of Destek and Sarkodie (2019) , Ulucak and Bilgili (2018) and Ahmed and Wang (2019) in short-run analysis. Results indicate that Bangladesh belongs to the earlier stage of development and operates at the initial level (rising part) of the EKC, where economic activities to achieve growth are damaging the environment. Like other developing countries, Bangladesh has not yet attained full-fledged industrial development and it is evident by the large share of agriculture and service sector to the GDP (BER, 2019). However, the industrial sector is developing in Bangladesh which is evident by the increasing share of industry to the GDP. Continued economic growth will increase per capita income and eventually will achieve a threshold level. A further increase in income will start to improve the environmental quality in Bangladesh. The empirical finding of this study can be analyzed together with the pattern of structural economic change in the country. The dominance of agriculture is declining in Bangladesh in terms of its share to GDP by the steady growth of the industrial and service sectors. As the country tries to build its industrial base, the level of pollution increases. However, if the country becomes capable of continuing growth, cleaner technology will be adopted with better resource allocation that will slow the pace of environmental degradation. Furthermore, the growth in Bangladesh leads to service-oriented economies which have the potential for greater environmental gains.",

Urbanization has a unidirectional causal link with EF but a bidirectional causal link with economic growth. Therefore, despite its huge potential, the unplanned nature of urbanization in Bangladesh has not yet become the source of positive externality in terms of better opportunity and income. In contrast, the empirical result finds the development of human capital as an improvement to the environmental quality and this result is similar to that of Ahmed and Wang (2019) and Ulucak and Bilgili (2018) in the long-run and with Hassan et al. (2019) in the short-run analysis. The significant positive role of human capital against environmental degradation indicates that human development is very crucial from the perspective of environment since human capital can contribute to the technical research on environment and to the increase in the level of awareness. HC that is measured in years of schooling and returns to education can play a significant role in environmental conservation through increased knowledge and income which provide not only the financial solvency to use environment-friendly and renewable technology, but also an increased level of awareness and pro-environmental activities.

To this end, this study examines the nexus between the ecological footprints, economic growth, urbanization, energy consumption, trade openness and human capital with particular emphasis on the EKC over the period 1972-2018. The ARDL approach with structural breaks is employed to explore the long-run association among the variables. The result indicates that all the variables are co-integrated. The study confirms the existence of the EKC hypothesis in Bangladesh, both in the short-run and in the long-run employing the index of ecological footprint that captures both the direct and indirect impacts of production and consumption activities on the environment (see Ulucak & Bilgili, 2018) . This result supports the structural change in the economy and technical advancement of the country (see Danish et al., 2020; Sarkodie & Adams, 2018) . The empirical results indicate that the present level of economic activity can be continued to achieve growth and this will not impose much cost to the ecology under the existing environmental management system. The initial increase in ecological footprint will tend to diminish with the maturity of economic growth. This result provides insights for targeted policymaking and implementation of environmental measures to extract the economic potential so that the growth target can be achieved without much damage to the ecology. The causal relation from economic growth to environmental degradation indicates that measures that are taken by the government to enhance economic growth and reduce environmental degradation in Bangladesh must be continued to diminish both economic and environmental challenges.",

This study finds urbanization to be the significantly contributing factor to the environmental degradation in the long-run and short-run. This causality test result of urbanization with economic growth demonstrates that planned urbanization will put forward the demand for the innovation of green technology, green city development projects, better education, and health care for urban people that will help to prevent downturns in environmental quality and promote economic growth. Proper urban planning can be suggested that will design the safe accommodation of increased urban population with better services and put forward the green development agenda in urban areas.",

Bangladesh has attained success in educational attainment. However, immense potential is left to improve its human capital as compared to other developed countries. Improvement in the quality of education is required for creating better human capital. This can help to identify the causes and understand the consequences of climatic change and environmental degradation with positive motivation to mitigate both of these (UNESCO, 2009). Therefore, spending in education and R&D can be suggested to develop human capital able to contribute to a reduction in environmental degradation. Besides these, since agriculture, forestry, and land use are categorized as the second contributor to greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2016; Sarkodie & Strezov, 2018) , Bangladesh should adopt sustainable agriculture development strategies accompanying technological advancement and scientific innovation in order to avoid environmental degradation.",
