Methods: This was a retrospective observational study. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavisrus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive cases that were asymptomatic at admission were retrospectively enrolled. Specific clinical information, laboratory test results, chest CT imaging features and outcome data during hospital stay were collected and analyzed. Results: 137 non-consecutive asymptomatic patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the present study. On admission, patients had no symptoms but chest CT findings were present in 61/137 (44.5%). Ground glass opacity (48, 78.7%) followed by ground glass opacity with crazy-paving pattern (9, 14.7%) were the commonest type of opacities with posterior, peripheral predominance and lower zone predilection. Among the initial CT positive group of 61 patients, follow-up imaging revealed progression of pulmonary opacities in 13/61",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were first reported from Wuhan, Hubei province of China towards the end of 2019 and spread rapidly across the globe with a sustained human-to-human transmission. According to the situation report-136 of World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the world, infecting 6.4 million people and causing 382 867 deaths. India has reported 216,919 cases with 6075 deaths as of June 4, 2020. 1 The causative organism is a novel enveloped single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 2 The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, expectoration, shortness of breath and sore throat. 3 Other less common symptoms attributable to gastrointestinal tract are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and mesenteric ischemia. 4, 5 Symptoms of neurological dysfunction have also been reported with headache, (21.4%) , complete resorption in 21/61 (34.4%), partial resolution in 22/61 (36%) and no change in 5/61 (8.2%). The patients in progression group (54 \u00b1 19.7 years) were older and had higher frequency of co-morbidities (46.2%) compared to the other three groups (10.4%). The patients in progression group had a significantly higher C-reactive protein, higher lactate dehydrogenase and lower lymphocyte count than the other groups (all p-values < 0.05). The duration of hospital stay was longer in the progression group (27.1 \u00b1 11.4 days) compared to the other three groups (16.12 \u00b1 5.8) (p =< 0.05). Conclusion: Nearly half of the asymptomatic cases with confirmed COVID-19 had abnormal chest CT imaging. Asymptomatic infections can have a variable clinicoradiological course. Clinically, some recover without developing symptoms, some present few mild symptoms whereas some deteriorate. Similarly, imaging follow-up may reveal resolution (partial or complete), progression or no change. Advances in knowledge: Clinicoradiological course of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is diverse. Many infected patients are asymptomatic. The frequency of asymptomatic infections has been reported in the range of 19-56%. 7, 8 Arons et al reported a high frequency (56%) of asymptomatic infections at the time of diagnosis in their cohort. 9 These infected asymptomatic patients known as \"asymptomatic carriers or covert transmitters, \" represent a potential contagious source of SARS-CoV-2, as they unknowingly transmit the infection to others. 10, 11 It is essential to have in-depth knowledge about these asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases for formulating strategies for epidemiological control of COVID-19. The high infective potential of asymptomatic cases supports the case of wide use of face masks by the general public especially in crowded places to contain the spread of disease. This holds more value in congregate living conditions like old age homes, prisons, orphanages, inpatient hospitalized patients, mental health facilities where many people with fragile immune systems live together. 12, 13 The aim of this endeavor was to study the clinicoradiological course in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive patients who were asymptomatic at the time of admission in order to understand the clinical course, temporal course of imaging findings and the final outcome.",

[18] [19] [20] [21] However, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases have a lower percentage of lung involvement with low CT severity score. It has been widely reported that the percentage of the total lung involvement signifying the disease burden determines the severity of the disease and the final clinical outcome. 21, 22 Inui et. al 7 in the famous Diamond Princess Cruise Ship made a comparison of total CT score (determined visually as the percentage of total lung involvement) and found a significantly lower CT score in asymptomatic cases compared to the symptomatic cases (p-value < 0.05). They also reported that consolidations were more common in symptomatic cases (41%) compared to asymptomatic cases (17%), whereas GGOs predominated in asymptomatic cases (83% vs 59%).

This is a unique finding which has not been reported earlier in any infectious pneumonia. This intriguing vascular finding can have a diagnostic value. The presence of intralesional vascular enlargement can differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other causes of infectious pneumonia. Though, the exact pathophysiological mechanism underpinning this intralesional vascular enlargement is unclear at present but it has been suggested that three possible mechanisms could account for this finding. 25 Cascading effect of inflammatory cytokines may result in intralesional vascular enlargement. Alternately, microvascular thrombosis (immunothrombosis) has also been suggested as the underlying cause. 26 Though CT has helped us in the understanding of the disease but the guidelines issued by various radiological societies do not recommended CT as a screening or diagnostic tool in lieu of nucleic acid testing for COVID-19 pneumonia. European Society of Radiology and the European Society of Thoracic Imaging do not recommend performance of CT in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients. According to the joint statement of European Society of Radiology and European Society of Thoracic ImagingI, CT should be reserved for the evaluation of patients with severe respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea and desaturation. However, in selected circumstances CT may also be helpful in patients with milder symptoms who have co-morbidities, such as diabetes, obesity, chronic respiratory disease, etc. 27 Repeat CTs are not indicated in patients that are recovering. However, a repeat examination may be indicated in cases with suspected complications (e.g. superinfection, pulmonary embolism). 27 According to American College of Radiology guidelines, CT should be reserved for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications like deteriorating respiratory status. 28",
