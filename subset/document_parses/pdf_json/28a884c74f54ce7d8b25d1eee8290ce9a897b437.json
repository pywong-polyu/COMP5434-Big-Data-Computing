The management of the disease was done at home with methylprednisolone (MP) pulse therapy for three days. This resulted in a favorable evolution and resolution of most symptoms. COVID-19 infection presents as asymptomatic disease, non-severe symptomatic disease, and severe respiratory inflammatory disease. The first two forms are dependent on viral response and a \"cytokine storm\" is responsible for the progression into severe disease. Glucocorticoids (GC) reduce inflammation by different mechanism depending of their concentration. Pulses lead to overall apoptosis of immune cells. Studies using pulse MP as treatment for SARS-CoV-1 showed clinical improvement and decreased incidence of ARDS compared with patients who received low dose steroid treatment. Inhibition of excessive inflammation through timely administration of GC in the early stage of inflammatory cytokine storm effectively prevents the occurrence of ARDS.",

Both of our patients repeatedly attempted to obtain medical attention, but were turned away by health institutions. In Patient 1, the negative result from a SARS-CoV-2 rapid test overruled clinical evidence in favor of hospitalization and treatment; Patient 2 did not even get access to prompt testing. The grim reality that many Peruvians are facing today pushes us to seek alternatives within our limited possibilities, a situation that is not strange to our history in epidemic management.",

Peru was the most severely affected country amongst its Latin American (LATAM) peers, with 82% of all cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization. Nevertheless, the Peruvian case fatality rate (0.9%) has been the lowest of all cholera epidemics due to the national distribution of Oral Rehydration Units (UROS, for \"Unidades de Rehidrataci\u00f3n Oral\" in Spanish). Peru understood that in order to assure patient survival, treatment needed to reach all patients [1] . Similarly, it is important to highlight the value of treatment with methylprednisolone (MP) pulse therapy for COVID-19 patients in cytokine storm, at primary facilities by trained personnel, when it is impossible to obtain hospital assistance. The course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is divided into three stages: asymptomatic disease, non-severe symptomatic disease, and severe respiratory inflammatory disease. While the first two forms are dependent on viral response, a cytokine storm/secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH)/macrophage activation syndrome, is most likely responsible for the progression into severe forms of COVID-19 that presents with progressive pneumonitis and respiratory failure [2] .",

Ignorance about the correct GC dosage and the reasons behind it has sprung confusion regarding the use of this treatment for COVID-19 patients with cytokine storm. Low concentrations of GC (\u22647.5 mg/day) mediate effects via genomic events that regulate, in the nucleus, transcription of pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. Medium concentrations (7.5-30 mg/day) activate genomic and non-genomic events [3] . Finally, very high concentrations (>100 mg/day) intercalate into cellular membranes, disturb cation transport through the plasma membrane and leak protonsfromthe mitochondria. As GC dose increases and the receptors become saturated, non-genomic effects come to play [4] and, with the administration of pulses (500-1000 mg/d), a GC-induced apoptotic effect occurs [5] and explains the very rapid immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects [4] . In the early stage of the inflammatory cytokine storm, MP pulses change the outcome of COVID-19 for a complete recovery [6] like it happened with our patients.",
