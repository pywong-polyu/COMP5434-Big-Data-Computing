            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) created a global pandemic that has resulted in massive health and economic losses. The current unavailability of treatments leaves vaccination as the only way to control this disease. There are four vaccines (Sinopharm, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sputnik, and AstraZeneca) available in Bahrain. This project aimed to study the most common side effects resulting from the first and second doses of these four vaccines. Data were collected through an online questionnaire answered by 311 individuals who received both doses of one of these four vaccines. The results of this study revealed that regardless of the vaccine identity, participants experienced more side effects from the second dose. Among the different side effects, pain at the site of injection was primarily observed after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine (43%), which was followed by the AstraZeneca vaccine (31%). Moreover, fever was observed in participants after the first dose of the Sputnik vaccine (37%), while headache was mainly observed after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine (32%). It is important to note that fatigue was observed after the first dose of all four vaccines but was reported by the highest proportion of respondents in the Pfizer group (28%). Interestingly, there are some side effects, such as pain at the site of injection, that are correlated with fever (r = 0.909). Similarly, headache is correlated with fever (r = 0.801) and pain at the site of injection (r = 0.868). Overall, it was observed that recipients of the Sinopharm vaccine reported the mildest side effects among all four vaccines. The crucial finding of this study is that the first and second dosage post-vaccination side effects were modest and predictable with no occurrences of hospitalization; this information can assist in lessening vaccine apprehension.",

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic [2] . The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continues to rise every day. Many studies have been conducted to clarify the epidemiology, virology, and clinical management of SARS-CoV-2. Researchers have not yet identified or approved any drugs against SARS-CoV-2 due to a lack of sufficient data and understanding of the virus [1] . Early studies showed that one infected person spread the disease to two or more people, which leads to a high spread rate [3] [4] [5] [6] . Symptoms of COVID-19 include shortness of breath, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, and loss of smell and taste [7] [8] [9] . In some cases, infection can lead to dysfunction of the kidneys, lungs, heart, and in severe cases, even death. Diagnosis is performed by RT-PCR assay using specimens collected from oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab [10] .",

COVID-19 vaccines have been linked to an increase in venous thromboembolic (VTE) events, which was likely due to a thrombophilic state caused by inflammation and immune thrombosis [20] . Due to reports of thromboembolic events in vaccinated patients, distribution of the AstraZeneca vaccine was suspended in many European countries by mid-March 2021. By 10 March 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had received 30 reports of thromboembolic events (primarily venous) [21] .

This extensive literature review revealed a wide range of potential post-vaccination side effects that were subsequently considered in the design of the survey. Several questions requested demographic information, participants' general health status vaccination, and pre-and post-vaccination imprints of COVID-19 vaccinations.

The data were stored in Google forms until final responses were downloaded and used for data analysis. Univariate models were applied to estimate the percentage of symptoms reported after receipt. Pearson's correlation was applied to understand the association between each pair of symptoms. The null hypothesis for the Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed that the data were normally distributed in this sample population. Table 1 shows the characteristics of participants who received both doses of any of the four vaccines available in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The respondent cohort was 56.3% male and 43.7% female. There were four age categories: 22% of participants were 18-24 years, 29.9% were 25-34 years, 34.7% were 35-44 years, and 13.1% of participants were 45 years of age or above. In total, 16.7% of respondents were single, 75.2% were married, and 8.1% were divorced or widowed. The majority, 70.7%, were employed, 21.2% were students, and 8% were unemployed. Just over half (52.1%) were Bahraini, while 47.9% were non-Bahraini. Most (81%) individuals were healthy, while 19% reported a chronic illness. According to Table 1 , the most common chronic conditions were diabetes (8%) and cardiovascular diseases (5.4%). The number of participants was standardized for each vaccine to study the side effects of each vaccine using ANOVA. Figure 1 shows that the greatest proportion of respondents who reported pain at the site of injection after the first dose received the Pfizer vaccine (43.14%), followed by the AstraZeneca vaccine (31.03%). The lowest proportion of pain complaints was reported by those who received the first dose of Sinopharm (19%). However, this difference in reports of pain after the first dose among the vaccine groups was not statistically significant. Interestingly, the proportion of respondents who complained of pain at the site of injection after the second dose was reduced for all vaccine groups. The difference in reports of pain at the injection site between the first and second dose for all four vaccines is statistically significant (0.012) ( Figure 1 ). Figure 2 shows that most respondents who suffered from fever after the first dose of vaccination received Sputnik (37%) or Pfizer (35.3%). Very few participants suffered from fever after taking the first dose of the Sinopharm vaccine (13%). It is important to note that the second dose of all four vaccines had a mild effect on individuals, and there is a statistically significant difference in symptoms of fever after the first and second doses for all four vaccines (0.007) (Figure 2 ).",

Notably, very few individuals reported fatigue as a side effect after receiving the second dose of any of the four vaccines (Figure 7) . The difference in fatigue after the first and second doses of these vaccines was statistically significant. Fatigue was one of the most common symptoms reported after COVID-19 vaccination.

Pearson's heatmap was applied to determine the correlation of reported side effects of four COVID-19 vaccines that have been used in the Kingdom of Bahrain. As shown in Figure 8 , some side effects, such as pain at the site of injection, are correlated with fever (r = 0.909). Headache is also correlated with fever (r = 0.801) and pain at the site of injection (r = 0.868). Some symptoms, primarily myalgia and cough, seem to be independent of any other side effect.

Interestingly, the current study reported similar results of fever (13%), fatigue (13%), and headache (8%) after the first dose of Sinopharm (Figures 1-3 and Figure 7 ). Abu-Halaweh and colleagues [25] studied the side effects of the Sinopharm and Pfizer vaccines. They reported that 46.3% of individuals experienced an adverse response after the first dose, with injection site pain as the most common complaint (33.2 percent). The second dose caused adverse effects in 48.6% of individuals, with injection site pain as the most common complaint (29%).

Shitany and colleagues [26] reported that pain at the injection site, headaches, flu-like symptoms, fever, and fatigue were the most prevalent complaints following the Pfizer vaccine. In this study, it was observed that after the first dose of Pfizer, 43% of people experienced pain at the site of injection, 25% suffered from fever, 32% developed a headache, while 28% reported experienced fatigue. Riad and colleagues [27] conducted a cross-sectional survey in which they found that 89% of people experienced injection site pain, 62.2% experienced fatigue, 46% suffered from headache, 37% felt muscle pain, and 34% experienced chills. In another study [28] , the authors described that 54.8% of people experienced more side effects following the second dosage of the Pfizer vaccine than the first with 15.8% of individuals reporting fewer side effects after the first dose. The CDC team found that the side effects of the additional (booster) dose were mild to moderate and were identical to those observed after receiving the first two doses [32] . Only the Pfizer vaccine is currently approved for use in the pediatric population aged 16 and up under emergency use authorization [33] . AstraZeneca is the third Bahrain-approved vaccine developed to combat COVID-19. Interestingly, a study reported the short-term side effects of Pfizer and AstraZeneca in Saudi Arabia [29] . Similar to the previously mentioned studies, 60% of trial participants reported side effects from COVID-19 vaccinations, with the majority reporting fatigue and pain at the injection site. Concerns have been raised about the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine due to reports of blood clots, but post-vaccination neurological events are currently rare [30] . Menni and colleagues studied the side effects of Pfizer and AstraZeneca in the United Kingdom [31] . They found that 7% of recipients experienced headache after the first dose of Pfizer while 22% developed headache after the first dose of AstraZeneca. Another study found that the AstraZeneca vaccine caused non-life-threatening side effects [35] . Denis Logonov and colleagues published interim results from a Phase III study of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine. They demonstrated a robust protective impact across all age categories of participants [36] . It has been reported that the first or second dosage of the Sputnik vaccine confers mild to severe side effects that usually disappear within three days [34] . Nogrady and his colleagues reported that the Sputnik vaccine is not only safe but effective against SARS-CoV-2 [37] . These studies are in agreement with our results that the side effects of the Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sputnik, and Sinopharm are mild to moderate, and they remain for only a few days.",
