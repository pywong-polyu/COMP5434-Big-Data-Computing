Despite that, the internal and external validity of these studies is often compromised by barriers to recruiting and retaining participants (Nicholson, Schwirian, & Groner, 2015; Nicholson et al., 2011; UyBico, Pavel, & Gross, 2007) .

Third, we conducted two focus groups (i.e., one with employees of food-aid organizations employees and one with food-aid users) to discuss the feasibility of various recruitment and retention strategies. We stratified potential strategies into the four domains recommended in mTPM. Six strategies aimed at maximizing study credibility, four were designed to maintain regular communication with participants, six ensured consistency of the follow-up plan, and two related to financial compensation (Table 1) .

The diversity of languages in Montr\u00e9al is such that translating/back-translating questionnaires or using translators would have incurred significant costs and possibly measurement bias. For ethical reasons, we did not have direct access to the list of names of community food-aid users. Food-donation organizations' staff informed newly registered food-aid users aged 18-63 years about the study and asked permission to disclose their names to the research team. Those who agreed were then contacted by the research team, received a detailed explanation of the study, and completed a short screening questionnaire to assess eligibility. Each eligible candidate interested in participating was then asked to come in to their community organization for an interview. Participants were called the day before the interview as a reminder. Interviews with participants from organizations distributing food in parking lots took place in public spaces such as parks, libraries, or health centers, depending on participant availability and preferences. Participants were compensated with increasing monetary incentives ($20 for the first interview, $25 for the second, and $30 for the third). The study's steering committee set the compensation amount, considering information gathered from the focus groups and literature review. The compensation was provided in cash by the interviewer at the end of the interview. Our original objective was to recruit 1800 participants to maintain a 70% retention rate at the one-year follow-up and an 80% retention rate at the two-year follow-up.

The challenges and successes of outsourcing participant recruitment to community organizations have been described (Grape et al., 2018; Meyer et al., 2018) , but increasing the number of organizations also means increasing tailor-made adjustments to accommodate partners. Second, because many potential participants could not be contacted or did not show up for a scheduled interview, interviewers spent much more time than anticipated rebooking and travelling to conduct interviews, which translated into increases in the costs of data collection and difficulties in planning interviewer schedules.",

We encountered more difficulties in recruiting participants in rural areas essentially because, being less populated, the number of people demanding food aid for the first time is smaller in rural areas.

Moreover, participants lost to follow-up after one year and after two years were more vulnerable than those retained. Their precarious conditions made them more difficult to reach despite multiple types of contact information (phone number, email, possibility to ask for information at food banks, second contact). These results are in contrast with the findings of another Canadian study on food-bank users (Rizvi et al., 2021) , which found no difference between participants lost to follow-up and those retained. Unlike our study, they did not target just first-time food-bank users (Rizvi et al., 2021) . Since the main reason for participants lost to follow-up in our study relates to failure to reach them, it is realistic to hypothesize that these participants had to terminate their telephone service or relocate due to their extreme vulnerability (Clair, Fledderjohann, Lalor, & Loopstra, 2020; Tarasuk, Fafard St-Germain, & Loopstra, 2020) .
