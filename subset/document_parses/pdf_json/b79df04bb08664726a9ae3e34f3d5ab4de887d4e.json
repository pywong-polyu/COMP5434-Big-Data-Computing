The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental state of the medical students switching to OL in comparison with the mental state of the students who had traditional learning (TL). A repeated questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students ranging from 1st year to 5th year at Astana Medical University in the 2019-2020 academic year. The first study was conducted during the TL (October-November 2019, N = 619), and the second study was conducted during the OL period (April 2020, N = 798). Burnout syndrome, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and satisfaction with academic performance have been studied. The findings revealed that prevalence of the burnout syndrome, depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms decreased after transitioning from TL to OL. However, during the OL period, the prevalence of colleague-related burnout increased, which tells us about the negative impact of OL on students' communication and interpersonal relationships. The most common depression and anxiety symptoms, dissatisfaction with academic performance were among students who indicated a decrease in academic performance during OL. Students who lived alone during the quarantine were more prone to depression during OL. In conclusion, during the quarantine period after the transition from TL to OL, the mental health state of medical students improved, despite the severe conditions of the pandemic.",

While the spread of the virus has had farreaching consequences, the closure of universities has led to the emergence of innovative methods of providing education that ensure the continued education of students [2] . The implications of these changes on the development of medical students and their mental health remain to be determined [3] . According to one systematic review of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being of people, it can be concluded that many segments of the population have experienced a negative impact on their mental state. A study conducted among the Iranian population showed that medical students had significantly higher scores for stress, anxiety, and depression compared with that of medical staff and community populations [4] . Fear of a new virus, social distancing, job loss, and increased media attention, along with a lack of information and knowledge about the pandemic, has created and exacerbated feelings of insecurity, depression, and anxiety [5] . Moderate to high level of anxiety in COVID-19 has a significant association with general somatic symptoms, in particular, fatigue symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms [6] . Moreover, the chronic stress caused by the pandemic has led to many physical symptoms, such as headaches, insomnia, digestive problems, hormonal imbalances, and fatigue [7] .",

Schaeffer and Konetes found that OL students are more likely to discontinue their studies than students following traditional education (TL). Moreover, social isolation during OL was the main factor affecting students' ability to study [13] . Kahl and Cropley stated that students learning remotely were more \"isolated\" than TL students, and had a lower level of self-confidence [14] . Social isolation may cause anxiety and depression [15] . Lazarevic and Bentz indicated a significant lower level of perception of stress associated with learning in an online group compared to students who took a course in a class [16] . Whereas in Hendrix's study, the level of perceived stress between students studying online and students studying TL was not significantly different [17] . Haider and Al-Salman analyzing dataset of 775 Jordanian university students found after COVID-19 sleep compliance dropped by more than 50%; more than 80% of respondents indicated that prolonged use of digital tools for learning affected their sleeping habits; more than 90% of students indicated that continuous exposure to electronic screens in OL is tiring and exhausting; 89% of respondents agreed that prolonged use of e-learning tools often led to boredom, nervousness, and tension; and 73% of students do not recommend continuing with the online learning model because it is socially and psychologically unhealthy [18] . Gossenheimer et al. showed that cognitive factors, such as academic experience, academic performance, and distance learning formats, are comparable to those observed in the traditional form of training [19] . Pei and Wuin's systematic review concluded that OL has advantages to enhance knowledge and skills of medical student compared to the TL format [20] . However, Hasan and Bao concluded that \"e-Learning crack-up\" perception had a significant positive impact on student's psychological distress, and the fear of academic year loss was the crucial factor responsible for psychological distress during COVID-19 lockdown [21] .",

[22] , and adapted for students by Campos, Carlotto, and Maroco, was used to assess burnout syndrome [23] . This scale consists of 25 items that represent 4 subscales: Personal Burnout (PB), Studiesrelated Burnout (SRB), Colleague-related Burnout (CRB), and Teacher-related Burnout (TRB). The answered options ranged from \"always,\" \"frequently,\" \"sometimes,\" \"rarely,\" to \"never.\" This was quantified as 100, 75, 50, 25, and 0% respectively, with a reverse scoring for item 10. For each scale, a total average score was calculated. According to Kristenson's criteria of burnout, scores for a respective level of 50 to 74 were considered moderate, 75-99 were high, and a score of 100 was considered as severe burnout [24] . CBI-S has demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's \u0251 = 0.943). & The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale was used to assess depression [25] . This scale consisted of 9 questions. The participant had to respond to the question: \"How often have they been bothered by the following (by what) over the past 2 weeks?\". Each question had four possible answers and ratings: \"Not at all\" (0), \"Several days\" (1), \"More than half of the days\" (2), \"Nearly every day\" (3). The total score was calculated and interpreted as follows: 0-4 scores (Minimal or none), 5-9 scores (Mild), 10-14 scores (Moderate), 15-19 scores (Moderately severe), and 20-27 (Severe). Participants with scores higher than 10 were considered depressed [26] . PHQ-9 has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's \u0251 = 0.890). & The Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the 7-item (GAD- 7) scale was used to assess anxiety [27] . This scale consists of 7 questions. Participants needed to answer to the question \"How often have they been bothered by the following over the past 2 weeks?\". Each question had four possible answers and ratings: \"Not at all\" (0), \"Several days\" (1), \"More than half the day\" (2), \"Nearly every day\" (3). The total score was calculated according to the results and interpreted as follows: 0-4 scores (Minimal), 5-9 scores (Mild), 10-14 scores (Moderate), and 15-21 scores (Severe). Participants with scores higher than 10 were considered to be anxious [26] . GAD-7 has demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's \u0251 = 0.907). & The Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) scale was used to assess common physical symptoms. It consists of 15 items, with a score of 0-2 points for each item, and 30 points total. A cutoff score of 5, 10, and 15 points indicates low, medium, and high severity of somatic symptoms, respectively [28] . Students scoring higher than 10 were considered having medium to highly severe somatic symptoms. PHQ-15 has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's \u0251 = 0.882). & Fear of COVID-19 was assessed using a 5-point adapted Snell's questionnaire (Snell's questionnaire regarding fear of AIDS) [29] . Results \u2265 3 were assessed as having fear of COVID-19. Snell's questionnaire has demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's \u0251 = 0.901).",

However, an analysis of the burnout by dimensions and academic year did not reveal any difference in SRB and TRB among 1st-year students ( Table 2 ). The absence of a significant difference in the level of SRB and TRB among first-year students can be explained by the fact that they continued to adapt to their studies, and unlike senior students, they did not get used to the established features of traditional education.",

Moreover, Meo et al. concluded that students showed a sense of emotional detachment from friends and fellow students during the COVID-19 quarantine [33] . The prevalence of CRB (13% vs 17%) had increased after the transition from TL to OL. This suggested that students during the OL are more prone to fatigue and emotional exhaustion as a result of changes in interpersonal relationships between colleagues, and the relationship between the last two was determined in a study by Rodr\u00edguez-Mantilla and Fern\u00e1ndez-D\u00edaz [34] . Students who had positive interactions with colleagues are more motivated [35] , and show greater engagement, as well as demonstrate higher academic performance [36] . Knebel concluded that students have a great desire to socialize with their peers [37] . However, OL and introduced quarantine measures due to COVID-19 reduce the interaction between students, which in our opinion affected the colleague-related burnout. In the case of a recurrence of a similar pandemic where quarantine measures and online training are necessary, we recommend developing and implementing preventive actions to maintain positive interactions between students.",

And the higher rates of depression in this study can be explained by a later collection of data, since excessive negative information about the COVID-19 is associated with a higher risk of depression.",

In one cross-sectional study that was conducted in China among college students, it was found that the frequency of somatic symptoms is 35%. Moreover, concerns about COVID-19 had a positive correlation with the occurrence of somatic symptoms [43] . Cellini et al. found that sleep quality deteriorated after the introduction of restrictive measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic; sleep disturbance was associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress [44] . In the current study, we found that sleep disturbances are associated with depression, anxiety (p < 0.001), and fear of COVID-19 (p < 0.05).",

Other factors that decreased burnout, depression, and anxiety are the ability to combine studying with personal and family life [45] and lack of interaction with patients during clinical placements. This also applied to students who lived with relatives during the OL period and therefore had more favorable conditions. In agreement with this, Cao et al. found that living with parents was a predictive factor against anxiety during COVID-19 [46] . A survey conducted by the dean's Head of AMU during the period of OL revealed that students responded positively to the following aspects of OL: availability of access to educational information at all times and from any location (65.3%), learning independence increased (47.1%), as well as more beneficial new educational technologies (42%). Daroedono et al. indicated the following supporting factors: time and location flexibility, absence of specific preparation, and low cost (except for cellular data) [32] . However, the survey conducted by the Dean's office also pointed to certain problems in the organization of OL. Most often, students indicated the following difficulties in OL: poor Internet connection (51%), lack of a personal computer (31%), lack of a webcam (13%); and 33% of students indicated that they did not encounter any difficulties during the OL period. Pointing out the main problems of organizing online learning, students indicated the following: insufficient control of their knowledge and skills (47%), unclear discipline requirements (17%), insufficient feedback from teachers (6%). These indicators will make it possible to organize OL more effectively in the future. A survey conducted at a later date (April 2020) indicated that satisfaction with the quality of OL had increased from 49 to 66%.",

Since students are more proficient in new technologies than professors, the learning environment was largely defined by students. During TL, the academic process was determined by the professors, which did not always coincide with the opinion of the students and thus made the learning environment more stressful. During online training, students became more independent and chose the time and conditions of learning, which could have a positive impact on mental health.",

However, a decrease in academic performance caused by transitioning to OL is associated with 2.5 times drop in satisfaction with academic performance. Strong relationship between satisfaction of students and academic performance was found by Dhaqane and Afrah [47] . Gonzalez et al. concluded that COVID-19 confinement changed students' learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving their efficiency; a significant positive effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' performance resulted [48] . Allen et al. demonstrated in a meta-analysis study that online learning does not reduce student satisfaction compared to traditional teaching methods [49] . Olivet et al. determined that satisfaction was higher among students in the traditional form of study [50] . Al-Balas et al. resulted that only 27% of Jordanian students are satisfied with medical distance learning [51] . A study conducted among Jordanian university students concluded that using digital learning tools was the reason for low academic performance in 81.5% [18] . These results provide an opportunity to further research the relationship between adaptation to a new learning environment like OL and academic performance.",
