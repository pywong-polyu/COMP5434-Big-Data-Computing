Efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by social distancing are associated with reduced COVID-19 disease rates per unit time (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) but also incur substantial psychological, social, cultural, medical, and economic costs (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Most cost-benefit analyses of social distancing policies overlook the fact that social contact is also an essential resource for optimal immune function (19) (20) (21) . As such, extreme social distancing measures such as extended \"stay at home\" or \"shelter in place\" (SIP) orders may paradoxically increase vulnerability to viral infection (conditional on viral exposure) even as they reduce the risk of viral exposure. Social influences on host resistance to viral infections have been documented in experimental viral challenge studies in humans (19, 22, 23) and nonhuman primates (24, 25) . However, the relevance of those studies to current (and historically novel) (26) extended SIP policies is complicated by the fact that earlier research assessed host resistance effects of perceived social isolation (\"loneliness\") and low social network density (\"social ties\") rather than objective social isolation (i.e., absence of others). Previous analyses also failed to capture the effects of some incidental nonsocial SIP effects such as transition from free mobility to involuntary confinement and reduced exposure to outdoor and natural environments. Research has begun to map the neural and immunoregulatory pathways through which loneliness and low social ties can influence immune function (24, (27) (28) (29) (30) , including a sympathetic nervous system (SNS)-mediated Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity (CTRA) involving up-regulated transcription of proinflammatory genes and down-regulated transcription of innate antiviral genes (e.g., Type I interferons; IFNs), resulting in part from increased output of classical CD16 \u2212 monocytes from bone marrow and splenic hematopoiesis (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) . By contrast, little is known about the neural or immunoregulatory impact of the involuntary social isolation and confinement characteristic of extended SIP.",

Previous experimental studies of CTRA gene regulation have shown that prosocial engagement (36) , caregiving (37) , and generativity (38) can reduce expression of proinflammatory genes and increase expression of Type I IFN genes (i.e., reduce the CTRA profile). These prosocial modes of behavior are hypothesized to activate central nervous system (CNS) reward circuits that subsequently inhibit the CNS threat response systems that control peripheral SNS activity and CTRA gene expression (39) (40) (41) (42) . This hypothesis Significance \"Shelter in place\" (SIP) orders have been deployed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but they induce social isolation that may paradoxically weaken antiviral immunity. We examined the impact of 2-wk SIP on immune cell population dynamics and gene regulation in 21 adult rhesus macaques, finding 30 to 50% declines in circulating immune cells, decreases in antiviral gene expression, and increased inflammatory cells in blood and inflammatory gene expression in lymph nodes. Declines in antiviral gene expression (but not circulating immune cells) were blocked by the presence of a novel juvenile partner during SIP, suggesting a potential strategy for maintaining antiviral immunity during SIP by enhancing prosocial engagement. raises the possibility that adverse immunological effects of extended SIP might potentially be reduced by promoting prosocial engagement during SIP.",

All major WBC subpopulations declined by 35 to 49% ( Stress-induced glucocorticoid release can reduce circulating WBC counts by shunting leukocytes out of blood and into other tissue compartments (44) (45) (46) (47) . Such effects do not appear to mediate the effects of SIP, however, because plasma cortisol concentrations did not increase during SIP but rather decreased progressively over 2 wk ( Fig. 1G ; F(3, 20) = 40.55, P < 0.0001). Stress can also alter circulating WBC numbers and CTRA gene expression via SNS catecholamine activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors that alter cell trafficking (48) (49) (50) and transcriptional regulation (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) . Consistent with SNS activation, promoter-based bioinformatics analyses indicated increased activity of the CREB family of transcription factors that mediate \u03b2-adrenergic signaling ( Fig. 1F ; CREB: 0.316 \u00b1 0.113, z = 2.80, P = 0.0056).

To determine whether prosocial engagement might buffer the immunoregulatory impact of SIP isolation, the same adult male macaques were subject to a second 2-wk SIP accompanied by a novel (unrelated) juvenile companion macaque (following an established conspecific caregiving protocol for abating effects of prolonged social isolation) (51). The 0.5-to 1.0-y-old male macaques were transferred to an individual shelter adjacent to each adult male, and a divider between the two shelters was subsequently removed to allow continuous interaction throughout the 2-wk SIP period. In all other respects the sheltering protocol was identical to the previous 2-wk isolated SIP. During juvenilepartnered SIP, adult macaques spent 23% of their time directly interacting with juveniles (e.g., grooming, contact, play), 51% of their time in the same cage, and 26% apart from the juvenile. The adults also showed a 54% reduction in abnormal behavior relative to isolated SIP (e.g., huddling, lying on floor, hanging on shelter walls; mean 186 \u00b1 As shown in Fig. 2 , SIP with a juvenile conspecific (solid symbol/ solid lines) did not significantly abate either WBC declines in general ( Fig. 2A) or declines in monocytes and dendritic cells (Figs. 2 B and C) .

To determine how the immunoregulatory alterations associated with SIP might impact host response to viral infection, we conducted metagenomic RNA sequencing of lymph node tissues to quantify the relative abundance of host-derived (metazoan) and viral-derived gene transcripts (53) . Compared to lymph nodes collected after isolated SIP, those collected after juvenile-partnered SIP showed a 45% reduction in viral gene transcripts as a fraction of total lymph node RNA abundance ( Fig. 3C ; \u22120.264 \u00b1 0.026 log 10 viral RNA reads per million total RNA reads, F(1, 18) = 99.40, P < 0.0001). To determine whether similar effects occur specifically for lymphotropic viruses, we conducted parallel metagenomic analyses of WBC RNA sequences collected at pre-SIP baseline and SIP day 2. Viral transcript abundance was 29-fold lower in circulating WBCs relative to lymph nodes, but results continued to show a 9.8% reduction in virus-derived gene transcripts during juvenile-partnered SIP ( ",

These effects emerged within 48 h of \"lockdown,\" persisted for at least 2 wk, and abated within 4 wk of return to baseline social conditions. Provision of a novel juvenile partner during a subsequent round of SIP blunted CTRA-characteristic immunoregulatory dynamics (but not leukopenia), resulting in down-regulation of classical monocytes, increased Type I IFN gene expression, and preservation of antiviral gene regulation (IRF, STAT, GFI). Analyses of lymph nodes collected at the end of each SIP period showed parallel up-regulation of Type I IFN response genes and transcription control pathways following \"lockdown with caregiving\" compared to \"lockdown alone.\" Metagenomic sequencing confirmed the functional significance of changes in host antiviral gene transcription, documenting reduced viral gene expression during juvenile-partnered SIP relative to isolated SIP in both lymph nodes and circulating immune cells. These results identify significant reductions in host antiviral activity in both the circulating leukocyte pool available for recruitment into infected tissues and the lymphoid tissue leukocyte pool available to initiate adaptive immune responses (e.g., antibody and cytotoxic T cell production) during 2 wk of SIP. These results also suggest a potential strategy for ameliorating the CTRA-characteristic gene regulatory impacts (but not circulating leukopenia) by promoting prosocial engagement during SIP. The implications of these immunoregulatory dynamics for symptomatic viral disease remain to be quantified in future research, but the substantial immunobiological and virological impacts observed here suggest a need for such studies.",

Consistent leukopenia indicates that SIP is physiologically stressful regardless of partner status. The magnitude and consistency of leukopenia across all major leukocyte subsets (including dendritic cells) might be hypothesized to stem from the leukopenic effects of stress-induced glucocorticoid release from the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (44) (45) (46) . However, this mechanism is unlikely to mediate the observed effects because, 1) circulating glucocorticoid levels declined substantially over the 2-wk SIP periods [as previously observed (54, 55) and likely due to reduced exposure of adult males to dominance-related agonistic interactions in group housing (56, 57) ] rather than increasing as would account for leukopenia (47) ; and 2) glucocorticoids selectively increase circulating neutrophil numbers (47) , whereas neutrophil numbers declined in parallel with lymphocyte and monocyte counts during both SIP cycles. Global leukopenia is also inconsistent with the previously observed effects of acute SNS activation in up-regulating circulating neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte numbers (48) (49) (50) rather than downregulating them as observed here. As such, the physiological mechanisms underlying SIP-associated leukopenia remain to be defined, with changes in leukocyte development, cell death, and trafficking patterns representing key targets for future research.",

These changes are all consistent with the SNS-induced CTRA gene regulation program (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) , which is known to be activated by adverse social conditions in macaques (24, 25, 58) and has previously been linked to impaired control of viral infections (24, 25) . Consistent with this hypothesis, 1) promoter-based bioinformatics analyses indicated up-regulation of the CREB transcription control pathway that mediates \u03b2-adrenergic signaling from the SNS (59), and 2) CREB activity was reduced by the presence of a juvenile partner during SIP, in parallel with other CTRA-characteristic regulatory dynamics. Reductions in lymph node CREB activity during juvenile-partnered SIP may also stem from reductions in stress-mediated neural activity and structural arborization of sympathetic nerve fibers within lymphoid tissues (25, 58) . Parallel increases in GR activity during juvenile-partnered SIP may stem from reduction in SNS-mediated GR desensitization associated with stress myelopoiesis (33, 34, 60) . However, definitive support for an SNS mechanism will require experimental inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity or \u03b2-adrenergic signaling to abrogate SIP effects on CTRA gene regulation.",

These effects are hypothesized to be mediated by activation of CNS reward circuits that laterally inhibit activity of CNS threat response systems (41, 42, 61) and prosocial engagement of the parasympathetic nervous system (62), both of which act to reduce basal sympathetic tone and the \u03b2-adrenergic signaling pathways that mediate CTRA gene expression (31, 32) . Consistent with reduced CNS threat processes, adult macaques displayed lower rates of distress-related behavior (e.g., huddling, hanging, lying) and higher rates of species-typical behavior (e.g., seated rest, normal mobility, cage exploration) during juvenile-partnered SIP compared to isolated SIP. However, it is possible that partnered SIP also acts in ways that do not involve prosocial motivation per se, such as effects of physical contact, motor activity, or microbial exposures. Given the marked impacts documented here, the isolated versus partnered-SIP paradigm may be a useful experimental system for broader analyses of the pathways through which social exposures buffer biological responses to adversity. Social exposures can also generate physiological costs resulting from social burdens (63) as previously observed when older adult macaques were paired with multiple juvenile partners (64) . Adverse effects may be amplified by competing demands (e.g., from work, education, additional social partners, etc.) or more extended SIP durations than studied here and could be clarified by parametric variation of the present paradigm (e.g., > 2-wk duration; multiple partners; novel versus familiar juvenile partners, adult peers, biological relatives; competing engagements; etc.).",

The present analyses suggest an alternative mechanism whereby caregiving adults may show physiologically mediated alterations in immune cell gene regulation that promote host resistance to viral disease (e.g., elevated Type I IFN activity). Such effects would be consistent with previous viral challenge studies that document reduced risk of respiratory virus infections and symptomatic disease among parents (including those whose children have already left home) (68) .",

SIP also affects nonsocial processes (e.g., mobility, natural environment exposure), and the immunologic effects observed here cannot be attributed purely to social deprivation. Partnered SIP always followed isolated SIP in this study, which might confound partner status with habituation (although recurrent leukopenia shows any habituation to be partial at best). This study does not contain any direct measures of viral disease (tissue pathology, illness symptoms) or host resistance to de novo infection, and the health significance of the observed effects remains to be defined in future research.",

Policy analyses of disease prevalence capture the net effect of host resistance costs and viral exposure benefits, and substantial observational data have linked social distancing policies in general to reduced viral disease rates per unit time (9, 10) . However, among all distancing policies examined, SIP and extended \"stay at home\" orders appear to have the weakest net benefit (i.e., above and beyond more targeted business closures, school closures, and restrictions on large gatherings) (9, (11) (12) (13) (14) . The present results suggest that the relatively modest epidemiologic benefits of SIP policies may stem in part from their unrecognized costs in undermining host resistance to viral infection even as they reduce the probability of viral exposure. To the extent that SIP is retained as a policy response (e.g., due to political demand), it may be possible to enhance SIP's epidemiologic benefit by altering the mode and conditions of sheltering to maximize caregiving opportunities and other prosocial engagements. Mapping the psychological and biological mechanisms involved may also suggest new policy, behavioral, or pharmacologic strategies for controlling the immunological impacts of protracted social isolation and thus help evolve more sustainable and effective disease mitigation strategies for social control of pandemic infectious diseases.",

WBC reductions (leukopenia) persisted throughout the 2-wk SIP period with minimal abatement. Within the declining monocyte subpopulation, however, we observed multiple CTRAcharacteristic immunoregulatory alterations including relative upregulation of CD16 \u2212 classical monocytes (Fig. 1C; F(3, 20) = 5.24, P = 0.0079) and up-regulation of the CTRA gene expression profile (per-cell ratio of inflammatory versus Type I IFN response gene messenger RNA (mRNA): F(3, 3,546) = 3.01, P = 0.0291), the latter of which stemmed primarily from down-regulated expression of Type I IFN response genes (Fig. 1D; F(3, 1,969) = 6.92, P < 0.0001). Consistent with these alterations, promoter sequence-based bioinformatics analysis of the 1,804 gene transcripts that showed consistent change in average expression within the first 48 h of SIP (genes listed in Dataset S1) indicated reduced activity of transcription control pathways mediating expression of Type I IFNs (Fig. 1E; Interferon Response Factor/IRF: mean log 2 ratio of transcription factor-binding motifs (TFBMs) in promoters of up-versus down-regulated genes: \u22120.607 \u00b1 0.094, z = \u22126.45, P < 0.0001), IFN receptor signaling (STAT: \u22120.110 \u00b1 0.033, z = \u22123.34, P = 0.0010), and development of the plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) that constitute the primary source of Type I IFNs in circulating blood (43) (GFI: \u22120.700 \u00b1 0.029, z = \u221223.98, P < 0.0001).

To assess the relevance of SIP-related changes in circulating WBC gene regulation for the lymphoid tissue environments in which leukocytes initiate adaptive antiviral immune responses (52), we biopsied axillary lymph nodes from each macaque at the end of each 2-wk shelter period. (Lymph nodes were not collected at pre-SIP baselines to avoid any immunologic impact of surgery during the SIP period.) Compared to lymph nodes collected after isolated SIP, those collected after juvenile-partnered SIP showed an 18% reduction in inflammatory gene expression (Fig. 3A; F(1, 18) = 13.54, P = 0.0017) and a 22% increase in Type I IFN response gene expression (Fig. 3A; F(1, 18) = 9.87, P = 0.0056). Promoter-based bioinformatic analysis of 884 gene transcripts showing consistent difference in expression following juvenile-partnered versus isolated SIP (Dataset S3) indicated increased activity of IFN-related transcription factors (Fig. 3B; IRF: 0.724 \u00b1 0.144, z = 5.04, P < 0.0001; STAT: 0.332 \u00b1 0.092, z = 3.63, P = 0.0004; and nonsignificant increase in GFI: 0.724 \u00b1 0.144, z = 1.64, P = 0.1025) accompanied by reduced activity of CREB (\u22120.929 \u00b1 0.235, z = \u22123.95, P = 0.0001) and increased activity of the GR (0.149 \u00b1 0.072, z = 2.08, P = 0.0388).",
