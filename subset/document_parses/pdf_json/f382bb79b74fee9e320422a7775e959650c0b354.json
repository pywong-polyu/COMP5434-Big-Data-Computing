Another reason for assigning the code was COVID-19 sequela, where the actual date of COVID-19 infection could have been anywhere from 6 months to a couple of weeks in the past.

While these RCTs allowed us to make such comparisons for absolute effectiveness, there are other research questions for which RCTs may not be feasible or readily available. The US and international booster campaigns raise the question of vaccine comparative effectiveness to prioritize vaccination. An indirect comparison may not be accurate due to the differences in the populations we observed in our study. First, patients vaccinated with Janssen were substantially different from mRNA patients: on average, they were older, had a higher proportion of patients with race recorded as Black and had more comorbidities. Therefore, comparative effectiveness studies of Janssen and mRNA vaccines require robust techniques such as large-scale propensity matching to ensure valid comparison. Second, while Modena and Pfizer patients had similar baseline characteristics, the temporal distribution of vaccinations in CUIMC data differ. Moderna vaccine was administered early on in 2021 with the peak in January, while Pfizer vaccination peaked in April. Given the varying baseline COVID-19 prevalence, a comparison of mRNA vaccines requires matching patients on calendar month to account for this potential bias. These vaccines also had different administration pathways in our system.

Inclusion of patients regardless of their prior COVID-19 status led to a small decrease in observed effectiveness (Appendix 9) for both COVID-19 infection and hospitalization in patients vaccinated with Moderna or Janssen. DISCUSSION In this retrospective cohort study, we examined the weekly effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as well as the overall effectiveness of three COVID-19 vaccines commonly used in the US. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were highly effective against both COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 associated hospitalization. Our findings support the RCTs and previously published post-marketing studies for all three vaccines. Larger sample size for patients vaccinated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines allowed us to have more power, which resulted in overlapping yet narrower confidence intervals compared to the RCTs.",
