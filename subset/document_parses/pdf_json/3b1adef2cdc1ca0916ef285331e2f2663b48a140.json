This revolution is impacting almost every industry in every country and causing a tremendous change in a non-linear manner at an unprecedented rate, with implications for all disciplines, industries, and economies. Three key terms Automation, i.e., reducing human interaction in operations, Intelligent, i.e., ability to extract insights or usable knowledge from data, and Smart computing, i.e., self-monitoring, analyzing, and reporting, known as self-awareness, have become fundamental criteria in designing today's applications and systems in every sector of our lives since the current world is more reliant on technology than ever before. The use of modern smart technologies enables making smarter, faster decisions regarding the business process, ultimately increasing the productivity and profitability of the overall operation, where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is known as a leading technology in the area. The AI revolution, like earlier industrial revolutions that launched massive economic activity in manufacturing, commerce, transportation, and other areas, has the potential to lead the way of progress. As a result, the impact of AI on the fourth industrial revolution motivates us to focus briefly on \"AI-based modeling\" in this paper.",

Therefore, in the domain of today's business intelligence, it becomes a core part of AI that can provide insights to an enterprise and generate suggestions or recommendations through its analytical processing capability. Various machine learning [81] and deep learning [80] techniques can be used to build an analytical AI model to solve a particular real-world problem. For instance, to assess business risk, a data-driven analytical model can be used. \u2022 Functional AI: Functional AI works similarly to analytical AI because it also explores massive quantities of data for patterns and dependencies. Functional AI, on the other hand, executes actions rather than making recommendations. For instance, a functional AI model could be useful in robotics and IoT applications to take immediate actions. \u2022 Interactive AI: Interactive AI typically enables efficient and interactive communication automation, which is well established in many aspects of our daily lives, particularly in the commercial sphere. For instance, to build chatbots and smart personal assistants an interactive AI model could be useful. While building an interactive AI model, a variety of techniques such as machine learning, frequent pattern mining, reasoning, AI heuristic search can be employed. \u2022 Textual AI: Textual AI typically covers textual analytics or natural language processing through which businesses can enjoy text recognition, speech-to-text conversion, machine translation as well as content generation capabilities.

In general, AI [77] combines human behavior and intelligence into machines or systems, whereas ML is a way of learning from data or experience [81] , which automates analytical model building. Deep learning [80] also refers to data-driven learning approaches that use multi-layer neural networks and processing to compute. In the deep learning approach, the term \"Deep\" refers to the concept of numerous levels or stages through which data is processed to develop a datadriven model. Thus, both ML and DL can be considered as essential AI technologies, as well as a frontier for AI that can be used to develop intelligent systems and automate processes. It also takes AI to a new level, termed \"Smarter AI\" with data-driven learning. There is a significant relationship with \"Data Science\" [79] as well because both ML and DL can learn from data. These learning methods can also play a crucial role in advanced analytics and intelligent decision-making in data science, which typically refers to the complete process of extracting insights in data in a certain problem domain. Overall, we can conclude that both ML and DL technologies have the potential to transform the current world, particularly in terms of a powerful computational engine, and to contribute to technologydriven automation, smart and intelligent systems.

ML models are often made up of a set of rules, procedures, or sophisticated \"transfer functions\" that can be used to discover interesting data patterns or anticipate behavior [23] . Machine learning is also known as predictive analytics that makes predictions about certain unknowns in the future through the use of data and is used to solve many real-world business issues, e.g., business risk prediction. In Fig. 3 , a general framework of a machine learning-based predictive model is depicted, where the model is trained from historical data in phase 1 and the outcome is generated for new test data in phase 2. For modeling in a particular problem domain, different types of machine learning techniques can be used according to their learning principles and capabilities, as discussed below.",

            "text": "\u2022 Supervised learning This is performed when particular goals are specified to be achieved from a set of inputs, i.e., a 'task-driven strategy' that uses labeled data to train algorithms to classify data or forecast outcomes, for example-detecting spam-like emails. The two most common supervised learning tasks are classification (predicting a label) and regression (predicting a quantity) analysis, discussed briefly in our earlier paper Sarker et al. [81] . Navies Bayes [42] , K-nearest neighbors [4] , Support vector machines [46] , Decision Trees -ID3 [71] , C4.5 [72] , CART [15] , BehavDT [84] , IntrudTree [82] , Ensemble learning, Random Forest [14] , Linear regression [36] , Support vector regression [46] , etc. [81] are the popular techniques that can be used to solve various supervised learning tasks, according to the nature of the given data in a particular problem domain. For instance, to detect various types of cyber-attacks the classification models could be useful, while cyber-crime trend analysis or estimating the financial loss in the domain of cybersecurity, a regression model could be useful, which enables enterprises to assess and manage their cyber-risk. \u2022 Unsupervised learning This is referred to as a 'datadriven method', in which the primary goal is to uncover patterns, structures, or knowledge from unlabeled data. Clustering, visualization, dimensionality reduction, finding association rules, and anomaly detection are some of the most common unsupervised tasks, discussed briefly in our earlier paper Sarker et al. [81] . The popular techniques for solving unsupervised learning tasks are clustering algorithms such as K-means [55] , K-Mediods [64] , CLARA [45] , DBSCAN [27] , hierarchical clustering, single linkage [92] or complete linkage [93] , BOTS [86] , association learning algorithms such as AIS [2] , Apriori [3] , Apriori-TID and Apriori-Hybrid [3] , FP-Tree [37] , and RARM [18] , Eclat [105] , ABC-RuleMiner [88] as well as feature selection and extracting techniques like Pearson Correlation [81] , principal component analysis [40, 66] , etc. that can be used to solve various unsupervised learning-related tasks, according to the nature of the data. An unsupervised clustering model, for example, could be useful in customer segmentation or identifying different consumer groups around which to build marketing or other business strategies. \u2022 Other learning techniques In addition to particular supervised and unsupervised tasks, semi-supervised learning can be regarded as a hybridization of both techniques explained above, as it uses both labeled and unlabeled data to train a model. It could be effective for improving model performance when data must be labeled automatically without human interaction. For instance, classifying Internet content or texts, a semi-supervised learning model could be useful. Reinforcement learning is another type of machine learning training strategy that rewards desired behaviors while punishing unwanted ones. A reinforcement learning agent, in general, is capable of perceiving and interpreting its surroundings, taking actions, and learning through trial and error, i.e., an environment-driven approach, in which the environment is typically modeled as a Markov decision process and decisions are made using a reward function [10] . Monte Carlo learning, Q-learning, Deep Q Networks, are the most common reinforcement learning algorithms [43] . Trajectory optimization, motion planning, dynamic pathing, and scenario-based learning policies for highways are some of the autonomous driving activities where reinforcement learning could be used. Overall, machine learning modeling [81] has been employed in practically every aspect of our lives, including healthcare, cybersecurity, business, education, virtual assistance, recommendation systems, smart cities, and many more. Blumenstock et al. [12] , for example, provides a machine learning strategy for getting COVID-19 assistance to people who need it the most. Sarker et al. highlight numerous sorts of cyber anomalies and attacks that can be detected using machine learning approaches in the domain of cybersecurity [78, 89] . Saharan et al. [76] describe a machinelearning-based strategy to develop an effective smart parking pricing system for smart city environments. In our earlier paper, Sarker et al. [81] we briefly discussed various types of machine learning techniques including clustering, feature learning, classification, regression, association analysis, etc. highlighting their working principles, learning capabilities, and real-world applications. In Table 1 , we have outlined the above-mentioned machine learning techniques, emphasizing model building procedures and tasks. Overall, machine learning algorithms can build a model based on training data of a particular problem domain, to make predictions or decisions without having to be explicitly programmed to do so. Thus, we can conclude that machine learning approaches can play a crucial part in the development of useful models in a variety of application areas, based on their learning capabilities and the nature of the data, and the desired outcome.",

Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) [67] , Convolutional neural networks (CNN or ConvNet) [53] , Recurrent neural networks (RNN) [24, 57] , and their variants can be used to build the deep discriminative learning models to solve the relevant real-world issues. \u2022 Deep networks for unsupervised or generative learning This category of deep learning approaches is commonly used to identify high-order correlation qualities or features for pattern analysis or synthesis, as well as [20] . The key notion of generative deep architectures is that specific supervisory information, such as target class labels, is unimportant throughout the learning process. Techniques in this category are mostly employed for unsupervised learning, as they are commonly used for feature learning or data generation and representation [19, 20] . Thus, generative modeling can also be utilized as a preprocessing step for supervised learning tasks, ensuring discriminative model accuracy. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [32] , Autoencoder (AE) [31] , Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [58] , Self-Organizing Map (SOM) [50] , and Deep Belief Network (DBN) [39] , as well as their variants, can be used to build the deep generative learning models to solve the relevant real-world issues. \u2022 Deep networks for hybrid learning Generative models are versatile, learning from both labeled and unlabeled data.",

This is a natural generalization of standard logic in which a concept's degree of truth, also known as membership value or degree of membership, can range from 0.0 to 1.0. Standard logic only applies to concepts that are either completely true, i.e., degree of truth 1.0, or completely false, i.e., degree of truth 0.0. Fuzzy logic, on the other hand, has been used to deal with the concept of partial truth, in which the truth value may range from completely true to completely false, such as 0.9 or 0.5. For instance, \"if x is very large, do y; if x is not very large, do z\". Here the boundaries of very big and not too big may overlap, i.e. fuzzy. As a result, fuzzy logic-based models can recognize, represent, manipulate, understand, and use data and information that are vague and uncertain [104] .

Thus, the system may work with any type of input data, including imprecise, distorted, or noisy data, as well as with limited data. It is a suitable strategy to use in scenarios with real, continuousvalued elements because it uses data acquired in surroundings with such properties [34] . Fuzzy logic-based models are used to tackle problems in a variety of fields. Reddy et al. [74] , for example, use a fuzzy logic classifier for heart disease detection, with the derived rules from fuzzy classifiers being optimized using an adaptive genetic algorithm. Krishnan et al. [51] describes a fuzzy logic-based smart irrigation system using IoT, which sends out periodic acknowledgment messages on task statuses such as soil humidity and temperature. Hamamoto et al. [34] describe a network anomaly detection method based on fuzzy logic for determining whether or not a given instance is anomalous. Kang et al. [44] proposed a fuzzy weighted association rule mining approach for developing a customer satisfaction product form. Overall, we can infer that fuzzy logic can make reasonable conclusions in a world of imprecision, uncertainty, and partial data, and thus might be useful in such scenarios while building a model.",

Many types of knowledge can be used in various application domains include descriptive knowledge, structural knowledge, procedural knowledge, meta-knowledge, and heuristic knowledge [87] . Knowledge representation is more than just storing data in a database; it also allows an intelligent machine to learn from its knowledge and experiences to act intelligently as a human. As a result, in designing an intelligent system, an effective method of knowledge representation is required. Several knowledge representation approaches exist in the fields that can be utilized to develop a knowledge-based conceptual model, including logical, semantic network, frame, and production rules [95] .

            "text": "\u2022 Ontology-based In general, ontology is \"an explicit specification of conceptualization and a formal way to define the semantics of knowledge and data\" [56] . According to [56] , formally, an ontology is represented as \" {O = C, R, I, H, A} , where {C = C 1 , C 2 , \u2026 , C n } represents a set of concepts, and {R = R 1 , R 2 , \u2026 , R m } represents a set of relations defined over the concepts. I represents a set of instances of concepts, and H represents a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) defined by the subsumption relation between concepts, and A represents a set of axioms bringing additional constraints on the ontology\". Ontology-based knowledge representation and reasoning techniques provide sophisticated knowledge about the environment for processing tasks or methods. Figure 8 shows an example of ontology components for the entity University [26] . By defining shared and common domain theories, ontologies help people and machines to communicate concisely by supporting semantic knowledge for a particular domain. In the area of semantic data mining, such ontology-based approaches like classification, mining with association rules, clustering, finding links, etc. can play a significant role to build smart systems. Fig. 8 An example of ontology components for the entity University [26] \u2022 Rule-base It typically consists of pairs of the condition, and corresponding action, which means, \"IF < condition > THEN < action > \" [85] . As a result, an agent checks the condition first, and if the condition is satisfied, the related rule fires. The key benefit of a rule-based system like this is that the \"condition\" part can select which rule is appropriate to use for a given scenario. The \"action\" portion, on the other hand, is responsible for implementing the problem's solutions. Furthermore, in a rule-based system, we can easily insert, delete, or update rules as needed. \u2022 Uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning Probabilistic reasoning is a method of knowledge representation in which the concept of probability is used to signify the uncertainty in knowledge, and where probability theory and logic are combined to address the uncertainty [65] . Probability is the numerical measure of the possibility of an event occurring, and it can be defined as the chance that an uncertain event will occur. To deal with uncertainty in a model, probabilistic models, fuzzy logic, Bayesian belief networks, etc. can be employed.",

            "text": "Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a cognitive science and AI paradigm that represents reasoning as primarily memorybased. CBR is concerned with the \"smart\" reuse of knowledge from previously solved problems (\"cases\") and its adaption to new and unsolved problems. The inference is a problem-solving strategy based on the similarity of the current situation to previously solved problems recorded in a repository. Its premise is that the more similar the two issues are, the more similar their solutions will be. Thus, case-based reasoners handle new problems by obtaining previously stored 'cases' that describe similar earlier problemsolving experiences and customizing their solutions to meet new requirements. For example, patient case histories and treatments are utilized in medical education to assist diagnose and treating new patients. Figure 10 shows a general architecture of case-based reasoning. CBR research looks at the CBR process as a model of human cognition as well as a method for developing intelligent systems. CBR is utilized in a variety of applications. Lamy et al. [52] , for example, provide a visual case-based reasoning strategy for explainable artificial intelligence for breast cancer. Gonzalez et al. [30] provide a case-based reasoning-based energy optimization technique. Khosravani et al. [47] offers a case-based reasoning application in a defect detection system for dripper manufacturing. Corrales et al. [17] provide a case-based reasoning system for data cleaning algorithm recommendation in classification and regression problems. As the number of stored cases grows, CBR becomes more intelligent and thus might be useful in such scenarios while building a model. However, as the time SN Computer Science required to find and process relevant cases increases, the system's efficiency will decline.",

            "text": "Text mining [7] , also known as text data mining, similar to text analytics, is the process of extracting meaningful information from a variety of text or written resources, such as websites, books, emails, reviews, docs, comments, articles, and so on. Information retrieval, lexical analysis to investigate word frequency distributions, pattern recognition, tagging or annotation, information extraction, and data mining techniques such as link and association analysis, visualization, and predictive analytics are all part of text analysis. Text mining achieves this by employing several analysis techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP). NLP is a text analysis technique that allows machines to interpret human speech. NLP tasks include speech recognition, also known as speech-to-text, word segmentation or tokenization, lemmatization and stemming, part of speech tagging, parsing, word sense disambiguation, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, topic segmentation and recognition, and natural language generation, which is the task of converting structured data into human language [21] . Fake news identification, spam detection, machine translation, question answering, social media sentiment analysis, text summarization, virtual agents and chatbots, and other real-world applications use NLP techniques. Although many language-processing systems were built in the early days using symbolic approaches, such as handcoding a set of rules and looking them up in a dictionary, NLP now blends computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models [80, 81] . These technologies, when used together, allow computers to process human language in the form of text or speech data and comprehend its full meaning, including the speaker's or writer's intent and sentiment. Many works have been done in this area. For example, using the feature ensemble model, Phan et al. [68] propose a method for improving the performance of sentiment analysis of tweets with a fuzzy sentiment. Using weighted word embeddings and deep neural networks, Onan et al. [62] provide sentiment analysis on product reviews. Subramaniyaswamy et al. [96] present sentiment analysis of tweets for estimating event criticality and security. In [60] , the efficacy of social media data in healthcare communication is discussed. Typically, learning techniques rather than static analysis is more effective in terms of automation and intelligence in textual modeling or NLP systems. In addition to standard machine learning algorithms [81] , deep learning models and techniques, particularly, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) enable such systems to learn as they go and extract progressively accurate meaning from large amounts of unstructured, unlabeled text and speech input. Thus various deep learning techniques including generative and discriminative models can be used to build powerful textual or NLP model according to their learning capabilities from data, discussed briefly in our earlier paper Sarker et al. [80] , which could also be a significant research direction in the area. Overall, we can conclude that by combining machine and deep learning techniques with natural language processing, computers can intelligently analyze, understand, and infer meaning from human speech or text, and thus could be useful for building textual AI models.",

The general architecture of a convolution neural network is depicted in Figure 11 . Large datasets of thousands or millions of labeled training samples are typically used to train these algorithms. However, the lack of appropriate data limits the applications that can be developed. While enormous volumes of data can be obtained fast, supervised learning also necessitates data that has been labeled. Unfortunately, data labeling takes a long time and costs a lot of money.

            "text": "Moreover, many AI problems can be solved theoretically by searching through a large number of possible solutions, and the reasoning process may be reduced down to a simple search. Thus, search strategies, also known as universal problem-solving approaches in AI, can also play a significant role to solve real-world issues such as gaming, ranking web pages, video, and other content in search results, etc., due to the properties of its completeness, optimality, time complexity, and space complexity. Depending on the nature of the problems, search algorithms can be uninformed search (a.k.a. blind, brute-force) or informed search (a.k.a. heuristic search). Uninformed search [75] refers to a group of generalpurpose search algorithms that generate search trees without relying on domain information, such as breadth-first, depthfirst, uniform cost search, etc. Informed search [75] algorithms, on the other hand, use additional or problem-specific knowledge in the search process, such as greedy search, A* search, graph search, etc. For example, when searching on Google Maps, one needs to provide information such as a position from the current location to precisely traverse the distance, time traveled, and real-time traffic updates on that specific route. Informed search can solve a variety of complicated problems that cannot be handled any other way. Furthermore, evolutionary computation employs an optimization search technique, such as genetic algorithms, which has a great potential to solve real-world issues. For instance, in the domain of cybersecurity, a genetic algorithm is used for effective feature selection to detect anomalies in fog computing environment [61] . In [28] , genetic algorithm is used for optimized feature selection to detect Android malware using machine learning techniques. With AI-powered search, the platform learns from the data to provide the most accurate and relevant search results automatically. Thus, searching as well as optimization techniques can be used as a part of hybridization while building AI models to solve real-world problems.",

AI has acted as the driving force behind developing technologies for industrial automation, medical applications, agriculture, IoT applications, cybersecurity services, etc. summarized in \"Future Aspect and Research Issues\", and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. This interdisciplinary science comes with numerous advancements and approaches that are possible with the help of deep learning, machine learning algorithms, knowledge-base expert systems, natural language processing, visual recognition, etc. discussed briefly in \"Potential AI techniques\". Thus, by taking into account the capabilities of AI technologies, we illustrate three essential terms, mentioned in \"Introduction\" within the scope of our study. These are \u2022 Automation One of the main themes of today's applications is automation, which encompasses a wide range of technologies that reduce human interaction in operations. A program, a script, or batch processing are commonly used in computing to automate tasks. AI-based automation takes the insights gained through computational analytics to the next level, allowing for automated decisionmaking. As a result, we can describe automation as the development and implementation of technology to manufacture and deliver products and services to increase the efficiency, dependability, and/or speed of various jobs traditionally handled by humans. In customer service, for example, virtual assistants can lower expenses while empowering both customers and human agents, resulting in a better customer experience. Artificial intelligence technology has the potential to automate almost any industry and every person on the planet. \u2022 Intelligent computing It is also known as computational intelligence, and it refers to a computer's or system's ability to extract insights or usable knowledge from data or experimental observation, or to learn a specific task. Intelligent computing methodologies include informa-tion processing, data mining, and knowledge discovery, as well as machine learning, pattern recognition, signal processing, natural language processing, fuzzy systems, knowledge representation, and reasoning. Transportation, industry, health, agriculture, business, finance, security, and other fields could all benefit from intelligent systems. Thus, the above-mentioned AI techniques, discussed in \"Potential AI techniques\" are the main drivers for performing intelligent computing as well as decision-making. \u2022 Smart computing The word \"Smart\" can be described as self-monitoring, analyzing, and reporting technology in smart computing, and the word \"Computing\" can be defined as computational analysis. As a result, it can be thought of as the next generation of computing, which is used to create something self-aware, that is, something that can sense the activities of its environment, massage the gathered data, perform some analytics, and provide the best decisions while also predicting future risks and challenges. In other words, it is a significant multidisciplinary area in which AI-based computational methods and technologies, as explained in \"Potential AI techniques\", are integrated with engineering approaches to produce systems, applications, and new services that suit societal demands. Overall, it strives to construct a smart system by monitoring, analyzing, and reporting data in a faster and smarter manner, with AI-based modeling playing a vital part in system intelligence and decisionmaking.",

Business, health care, energy, transportation systems, environment, security, surveillance, industrial systems, information retrieval and publication, entertainment and creativity, and social activities can all benefit from automation, intelligence, and smart computer systems. For example, chatbots, consumer personalization, image-based targeting advertising, and warehouse and inventory automation are all examples of how AI will continue to drive e-commerce. The potential benefits of using AI in medicine are now being investigated. The medical industry has a wealth of data that may be used to develop healthcare-related predictive models. Manufacturing, notably the automobile industry, will be significantly impacted by AI. AI will have an impact on sales operations in a range of industries. Marketing tactics, such as business models, sales procedures, and customer service options, as well as customer behavior, are predicted to be significantly influenced by AI. AI and machine learning will be key technologies in cybersecurity for identifying and forecasting threats [77, 89] . AI will be a vital tool for financial security because of its ability to analyze large amounts of data, foresee fraud, and identify it. In the near future, interacting with AI will surely become commonplace. Artificial intelligence can be used to solve incredibly difficult problems and find solutions that are vital to human well-being. These developments have enormous economic and societal implications. Thus, we can say, AI's potential is limitless and its future will be shaped by our decisions and actions. While our discussion has established a solid foundation on AI-based systems and applications, hence we outline the below ten research issues.",

            "text": "\u2022 Several potential AI techniques exist in the area with the capability of solving problems, discussed in \"Potential AI techniques\". To understand the nature of the problem and an in-depth analysis is important to find a suitable solution, i.e., detecting cyber-anomalies or attacks [78] . Thus, the challenge is \"Which AI technique is most suited to solving a specific real-world problem, taking into account the problem's nature?\" \u2022 One promising research direction for AI-based solutions is to develop a general framework that can handle the issues involved. A well-designed framework and experimental evaluation are both a crucial direction and a significant challenge. Thus, the question is \"How can we design an effective AI-based framework to achieve the target outcome by taking into account the issues involved?\" \u2022 The digital world contains a wealth of data in this age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0 or 4IR), including IoT data, corporate data, health data, cellular data, urban data, cybersecurity data, and many more [79] . Extracting insights using various analytical methods is important for smart decision-making in a particular system. Thus, the question is \"How to extract useful insights or knowledge from real-world raw data to build an automated and intelligent system for a particular business problem? \u2022 Nowadays, data are considered as the most valuable resource in the world and various machine learning [81] and deep learning [80] techniques are used to learn from data or past experience, which automates analytical model building. The increase in data and such datadriven analytical modeling have made AI the highest growth in history. Thus, it's important to do some data pre-processing tasks to feed into the ultimate machine learning model, so the data behaves nicely for the model. Therefore, the question is \"How to effectively feed data to a machine or deep learning model to solve a particular real-world problem?\" \u2022 The traditional machine learning [81] and deep learning [80] techniques may not be directly applicable for the expected outcome in many cases. Thus, designing new techniques or their variants by taking into account model optimization, accuracy, and applicability, according to the nature of the data and target real-world application, could be a novel contribution in the area. Therefore the question is-\"How to design an effective learning algorithm or model allowing the application to learn automatically from the patterns or features in the data?\" \u2022 In the domain of today's smart computing, the term 'context-awareness' typically refers to a system's capacity to gather information about its surroundings at any given time and adapt its behavior accordingly. Thus, the concept of context-aware machine learning can play a key role to build an intelligent context-aware application, highlighted in our book Sarker et al. [85] . Thus, the question is \"How to effectively incorporate contextawareness in an AI-based smart system that can sense from the surrounding environment and make intelligent decisions accordingly?\" \u2022 Decision rules, represented as IF-THEN statement, can play an important role in the area of AI. Expert systems, a core part of AI, are typically used to solve many realworld complex problems by reasoning through knowledge, which are mostly represented by such IF-THEN rules rather than traditional procedural code [85] . Thus, a rule-based system can manipulate knowledge and interpret information in a useful way. Therefore, the question is \"How can we design an automated rule-based system emulating the decision-making ability of a human expert through discovering a concise set of IF-THEN rules from the data? \u2022 A decision support system is a type of information system that aids in the decision-making process of a business or organization. AI techniques discussed in \"Potential AI techniques\" can play a key role to provide intelligent decisions across a wide range of sectors (e.g., business, education, healthcare, etc.) rather than the traditional system, according to the nature of the problem. Thus, the challenge is \"How can we design an AI-assisted decision-support system that aids a team or organization in making better decisions?\" \u2022 Uncertainty refers to an event's lack of confidence or certainty, e.g., information occurred from unreliable sources. Several strategies, such as the probabilitybased model or fuzzy logic, discussed in \"Potential AI techniques\" allow for the processing of uncertain and imprecise knowledge while also providing a sophisticated reasoning framework. The ability of AI to identify and handle uncertainty and risk is essential for applying AI to decision-making challenges. Thus, the question is \"How to manage uncertainty in AI-enabled decision-making applications\". \u2022 With the widespread availability of various IoT services, Internet of things (IoT) devices are becoming more common in mobile networks. It is essential nowadays to have a lightweight solution that promises high-performing artificial intelligence applications for mobile and IoT devices. Thus, the question is \"How to design AI-enabled lightweight model for intelligent decision-making through IoT and mobile devices\".",
