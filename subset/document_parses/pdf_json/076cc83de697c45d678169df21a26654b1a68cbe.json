The WHO, ECDC and CDC have issued conflicting guidelines on the use of respiratory filters (N95) by HCWs. We searched PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to March 21, 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of COVID-19 or any other respiratory infection among HCWs. The grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Four RCTs involving 8736 HCWs were included. We did not find any trial specifically on prevention of COVID-19. However, wearing N95 respirators can prevent 73 more (95% CI 46-91) clinical respiratory infections per 1000 HCWs compared to surgical masks (2 RCTs; 2594 patients; low quality of evidence). A protective effect of N95 respirators in laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.41; 95%CI 0.28-0.61) was also found. A trend in favour of N95 respirators was observed in preventing laboratoryconfirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza like illness. We found no direct high quality evidence on whether N95 respirators are better than surgical masks for HCWs protection from SARS-CoV-2. However, low quality evidence suggests that N95 respirators protect HCWs from clinical respiratory infections. This finding should be contemplated to decide the best strategy to support the resilience of healthcare systems facing the potentially catastrophic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak emerged in China in December 2019 and it was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March [1] . As of 3 May 2020, a total of 3,349,786 cases and 238, 628 deaths have been reported worldwide [2] . Nosocomial spread and infection of healthcare workers (HCWs) are a major concern. In Italy HCWs are paying a heavy price in addition to their professional and humanitarian efforts, with 21,338 cases (more than 10,4% of total Italian cases [3] ) and 154 deaths [4] among physicians. Protecting HCWs from SARS-CoV-2 is therefore of great importance for individual HCW and for their role in fighting this devastating pandemic effectively. Claims of insufficient protection of HCWs by personal protective equipment, in particular with regards to the use of surgical masks, have fuelled the scientific and social media debate in several countries. While both surgical masks and N95 respirators are worn by HCW for self protection, they have different intended uses [5] . Surgical masks do not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles and fit the face loosely while N95 respirators are able to do so by fitting tightly to the wearer's face and fulfil strict filtration requirements. In fact, except for aerosol generating procedures requiring higher level of respiratory protection with filtering respirators (ie. N95 respirators), WHO considers surgical masks adequate for the routine care of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients [6] . Instead, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the European Center for Disease Control guidelines (ECDC) have a more cautious approach, acknowledging that the exact role of airborne (aerosol) route in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still largely unknown [7, 8] . The direct evidence supporting the WHO guidelines is based on very few case reports on the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples taken in highly protected environments where a rapid dilution of aerosols occurs, the absence of infection of HCWs exposed for a limited time or limited viral loads, or on modelling of epidemiologic patterns of transmission [9] [10] [11] [12] . In contrast, the airborne (aerosol) opportunistic route of transmission has been documented for SARS and MERS caused by closely related coronaviruses responsible of severe nosocomial infections among HCWs. Aerosol filtering respirators were consequently recommended for SARS during 2002-03 outbreak [13] . It is worth remembering that Canadian Health authorities modified their earlier recommendations in favour of a more strict respiratory protection after the deaths of several HCWs [14] . The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols has been documented in experimental [15] and real life conditions in crowded, poorly ventilated hospital areas unrelated to aerosol generating procedures [16] . Also, spontaneous cough generates aerosols, not only droplets [17, 18] and COVID-19 patients may infect HCWs in this way, especially if they are unable to wear facemasks due to hypoxia and need of oxygen therapy. Moreover, none of the above mentioned guidelines adopted the suggested Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for directing public health policy decisions and they did not explicitly consider the potentially catastrophic consequences of deferring the recommendation of N95 respirators for HCWs while awaiting more robust evidence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 195, "end": 198, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 295, "end": 298, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 540, "end": 543, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1064, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1540, "end": 1543, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1810, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1813, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2168, "end": 2171, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2172, "end": 2176, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2177, "end": 2181, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2182, "end": 2186, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2492, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2674, "end": 2678, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2760, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2874, "end": 2878, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2943, "end": 2947, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2948, "end": 2951, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "There are already some systematic reviews addressing the role of N95 respirators in protecting HCWs, offering however a debatable interpretation of the estimates of the effect (ie. reviews' analyses did not take into account the clustered design of RCTs) [19] [20] [21] [22] .

Indeed, if clustering is ignored, P values will be artificially small resulting in false positive conclusions about the effectiveness of the intervention. In addition, we adopted the Claxton model to quantify the trade-off between immediate implementation of the intervention versus deferring it while awaiting further evidence. Finally, we offered a solid ground for the development of future evidence-based clinical guidance based on the quality of evidence by GRADE approach which can be applied in a variety of decision-making contexts, including urgent responses as the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 pandemic [45, 46] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 820, "end": 824, "text": "[45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 825, "end": 828, "text": "46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations and strengths"}, {"text": "This is the first systematic review on the efficacy of N95 respirators versus surgical masks among HCWs accounting for possible bias derived from cluster trials and evaluating the findings from a public health policy perspective. We found evidence that N95 respirators halve the risk of any respiratory infection compared to surgical masks. Considering that the absenteeism from work due to healthcare related infections hampers heavily the resilience of healthcare systems facing an infectious pandemic, the protective effect of N95 respirators for this primary outcome could produce large benefits in the current context. Furthermore, the immediate implementation of the intervention, rather than deferring it until more studies will be available, seems justified on a sound quantitative basis. The evidence from the current study could be used to inform the production of trustworthy GRADE based guidelines for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs.
