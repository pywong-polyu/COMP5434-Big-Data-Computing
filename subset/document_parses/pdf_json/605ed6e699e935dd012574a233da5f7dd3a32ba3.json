[2] [3] [4] By April 30, 2020, over 3,249,000 COVID-19 cases had already been confirmed worldwide, with more than 1,067,000 cases and 62,000 resulting deaths in the United States. 5 In an effort to contain the virus, broad shutdowns resulted in severe economic impacts including 26 million Americans filing for unemployment within a 5 week period. 6 Simultaneously, there is concern that quarantine puts people at increased risk of domestic violence and severe psychological suffering, as well as physical inactivity, weight gain, behavioral addiction disorders, and insufficient sunlight exposure. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] It is therefore important to quantify the effects of early, proactive social distancing measures on disease spread in order to guide future policy decisions which may continue to limit economic security and healthy lifestyles.",

Previous modeling studies have described the importance of social distancing in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] and these findings have been supported by case data. 2, [20] [21] [22] Mandated NPIs have also been associated with reduced transmission, 23 presumably due to subsequent reductions in community mobility. 3 However, little has been done to characterize the impact of NPIs in states with poor compliance. Furthermore, efforts to quantify the effects on transmission have not accounted for different stages of outbreak, discounting that the effectiveness of policy changes will likely differ if they are instituted in the context of 20 cases or 10,000. This study accounts for the stage of disease spread by selecting a normalized point on the epidemic curve, analyzing each state in the week following its 500th case and assessing how different NPIs influence the burgeoning case load early in outbreaks.",

In states that implemented a stay-at-home order prior to reaching 500 cases, we observe a significant decrease in the effective viral transmission rate and an increase in the time to reach 1000 cases. Subsequent multivariable analyses indicate that this effect may have been driven by a state-wide increase in the amount of time spent at home.

Many previous research studies and news sources characterizing disease burden have relied on the metrics of cumulative case and death counts; however, these metrics are unidirectional and do not account for bidirectional changes in the rate of viral transmission over time, a much more powerful metric for predicting an epidemic's trajectory. In this study, we examine effective reproduction number (R t ) as the primary metric of disease burden, which describes the virus's transmission potential in real-time and can thus account for the impact of contextual changes in policy and behavior on disease spread. Further, this R t metric has been used widely in popular media to report the rate of disease spread in different areas.

Disease modeling has indicated that social distancing is a critical measure to achieve this goal, but studies validating these findings with case data can increase buy-in from policy makers and the public. This study indicates that stayat-home orders, limitations on mass gatherings, educational facility closures, and non-essential businesses closures are all effective measures at reducing transmission rates, thereby \"flattening the curve,\" with stay-at-home orders having the largest effect. Of note, adherence to social distancing appears to be the driving force behind the effectiveness of these policies, as states with stay-at-home orders but relatively poor adherence experienced doubling times more similar to those without such policies. By more rigorously characterizing the state-level strategies that have proved most effective at reducing disease burden, this study aims to provide stakeholders with a more standardized, data-driven framework to guide future policy decisions.
