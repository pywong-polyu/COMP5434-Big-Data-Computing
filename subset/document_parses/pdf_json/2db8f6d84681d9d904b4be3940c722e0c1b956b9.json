            "text": "Introduction: A post hoc, descriptive analysis of three prospective, randomised, controlled clinical studies investigating cefiderocol in gram-negative bacterial infections was conducted to assess its efficacy in patients with baseline bacteraemia. Methods: Data from APEKS-cUTI (NCT02321800), APEKS-NP (NCT03032380) and CREDIBLE-CR (NCT02714595) studies were assessed individually. Patients received cefiderocol 2g, q8h, for 7-14 days or comparators (imipenem/cilastatin [APEKS-cUTI], meropenem [APEKS-NP] or best available therapy [BAT; CREDIBLE-CR]). Bacteraemia and clinical outcomes were assessed at early assessment (EA), end of treatment (EOT) and test of cure (TOC) for patients in the intention-to-treat populations with baseline blood samples positive for aerobic gram-negative species. Eradication, persistence or recurrence of baseline blood pathogen was confirmed from follow-up blood cultures; in the absence of follow-up blood cultures, clinical response, administration of additional antibiotics and vital status were used to assess bacteraemia outcome. Results: Of 885 patients randomised, 84 had bacteraemia and 89 (cefiderocol: 55, comparators: 34) gram-negative pathogens were isolated, namely Enterobacterales (n = 62) and non-fermenters (n = 27). At EA, on-therapy bacteraemia eradication rates in APEKS-cUTI, APEKS-NP and CREDIBLE-CR were 100% (19/ 19), 50.0% (4/8) and 72.0% (18/25) with cefiderocol. Corresponding rates for comparators were 77.8% (7/9), 100% (10/10) and 69.2% (9/13), respectively. Persistence in blood at EA was seen in six patients overall (cefiderocol: 3, comparators: 3); indeterminate responses were common (cefiderocol: 8, comparators: 3), usually due to lack of blood cultures. Clinical cure/ improvement rates at EA in APEKS-cUTI, APEKS-NP and CREDIBLE-CR were 100% (19/19), 62.5% (5/8) and 64.0% (16/25) with cefiderocol. Corresponding rates for comparators were 77.8% (7/9), 90.0% (9/10) and 30.8% (4/13), respectively. Bacteraemia eradication rates with cefiderocol in APEKS-cUTI, APEKS-NP and Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// CREDIBLE-CR were 89.5%, 37.5% and 60.0% at EOT and 78.9%, 12.5% and 44.0% at TOC. Conclusion: This descriptive analysis suggests that cefiderocol may be a useful treatment option for gram-negative bacteraemia, including pathogens resistant to other antibiotics.",

With rising global antimicrobial resistance, the management of BSIs caused by carbapenem-resistant (CR), multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Enterobacterales and nonfermenters [8, 9, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] has become challenging in both community and hospital settings [14, 15] . MDR gram-negative pathogens are also a common cause of neonatal sepsis in lowerand middle-income countries, contributing to infant morbidity and mortality [20, 21] . Antibiotic resistance is the result of a range of mechanisms employed by various species, including plasmid-encoded extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs, e.g. Temoneira extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [TEM]-, sulphydryl variant of TEM extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [SHV]-and cefotaxime-hydrolysing beta-lactamase [CTX-M]-type enzymes), carbapenemases (e.g. K. pneumoniae carbapenemase [KPC]), metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs, e.g. imipenemase metallo-beta-lactamase [IMP] , Verona integron-encoded metallobeta-lactamase [VIM] , New Delhi metallo-betalactamase [NDM] ) and oxacillinase (OXA) enzymes [19] . Due to the variability of resistance mechanisms, appropriate antibiotic treatment is often delayed, increasing the risk of mortality [9] [10] [11] .",

Data from subset analyses of patients with bacteraemia from infection site-specific trials are alternative evidence, but often limited because of the general exclusion of patients with highly resistant pathogens. Additionally, because these studies were generally focused on specific infection sites (e.g. lung, urinary tract), assessment of the microbiological clearance of the baseline blood pathogen is not systematically conducted. Nevertheless, since bacteraemia represents the most severe manifestation of infection, even if the primary source is identified, failure to clear culturable bacteraemia is considered a suboptimal response to treatment. Among patients with gram-negative bacteraemia, positive follow-up blood cultures may be associated with increased mortality compared with negative blood cultures [22] . Thus, there is a need to more precisely evaluate the treatment of secondary bacteraemia caused by resistant gram-negative pathogens.",

Patients with known carbapenemnon-susceptible pathogens were excluded. No adjunctive gram-negative therapy was allowed [26] . APEKS-NP (NCT03032380) was a 1:1 randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority Phase 3 study in patients with nosocomial pneumonia (NP), comparing cefiderocol (2 g, q8h, 3-h infusion) with high-dose, extended-infusion meropenem (2 g, q8h, 3-h infusion). No adjunctive gram-negative therapy was allowed; however, linezolid 600 mg, twice daily, was administered for at least 5 days in both arms to cover gram-positive bacteria in the cefiderocol arm and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in both arms. Patients with CR pathogens known at the time of randomisation were excluded [27] . CREDIBLE-CR (NCT02714595) was a 2:1 randomised, open-label, descriptive Phase 3 study conducted in patients with serious infection (cUTI, NP and BSI/sepsis) caused by CR gram-negative pathogens. Patients were treated with cefiderocol (2 g, q8h, 3-h infusion) or best available therapy (BAT, which could include up to three agents dosed according to the local label) [28] . In all three studies, eradication of pathogen-causing bacteraemia was confirmed from subsequent blood cultures collected at early assessment (EA), end of treatment (EOT), test of cure (TOC) and follow-up (FUP) visits.",

Although the main focus of the analysis was to describe the clinical effectiveness and microbiological activity of cefiderocol in patients with gram-negative bacteraemia, effects of comparator antibiotics from each of the three studies involved were also included for completeness. However, no statistical comparisons between cefiderocol and comparator antibiotics were made for this analysis. The analysed population per study is the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, in which patients in both treatment arms received at least one dose of study drug. Patients with NP or cUTI diagnosis could have had no primary infection gram-negative pathogen but a positive blood culture at randomisation. ACM was calculated for the ITT population in each study.",

It was recognised when planning the analysis that this might lead to better outcomes in patients from APEKS-cUTI compared with those from the other two studies, particularly CREDIBLE-CR. However, because patients with known CR gram-negative pathogens at randomisation were excluded from APEKS-cUTI and APEKS-NP, most of the CR pathogens among patients with bacteraemia were identified in CREDIBLE-CR; therefore, results from patients with CR infections were not confounded by study design heterogeneity. Of note, the difference between the studies in the randomisation ratios (2:1 for cefiderocol in APEKS-cUTI and CREDIBLE-CR, and 1:1 in APEKS-NP) explains the greater number of bacteraemia patients receiving cefiderocol (n = 52) than comparators (n = 32).",

Enterobacterales isolates with MBLs were eradicated with cefiderocol at a high rate (75% [3/4] ) at EA and 100% (4/4) at EOT. This is consistent with in vitro data showing activity of cefiderocol in the presence of beta-lactamases, including MBLs, as well as porin mutations and upregulated efflux pumps [29] .

The higher mortality rates may be a reflection of risk factors such as pneumonia, ventilation status, high APACHE II and SOFA scores in APEKS-NP and CR gram-negative infections in CREDIBLE-CR. Mortality rates are known to be affected by primary infection severity [10, 30] and infection site. In gram-negative BSI, including CR Enterobacterales, mortality was found to be higher in patients with a pulmonary source of infection compared with other sources, including UTI [1, 2, 7, 14] . These factors may help to explain the difference between our findings and those from the MERINO trial, in which the overall mortality rate remained \\ 10%, despite a mortality difference between the meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam arms [7] . The MERINO trial excluded severely ill patients, the main source of bacteraemia was the urinary tract (64%) and E. coli was the causative pathogen in around 86% of patients [7] .",

There was a broad range of bacterial species, both Enterobacterales and non-fermenters (most importantly Acinetobacter), as well as considerable diversity in bacterial resistance mechanisms, as assessed by molecular analysis. Of note, cefiderocol treatment was given as monotherapy to 47 of 52 (90.4%) patients across the studies, providing a clearer link between cefiderocol therapy and outcomes.",

This means that a true rate of microbiological eradication or, conversely, persistence could be underestimated when responses are classified as indeterminate. Among the studies reported here, the highest rate of repeat culture provision was in the BSI/sepsis subset of patients in CREDIBLE-CR. We found a high indeterminate microbiological response rate in APEKS-NP due to deaths, additional antibiotics and missing samples. While the lack of repeat cultures in our analysis was unavoidable given the design of the studies analysed, use of an algorithm that allowed clinical response to determine bacteraemia response helped in part to address the problem of indeterminate responses. As stated previously, pooled analysis of data was not feasible because of the heterogeneity across the studies. Finally, any interpretation of the data should acknowledge its descriptive nature and the small size of the subgroups.",

Our post hoc analysis data are complemented by efficacy findings for cefiderocol in real-life cases of difficult-to-treat severe gram-negative infections. Microbiological clearance from repeat blood cultures was seen in around 67% of a total of 60 patients with BSI due mainly to CR or XDR A. baumannii and difficult-to-treat resistant P. aeruginosa [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . A more complete picture of the real-world efficacy of cefiderocol in gram-negative BSI patients will be provided by the ongoing Phase 2 GAMECHANGER study, an open-label, prospective, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, comparing cefiderocol and standard of care in the treatment of healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired BSI (NCT03869437; [43] ).",
