In this report, Staining of cells with a fluorescently labeled anti-gp64 antibody allows for identification of infected insect cells. By inoculating cultures with a series of log dilutions of virus, and staining of the cultures 13-22 hours post inoculation, the ratio of infected to un-infected insect cells can be determined by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis of the percentage of infected cells in the virus dilution series enables accurate infectious titer determination. The culture time, cell growth state, the concentration of GP64-APC antibody and the concentration of inactivated FBS in diluent were optimized.The generality, repeatability and intermediate precision of the method were verified. The FCM method has the advantages of simplicity, accuracy, low cost and good repeatability.",

Lactosidase activity, the use of microfluidic bioanalyzer, etc [3] . The plaque method is a classic method for titer determination, but the detection cycle is long (6-10 days), and the operator's technical and experience requirements are high; the end-point dilution method also requires at least 3 days. Currently, immunostaining and qPCR are widely used. The qPCR method has the advantage of a short detection cycle, but it requires a nucleic acid extraction step, which is to detect the number of gene copies, rather than the infectious virus titer value, which is not accurate enough. The immunostaining method also has a series of shortcomings: there are many operating steps and a long detection cycle; manual counting is required, which is more labor-intensive; insect cells are semi-adherent cells, which are not firmly attached during detection, and they may fall off in the multi-well plate. In the process of counting spots, the subjectivity is strong and requires certain experience or standards to distinguish.",
