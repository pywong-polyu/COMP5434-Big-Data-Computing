Along this line, Blach et al. [5] modeled brightly the devastating consequences of delaying HCV elimination programs. This delay will be reflected in an increase of HCV-related mortality, both as consequence of cirrhosis complications and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. A single-year delay may result in an excess of 70,000 liver-relateddeaths and 44,000 excess HCC diagnoses.",

Unfortunately, the closure of harm reduction centers, cancellation of elimination programs and medical consultations, as well as the struggle for accessing to health centers in this pandemic time, is decreasing the rate of HCV diagnoses. In fact, a recent survey evaluating the collateral damages of COVID19 on VH services showed that up to 64% of participants reported the impossibility to access to viral testing, with the closure of testing facilities being its main cause in the United States [7] . Consequently, this diagnosis adjournment J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 will be translated into a patent delay in starting DAA, whose future consequences have just been predicted by Blach et al.

Thus, it should be translated into the need of massive population testing, since home confinement -and re-confinement-cannot be a long-lasting measure because of the collateral consequences. Therefore, the vast majority of people are probably undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing. In this regard, and taking advantage of massive SARS-CoV2 testing, we have a golden opportunity for catching up with HBV control and HCV elimination. Since these patients must approach to sanitary facilities, they could be screened for HCV and HBV using only dried blood spots or with a regular blood draw, granting an opportunistic screening at a single visit.",

Finally, since COVID-19 disease itself may induce -although rare-liver damage and the current viral armamentarium includes multiple potentially hepatotoxic drugs, HBV and HCV screening can be considered in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, SARS-CoV2 and hepatitis tests could be easily performed at the same time by means of point-of-care technics, using saliva assays or dried blood spots, preventing further redundant analyses. Thus, establishing integrated diagnostic circuits may prevent unnecessary repeated sampling.We are aware of the huge amount of resources that the pandemic requires, not only for therapeutic purposes, but also for achieving transmission control. However, it is our duty to provide an adequate care for non-COVID19 patients. In fact, if their conditions remain undiagnosed as a consequence of the reintroduction of restrictive policies, they may not overcome them and have a dismal prognosis. For this reason, and in agreement with adapting the cascade-of-care to the new coronavirus situation recommended by the EASL-ESCMID in their last position document[10], we believe that mass and combined detection of SARS-CoV-2, HBV and HCV would allow us to respond simultaneously to several public health problems with minimal cost. As a matter of fact, this policy would allow to maintain the track of viral elimination by 2030.",
