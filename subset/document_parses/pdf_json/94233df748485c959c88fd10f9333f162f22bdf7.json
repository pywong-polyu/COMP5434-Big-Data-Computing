The role of respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), the parainfluenza virus, influenza virus and adenovirus in causing acute respiratory infections (ARI) in infants and children is well established (1) . The importance of some other viruses in the development of respiratory illnesses in children has been clarified relatively recently. In addition to their known role as upper respiratory tract pathogens, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, often referred to as common cold agents, have been shown to cause lower respiratory tract disease (3, 4) , whereas the metapneumovirus (5) and human bocavirus (6) have been identified as acute disease causing agents of the respiratory tract.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 89, "end": 92, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 363, "end": 366, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 564, "end": 567, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 903, "end": 906, "text": "(3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 907, "end": 909, "text": "4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 940, "end": 943, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 964, "end": 967, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "However, the majority of studies on VRI utilise a crosssectional design and focus on the relation of a particular virus to the development of a constellation of symptoms.

The prevalence of each individual virus is shown in Table 1 . The most frequently detected viruses in each one of the four study periods, for the whole study population, were as follows: bocavirus (n = 71) for the first, RSV (n = 38) for the second, bocavirus (n = 36) for the third and rhinovirus (n = 37) for the fourth.

This could be attributed to the same periods of sampling and to the roughly equal number of children living in rural and urban areas in both groups. The presence of viruses was not related to symptoms, as the children were generally in good health during the sampling period. The most commonly isolated virus in our study was HBoV, and it was the most prevalent in the first and third sampling periods. However, it was second to RSV and rhinovirus in the second and fourth periods, which were epidemic seasons for those two viruses (11, 12) . The bocavirus was also found to be persistently present in many children, much more so than the rest of the viruses. This is consistent with previous works suggesting prolonged persistence and shedding of bocavirus from the nasopharyngeal secretions in asymptomatic children (13, 14) . Living in an urban environment was found to facilitate the persistence of bocavirus and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this relation has been described. It is already known that exposure to air pollution has been linked to childhood respiratory disease and increased hospitalisation from viral causes. So the phenomenon of repeatedly detecting the bocavirus could probably be partly attributed to the higher levels of air pollution and especially to traffic-derived particulate matter, as it has already been described for other viruses (15) (16) (17) . Apart from bocavirus, the rest of the viruses were isolated in relatively small numbers. The resultant small sample sizes may have prevented our results from showing significant differences in the distributions of other viruses between urban and rural areas. In the analysis, we did not take into account the potential confounding role of indoor air pollution parameters, especially second-hand tobacco smoking, and we consider that this was an important limitation of our study. We did not measure viral load with quantitative PCR or use antibody assays in paired sera so we were not able to study how the bocavirus, or the other viruses, declined so that we could further clarify their role as respiratory pathogens. Likewise, we could not exclude the possibility of reinfection as the cause of the repetitive detection of the bocavirus. Further limitations of our study were the absence of climatic conditions measurements and not having taken into account any preceding clinical symptoms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 624, "end": 628, "text": "(11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 629, "end": 632, "text": "12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 910, "end": 914, "text": "(13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 915, "end": 918, "text": "14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1490, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1495, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1496, "end": 1500, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Our findings suggest that although there were no substantive differences in the carriage of the majority of viruses in the upper airways of preschool-aged children of two to five years of age, with respect to rural or urban residence, the urban environment could have had a promoting effect on the prolonged persistence of HBoV.
