In a well-controlled animal model of infection, we sought to determine if one could predict lethality using transcriptional information obtained from whole blood early after influenza virus exposure. We started with publicly available transcriptomic data from the lung, which is the primary site of the infection and pathology, to derive a multigene transcriptional signature of death reflective of innate inflammation associated with tissue damage. We refined this affected tissue signature with data from infected mouse and human blood to develop and validate a machine learning model that can robustly predict survival in mice after IAV challenge using data obtained from as little as 10 \u00b5l of blood from early time points post infection. Furthermore, in genetically identical, cohoused mice infected with the same viral bolus, the same model can predict the lethality of individual animals but, intriguingly, only within a specific time window that overlapped with the early effector phase of adaptive immunity. These findings raise the possibility of predicting disease outcome in respiratory virus infections with blood transcriptional data and pave the way for translating such approaches to humans.",

A notable exception was the recent description of blood transcriptomics data from a large cohort of subjects enrolled in the Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza Consortium (MOSAIC) study (21) . In that report, severity of infectionmeasured in terms of need for mechanical ventilation -was associated with a weak transcriptional \"viral response\" signal and a strong transcriptional \"bacterial response\" (and activated-neutrophil) signal in blood in comparison with non-severe cases. However, these transcription patterns were also strongly associated with duration of illness and the authors emphasized the importance of timing in the interpretation of immune activity to IAV infection (21), which, for obvious reasons, can be hard to control for in natural human infection studies.",

Importantly, it is not known mechanistically what drives this outcome dichotomy, since measuring putative candidate factors such as lung viral titer and immune infiltration requires sacrificing the mice and, thus, precludes assessment of the actual outcome of disease. To us, the most obvious candidate mechanism was that differences in initial infectious bolus effectively received by each animal during the infection procedure would determine the dichotomy.

Although the average T cell response to infection is remarkably efficient and constant (44-48), formation of the na\u00efve repertoire of antigen-specific T cells is a semi-stochastic process that varies in each host, resulting in a range of precursor frequencies (49-51) and, presumably, leading to a spread among the mice in the kinetics of reaching an adequate effector T cell number for effective viral clearance.",

However, a cause/effect relationship is difficult to test directly due to the lack of tools to accurately examine, for example, virus titer, lung infiltration by antigen-specific cells, or the size of their precursor population in live mice, because these would require terminal experiments that would preclude determination of which animals would eventually die several days later due to the actual infection. Nonetheless, preliminary experiments adding gene probes to our panel that report activated CD8+ T cell abundance in the blood samples suggest that there is a relationship between the strength of these lymphocyterelated signals in day 5 or 6 samples and survival after infection. Further tests along these lines are planned to refine the signature and relate these blood findings in a large cohort of infected animals to effector function and viral abundance in the lungs as directly assessed by multiplex tissue imaging.",

Experimental IAV challenge in humans with relatively mild strains indicates a peak of symptoms (mostly runny nose and sore throat but no need for mechanical ventilation) around day 3-4 after exposure (52), but it is not clear how long it takes, on average, for a symptomatic carrier to seek medical treatment, in particular in case of severe disease with highly virulent and/or highly pathogenic strains.
