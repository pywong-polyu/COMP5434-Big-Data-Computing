            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its emerging 33 variants of concern (VOC), such as Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529), has continued to 34 drive the worldwide pandemic. Therefore, there is a high demand for vaccines with enhanced 35 efficacy, high thermostability, superior design flexibility, and fast manufacturing speed. Here, we 36 report a circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine that encodes the trimeric RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike 37 protein. Without the need of nucleotide modification, 5'-capping or 3'-polyadenylation, circRNA 38 could be rapidly produced via in vitro transcription and is highly thermostable whether stored in 39 naked or lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated format. LNP-encapsulated circRNA RBD elicited 40 potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses, providing robust protection against Beta 41 (B.1.351) and native viruses in mice and rhesus macaques, respectively. Notably, circRNA vaccine 42 enabled higher and more durable antigen production than 1m\u03a8-modified mRNA vaccine, eliciting 43 a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies and stronger Th1-biased immune responses. 44 Importantly, we found that circRNA RBD-Omicron vaccine induced effective neutralizing antibodies 45 against only Omicron but not Delta variant. By contrast, circRNA RBD-Delta could elicit high level 46 of neutralizing antibodies against both Delta and Omicron. Following two doses of either native-47 or Delta-specific vaccination, circRNA RBD-Delta , but not Omicron or Beta vaccines, could 48 effectively boost the neutralizing antibodies against both Delta and Omicron variants. These results 49 suggest that circRNA RBD-Delta is a favorable choice for vaccination to provide a broad-spectrum 50 protection against the current variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2. 51 52 Main Text: 53 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious worldwide public health emergency caused by 54 a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) 1,2 . So far, COVID-19 had 55 resulted in ~300 million confirmed cases and over 5 million confirmed deaths (World Health 56 Organization). With the development of the epidemic, variants with immune escape ability 57 appeared, the most serious of which is Omicron. As of Dec. 28, 2021, Omicron had taken ~30% 58 of COVID-19 cases (GISAID). The rapid rise of Omicron suggests that it could overtake Delta as 59 the next dominant strain. Omicron carries over 30 mutations on the Spike protein, 15 of which are 60 located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) 3 , resulting in a significant decrease in the 61 effectiveness of prior neutralizing antibodies 4-8 . This poses a severe challenge to the efficacy of 62 current vaccines, highlighting the urgent need to develop effective vaccines against such fast-63 spreading variants. 64 SARS-CoV-2, together with the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, Severe Acute 65 Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, the 66 other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the 67 Coronaviridae family 9 . SARS-CoV-2 is a single-strand, positive-sense, enveloped virus, with an 68 inner capsid formed by a 30-kb RNA genome wrapped by the nucleocapsid (N) proteins and a 69 lipid envelope coated with the membrane (M), envelope (E), and trimeric Spike (S) proteins 10 .

Seven 183 weeks post the boost dose, the RBD-Beta-specific IgG endpoint GMT was still around 1.2\u00d710 4 184 (Extended Data Fig. 5d) , with significant neutralizing activity against RBD-Beta antigens 185 (Extended Data Fig. 5e ). Each immunized mouse was then intranasally infected with 5\u00d710 4 PFU 186 of Beta virus (7 weeks post the boost dose). The lung tissues were collected three days after the 187 challenge for the detection of viral RNAs. Viral loads in the lungs of vaccinated mice were 188 significantly lower compared with the placebo group (Fig. 1m) . Consistently, only the mice in the 189 placebo group underwent weight loss (Fig. 1n) . These results indicated that the circRNA vaccine could effectively protect the mice against SARS-CoV-2 Beta. 191 Considering that the 50 \u00b5g of circRNA RBD elicited a higher level of neutralizing antibodies than 192 10 \u00b5g, we postulated that the LNP delivery might have great impact on the efficacy of circular 193 RNA vaccine. After multiple tests, we were able to significantly lower the vaccine dose using one 194 of the commercial formulas (Precision Nanosystems). 10 \u00b5g of circRNA could induce neutralizing 195 antibodies at a level comparable to 50 \u00b5g (Extended Data Fig. 6 ).

            "text": "Antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE) of infection by virus-specific antibodies is another 256 potential concern for vaccines, which has been reported for infections by some viruses including 257 Zika, Dengue virus, and coronaviruses 65-69 . Previous research has reported that the virus-binding 258 antibodies without neutralizing activity elicited by infection or vaccination possibly caused the 259 ADE effects, especially for those viruses with different serotypes 70,71 . Therefore, we compared the 260 ratio of neutralizing to binding antibodies between circRNA and mRNA vaccines. Although 261 circRNA RBD-Delta exhibited equal neutralizing capability compared to mRNA RBD-Delta (Fig. 3h-j) , 262 the former induced a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies at all doses tested (0.5 \u00b5g, 2.5 263 \u00b5g, and 5 \u00b5g) in mice (Fig. 3k) . Owing to this unique feature, the circRNA vaccine might have 264 certain advantage to circumvent potential ADE effects and tolerate viral mutations. 265 circRNA RBD-Delta vaccine elicited strong T cell immune responses 4a-c). Similar to the above observations ( Fig. 3h-k) , circRNA RBD-Delta vaccine also elicited higher 297 proportion of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron variant than 1m\u03a8-mRNA RBD-Delta vaccine at 298 both 2 weeks post boost (short-term) and 7 weeks post boost (long-term) (Extended Data Fig.  299 11a-d), indicating the potential superiority of circRNA vaccine against the circulating variants of 300 SARS-CoV-2, likely owing to its high proportion of neutralizing antibody (Fig. 3h-k and  301 Extended Data Fig. 11a-d) .

Only circRNA RBD-Delta effectively boosted the neutralizing antibodies 321 against both Delta (Fig. 4h) and Omicron (Fig. 4i) . On the contrary, the 3 rd boost with the 322 circRNA RBD-Beta or circRNA RBD-Omicron vaccine failed to elevate the neutralizing capability against 323 Omicron (Fig. 4h, i) .",

            "text": "Taken together, these results suggest that circRNA RBD-Delta might be a favorable choice for 331 vaccination to provide a broad-spectrum protection against the current VOC of SARS-CoV-2. 332 However, the 3 rd booster with Omicron-specific vaccines might not be an appropriate strategy 333 against the current Delta and Omicron emergency in the real world. To further assess the immunogenicity of circRNA vaccine in non-human primates (NHPs), groups 338 of 2~4-year-old rhesus macaques were immunized i.m. with 20 \u00b5g, 100 \u00b5g or 500 \u00b5g of 339 circRNA RBD vaccines, 100 \u00b5g of circRNA Ctrl , or PBS control on Days 0 and 21 (Fig. 5a) . The total 340 RBD-specific IgG binding and neutralizing antibodies were measured using the plasma of rhesus 341 macaques at two weeks post the boost dose (Fig. 5a) . The IgG endpoint GMTs reached ~2.1\u00d710 4 342 (20 \u00b5g), ~1.6\u00d710 4 (100 \u00b5g dose) and ~7\u00d710 3 (500 \u00b5g dose) for circRNA RBD vaccines, while 343 circRNA Ctrl or PBS-immunized rhesus macaques failed to induce RBD-specific antibodies (Fig.  344   5b) . The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay showed the NT50 of ~180 for 20 \u00b5g dose, 345 ~520 for 100 \u00b5g dose, and ~390 for 500 \u00b5g dose (Fig. 5c) . The authentic SARS-CoV-2 346 neutralization assay showed the NT50 of ~80 for 20 \u00b5g dose, ~120 for 100 \u00b5g dose, and ~50 for 347 500 \u00b5g dose (Fig. 5d, e) . These results indicated that the 100 \u00b5g dose could elicit maximal level 348 of neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 5c, d) . 349 We then performed the cross-neutralizing assay using the plasma samples from the immunized 350 rhesus macaques. Both the pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay showed 351 that the circRNA RBD vaccine-immunized rhesus macaque plasma could effectively inhibit the 352 corresponding native strain, while Alpha, Delta and Beta variants could also be inhibited, but with rhesus macaques were measured using the PBMCs stimulated with the corresponding RBD peptide 357 pools (Supplementary Table 2 ). ELISpot assay showed evident IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 responses, but 358 nearly undetectable IL-4 in circRNA RBD -immunized rhesus macaques (Fig. 5f) Five weeks post the boost dose, the immunized rhesus macaques were challenged with 1\u00d710 6 363 plaque forming units of SARS-CoV-2 native strain via intranasal and intratracheal routes, as 364 described previously 33 . The challenged rhesus macaques were euthanized at 7 dpi, and the lung 365 tissues were underwent viral load and histopathological assays. The RT-qPCR assay using primers 366 targeting SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (N protein region) indicated that the rhesus macaques 367 immunized with 100 \u00b5g or 500 \u00b5g of circRNA RBD vaccine were well protected as the viral genomic 368 RNA copies were reduced nearly 1000-fold compared to the control groups (Fig. 5g) . To detect 369 the actively replicative viral loads, we performed qPCR using primers targeting SARS-CoV-2 sub-370 genomic RNA (E protein region), and found that circRNA RBD -immunized rhesus macaques of all 371 three doses had nearly no detectable viral sub-genomic RNA in the lung tissues (Fig. 5g) . 372",
