In the health field of China's \"Learning and Development Guide for Children Aged 3-6\", it is suggested that parents and teachers help children learn to express and adjust their emotions correctly, and give appropriate guidance so that children can express their emotions [4] . Emotion is the internal development of a person's whole life and plays an important role in personal growth [5] , which will not only produce different emotions when getting along with their families, peers, and teachers [6] but also need to learn to express and adjust their emotions and understand the others' emotions in adverse circumstances [7, 8] . However, people's performance in the face of disadvantage varies greatly [9] : some people choose to face setbacks bravely, but some people feel frustrated. The internal mechanism of this difference has attracted extensive attention from researchers. The proposal of resilience explains the appearance of this mechanism [10] . For decades, the elasticity of subjects with different ages, sexes, and backgrounds has been continuously studied by researchers [11, 12] . However, there is still a lack of research on the development of children's resilience [13] . As one of the internal protection factors of resilience, emotional ability is closely related to resilience [14] . Positive emotions can help individuals to face and adapt to adverse conditions bravely, rather than depression [9] . It is of great significance to explore the development of emotional ability and resilience in the preschool stage to cultivate children's emotional ability and improve children's resilience [15] . In addition, studying the influence of children's emotional ability on resilience can provide a new way to improve the development level of children's mental health [16] .",

As for the influencing factors of children's emotional ability, it requires children to understand, express, and regulate their emotions, and experience the emotions of others [20] , which would be affected by individual factors, such as age, gender, temperament, and behavior [21] ; environmental factors, such as parents, peers, teachers, and cultural background [22] ; and cognitive factors, such as language and music ability development [23] . Therefore, this study defined children's emotional ability by integrating Saarni's (1999) [18] , Yao's (2004) [24] , and Li's (2007) [25] definitions of emotional ability: children's emotional ability consists of emotional understanding and emotional regulation; with the accumulation of age cognition and the determination of gender cognition, children have an adaptive emotional response to their abilities and social forces through emotional understanding and emotional regulation. At the same time, the development of children's emotional understanding and emotion regulation strategies as an important part of emotional ability development can help us better understand the development of children's emotional ability [26] .",

To sum up, this study adopted Masten's (2014) definition [39] to define resilience as a kind of dynamic ability and considered that children's resilience is the adaptability and recovery of children in the face of difficulties, setbacks, and conflicts, and there are significant individual dynamic changes with different cultures, personal encounters, family, gender, age, and so on.",

According to the actual physical and mental development of Chinese children, Liang et al.

Mandelco (2000) pointed out that resilience includes internal factors composed of biological and psychological factors, and external factors composed of the environment [45] . Ma et al. (2018) divided the indicators that reflect the resilience of young children into three aspects: individual factors, family factors, and extra-family factors [46, 47] . Zhang (2019) divided the factors that affect young children's resilience into two aspects: internal factors based on themselves and external factors based on the environment [48] . Internal factors include gender, physical fitness, curiosity and interest, self-confidence, self-expectation, security, and communication skills. External factors include family education, interpersonal relationships, teacher factors, and the consistency of home education [45] . To sum up, the resilience of young children is affected by internal factors and external factors [49] . Therefore, in order to study resilience with the experimental method, this study needs to restore the relevant characteristics of resilience to the present experiment. Firstly, create an unfavorable experimental situation for the subjects. Secondly, observe the cognitive behavior performance of the subjects in the experimental situation.",

Rees (2013) pointed out that there is an obvious positive correlation between emotional literacy and resilience on children's mental health [53] . On the physiological level, Motsan et al. (2021) discussed the interaction of biological, emotional, cognitive, and relational factors to form two kinds of regulatory results in young people exposed to trauma: emotional recognition and executive function. The results showed that early traumatized children had certain barriers to emotion and resilience, which led to different clinical manifestations in physiology [54] .

First of all, the selection of all participants was confirmed by random lottery to ensure that the selection probability of each participant was equal. Secondly, Jiangsu Province is a relatively developed region in China, while Fujian Province is a region with a medium development level. The main reason for choosing these two places was to control the influence of the differences in the development level of research fields. In the final analysis of this study, it was also found that the difference between the two regions is not significant, so the final data can be combined and analyzed. Third, all participants needed the consent of their guardians and could participate anonymously. Finally, 5 participants who were unable to participate in the experiment due to illness, absence of parents, or other reasons were excluded. In addition, the final data-screening process also included responses to 6 missing data. Finally, 289 valid data were obtained. See Table 1 below for details. ",

There is undoubtedly an agreement that it is essential to consider children's cultural context if one is to understand their cognitive development [70] . At the same time, Brody (1999) proposed that girls' self-control ability is higher than boys' in early childhood due to genetic and hormonal differences [71] . Considering Chinese local cultural background, most children spend more time with their mothers. When a girl is wrong or disobedient, her mother can give her a patient explanation and guidance. The girl may better control emotions to solve the problem [72] . This may also explain why the overall level of girls in this study was slightly higher than boys. However, as children's self-control ability continues to improve during childhood [73] , both boys and girls in the first grade (aged 6-7) of primary school may be influenced by maternal nonviolent discipline to control negative emotions rationally. This can also explain the situation that the level of emotional ability and resilience of children aged 5-6 years old in this study is gradually stable compared with the level of children aged 3-4 years old, which has significantly increased every year.

Therefore, this paper thinks that future research can also try to do some qualitative research or field research and carry out long-term tracking to obtain data. The combination of these two experimental methods will help to analyze the influencing factors of children's emotional ability and resilience more comprehensively. This experiment uses the experimental method adopted by Garcia (2020) to investigate the children's understanding of facial expressions. First, use the selected facial expression pictures to test the children. The expressions in the facial expression pictures include happiness, anger, sadness, and joy (see Appendix A Figure A1 ). The expression recognition experiment is divided into an expression naming task and a recognition task. This experiment uses the experimental method adopted by Garcia (2020) to investigate the children's understanding of facial expressions.

This experiment uses the experimental method adopted by Garcia (2020) to investigate the children's understanding of facial expressions. First, use the selected facial expression pictures to test the children. The expressions in the facial expression pictures include happiness, anger, sadness, and joy (see Appendix A Figure A1 ). The expression recognition experiment is divided into an expression naming task and a recognition task. The expression naming task asked the children to orally confirm the facial expression pictures one by one, and the researchers asked the children: what happened to the children in the picture? The children were asked to answer the expression shown in the picture. The expression recognition task requires the children to find the corresponding facial expression pictures under the questions of the researchers or to describe the facial expressions in the form of painting (see Appendix A Figure A2 ). The scoring standard of the expression recognition experiment adopts a two-point scoring method, and the total score of the expression naming task and the expression recognition task is between 0 and 16 points. Participants receive 2 points for exactly correct, 1 point for being able to express the positive or negative emotional state corresponding to the expression and 0 points for irrelevant answers or incorrect answers. Liu's (2006) Viewpoint Selection Scenario Story. The researcher provided and told the children's situational stories to examine the children's judgment level of the emotional state of others in the situation. When the child is unable to express his/her emotional state, he/she can provide pictures for facial expression recognition tasks for selection. Situational stories need to exclude gender and name interference. Each basic emotion is equipped with a situational story, and the researcher presents the four situational stories in random order. For example, there is a child named Coco who likes kittens very much. On his birthday, his father brought a kitten back to him. How would Coco feel? The child needs to answer happy feelings, or identify happy expressions in pictures or express positive feelings by identifying facial expressions. The scoring standard is based on a 2-point scoring method. The total score of the emotional viewpoint selection task is between 0 and 8. Completely correct emotional opinions are scored 2 points, and those who can express positive or negative emotions corresponding to the emotions are scored 1 point, and irrelevant answers or incorrect answers are scored 0 points. Appendix A.1.3. E3: Emotional Attribution Interpretation Experiment This experiment and the emotional viewpoint selection experiment share the same set of situational stories to investigate the children's understanding of the causes of other people's emotions. After the researcher conducted an emotional viewpoint selection experiment on the children, they used a calm tone to ask the children the reasons for the emotional state of others in the situation. For example, a child named Coco likes kittens very much. On his birthday, his father brought a kitten back to him. How would Coco feel? The child answered that Coco was very happy. The researcher needs to continue to ask questions, why do you think Coco is happy? The child needs to answer because he received a gift he likes. The scoring standard of the emotional attribution interpretation experiment adopts a two-point scoring method, and the score of the emotional attribution interpretation task is between 0 and 8 points. Participants receive 2 points for correct attributions, 1 point for correct attributions, and 0 points for irrelevant answers or incorrect attributions. In order to ensure the children's understanding of the situational story, the gender of the characters in the picture is consistent with that of the children, and the expressions of the characters in the picture are blocked. After listening to the situational story, the children need to answer the memory test questions and the fact test questions first. If the answers are correct, ask questions based on beliefs about emotional understanding. If the answer is wrong, the situational story needs to be told to the child again until the child fully understands and answers the memory test and fact test questions correctly. The specific situational story is presented in the appendix. The questions of emotional understanding based on belief are as follows: Coco came back from outside, picked up the cup on the table, and prepared to drink. What was his mood before Coco drank the cup? (Is he happy or unhappy?) Why is there such a mood? The scoring standard of the belief-based emotion understanding experiment uses a 2-point scoring method, which participants who were able to correctly answer that Coco was happy before drinking something in the cup and correctly explained the reason was scored 2 points, only those who were able to answer emotions that could not explain the reason were scored 1 point, and irrelevant answers or incorrect answers were scored 0 points. Appendix A.1.5. E5: Desire-Based Emotional Understanding Experiment This experiment and the belief-based emotion understanding experiment use the same set of situational stories to investigate the children's understanding of the situational characters based on desire emotions and the reasons for their emotions. The questions of emotional understanding based on desire are as follows: What is his/her mood after Coco comes back from the outside and drinks something in the cup? (see Appendix A Figure A3 ) Is he happy or unhappy? Why does he feel this way? The scoring standard for the desire-based emotion understanding experiment uses a two-point scoring method. Participants who were able to correctly answer that they were unhappy after Coco drank something in the cup and correctly explained the reason was scored 2 points, only those who were able to answer emotionally unexplainable reasons were scored 1 point, and irrelevant answers or incorrect answers were scored 0 points.",
