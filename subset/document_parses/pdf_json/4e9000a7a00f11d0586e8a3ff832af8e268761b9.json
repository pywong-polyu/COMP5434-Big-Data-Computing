What is proposed as a solution is the repurposing of FDA approved drug such as niclosamide (NIC) having multiple pathways to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2, the specific virion that induces COVID-19. However, NIC is hardly soluble in an aqueous solution, thereby poor bioavailability, resulting in low drug efficacy. To overcome such a disadvantage, we propose here an oral formulation based on Tween 60 coated drug delivery system comprised of three different mesoporous silica biomaterials like MCM-41, SBA-15, and geopolymer encapsulated with NIC molecules. According to the release studies under a gastro/intestinal solution, the cumulative NIC release out of NIC-silica nanohybrids was found to be greatly enhanced to ~97% compared to the solubility of intact NIC (~40%) under the same condition. We also confirmed the therapeutically relevant bioavailability for NIC by performing pharmacokinetic (PK) study in rats with NIC-silica oral formulations. In addition, we discussed in detail how the PK parameters could be altered not only by the engineered porous structure and property, but also by interfacial interactions between ion-NIC dipole, NIC-NIC dipoles and/or pore wall-NIC van der Waals in the intra-pores of silica nanoparticles.",

In this context, therefore, nano-aided therapeutic strategies, either alone or in combination with vaccines, to completely eliminate the pandemic are critical for diseases like COVID-19, but no proper medications have yet discovered. On the other hand, re-purposing clinically relevant and FDA approved drug like niclosamide (NIC) seems practically efficient, because it has already been known for its therapeutic benefits on similar but different strains of pathogenesis such as SARS [8] , and MERS [9] , etc. NIC, an anthelmintic drug, has shown significantly higher potency on many viral diseases such as Zika Virus (ZIKV) [10] , Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [11] , Chikungunya (CHIKV) [12] , Human adenovirus (HAdV) [13] , Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) [14] , etc. Since the new SARS-CoV-2 virus showed the similar host interaction for its entry, scientists came up with an idea that a nano-engineered NIC could be much beneficial for tackling the ongoing pandemic.",

NIC is known to exert anti-viral properties by blocking such viral entry through endocytosis and autophagy. In addition, viral replication can be inhibited by NIC, preventing their further maturation in the host cells [19] . However, NIC can undergo faster metabolism in liver as glucuronic acid-NIC metabolite by cytochrome P450 enzymes [20] .

            "text": "In this study, an attempt was made to develop mesoporous geopolymer (PG) with the aluminosilicate network with MCM-41 structure. The present PG with a charged framework was accomplished by dissolving clay (kaolinite) as the aluminosilicate source in an aqueous alkali solution [28] . According to our previous studies, various hexagonal type (p6mm) PGs were successfully prepared from metakaolin, a low-cost Si and Al source [29, 30] . Basically, the present PG has MCM-41 structure, where the tetrahedrally coordinated Si(IV) atoms are partially substituted by Al(III) ones resulting in negative charge in the pore, where alkali ions like Na + one, depending on the synthetic solution, are stabilized for satisfying the charge neutrality criteria. Since the Na + ions are present in the mesopores of PG with MCM-41 structure, NIC drug molecules can not only be encapsulated in the pore by ion-dipole interaction, but also be released out in a controlled manner upon modifying the pore charge, namely, the cation exchange capacity (CEC). It is, therefore, expected that PG could serve as an efficient therapeutic vehicle with high NIC loading capability and enhancing NIC solubility [31] [32] [33] . These are the main reasons why PG was also added as one of the mesoporous silicas (PSs) drug delivery carriers, MCM-41 and SBA-15, for encapsulating NIC, a poorly water-soluble anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidate. The inclusion and the release of drug molecules are dependent on surface chemistry within pore (Scheme 1a). The as made NIC-PSs or PG nanohybrids were further coated with muco-adhesive non-ionic polymer, Tween 60 (Tween 60 coated NIC-PSs or PG nanohybrids), to induce high drug solubility and eventually enhanced bioavailability in-vivo, leading to have improved PK parameters (Scheme 1b). The PK parameter for the Tween 60 coated NIC-PG nanohybrid was compared with those of NIC-MCM-41 and NIC-SBA-15 ones, respectively, exploring the potential benefits as oral NIC drug delivery systems. This study marks as the first in-vivo investigation into the oral delivery performance of NIC-PG nanohybrid as an efficient NIC drug delivery system, which, in fact, is an important step toward understanding the clinical applicability of PG.",

The respective surface property parameters such as surface areas (S BET ), total pore volumes (V p ) and average pore diameters (D p ) were evaluated by the BET, BJH and NLDFT methods ( Table 1 ). The BET isotherm of PG was a type IV with a specific surface area of 468.9 m 2 g \u2212 1 and a total pore volume of 0.74 cm 3 g \u2212 1 , and a mesopore size of 3.10 nm (Fig. 3a) . Whereas, after NIC loading, the NIC-PG nanohybrid showed a reduced specific surface area of 103.2 m 2 g \u2212 1 and pore volume of 0.29 cm 3 g \u2212 1 , retaining hysteresis loop unchanged, indicating that the pore shape was the same even after drug encapsulation. A similar pattern was observed for MCM-41 and SBA-15 after NIC drug loading (Fig. 3b-c) . After drug loading, the pore volume and surface area were decreased not only due to the incorporated NIC molecules in the mesopores but also due to the partly adsorbed NIC ones on the external surface of the nanohybrids. It was found that approximately 30% of pore volume for each NIC-PG, NIC-MCM-41 and NIC-SBA-15 was not filled with NIC molecules, but still remained empty probably due to the condensation of polar drug molecules in the pores. [40] [41] [42] . In an aqueous solution, the surface charge of PG was determined to be \u2212 44.36 \u00b1 1.74 mV, which is higher than that of MCM-41(-39.33 \u00b1 2.20 mV) and SBA-15(-39.26 \u00b1 2.18 mV) respectively. This pattern recommended that the Si to Al ratio determines acidic functionality based on their presence at the interfacial site. In short, the bridging (Si-OH-Al) hydroxide groups presented on the outer surface of particles can easily form Si-O by de-protonation, thereby making the surface charge negative [43] . However, the surface charge of NIC loaded NIC-PG, NIC-MCM-41, and NIC-SBA-15 were determined to be \u2212 45.67 \u00b1 0.80, \u2212 47.74 \u00b1 2.79, and 47.36 \u00b1 1.86 mV, respectively, which were similar or slightly larger than the unloaded porous carriers.",

In order to confirm the acidic properties based on the Si/Al ratio, PG was characterized through ammonia-temperature programmed desorption (NH 3 -TPD) (Fig. S3) . Generally, the low temperature desorption peak represents a weak acid sites, while those at high temperature indicate a strong acid sites. Compared to the MCM-41 and SBA-15 (only one weak broad peak at 100-150 \u2022 C) [44] [45] [46] , PG exhibited four desorption peaks: the first one 163 \u2022 C (weak acid sites), the second and third peaks at 321 and 378 \u2022 C (intermediate acidic sites) and the last peak at 604 \u2022 C (strong acid sites), indicating that the acidic property and the number of acid sites are increased with extra Al content in the PG framework. Similar phenomenon could be observed in the case of zeolite [47] .

We found that even after 2h, a very low ~10% NIC was dissolved from intact NIC under the gastric condition, due to its low aqueous solubility (Fig. 6a) . Compared to the control NIC, the hybrids such as NIC-PG, NIC-MCM-41 and NIC-SBA-15 significantly enhanced the NIC release from it. Conversely, 15.0% intact NIC was dissolved at the intestinal pH 6.8 (Fig. 6b) and this could be associated with their better dissolvability at higher pH [48] . Meanwhile, all the NIC-PG and NIC-PSs nanohybrids were able to drastically enhanced NIC drug release compared to the intact NIC; furthermore, a dual phase release kinetics was found, wherein, an early and quick NIC release was followed by sustained drug release. NIC-PG, NIC-MCM-41 and NIC-SBA-15 nanohybrids displayed an initial release of 25%, 28% and 30%, respectively, within the first 10 min. This initial release could be attributed to weakly bound drug molecules on the surface of NIC-PG and NIC-PSs nanohybrids. Following this release, more than 97% cumulative release in NIC-PG and NIC-PSs nanohybrids were observed in 24 h, suggesting that, compared to the free drug, NIC-PG and NIC-PSs nanohybrids have sustained-release properties, owing to the large surface area and pore size facilitating the diffusion of drug. Interestingly, the release rate of NIC-PG nanohybrid was slightly slower compared to that of NIC-MCM-41 and NIC-SBA-15 nanohybrids, both in pH 1.2 and 6.8 media. This effect could be understood since there is a strong ion-dipole interaction between Na + and NIC molecules for NIC-PG nanohybrid, which might alter the release kinetics of NIC from the silica nanohybrids.",

In addition, Tween 60 can stabilize the NIC-nanohybrids along with an improved drug release kinetics. As described above, Tween 60 coating was only via a physical mixing, and therefore no chemical modification was expected even after coating with NIC-nanohybrids. The UV analysis (Fig. S6 ) clearly showed that the NIC peak was not changed even after Tween 60 coating, assuring that it was just a kind of physical adsorption [50] .",

The AUC (last) values of NIC-PG, NIC-MCM-41 and NIC-SBA-15 were quite similar, achieving an increased bioavailability compared to the reported values for intact NIC in the literature [48, 51, 52] . This suggests that the synergistic effect of mesoporous carriers and surfactants contained in NIC-PG, NIC-MCM-41 and NIC-SBA-15 could improve the oral absorption of NIC in the gastro-intestinal tract. However, there was around 1.8 times higher C max for the NIC-MCM-41 (294.75 \u00b1 46.38 ng mL \u2212 1 ) compared to NIC-PG (159.38 \u00b1 47.07 ng mL \u2212 1 ) and NIC-SBA-15 (166.99 \u00b1 37.65 ng mL \u2212 1 ) nanohybrids. Additionally, t 1/2 value of NIC-SBA-15 (7.56 \u00b1 3.29 h) was approximately 1.8 times higher than NIC-PG (4.10 \u00b1 0.50 h) and NIC-MCM-41 (4.54 \u00b1 0.67 h) nanohybrids. In the case of T max , there was around 10.7 times higher T max for the NIC-PG (2.67 \u00b1 1.15 h) compared to NIC-MCM-41 (0.25 \u00b1 0.0 h) and NIC-SBA-15 (0.25 \u00b1 0.0 h) nanohybrids. These difference in PK parameters between the samples could be associated with their different pore characteristics. For example, PG has charged porous structure, which can load NIC drug molecules based on a strong ion-dipole interaction. On the other hand, both MCM-41 and SBA-15 were consisted of neutral porous structures but with different pore volume as described before. These specific characteristic properties could, therefore, alter the overall PK parameters as shown in Table 2 .",

It should be noted that, though the pore size for PG was as similar as that of MCM-41 (2.7 nm), the SBA-15 exhibited bigger pore window of 6.3 nm. In addition, the charged pores in the PG could hold NIC molecules majorly by three mechanisms such as 1) Na + -NIC (ion-dipole) interaction; 2) NIC-PG (dipole-pore wall) van der Waals (vW) interaction and 3) NIC-NIC (dipole-dipole) molecular interaction within the pore. Obviously, in the PG pores, the ion-dipole interaction might be dominant, thereby NIC could be released in a sustained manner. This was surely the reason why both t 1/2 and T max were improved in the NIC-PG nanohybrid. On the other hand, two dominant intra-pore interactions could be expected in the NIC-MCM-41 nanohybrid; 1) vW interaction between dipolar NIC and pore wall, and 2) molecular interactions between NIC and NIC. Since they are fairly weaker than ion-dipole interaction, the sustained in-vivo release could not be expected. Because of this weak NIC-NIC molecular interaction, it was not that surprising why the NIC-MCM-41 nanohybrid showed such a high C max and a low T max compared to the NIC-PG one. In the NIC-SBA-15, more NIC molecules could be accommodated in the meso pore of SBA-15 than MCM-41via collective interaction among NIC molecules, since SBA-15 showed bigger pore volume than MCM-41. In addition, vW interaction between NIC dipole and pore wall could also be expected. Because of this large pore volume with collective dipole-dipole interaction energy gain among NIC-NIC, the NIC-SBA-15 nanohybrid showed very high t 1/2 compared to the other two samples, however, the T max was turned out to be very low.",

It is worthy to mention that by controlling the pore size and charge density of internal pores of silica nanohybrids, one could achieve desirable drug release profile. Especially, the pores in PG can be altered by changing the Al content, making them more charged, in such a way that the NIC dosage or loading content can be controlled as required, and thereby, the overall release kinetics can be tuned to achieve maximum outcome towards SARS-CoV-2. In this way we could specifically deliver therapeutic dosages for combating contagious diseases like COVID-19.",

Since the present anti-viral nanohybrids are of clay origin, with a NIC loaded in it, it could be acted through synergistic mechanisms via targeting + therapy. Therefore, our future studies will be focused on understanding such fundamentals to bring the NIC silica nanohybrids from bench to market.",

The in-vitro NIC release was found to be enhanced under gastro/intestinal solution compared to the intact NIC. Further the in-vivo oral administration of the present NIC-PG and NIC-PSs hybrids showed improved PK parameters, which were dependent on the pore structure/property relation along with their interfacial and molecular interactions within the intra-pores. In a sustained bioavailability aspect, we suggest that NIC-PG might be good formulation, since it improved both T max and t 1/2 whereas the NIC-MCM-41 and NIC-SBA-15 nanohybrids showed only better t 1/2 with a low T max . On the other hand, NIC-MCM-41 showed maximum AUC and C max , along with higher t 1/2 which could also be beneficial for achieving a therapeutic outcome. Conversely, the NIC-SBA-15 had significantly higher t 1/2 , showing that the elimination half-life, t 1/2 , of NIC can be sustained quite longer than the other two. In summary, we recommend that tuning the Si/Al ratio would allow one to control the charged pores in the silica nanohybrids, thereby regulating the release profile in a sustained fashion to improve the overall therapeutic outcome. In fact, depending on one's own requirements, it is possible to achieve efficient NIC release and PK parameters from our rationally designed silica nanohybrids. The present study therefore, clearly demonstrated that silica based nanohybrids could be an effective mesoporous therapeutic agents to improve the efficacy from orally administered, poorly-soluble drugs such as NIC.
