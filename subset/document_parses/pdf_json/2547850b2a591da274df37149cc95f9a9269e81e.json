Methods We developed an electronic monitoring and evaluation system to assist district health offices in making rapid assessments of the impact of COVID-19 on maternal and child health and nutrition programmes in their area and in developing policy and programme responses. This implementation research was conducted from September to December 2020 in 304 districts. The strategies consisted of technical assistance for district offices by 21 partner universities and development of an online dashboard for rapid situation analyses and reporting. We collected qualitative data on feasibility and adherence to the intervention, as well as quantitative data from routine health databases to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on maternal and child health and nutrition indicators. Findings In the majority of districts key maternal and child health and nutrition services were moderately or severely affected by the pandemic, particularly child growth monitoring and antenatal care services. Adherence to the protocol of the intervention varied across districts but the system is a feasible approach to be scaled up to other regions and health programmes. High uptake by the health ministry, district office and university partners provided the platform with collaborative efforts for health-systems strengthening. Conclusion The electronic monitoring and evaluation system could be implemented and completed with several modifications to accommodate district offices and universities. There is a potential to scale up the intervention with better implementation planning and training.",

            "text": "Indonesia, a lower-middle-income country with a population of more than 260 million people, has a high burden of infant and maternal mortality and child undernutrition. In 2018, the prevalence of stunting was 30.8% (27 023 of 87 737 children aged 0-59 months), 1 significantly higher than in other countries with comparable economic development status. 2, 3 The prevalence also varies widely across provinces, ranging from 17.7% in the capital city Jakarta to 42.6% in the less-developed province of East Nusa Tenggara. 1 In 2019, Indonesia's infant mortality (20.2 per 1000 live births) and maternal mortality (177 per 100 000 live births) were among the highest in the South-East Asia Region. [4] [5] [6] The United Nations Children's Fund in Indonesia has reported that lack of awareness, unequal capacity and distribution of health resources, insufficient budget allocation, and lack of vertical and intersectoral coordination were the most prominent factors related to those problems. 7 Indonesia's national strategy for stunting reduction has been in place since 2015. [8] [9] [10] However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has halted many public health programmes, particularly those delivered by community health centres and integrated health posts. [11] [12] [13] By 2020, the Indonesian health system was at its capacity, with the government diverting resources towards COVID-19 mitigation. [14] [15] [16] Budget reallocation to the pandemic has jeopardized the country's capacity to maintain essential health services, with a notable impact on pre-existing problems, 7 including programmes focused on the health of mothers and children's nutrition. 11 Providing timely data on the impact of the pandemic on routine programmes is necessary to rapidly map strategies to recover from the disruption caused by the pandemic. Managerial problems that might be faced by district health offices can provide evidence of the need for capacity improvement from external resources.",

M\u00e9todos Se desarroll\u00f3 un sistema electr\u00f3nico de supervisi\u00f3n y de evaluaci\u00f3n para ayudar a las oficinas distritales de salud a realizar evaluaciones r\u00e1pidas sobre los efectos de la COVID-19 en los programas de salud y nutrici\u00f3n maternoinfantil en su zona y a elaborar respuestas normativas y program\u00e1ticas. Esta investigaci\u00f3n de aplicaci\u00f3n se llev\u00f3 a cabo de septiembre a diciembre de 2020 en 304 distritos. Las estrategias consistieron en la asistencia t\u00e9cnica a las oficinas de distrito a cargo de 21 universidades asociadas y el desarrollo de un tablero de mando en l\u00ednea para realizar an\u00e1lisis r\u00e1pidos de la situaci\u00f3n y presentar informes. Se recopilaron datos cualitativos sobre la viabilidad y la adhesi\u00f3n a la intervenci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como datos cuantitativos de las bases de datos de salud sistem\u00e1ticas para analizar los efectos de la COVID-19 en los indicadores de salud y nutrici\u00f3n maternoinfantil.",

La adhesi\u00f3n al protocolo de la intervenci\u00f3n vari\u00f3 en los diferentes distritos, pero el sistema es un m\u00e9todo viable que se puede ampliar a otras regiones y programas sanitarios. La participaci\u00f3n activa del ministerio de sanidad, la oficina del distrito y los socios universitarios proporcion\u00f3 una plataforma de colaboraci\u00f3n para el fortalecimiento de los sistemas sanitarios. Conclusi\u00f3n El sistema electr\u00f3nico de supervisi\u00f3n y de evaluaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda aplicarse y completarse con varias modificaciones que se adapten a las oficinas de distrito y a las universidades. Existe la posibilidad de ampliar la intervenci\u00f3n mediante la mejora de la formaci\u00f3n y la planificaci\u00f3n de la aplicaci\u00f3n. ",

M\u00e9thodes Nous avons mis au point un syst\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique de surveillance et d'\u00e9valuation afin d'aider les bureaux de la sant\u00e9 des districts \u00e0 identifier rapidement les effets de la COVID-19 sur les programmes de nutrition et de sant\u00e9 maternelle et infantile dans leur r\u00e9gion, et \u00e0 d\u00e9ployer des politiques et programmes capables de les contrer. Cette \u00e9tude de mise en oeuvre a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e de septembre \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2020 dans 304 districts. Les strat\u00e9gies pr\u00e9voyaient de fournir une assistance technique aux bureaux de district avec le concours de 21 universit\u00e9s partenaires, et de cr\u00e9er un tableau de bord en ligne servant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir rapidement des analyses et rapports de situation. Nous avons r\u00e9colt\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es qualitatives sur la faisabilit\u00e9 et l'adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 l'intervention, ainsi que des donn\u00e9es quantitatives issues des bases de donn\u00e9es sur les soins de routine, en vue d'analyser l'impact de la COVID-19 sur les indicateurs de nutrition et de sant\u00e9 maternelle et infantile. R\u00e9sultats Dans la majorit\u00e9 des districts, les principaux services de nutrition et de sant\u00e9 maternelle et infantile ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mod\u00e9r\u00e9ment ou gravement touch\u00e9s par la pand\u00e9mie, en particulier le suivi de la croissance des enfants et les soins pr\u00e9natals. Bien que le respect du protocole d'intervention ait vari\u00e9 d'un district \u00e0 l'autre, le syst\u00e8me constitue une approche envisageable pouvant \u00eatre \u00e9tendue \u00e0 d'autres r\u00e9gions et programmes de sant\u00e9. La participation active et les efforts conjoints du minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9, des bureaux de district et des partenaires universitaires ont permis \u00e0 la plateforme de renforcer les syst\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. Conclusion Le syst\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique de surveillance et d'\u00e9valuation pourrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 et accompagn\u00e9 de plusieurs modifications pour s'adapter aux diff\u00e9rents bureaux de district et universit\u00e9s. Cette intervention peut \u00eatre amen\u00e9e \u00e0 se d\u00e9velopper en am\u00e9liorant la formation et la planification de la mise en oeuvre.",
