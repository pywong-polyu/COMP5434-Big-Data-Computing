[9] study showed survival rate was 75%.At the end of our period, 13.6% COVID-19 patients with barotrauma remained hospitalized, while represented 30% in McGuinness et al. [7] , cohort study and it was not clear whether barotrauma caused prolonged hospitalization or longer hospital stay was a risk for barotrauma.Breathing natural mechanism in humans depends upon negative intra-thoracic pressures. In contrast, mechanically ventilate patients are on with positive pressures. Since positive pressure ventilation is not physiological, it may raise the occurrence of barotrauma [17] .There were few limitations in this study: a small number of the patient population, the study was single-center retrospective study, pathologic correlation was not available for many included patients.We focused on chest X-ray and CT chest findings and did not investigate a possible association between barotrauma and respirator settings. Since optimum characterization and detection of barotraumas frequently require computed tomography, the findings might be under diagnosed if only less sensitive chest radiography is obtained.",
