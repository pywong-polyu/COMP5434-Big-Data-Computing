Specifically, we investigated whether electrical recordings made with dry electrodes are suitable to identify meal-response colonic cyclic motor patterns (CMPs), in comparison to wet electrodes. Dry electrodes have previously been assessed for their recording quality and overall usability for recording and analysis of the EEG (e.g., [11, 12, 13] ), ECG and sEMG [10, 14, 15] , but no similar study has yet been conducted for GI electrical signals, which predominantly occur at much lower frequencies, in the range of approximately 0.03 -0.10 Hz (\u2248 2 to 6 cycles per minute (cpm)). The main result of our study was that dry electrodes recorded high-quality signals comparable to those of wet electrodes, and could readily identify colonic CMP post-meal responses in the majority of cases. Thus, dry electrodes may offer a viable alternative electrode platform for long-term GI monitoring applications, in general.",

We applied LMMSE using a 30 s data window width to compute statistics averaged over (at least) one colonic oscillation period. Because the signal variance is expected to differ substantially in the postversus premeal epoch, we used a time-varying noise variance parameter, computed as the running median in sliding 5 min windows, which yields a better time-local noise estimate and thus avoids inappropriate colonic signal attenuation.

We did not observe systematic differences in results obtained using different contact area wet electrode types, nor would we expect to observe such differences based on biophysical principles. First, given the diameter of the distal colon-the underlying electrical source-has a diameter of \u2248 50 mm subject to the volume-conduction spatial low-pass spatial filtering, the body surface potential would spatially vary by only \u2264 5% over the contact area of any electrode employed in this study [33] . Second, although we did not directly measure the skinelectrode impedance, it is reasonable to assume values were \u2264 1M\u2126 at a frequency of \u22480.05 Hz for all electrode sizes [15] . This is 100\u00d7 less than the 100 M\u2126 amplifier input impedance. Therefore, the voltage divider effect would be negligible.",

The results show that Dryodes are suitable for clearly identifying colonic post-meal response CMPs. Signal quality obtained with dry electrodes was very good, similar to that of wet electrodes, and characteristic post-meal colonic CMPs easily identified in the majority of recordings. While users found dry electrodes somewhat more time consuming and difficult to self-apply, they were also rated as more comfortable and tolerable for long-term studies compared to wet electrodes. The use of dry electrodes may be extended to include measuring gastric slow wave activity on the body surface, given the similarity in colonic and gastric amplitude and dominant frequencies. Dry electrodes may thus facilitate non-invasive, long-term monitoring of GI electrical activity to further elucidate dynamic motility patterns in health and disease.",
