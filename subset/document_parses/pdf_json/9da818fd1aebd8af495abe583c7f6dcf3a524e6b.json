The neutralization capacity of licorice root extract was determined in cell culture by endpoint dilution. For this purpose, serial dilutions of the licorice root extract (0.004 mg/ml -4 mg/ml) were pre-incubated with 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C and subsequently incubated on confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well microtiter plates (pre-entry approach). After 48 hours, the cells were stained with crystal violet and analysed for plaque formation. Cytotoxicity was determined at four distinct time points (5 minutes, 12 hours, 24 hours and 4 hours) by using the \"Orangu cell counting solution\" (Cell guidance systems, Cambridge, United Kingdom), which is a WTS-8 based assay using NAD(P)H concentration and dehydrogenase enzyme activity to detect the cell vitality. The aqueous licorice root extract showed neutralizing effects even at a subtoxic concentration of 2 mg/ml, ( Figure 1A and B). This concentration is lower than the normal consuming dilution e.g. in tea (12.5 mg/ml). Although licorice root tea may represent a good candidate for complementary use, the identification and characterization of the active compound is of great importance for a potential clinical application.",

Here, glycyrrhizin acid ammonium-nitrate was dissolved in DMEM containing 2% (v/v) FCS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C and adjusted to pH 7. A potential cytotoxic effect of glycyrrhizin was investigated as described above. No cytotoxic effect could be observed even at a concentration of 4 mg/ml ( Figure 1B CoV-2 RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR. Therefore, primer targeting the viral M or N gene were used. M and N gene copy numbers were assessed using a 1:10 plasmid dilution series as reference (details and sequence information available upon request). Glycyrrhizin treatment significantly reduced the genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels ( Figure 1D) . Taken together, we demonstrated that glycyrrhizin exhibited a high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Next, we investigated the underlying mechanism how glycyrrhizin may interfere with the virus replication. Recently, protease inhibitory activity of glycyrrhizin was predicted by in silico simulations 5 . The human transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) was shown to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein thereby facilitating the virus entry into the host cell 6 . However, since there was only a slight difference in antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin between pre-and post-entry conditions, and only a minor affinity was simulated for the interaction between glycyrrhizin and TMPRSS2, we concluded that glycyrrhizin neutralizes the virus by a mechanism different from inhibiting TMPRSS2. Thus, we focused on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) as a potential target for glycyrrhizin 7 . M pro is essential for processing the viral polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA and thus, for virus replication 7 . Glycyrrhizin was suggested as a possible inhibitor of M pro by in silico analysis, but this hypothesis has never been experimentally proven 5 ",

Descending glycyrrhizin concentrations (0.002 -4 mg/ml) were pre-incubated with 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C (preentry condition) and subsequently added to confluent Vero E6 cells in 96-well microtiter plates for 48 hours. In a second approach, Vero E6 cells were inoculated with 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 for 4 hours before the glycyrrhizin-containing inoculation medium with various glycyrrhizin concentrations (0.002 -4 mg/ml end-concentration) was added (post-entry conditions). Complete virus neutralization was achieved at subtoxic concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml under pre-and 1 mg/ml under post-entry conditions (Figure 1Aand B). To further investigate the antiviral efficacy of glycyrrhizin, we determined the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) sufficient to neutralize the virus. Confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 6-well plates were infected with 1000 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 and at the same time treated with various concentrations of glycyrrhizin ranging from 0.0625 to 4 mg/ml. After 48 hours of incubation, the supernatants were harvested and the viral loads were determined by endpoint dilution. The experiment was performed in triplicates. The EC50 was calculated with 0.44 mg/ml, uncovering glycyrrhizin as a potent compound effective against SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1C). The initial finding was supported by quantifying the SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the supernatants of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells treated with glycyrrhizin. Confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with 500 TCID50 and simultaneously treated with 1 mg/ml of glycyrrhizin.Supernatants were collected at seven different time points (0 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 28 hours, 32 hours and 48 hours) post-infection. Viral RNA was purified from the supernatants with the \"High Pure Viral RNA Kit\" (Roche Diagnostics) and the genomic SARS-",

The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 M pro by glycyrrhizin was measured by using the \"3CL Protease, MBP-tagged (SARS-CoV-2) Assay Kit\". Briefly, 90 ng of recombinant M pro were incubated with two different concentrations of glycyrrhizin (30 \u00b5M and 2000 \u00b5M, dissolved in water). As control, the protease inhibitor GC376 was used. The enzyme-sample solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The enzyme activity was measured at 360 nm excitation and 460 nm emission after overnight incubation of the inhibitor-M pro mixtures with substrate (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ\u2193SGFRKM-E(Edans)-NH2) at room temperature. Glycyrrhizin completely inhibited M pro activity at a concentration of 2000 \u00b5M (1.6 mg/ml) and reduced its activity by 70.3% at a concentration of 30 \u00b5M (0.024 mg/ml). Glycyrrhizin was clinically evaluated in the context of a clinical trial and described to be a safe and well-tolerated compound 8 . The pharmacological effects include antioxidative and antiinflammatory, corticosteroid-like activities 9 . The potent antiviral activity as well as antiinflammatory properties highlight glycyrrhizin as an excellent candidate for further clinical investigations in COVID-19 treatment. A case report described compassionate use of glycyrrhizin among other potential antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19 10 . Although the patient recovered from disease, further controlled studies are needed to prove the therapeutic effects of glycyrrhizin in COVID-19.Taken together, we demonstrated that glycyrrhizin, the primary active ingredient of the licorice root, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting the viral main protease. Our experiments highlight glycyrrhizin as a potential antiviral compound that should be further investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.",

Plaque formation was evaluated after 48 hours post infection (p.i.). Bars represent 200 \u00b5m. B The toxicity of the treatment was tested by using \"Orangu cell counting solution\". Different concentrations were incubated with a confluent layer of Vero E6 cells and evaluated at four time points (5 minutes, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours). C Vero E6 cells were infected with 1000 TCID50/ 1.5 ml in different glycyrrhizin concentrations for 48 hours. The supernatant was titrated on microtiter plates in 1:10 dilutions to determine the viral loads in triplicates. The EC50 value was calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.0.1 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, USA). D SARS CoV-2 RNA levels in supernatants of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells (500 TCID50) treated with 1 mg/ml glycyrrhizin or mock treated were determined at seven time points (0, 4, 8, 24, 28, 32 and 48 hours) p.i. by quantive RT-qPCR. E The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 M pro by glycyrrhizin was measured by using the \"3CL Protease, MBP-tagged (SARS-CoV-2) Assay Kit\" (BPS Bioscience, San Diego, United States).",
