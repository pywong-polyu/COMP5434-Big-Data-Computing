In this paper a time series model to predict short-term prediction of the transmission of the exponentially growing COVID-19 time series is modelled and studied. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model prediction is performed on the number of cumulative cases over a time period and is validated over Akaike information criterion (AIC) statistics.",

Depending on the predictions, the government officials should adapt aggressive interventions to control this exponential growth [3] of this rapid infectious disease and curtail the COVID-19 pandemic. The updation of Johns Hopkins university on a daily basis is considered and the data for India till 14 th April 2020 is considered for this analysis and a time-series database was created in Excel.

In the model, p is the auto-regressive part of the model and incorporates the effect of past values in the model. d is the integrated part of the mode and incorporates the amount of differencing to apply to the time series. The parameter q is the moving average parameter that allows to set the error of the proposed model as a linear combination of the error values observed at previous time points in the past.

In ARIMA modeling using R the univariate data is converted into time series data format. The graph follows an overall upward trend with some outliers in terms of sudden lower values. The Augmented Dickey Fuller Test (ADF) is unit root test for stationarity. Since the data is not stationary, the data is differenced and is computed by the differences between consecutive observations. Since the p-value after differencing is 0.01 and is less than 0.05 the null hypothesis is rejected and the data do es not have a unit root and is stationary. The time series after the data is removed of its non stationarity is giv en in the Fig 1. The autocorrelation function gives the autocorrelation at all possible lags. The autocorrelation at lag 0 is included by default which always takes the value 1 that represents the correlation between the data and themselves. The ACF and the PACF is given in Fig.2 The best fit model is selected based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value of the model. The idea is to choose a model with minimum AIC and BIC values.The best model is ARIMA(1,2,2) with the AIC value of 932 and the the BIC value of 941is fitted using the auto.arima() function. .
