This restriction resulted in a sudden change in people's lifestyle, leading to an increase in sedentary behavior and a related decrease in the practice of physical activity (PA). However, in neuromuscular diseases patients need to perform regular PA to counteract the negative consequences of the disease. Hence, the aim of this study was to estimate the levels of PA, measured as energy expenditure (MET-minute/week), among patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD) before and during the last week of quarantine. Methods A total of 268 Italian subjects, living in Sicily, completed an adapted version of the IPAQ-SF. Participants comprised 149 NMD, enrolled at the Neuromuscular Clinic of Palermo and 119 healthy subjects (control group). The SF-12 questionnaire was also administered to NMD. The Mann-Whitney U and the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum tests were used for statistical analyses. Results We observed a significant decrease of the total weekly PA level during COVID-19 quarantine in both patients and controls. Moreover, a significant difference in the total weekly PA level was found depending on the presence of neuromuscular disease, impaired walking, gender and BMI. Finally, we found a correlation between SF-12 scores and the entity of the reduction of PA level during quarantine, thus confirming a relevant association with the quality of life in NMD. Conclusion Our study confirmed that COVID-19 quarantine has affected the practice of PA among both NMD and healthy controls.",

Apart from the well-known symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, diarrhea and respiratory impairment), neurological symptoms are reported in up to one-third of cases [2, 5, 6] . Furthermore, pandemic-associated psychological sequelae have been reported [1, 7] .

They include disorders of: skeleton muscle (i.e. muscle dystrophies, inflammatory myopathies, muscle channalopathies), neuromuscular junction (i.e. myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome), and peripheral nerve (i.e. familial amyloid neuropathies, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy). Moreover, patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD) require strict follow-up, essential immunotherapies, muscle rehabilitation and physical exercise [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . In particular, NMD need an active physical activity (PA), through the practice of regular exercise, to improve muscle strength, endurance ability and to prevent osteoarticular complications from disuse [15, 17, 21] . PA and exercise should be performed under the supervision of a reference specialist and in close collaboration with physiotherapists in an integrated and individualized approach [15, 16, 21] . For these reasons, it is not difficult to hypothesize that COVID-19 pandemic-related Italian government limitations have contributed to a significant change in the care of NMD due to the difficult access to immunosuppressive treatments and physiotherapy [15] .",

Furthermore, we analyzed both parameters in relation to the gender, age, and BMI variables. The weekly PA level of both considered parameters were calculated as energy expenditure in MET-minutes/week (MET-min/wk) [27] . We used the corresponding metabolic equivalent task (MET) assigned to each type of PA (i.e. 3.3, 4.0 and 8.0 for walking, moderateintensity physical activities and vigorous-intensity physical activities, respectively) to estimate the weekly level of energy expenditure. Afterwards, we computed the sum of energy expenditure of walking, moderate-intensity physical activities, and vigorous-intensity physical activities in MET-min/wk for the \"total PA\" level and the sum of moderate-intensity physical activities, and vigorous-intensity physical activities in MET-min/wk for the \"MVPA\" level [25, 28] . Hence, we multiplied the corresponding MET basal level for each type of PA per minutes of practice during the week to calculate the MET weekly level (https ://www.ipaq. ki.se) [25, 28] . The distribution of the PA level difference between before and during quarantine was calculated for each different PA intensity and for the total PA level (i.e. the sum of walking, moderate-intensity physical activities, and vigorousintensity physical activities) in walking subjects. In fact, in patients with impaired walking ability, we did not calculate the total PA level, but, for these subjects, we considered instead the MVPA level (i.e. the sum of moderate-intensity physical activities and vigorous-intensity physical activities), which has been often used in elderly (https ://www. ipaq.ki.se) [29, 30] .",

Data from studies on \"bed rest\" established that muscle atrophy, especially in antigravity muscles, appears very soon after only two days of inactivity [10, 35] . A prolonged immobilization can induce a significant reduction of protein synthesis in the muscle fibers thus conducting to muscle mass loss [12, 13, 35] . Of note, it has been recently hypothesized that physical inactivity may also cause damage at the neuromuscular junction with muscle denervation [10] . Finally, it has to be considered that a more sensible muscle mass loss is reported following physical inactivity in older people and in neuromuscular disease, compared to healthy young subjects [10, 13] . Hence, there is some concern about the consequences of physical inactivity especially in NMD and older people.",

Moreover, in controls subjects was found a significant reduction in all PA parameters considered, while, NMD showed a significant decrease in walking activity, total weekly PA level and weekly MVPA level. These results reflect the fact that moderate-intensity PA and walking activities were similarly affected in both patients and controls, while vigorous-intensity PA seem to be more reduced in controls. This was in agreement with a recent study that reported a high level of total weekly energy expenditure before the COVID-19 quarantine in healthy subjects [25] . Vigorous-intensity and moderate-intensity PA, which require a suitable state of health to perform certain physical efforts represented a relevant part of baseline PA levels in healthy controls, but not in NMD. Anyhow, the quarantine has negatively influenced walking activities above all in NMD. The key explanation for this result could be related to the fact that walking represents a low intensity and aerobic activity characterized by easy accessibility for all the population [36] .",

Surprisingly, both PCS-12 and MCS-12 scores correlated with \u2206MET-Total and, moreover, PCS-12 correlated with MVPA level. Furthermore, compared to Italian population [31, 32] , NMD showed reduced SF-12 scores, especially patients with impaired walking. In particular, the mental health component resulted more affected among men, while the physical component was more altered in patients with higher BMI. Finally, specific alterations resulted from different diseases: ND patients showed lower PCS-12 scores than MY patients and lower MCS-12 scores compared to NJD and PN patients.

A significant reduction in PA has been reported in NMD, especially walking activities. Moreover, the extent of PA reduction was related to the perceived physical and mental health of NMD, thus influencing their quality of life. Sedentary behaviors can have negative consequences on the health of the entire population, in particular for those with additional risk factors and neuromuscular diseases. Therefore, since outdoor activities are not practicable due to the quarantine, it is essential to maintain an active lifestyle by performing exercise in a home-based setting for healthy subjects as well as for patients. Indeed, PA and physiotherapy are fundamental for NMD to avoid further loss of muscle mass and to slow the progression of the disease.",

Our results come from comparison of the two condition, \"pre\" and \"during\" quarantine; however, the evaluation of the two conditions comes from the same interview and this may have biased the collection of data. PA levels are quite easy to recall in memory and should not be affected by the mental perception, at difference with psychological variables that may be affected by memory. For this reason, we administered SF-12 only during quarantine renouncing to a comparison with the before quarantine status. Future studies are needed to clarify whether differences in PA levels could affect other domains of health and life in healthy subjects and in NMD. Finally, we did not report data on follow-up. Future studies monitoring PA levels for several months after lockdown could offer new interesting clues to the mechanisms of recovering after muscle mass loss and hypotrophy and provide more useful information to predict outcome and response to different rehabilitation strategies.",
