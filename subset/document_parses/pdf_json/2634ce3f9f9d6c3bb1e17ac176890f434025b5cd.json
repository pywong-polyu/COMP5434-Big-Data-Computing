Although reported rates vary, one study found that 20% of COVID-19 patients presenting to the hospital required mechanical ventilation, and the mortality for these patients was 88% 1 . A Cochrane systematic review by Andriolo et al. suggested that early tracheostomies, defined as less than 10 days after intubation, reduces mortality in other critically ill patients 2 . Benefits of tracheostomy include decreased respiratory secretions and pneumonia, greater patient comfort, and faster weaning from the ventilator 2 .",

However, patients who survive beyond the initial intubation period may benefit from tracheostomy, similar to other critically ill patients with respiratory failure. Because of viral load and risk to the healthcare team, it has been suggested that tracheostomies for COVID-19 patients be performed later in their hospital course, specifically after at least 21 days of ventilation [3] [4] [5] . To our knowledge, there are no previous studies that have evaluated outcomes of COVID-19 patients who received tracheostomies after 21 days of intubation. Prior studies have focused on tracheostomies performed an average of 10-20 days post intubation and demonstrated variable mortality rates 7-24% [6] [7] [8] [9] . Our study seeks to examine the in-hospital mortality rate and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheostomy.",

Of the patients who were liberated, 5 (63%) were decannulated prior to discharge. The average intensive care length of stay was 47 \u00b1 13 days (range 29-74 days) and the average overall hospital length of stay was 59 \u00b1 16 days (range 34-103 days). The patients who were liberated from mechanical ventilation were discharged an average of 31 days after their tracheostomy and 17 days after liberation. The patients who remained on mechanical ventilation were discharge an average of 18 days after tracheostomy placement. Of note, social issues and lack of insurance delayed placement for some patients, extending their hospital stays.",

Patients with later tracheostomies are more likely to be in a recovery phase, having survived the period of early mortality. Our patients were intubated an average of 31 days prior to undergoing tracheostomy. Their overall mortality rate was 13%, in sharp contrast to the reported 88% mortality for COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation 1 , suggesting that once patients survive that initial period, tracheostomy may be an important step contributing to their survival. An appropriate comparison group would be those who survived at least 21 days and were extubated without tracheostomy. However, we had very few of those COVID-19 patients. Generally, if COVID-19 patients remained intubated past 21 days, they had failed weaning trials and were not suitable for extubation. Two patients in our cohort died and both deaths were not directly related to the tracheostomy. Compared to patients who survived to discharge, these patients were slightly older, had somewhat higher ventilator settings at time of tracheostomy, and had underlying comorbidities. Risk factors for later mortality in this cohort of patients is an area for further study.",

One early study performed tracheostomies after 14 days of intubation in COVID-19 patients and found a mortality rate of 25%, leading them to conclude that a tracheostomy should not be performed until at least 21 days of mechanical ventilation 12 . Another study that waited longer, on average 20 days, had a much lower mortality rate of 11%. They were similarly able to liberate about half of their cohort 6 . Also, viral load appears to become undetectable around two weeks after symptom onset 13 , reducing risk of healthcare worker exposure during the procedure. These results led to the recommendation by some to wait until 21 days to perform tracheostomy [3] [4] [5] . The largest study to date was performed by Martin-Villares et al. in Spain. This study included 1,890 patients with a median time to tracheostomy of 12 days. These patients were followed for one month with a mortality of 24% 7 . Although they were similarly successful at weaning about half their population from mechanical ventilation, they report a fairly high mortality. These prior studies as well as our own findings suggest that waiting longer (at least 21 days) before tracheostomy, when patients may be more stable and starting to recover, does not change likelihood of liberation from mechanical ventilation, may reduce risk of death, and is warranted.",

One limitation is the small sample size, due in part to a limited number of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients surviving to 21 days and being able to undergo tracheostomy. While we did not have a strict protocol for timing or method for tracheostomy, we had a standard approach and consistently took all the precautions to minimize risks to clinicians. Our demographics reflected that of our local patient population with no white non-Hispanic patients, potentially limiting generalizability to other populations. However, minority populations have been shown to have worse outcomes than white COVID-19 patients 14 . This may suggest our results are even more promising on a general scale since this population usually has poorer outcomes than other populations. Lastly, our study has no control group, so we are unable to definitively conclude that a later tracheostomy is better than an earlier one or no tracheostomy. Finally, it must be said that by waiting at least three weeks to proceed with tracheostomy, we have selected for patients who may be more likely to survive. While this may be true, the benefit of protecting the healthcare workforce during earlier periods of patients' hospitalization when they may be more infectious, outweighs whatever potential risks this may have on our outcomes.",
