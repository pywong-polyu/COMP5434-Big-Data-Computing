Compared with NGCs made of single material, composite NGCs have a greater development prospect. Our previous research has confirmed that poly(D, L-lactic acid)/\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate/ hyaluronic acid/chitosan/nerve growth factor (PDLLA/\u03b2-TCP/HA/CHS/NGF) NGCs have excellent physical and chemical properties, which can slowly release NGF and support cell adhesion and proliferation. In this study, PDLLA/\u03b2-TCP/HA/CHS/NGF NGCs were prepared and used to bridge a 10 mm sciatic nerve defect in 200-250 g Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat to verify the performance of the NGCs in vivo. Substantial improvements in nerve regeneration were observed after using the PDLLA/\u03b2-TCP/HA/CHS/NGF NGCs based on gross postoperation observation, triceps wet weight analysis and nerve histological assessment. In vivo studies illustrate that the PDLLA/\u03b2-TCP/HA/CHS/NGF sustained-release NGCs can effectively promote peripheral nerve regeneration, and the effect is similar to that of autograft.",

Although human peripheral nerves can regenerate after injury, due to the limited ability of regeneration, this spontaneous process is not enough to achieve normal functional recovery [2] . Hence a considerable number of PNI patients will have sequelae, such as chronic pain, sensory or motor dysfunction and muscle atrophy [3] . Historically, PNI has been poorly repaired, especially in cases of delayed treatment and/or severe injury [4] .",

The requirements of ideal NGCs include bionic structure, structural characteristics of regenerated axons arranged longitudinally, sufficient mechanical properties, good permeability, conductivity, flexibility and biodegradability [5] . A single material can not meet the above-mentioned requirements. So, the preparation of composite NGCs by mixing natural polymer and synthetic polymer is the focus of current research [2] .

Among them, the nerve fibers in the PDLLA/\u03b2-TCP/HA/CHS/NGF group regenerated more effeciently than those in the PDLLA/\u03b2-TCP/HA/CHS group.

Triceps wet weight, histological and immunological assessments showed that the regenerated neuromyelin sheath of the PDLLA/ \u03b2-TCP/HA/CHS/NGF group was thicker and more uniform, which is similar to autograft controls and better than the PDLLA, PDLLA/\u03b2-TCP/HA/CHS groups. Furthermore, the PDLLA/\u03b2-TCP/HA/CHS/ NGF NGCs are capable of slowly releasing NGF, which effectively promoted the regeneration of the peripheral nerve defect. In conclusion, the PDLLA/ \u03b2-TCP/HA/CHS/NGF sustained-release nerve conduit is an excellent conduit material to induce nerve regeneration.",
