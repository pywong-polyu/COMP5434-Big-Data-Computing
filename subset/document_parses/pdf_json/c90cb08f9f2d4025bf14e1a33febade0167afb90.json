However, the rapid appearance of large numbers of plasmablasts in Plasmodium-infected hosts can suppress the development and function of durable humoral immunity. Here, we identify that the formation of plasmablast populations in Plasmodium-infected mice is mechanistically linked to both hemolysis-induced exposure of phosphatidylserine on damaged RBCs and inflammatory cues. We also show that virus and Trypanosoma infections known to trigger hemolytic anemia and highgrade inflammation also induce exuberant plasmablast responses. The induction of hemolysis or administration of RBC membrane ghosts increases plasmablast differentiation. The phosphatidylserine receptor Axl is critical for optimal plasmablast formation, and blocking phosphatidylserine limits plasmablast expansions and reduces Plasmodium parasite burden in vivo. Our findings support that strategies aimed at modulating polyclonal B cell activation and phosphatidylserine exposure may improve immune responses against Plasmodium parasites and potentially other infectious diseases that are associated with anemia.",

However, protective antibody responses are not efficiently induced by Plasmodium infections, and such humoral responses take years to develop among those living in malaria endemic areas (Tran et al., 2013) , which leaves individuals susceptible to chronic and repeated bouts of infection.",

The reasons for delayed and inefficient acquisition of antimalarial humoral immune responses are multifactorial (reviewed in Ly and Hansen, 2019) , but recent data support that GC responses induced by blood-stage Plasmodium infection are constrained by the rapid emergence of metabolically hyperactive populations of plasmablasts that numerically dominate the initial B cell response and suppress humoral immunity . Using specific immunoassays, these studies further showed that only a small fraction (<1%) of the plasmablast population appeared parasite specific, consistent with blood-stage Plasmodium infection-associated polyclonal B cell activation.",

            "text": "Polyclonal B cell activation has been described as an immune evasion mechanism that multiple pathogens, including Plasmodium, have evolved to exploit in order to establish persistent infection, thereby increasing the likelihood for transmission. Initial work showed that the CIDR1\u03b1 subdomain of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1) could trigger B cell proliferation independent of B cell receptor (BCR) specificities (Donati et al., 2006; Donati et al., 2004; Simone et al., 2011) . Additionally, controlled human malaria infection studies showed that the B cell growth and survival factor BAFF is potently induced during P. falciparum infection of malaria-naive individuals (Scholzen et al., 2014) , which may additionally contribute to polyclonal B cell proliferation. Relevant to these sets of observations, Plasmodium blood-stage infection has been linked to the activation of self-and lipid-specific B cells (Rivera-Correa et al., 2017) . The secretion of phosphatidylserine (PtS)-specific antibodies exacerbates anemia in experimental malaria models and is associated with severe malarial anemia in P. falciparuminfected individuals (Fernandez-Arias et al., 2016) . As a composite, these reports suggest that the numerical over-representation of immunosuppressive and potentially self-reactive plasmablast populations triggered by Plasmodium blood-stage infection may be linked to polyclonal B cell activation events. However, the pathways and mechanisms that lead to the formation of rapid, highmagnitude plasmablast responses and whether the appearance of plasmablasts relates to distinct pathophysiologic features of malaria are not understood. Moreover, whether other infections associated with polyclonal B cell activation events also trigger highmagnitude plasmablast expansions has not been investigated.",

We further show exuberant plasmablast responses were also induced by virus and Trypanosoma infections that are associated with RBC damage and hemolysis and that blocking PtS in vivo during experimental malaria markedly reduced the formation of plasmablasts and improved parasite control. B cell-intrinsic expression of the PtS receptor Axl was also essential for optimal plasmablast expansion.

To investigate factors that promote the enormous expansions of malaria-associated plasmablasts, we first examined whether their appearance was linked to parasite burden. Across multiple time points, we observed a strong positive correlation between the proportion of CD138 hi plasmablasts among total B cells and parasite burden ( Fig. 1 B) , suggesting that pathogen-associated molecular patterns and/or antigen and BCR-associated activation events contribute to CD138 hi plasmablast expansion. However, RNA sequencing analyses revealed transcriptional signatures that were consistent with blunted BCR-mediated activation in CD138 hi plasmablasts compared with CD138 lo IgD neg activated B cells. Moreover, key pathways that include PI3K and BCR signaling showed lower activation scores (z score less than \u22121.5) in CD138 hi plasmablasts (Fig. 1 C and Table S1 ). Blunted BCR signaling was also evident by reduced phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase Syk in CD138 hi plasmablasts compared with CD138 lo IgD neg activated B cells (Fig. S1 B) . CD138 hi plasmablasts also exhibited expected signatures of the unfolded protein response, yet substantially lower activation scores for genes associated with IFN-\u03b3, TLR, and other PRR signaling pathways compared with activated B cells and naive B cells (Fig. 1 D, left and right, respectively; and Table S1 ).",

To explore this hypothesis, we infected MD4 transgenic mice, in which the B cell repertoire is enriched for cells expressing a single BCR specific for hen egg lysozyme (HEL).

However, both genotypes harbored elevated HEL-specific antibody ( Fig. 1 G, bottom) , which is additionally consistent with polyclonal B cell activation following blood-stage Plasmodium infection. We also reacted sera from Plasmodium-infected WT mice against a panel of model antigens and bacterial components and identified robust IgM and IgG responses toward all antigens compared with naive mice (Fig. S1 C). Although parasite lysate-specific IgG titers remained elevated for 10 wk in Plasmodium-infected WT mice, anti-HEL and anti-LPS IgM and IgG responses markedly waned ( Fig. S1 D) , supporting that these off-target secreted antibody responses likely derive from short-lived, polyclonally activated plasmablasts. Consistent with nonspecific, polyclonal CD138 hi plasmablast activation and differentiation in Plasmodium-infected mice, single-cell transcriptomic analyses of the CD138 hi plasmablast BCR repertoire showed that it was as diverse as the naive B cell repertoire ( Fig. 1 H and Fig. S1 E) . Moreover, only two unique VH genes were selected within the plasmablast population (Fig. S1 F), suggesting that a very limited proportion of plasmablasts likely underwent BCR/antigen-dependent expansion. Together, these transcriptomic, genetic, and functional data support that a substantial proportion of the immunosuppressive CD138 hi plasmablast population expanded polyclonally during experimental malaria independently of canonical antigen recognition by BCR.",

Although terminally differentiated plasmablasts exhibit reduced signatures of IFN-\u03b3 signaling ( Fig. 1 D) , the neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 in Plasmodium-infected MD4 mice reduced the number of CD138 hi plasmablasts by more than twofold (Fig. 2 A) and blunted anti-HEL-secreted IgM and IgG antibody titers by threefold to fourfold (Fig. S2 A) . Chimeric mice in which Ifn\u03b3r1 deficiency was restricted to the B cell compartment (B Ifngr\u2212/\u2212 ) also exhibited threefold fewer CD138 hi plasmablasts compared with B WT chimeric mice (Fig. 2 B) . Moreover, the absence of TLR-and PRR-associated signaling adaptors MyD88 and TRIF reduced the differentiation and accumulation of CD138 hi plasmablasts by 30-40% (Fig. 2 , C and D, respectively). The splenic B cell compartments in MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 and Ticam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were 40-60% larger than those of WT mice, so the absolute number of plasmablasts was not different among these three groups (not shown). Together, these data support that the activity of polyclonal B cell activators, including IFN-\u03b3 and PRR signaling, and potentially other pathophysiological aspects of blood-stage malaria may act on precursor B cell populations to promote the induction and accumulation of terminally differentiated CD138 hi plasmablasts.",

However, we observed minimal induction of splenic CD138 hi plasmablast responses in WT mice infected with either Leishmania donovani or Leishmania infantum (Fig. S2 B) or influenza A virus (Fig. S2 C) in type I IFN receptor-deficient mice infected with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or in WT mice infected with high-dose VSV (Fig. S2 D) or in septicemic WT mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (Fig. S2 E) . By contrast, we observed marked CD138 hi plasmablast expansions in mice infected with either Trypanosoma brucei (Tb) or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus strain Armstrong (LCMV-Arm; Fig. 2 , E and F). These data led us to further hypothesize that in addition to IFN-\u03b3 and PRR signaling, other key pathological features of malaria, trypanosomiasis, and acute LCMV-Arm infection may also regulate the induction and expansion of CD138 hi plasmablasts. Indeed, polyclonal B cell activation, hemolysis, and anemia are features of both Plasmodium and Tb blood infections in mice and humans (Ikede et al., 1977; Lamikanra et al., 2007; Stijlemans et al., 2018) and LCMV-Arm infection in mice (Stellrecht and Vella, 1992; von Herrath et al., 1999) .",

PHZ-mediated hemolysis may stimulate CD138 hi plasmablast expansions via the release and recognition of either RBC cytoplasmic contents or damaged RBC membranes. To address whether membrane components were promoting plasmablast responses, we administered RBC membrane ghosts to LCMV-infected mice and found that RBC ghosts were sufficient to expand the number and proportion of CD138 hi plasmablasts by twofold ( Fig. 2 G) , which effectively phenocopied PHZ treatment.

ELISA assays also confirmed that naive B cells stimulated with LPS, IFN\u03b3, and RBC ghosts secreted IgM (Fig. 3 G) , supporting the notion that RBC membrane-associated factor(s) promote the induction and differentiation of CD138 hi plasmablasts. Because both malaria (Fernandez-Arias et al., 2016) and PHZ treatment (Adams et al., 2002; White et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2015) trigger PtS exposure in the outer leaflet of RBC membranes, we hypothesized that direct sensing of PtS exposed on damaged RBC membranes may promote the differentiation of CD138 hi plasmablasts, independently of BCR-PtS recognition. Indeed, we observed that a number of receptors documented to bind to PtS either directly (Havcr1 encoding Tim1) or indirectly (Mertk, Axl, C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, Scarb1, and Havcr2 encoding Tim2) were more highly expressed in naive or activated B cells compared with CD138 hi plasmablasts (Fig. 3 H) . We also confirmed that splenic B cells recovered from both naive and Plasmodiuminfected mice bound to PtS liposomes ex vivo, as detected by Annexin V labeling (Fig. S3 A) , and that both resting (IgD hi ) and activated B cells (IgD neg ) from infected mice were equivalently labeled (Fig. S3 B) . In further support of our hypothesis, ex vivo polyclonal activation of naive murine B cells in the presence of PtS, but not phosphatidylcholine (PtC), liposomes induced surface expression of CD138 (Fig. 3 I) , up-regulation of Prdm1 and Xbp1 mRNA (Fig. 3 J) , and IgM secretion (Fig. 3 K) . Importantly, blocking either RBC ghosts or PtS liposomes with either Annexin V or the mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (mch1N11) fully abrogated surface expression of CD138, induction of Prdm1 and Xbp1 mRNA, and IgM secretion (Fig. 3 , E-G and I-K). We also found that substantial fractions of human peripheral B cells also acquired a plasmablast-like phenotype (CD27 + CD38 + ) upon polyclonal stimulation and co-culture with either PtS liposomes or autologous RBC ghosts (Fig. 3 L) . Collectively, these data support a model in which polyclonal B cell activation via IFN-\u03b3 and PRR signaling, coupled with either hemolysis-or RBC damageassociated PtS exposure and sensing, potentiates the differentiation and accumulation of plasmablasts.",

Our studies suggest that PtS may additionally function as an immune checkpoint via its capacity to promote the induction of immunosuppressive CD138 hi plasmablast responses. To directly test the relevance of PtS exposure in promoting CD138 hi plasmablast responses during experimental malaria, we employed both biological and genetic approaches to manipulate PtS exposure and PtS receptor signaling. Consistent with our ex vivo B cell differentiation data, administration of mch1N11 to Plasmodium-infected mice reduced the absolute number of CD138 hi plasmablasts (Fig. 4 A) and increased the total numbers of GC B cells (Fig. 4 B) and GC-T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (Fig. 4 C) by 20-40%. Notably, mch1N11-mediated abrogation of CD138 hi plasmablast accumulation and augmented GC reactions were further associated with elevated class-switched, parasitespecific serum IgG antibody responses (Fig. 4 D) and enhanced parasite control (Fig. 4 E) , which is in line with our recent report establishing the immunosuppressive function of CD138 hi plasmablasts during Plasmodium infection .",

Indeed, hypoxia, which is a key feature of blood-stage Plasmodium infection (unpublished data) has been shown to stabilize and enhance Axl signaling (Mishra et al., 2012) . Moreover, Axl signaling via PtS requires GAS6, which binds PtS via its \"Gla\" domain to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and transduce intracellular signals that promote cell proliferation (Ruan and Kazlauskas, 2012) , and PI3K signaling is essential for the differentiation of plasmablasts (Omori et al., 2006) . While these reports are consistent with our finding that B cellintrinsic Axl expression is critical for optimal plasmablast differentiation, our data do not rule out the potential contributions of other PtS receptors that share intracellular signaling cascades, such as Tyro3 (Stitt et al., 1995) . Notably, multiple drugs targeting Axl have entered clinical trial, which raises the possibility that the PtS-GAS6-Axl pathway might serve as a therapeutic target to improve patient outcomes during malaria or other inflammatory pathologies associated with anemia and hemolysis and the exuberant expansion of plasmablasts.",
