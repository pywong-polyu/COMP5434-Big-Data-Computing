In an effort to vaccinate as many people as possible given an initially limited supply, states began providing three vaccines produced by Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen, J&J) to their residents, roughly in accordance with the priority groups established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2] . On April 13, 2021, U.S. authorities announced an investigation into potential adverse events associated with the J&J COVID-19 vaccine and recommended ''a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution.\" [3] While evaluating potential adverse events is a crucial part of the vaccine safety system, public health and medical experts worried that this recommendation could have also heightened public concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety in general and added to vaccine hesitancy, potentially reducing uptake. On the other hand, because there were other vaccines available, news about J&J may simply have shifted public preference for Moderna and Pfizer vaccines without changing overall hesitancy or uptake. Moreover, the suspension was short-lived as authorities recommended resuming using the J&J vaccine on April 23.",

This provides a counterfactual: the outcome we would expect if the J&J vaccine had not been suspended. We then compared the post-suspension outcomes predicted by our model with actual responses in the post-suspension round of the HPS. The HPS sampling weights were used to obtain estimates representative of the US adult population. The 95% prediction intervals (PI) of the point estimates were generated based on asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimates of the logistic model.

The third caveat relates to a change in the HPS survey instrument in the pre-and post-suspension periods. Prior to the suspension, survey respondents were given four options (''definitely yes\", ''probably yes\", ''probably no\", ''definitely no\" when prompted whether they would receive the vaccine. An additional category ''unsure\" was added to the instrument used after the J&J suspension.

As shown in our results, the suspension may have played a role in increasing concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety among the already hesitant population. This emphasizes the importance of using trusted channels to disseminate messages that address safety-specific concerns among those hesitant to receive the vaccine. At the same time, it is encouraging to see that precautionary communication from the US health authorities on vaccine side effects did not increase the size of the vaccine hesitant population, in aggregate. It is important to note that there were other vaccines available in the US when the CDC and FDA issued the recommendation for J&J vaccine suspension. This decision and the news about the J&J vaccine may simply have shifted public preference for Moderna and Pfizer vaccines without decreasing the overall demand of COVID-19 vaccine. The aforementioned KFF survey also showed that after the J&J suspension, people were less confident of the safety of the J&J vaccine compared to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines [8] , and the possibility that this affected brand preference should be investigated with additional data in future studies. It is unclear how the suspension would have affected the overall COVID-19 vaccine rollout if the J&J vaccine was the only vaccine available, but plausibly there may have been a more direct negative effect. This suggests there may be a benefit to having multiple vaccines available from a hesitancy perspective, as well as an operational one.",
