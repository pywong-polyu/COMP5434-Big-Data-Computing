To understand the specificity of Delta-elicited antibody immunity, we characterize the polyclonal antibody response elicited by primary or mRNA vaccine-breakthrough Delta infections. Both types of infection elicit a neutralizing antibody response focused heavily on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). We use deep mutational scanning to show that mutations to the RBD's class 1 and class 2 epitopes, including sites 417, 478, and 484-486 often reduce binding of these Delta-elicited antibodies. The anti-Delta antibody response is more similar to that elicited by early 2020 viruses than the Beta variant, with mutations to the class 1 and 2, but not class 3 epitopes, having the largest effects on polyclonal antibody binding. In addition, mutations to the class 1 epitope (e.g., K417N) tend to have larger effects on antibody binding and neutralization in the Delta spike than in the D614G spike, both for vaccine-and Delta-infection-elicited antibodies. These results help elucidate how the antigenic impacts of SARS-CoV-2 mutations depend on exposure history.",

We deep sequenced the pre-and post-selection populations to quantify each mutation's \"escape fraction\". These escape fractions range from 0 (no cells with the mutation in the plasma-escape bin) to 1 (all cells with the mutation in the plasma-escape bin) (S3 Data). We calculate the site-level antibody escape as the sum of the escape fractions for each mutation at a site (with a possible range from 0 to 19). The antibody-escape experiments were performed with two biologically independent replicate libraries. The replicate site-and mutation-level escape fractions were well-correlated (S5 Fig), and throughout we report the average across the two replicates (S3 Data). We represent the escape maps as logo plots, where the height of each le er is proportional to its escape fraction, or line plots showing the site-level escape (Figs 3 and S3A) .",

Infection with all three viruses elicits an antibody response that is affected by mutations to site 484 and the class 2 epitope (Fig 3 and 4A-B) .

The multidimensional scaling projection (Fig 4C) shows that the early 2020 plasmas cluster between multiple antibody classes, but are somewhat biased towards class 2 antibodies, the Beta plasmas cluster between the class 2 and 3 antibodies, and the Delta plasmas cluster between the class 1 and 2 antibodies (Fig 4C) . Overall, the binding-escape maps for Delta infections more closely resemble those for early 2020 infections than Beta infections. These results are consistent with serological evidence and antigenic cartography showing that the Beta and Delta variants are more distinct from one another than either is relative to the early 2020 variant (15) (16) (17) 45, 46) . .

Because there were often multiple mutations per variant for the Wuhan-Hu-1 libraries, global epistasis modeling was used to deconvolve the effects of single amino-acid mutations on antibody binding (22, 23) , whereas for the Delta libraries, the measurements for single-mutant variants were used directly (occasional variants with multiple mutations were discarded) to calculate antibody escape.

Colonies from bo lenecked transformation plates were scraped and plasmid purified. Plasmid libraries (10 \u00b5g plasmid per replicate library) were transformed into the AWY101 yeast strain (55) according to the protocol of Gie and Schiestl (56). PacBio sequencing to link variant mutations and barcodes As described by Starr et al. (53), PacBio sequencing was used to generate long sequence reads spanning the Nx16 barcode and RBD coding sequence. The 1079-basepair PacBio sequencing amplicons were prepared from the DNA plasmid libraries via NotI digestion, gel purification, and Ampure XP bead clean-up. Sample-specific barcoded SMRTbells were ligated using the SMRTbell Express Template Kit 2.0. The multiplexed libraries were sequenced on a PacBio Sequel IIe with a 20-hour movie collection time. Demultiplexed PacBio HiFi circular consensus sequences (CCSs) were generated on-instrument (Sequel IIe control software version 10.1.0.119549) and demultiplexed with lima using SMRTLink version 10.1.0.119588. HiFi reads are CCSs with >=3 full passes and a mean quality score Q >=20. HiFi reads were processed using alignparse (version 0.2.6) (57) to determine each variant's mutations and the associated Nx16 barcode sequence, requiring no more than 45 nucleotide mutations from the intended target sequence, an expected 16-nt length barcode sequence, and no more than 4 mismatches across the sequenced portions of the vector backbone. A ribution of barcodes to library variants determined that the libraries contained all 3,819 possible single amino-acid mutations to the Delta RBD. Approximately 20% of barcodes in the duplicate libraries corresponded to the unmutated (wildtype) Delta RBD (S3A Fig). The libraries were designed to contain only wildtype and 1-amino acid mutations, but in some cases, multiple mutations per variant were stochastically introduced during the library synthesis process. These multi-mutant variants were excluded from downstream analysis of the effects of mutations on ACE2 binding, RBD expression, and plasma antibody binding.",

Cells were then labeled with 1:100 diluted Myc-FITC to detect RBD expression and 1:200 Streptavidin-PE (Invitrogen S866) to detect binding of biotinylated ACE2. Cells were processed on a BD FACSAria II and sorted into four bins from low to high RBD expression (measured by myc-FITC staining) or ACE2 binding (measured by streptavidin-PE fluorescence). The RBD expression sort bins were set such that bin 1 would capture 99% of unstained cells, and the remaining 3 bins divide the remainder of each mutant RBD library into equal tertiles. For ACE2 binding, bin 1 captured 95% of cells expressing unmutated RBD incubated with no ACE2 (0 M), and bin 4 captured 95% of cells expressing unmutated RBD incubated with a saturating amount of ACE2 (10 -6 M).

The exact dilution used for each plasma is given in S4 Fig. After the plasma incubations, the libraries were secondarily labeled for 1 hour with 1:100 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-MYC antibody (Immunology Consultants Lab, CYMC-45F) to label for RBD expression and 1:200 Alexa Fluor-647-conjugated goat anti-human-IgA+IgG+IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch 109-605-064) to label for bound plasma antibodies. A flow cytometric selection gate was drawn to capture cells with the reduced plasma binding for their degree of RBD expression (S3 Fig). For each sample, approximately 10 million RBD + cells were processed on the BD FACSAria II cell sorter, with between 7 x 10 5 and 1.2 x 10 6 plasma-escaped cells collected per sample.

The 16-nucleotide barcode sequences identifying each RBD variant were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and prepared for Illumina sequencing as described in(53). Specifically, a primer with the sequence 5\u2032-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGA-3\u2032 was used to anneal to the Illumina P5 adaptor sequence, and the PerkinElmer NextFlex DNA Barcode adaptor primers with the sequence where xxxxxxxx indicates the sample NextFlex index sequence) were used to anneal to the Illumina P7 adaptor sequence and append sample indexes for sample multiplexing. Barcodes were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 or NextSeq 2000 with 50 bp single-end reads.

Media was changed to fresh D10 at 24 hours post-transfection. At ~60 hours post-transfection, viral supernatants were collected, filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m surfactant-free cellulose acetate low protein-binding filter, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.",

Generation of the Delta RBD mutant libraries and measurements of effects of mutations on ACE2 binding and RBD expression. (A) Schematic showing the Delta RBD mutant library design. A site-saturation variant library was generated in the Delta RBD background, targeting one amino-acid mutation per variant. Nx16 unique DNA barcodes were appended to the variant gene fragments. The Nx16 barcodes were linked to their associated RBD mutations by PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS). The plasmid library DNA was transformed into yeast cells. In downstream experiments, the Nx16 barcodes are sequenced by short-read Illumina sequencing. The tables at right indicate key library statistics.

See Methods for experimental details. (D) Thresholds on the ACE2 binding and RBD expression scores (dashed orange lines) for the Delta mutant library to computationally filter highly deleterious variants that may represent spurious antibody-escape mutations. We aimed to retain most mutations that have been observed >=50 times in sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The x-axis categorizes mutations by their number of observations in GISAID (67) as of Aug. 1, 2021. An ACE2 binding score threshold of >= -1.86 (10 -1.86 binding compared to unmutated Delta RBD, which is a 72.4-fold loss in binding affinity) and an RBD expression score of >= -0.75 (10 -0.75 expression compared to unmutated Delta RBD, which is a 5.6-fold loss in RBD expression) were chosen, which filter comparable numbers of mutations as in prior Wuhan-Hu-1 experiments (23,43). These filters retain 100 and 97.3% of mutations, respectively, that have been observed >=50 times in sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates. (E) Relationship between the ACE2 binding and RBD expression scores for the Delta RBD library compared to those previously published for the Wuhan-Hu-1 library in Starr, et al. (2020) (53). The computational filters used for antibody-escape experiments for the Wuhan-Hu-1 (23) and Delta libraries are dashed orange lines. Each dot is one mutation, and mutations to disulfide bonds are shown in red. A key difference is that for the previously published Wuhan-Hu-1 experiments, dimeric rather than monomeric ACE2 was used (53).
