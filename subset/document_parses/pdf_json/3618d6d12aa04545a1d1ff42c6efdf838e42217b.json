An intense research effort has been undertaken by the research community in order to better understand the molecular etiology of this virus and its mechanisms of host cell subjugation and immune system evasion. To facilitate further research into the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus we have generated adenovirus 5-based viral vectors that express SARS-CoV-2 proteins-S, N, E, NSP7, NSP8, and NSP12 as hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged and untagged variants. We have also engineered two additional viruses that express the S protein receptor binding domain and a fusion of the receptor binding domain to the N protein. We show that these vectors are expressed in several different cell lines by Western blotting and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT-PCR), we evaluate the subcellular localization of these viral proteins, and we show that these coronavirus proteins bind to a variety of cellular targets. The flexibility of adenovirus vectors allows them to be used in a variety of cell models and, importantly, in animal models as well.",

Intense research has made tremendous progress in understanding how this virus works, yet much research remains to be done as new variants and continued evolution of the virus keep shifting the rules of engagement on the pandemic battlefield. Therefore, wide availability of resources and reagents to study SARS-CoV-2 is essential in overcoming the pandemic and for the prevention of future outbreaks.

HAdVs offer several unique and useful features that make them attractive for the development of vaccines. HAdVs are widely distributed among the human population and generally cause mild disease. Of these, species C viruses, widely used for vaccine development (9) , are the best studied and understood (3) . This makes them particularly attractive for viral vector design due to widely available tools for recombineering, guaranteed infectivity in humans and a wide range of animals, extensive cellular tropism, and well-established manufacturing methods. The HAdV genome is comparatively large, allowing for insertion of large genes or multiple sequences of .30,000 base pairs in completely gutted vectors (10) . Importantly, there exists a large variety of reagents and vectors for viral recombineering, making engineering of novel vectors a relatively straightforward and rapid process (10) . This easy recombineering allows for generation of both replication-competent and replicationincompetent vectors, depending on the desired need (9) . Furthermore, not only is HAdV a stable virus that is easy to manipulate in the lab, but HAdV can be easily grown and scaled up in industrial settings for rapid vaccine scaleup and deployment when needed. Importantly, several vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed with the use of adenovirus as a vector, including vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac, the Sputnik V vaccine, and others; for a comprehensive list see reference 7. Despite exhibiting strict host-range restrictions for productive infection, HAdV is able to infect and deliver genes to a wide variety of hosts and cell types, making in vivo studies using different animals feasible.",

A previously described (12, 13) isolate of SARS-CoV-2 was used as the donor for the viral structural and nonstructural genes. SARS-CoV-2 genes (NSP7, NSP8, NSP12, E, N, S receptor binding domain [RBD, or RBD-N fusion) were subcloned into the donor plasmid, pAdLox-P, sequenced, and cotransfected with viral backbone, W5, into 293Cre9 cells using linear polyethylenimine lipid. 293Cre9 cells are a subclone of 293Cre8 cells (14) that have been specifically selected for efficient viral recombination. Two versions of each virus were generated, one carrying a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N terminus of the protein and one without the tag, with the exception of the spike gene, which did not recombine correctly when tagged with HA. Viral comets were used to identify recombination, and following two rounds of plaque purification, the viruses were assessed for expression of the gene of interest by Western blotting (for HA-tagged proteins) or quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR; for nontagged proteins).",

The 293 cells were infected with the rHAdVs expressing the HA-tagged SARS-CoV-2 proteins at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 500 viral particles (vp) per cell, while the A549 cells were infected at a 1,000 vp/cell for 72 h. All SARS-CoV-2 proteins that were tagged with HA were readily detectable in the infected 293 cells ( Fig. 2A) , including the relatively small products arising from NSP7 and E. In A549 cells expression was somewhat lower than in 293 cells (Fig. 2B) , and interestingly, we were unable to detect NSP12 despite its robust expression in 293 cells ( Fig. 2A) . The higher expression in 293 cells was likely the result of amplification due to virus replication in these cells; no replication occurred in A549 cells. There were multiple bands observed for several of the viral proteins, particularly N and NSP8, as well as the S-RBD and S-RBD-N fusion. These appear to correlate with the level of expression, as they were less apparent in A549 cells. We also tested the expression of the nontagged S construct, and it was readily detectable in A549 cells at an MOI of 1,000 vp/cell 72 h after infection (Fig. 2C) . We have designed two variants of the vectors expressing untagged S, one (#1) with a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) and one without (#2). This element is thought to enhance viral transgene expression (15) ; however, we found that in the context of Ad.S vector, it had the opposite effect and reduced expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.",

Interestingly, recombination of HA-tagged S construct was unsuccessful despite repeated attempts, while untagged S recombined easily. It is unclear why that was the case. It is possible that the combination of the sequences of HA-tag and S gene somehow interfered with the Cre recombinase, or it may be that the HA-tagged S protein itself was somehow toxic and killed recombined cells before efficient virus production was achieved. Ultimately, we felt it was more important to have S in any form, as there is a wide variety of anti-S antibodies, and not having an HA-tagged variant is of limited consequence overall. Expression of all NSPs and other structural proteins was easily detectable by a Western blot for the HA-tag (Fig. 2) using the high-affinity rat monoclonal antibody 3F10. Several of the proteins showed multiple bands on the Western blot indicative of smaller species; these are likely caused by proteolytic cleavage of the full-length protein, as they are generally more pronounced in proteins that expressed at high levels, such as N. Interestingly, it was puzzling to not see NSP12 express at detectable levels in A549 cells, which are derived from the lung. Some of this is undoubtedly due to a lack of virus replication and overall reduced expression versus 293 cells, but it is possible that stability or other aspects of NSP12 in A549 may play a factor. For example, the fusion protein of S-RBD-N, which expressed similarly to NSP12 in 293 cells, was easily detectable in A549 cells, but NSP12 was not. This may hint of potential regulation of the NSP12 half-life present in one of the cell lines but absent in another and may hint at the potential cellular tropism of the virus itself.",

Most of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins were readily detectable in the immunoprecipitation resolved on SDS-PAGE and silver-stained, with the exception of the smallest proteins, two of which likely did not resolve (NSP7 and E), and the third had the same molecular weight as a background band observed in all samples, likely masking it (NSP8). These three proteins also had the fewest binding partners; this may be unsurprising for the E protein but was somewhat unexpected for the replicase accessory factors NSP7 and NSP8 (17) . Nevertheless, other viral proteins, including the structural N, showed multiple cellular proteins that are bound during infection, providing a potential rich avenue for functional exploration. To further characterize these proteins, we investigated their cellular localization using fluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig. 5) . As would be expected of an RNA virus replicating predominantly in the cytoplasm, all of the proteins showed cytoplasmic localization with some variation. In particular, the proteins involved in viral genome replication (NSP7, NSP8, and NSP12) showed a distinct nucleocytoplasmic localization. This may be suggestive of potential nuclear functions of these proteins and perhaps involvement in suppression of antiviral responses or other functions. Indeed, NSP12 has previously been shown to attenuate type I interferon signaling (18) . The viral E protein showed a distinct punctate localization, likely due to its association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi network (19) . The receptor binding domain of S showed a nucleocytoplasmic distribution, whereas the fusion protein S-RBD-N showed cytoplasmic localization only. This is likely due to the small size of S-RBD alone, allowing it to freely cross into the nucleus, something that may also be the case for NSP7 and NSP8. We should note here that for those proteins with an N-terminal signal peptide, the presence of the HA-tag might affect their cellular localization to some degree. Ultimately, these proof-of-principle studies not only provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 protein functions but pave the way for further research.",
