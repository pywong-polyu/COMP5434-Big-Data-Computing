            "text": "A global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) began in December 2019, when the pathogen of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Wuhan, China. [1] [2] [3] Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 invades host cells by binding its spike proteins to receptor-angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) 3 and by their priming and fusion with the cell membrane by host transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). 4 In addition to the different expression levels or affinities of viral entry factors, host immunity functions could influence the infectivity or severity of COVID-19. 4 Thus, asthma, 2 allergic rhinitis, 2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 5, 6 and immunecompromised status 7 have been reported to be potentially associated with increased susceptibility to or severity of COVID- 19. In addition to the lower airway, COVID-19 has been suggested to have a high impact on the upper airway. 8 The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be higher in nasal swabs than in throat swabs in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. 9 Furthermore, in healthy human tissues, higher expression levels of viral entry-associated genes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were observed in nasal epithelial cells than in lower respiratory tract, corneal, and intestinal epithelial cells. 10, 11 In the respiratory tract, a gradient was found in ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection levels from the nose to the distal pulmonary epithelium, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 affinity to the respiratory epithelium combined with inhalation-related viral spreading could explain the pathogenesis of COVID-19. 12 Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the most common upper airway inflammatory diseases and could be associated with epithelial barrier dysfunction, bacterial colonization, exaggerated immune response, and specific antibody deficiency. 13, 14 Owing to the upper airway inflammatory condition, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and high expression levels of viral entry genes, CRS may increase COVID-19 susceptibility or severity. Previous preliminary studies were equivocal, 11, 15 and the potential association of CRS with COVID-19 susceptibility or severity has not yet been clarified.",

            "text": "The increased infectivity to SARS-CoV-2 and severity of COVID-19 observed in patients with CRS might be explained by several plausible mechanisms. First, the impairment of sinonasal epithelial barrier functions could increase the exposure of patients with CRS to viral pathogens and their invasion. The mucociliary clearance of viral pathogens might be impeded in CRS patients. Sinonasal epithelial cells in CRS patients have been shown to exhibit morphologic and functional changes in basal cell proliferation, goblet cell hyperplasia, and the loss of ciliated cells. 27 Second, patients whose CRS is caused by a viral infection may be more susceptible to viral coinfection, in particular with SARS-CoV-2. In a previous study, 28 CRS patients showed a 2.9 times higher rate of viral infection in nasal lavage fluids and nasal mucosa compared with patients without CRS, and approximately 21.6% of patients with CRS showed coronavirus infection. Third, the high expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the sinonasal cavity might have a role in the viral entry and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 10, 12, 29 The sinonasal cavity and the nasal epithelium are two regions with the highest ACE2 protein expression within the human respiratory tract. 10, 12, 29 Therefore, viral retention in the sinonasal cavity caused by CRS could accelerate the intracellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 by binding the viral receptor to ACE2 and its cofactor to TMPRSS2. Fourth, local inflammatory responses in patients with CRS could modulate susceptibility to COVID-19. Impaired antiviral innate immune responses in sinonasal epithelial cells occur in CRS patients during inflammation. 30 Sinonasal inflammatory responses can increase the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN) in CRS patients, 31 which in turn can upregulate the expression of ACE2. 32 Thus, local inflammation with increased IFN in CRS patients could induce ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV2 infection. 32 Consistent with local inflammation in CRS that possibly contributes to the development of COVID-19, an inhibitor of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 (dupilumab) has been reported potentially to alleviate the severity of COVID-19. 33, 34 Altogether, the combined effects of impaired barrier functions, viral coinfection, increased expression of viral entry-associated factors, and local inflammatory response might contribute to the increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 observed in CRS patients.",

Patients with CRSwNP or nonatopic CRS may prominently exhibit type 2 immune responses with downregulation of IFNs, which in turn might downregulate ACE2 expression. 8 An in vivo study of asthmatic rats with type 2 immune responses, which were given an ACE2 activator, demonstrated decreased expression of ACE2 together with the alleviation of altered airway responsiveness, eosinophilia, and inflammatory changes. 35, 36 Consistent with this observation, our previous real-world study 2 suggested a greater risk for a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and severe COVID-19 in patients with nonallergic asthma compared with patients with allergic asthma. Furthermore, a recent study 37 found that asthmatic patients with preexisting eosinophilia had a protective association from COVID-19eassociated admission and mortality. Altogether, these studies suggest that a prominent type 2 immune response caused by nasal polyps may contribute to lower SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 severity compared with CRSsNP.

In particular, CRS endotypes could not be differentiated because the current study used health insurance claims-based data with ICD-10 codes and lacked laboratory findings and biomarkers. Furthermore, the history of endoscopic sinus surgery was not considered. Because of the heterogeneous types, varying severity, and an inaccurate claimsbased definition of CRS in this cohort, this study might have underestimated the relation between CRS and the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 or severity of COVID-19. The classification of CRS patients according to the atopic status was based on the ICD-10 codes; thus, misdiagnosed cases or untreated cases may have been excluded in this study. Furthermore, ethnic differences in atopic CRS could explain the conflicting results regarding the association of atopic CRS with COVID-19. 39 The relatively small study population of atopic patients and that of patients with nasal polyps limited the statistical power in this study. Furthermore, although we adjusted for comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other confounding factors such as smoking could exist. 40 Second, CRS-related confounders might affect our main results. Although we used a large-scale nationwide cohort and a sophisticated matching technique to reduce bias, anosmia associated with CRS can cause more frequent SARS-CoV-2 testing, which may increase the selection bias. 41 Also, CRS can cause sinonasal symptoms, which may make wearing masks less tolerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the study population was limited to Koreans, and the association of CRS with the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 or the severity of COVID-19 could reveal differences in other ethnic groups. 42 In particular, type 2/atopic/ eosinophilic nasal polyps are less common in Asians. 39 The infectivity or severity of COVID-19 in CRS may not show a significant difference in Western countries owing to this geographic and ethnic difference in CRS endotypes.",
