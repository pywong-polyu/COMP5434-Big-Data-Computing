            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)when microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses acquire tolerance to antimicrobial drugs rendering these drugs less effectiveis a complex problem. Numerous and interacting factors impact the selection and transmission of acquired AMR within and between people, their animals, and the environment. These factors include antimicrobial use (AMU), in particular: the overuse and misuse of drugs; the extent to which infection prevention and control (IPC) and biosecurity practices are observed in hospitals, on farms, and in homes; the sanitation infrastructures of villages and cities; and national health and economic policies and regulations. [1] [2] [3] [4] These factors involve the behaviours of a wide range of stakeholders (e.g. consumers, farmers, doctors/veterinarians, policy makers, etc.) who are themselves motivated by socio-cultural, historical, political, economic, and personal forces. 1, 5 Considering the diversity of factors and actors impacting AMR, addressing the problem demands the development of holistic interventions. An approach that has emerged out of public health, dubbed 'complex interventions', is well suited to AMR as complex interventions usually target multiple outcomes (e.g. AMU and IPC) and include several interacting components (e.g. farmers, veterinarians, consumers) that often necessitate the development of new behaviours by those who receive and deliver the intervention. 6 The necessity of addressing AMR through a complex intervention approach is reflected in the broad range of interventions that have been targeted at the users, sellers, and prescribers of antimicrobial drugs. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] A recent review of interventions to limit AMU and AMR in the agricultural sector classifies these interventions into AMR-sensitive and AMR-specific interventions. AMR-sensitive interventions indirectly address AMR. For example, an intervention that limits the introduction and spread of pathogens by improving farm IPC can reduce the need for antimicrobials, thereby indirectly impacting AMR. In agriculture, common AMR-sensitive interventions include application of biological and chemical products to eliminate pathogens, modification of farm infrastructures and materials, and educational/behavioural interventions to limit disease. 13 Efforts to promote vaccine uptake by farmers would also be considered an AMR-sensitive intervention and the role of vaccinations in reducing AMR is routinely highlighted. [14] [15] [16] The main objective of AMR-specific interventions is to reduce AMR, for example, by requiring farmers to acquire prescriptions prior to purchasing antibiotics. 17 Most AMR-specific interventions focus on improving antimicrobial stewardship, such as the 'Yellow-Card Scheme' in Denmark, which gives farms with high AMU a yellow card followed by increased supervision and a 'red card' if measures to decrease AMU are not successful. 18 While evaluations of both AMR-sensitive and AMR-specific interventions find mixed support 13, 19, 20 there is a general consensus that AMR reduction will require the implementation of both AMR-specific and AMR-sensitive interventions. 5, 13, 21 A complex intervention methodology that can incorporate both AMR-sensitive and AMR-specific interventions is the Farmer Field School (FFS) approach. Pioneered by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the late 1980s, FFSs are based on the principles of adult-centred learning (e.g. 'learning-by-doing') and the exchange and creation of knowledge through group-level problem solving. 22 In a typical FFS, a group of farmers (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) meet on a weekly basis at a demonstration farm over the course of a production cycle (e.g. 6 weeks for broiler poultry). The school proceeds under the guidance of a trained FFS facilitator(s), who is often a local animal health, agricultural extension worker, or a graduate from a prior FFS. Specifics of FFS implementation are based upon analysis of the production ecosystem by FFS participants, the identification of problems arising from this analysis, and the development and implementation of solutions. A central aspect of the FFS methodology is experimentation, with alternative production practices being tested, for example, rearing some layers on manufactured feeds while other layers are administered home-made feeds. FFS participants then observe how these varying practices impact growth, health, and production. Assessments of FFS have found the intervention can produce gains in knowledge and empowerment, although evidence on economic impacts and farmer-to-farmer transmission of FFS contents is limited, and those in the development community have questioned the sustainability of the approach. 22, 23 In this study, we assessed the feasibly of the FFS approach to address the complex problem of AMR in agriculture, specifically within layer poultry systems. Building upon results from extensive knowledge, attitudes, and practices studies, 5 we developed an FFS curriculum that addressed three domains, including the AMR-sensitive interventions of farm biosecurity and animal health seeking practices, and the AMR-specific intervention of promoting more prudent AMU. The schools were held with small-to-medium-scale layer farmers from Ghana and Kenya. We evaluated the effectiveness of the FFS in respect to addressing the three domains of AMU, IPC, and animal health seeking. Results from this analysis, along with qualitative data from participants and facilitators on challenges and successes, are then used to extend recommendations on how to use the FFS intervention approach to address AMR in agriculture.",

First, the FAO research team identified within-country Master FFS Trainers with experience in training facilitators for livestock FFS. Second, FFS facilitators were recruited in Kenya (N = 6) and Ghana (N = 4) to receive multiweek training by the Master FFS Trainers. Facilitators in Kenya were research assistants who had contributed to the earlier KAP study and lived within the targeted communities. In Ghana, facilitators were animal health professionals who worked within the targeted communities and who had also been involved in the original KAP study. 5 During the training, an outline of the layer FFS curriculums was collaboratively developed by the Master Trainers, facilitators, and FAO research personnel. Curriculums included FFS sessions covering best practices in layer farming and included sessions to address gaps identified by previous KAP studies, including gaps in knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance, animal health seeking practices, and biosecurity. FFS participants were recruited by first approaching farmers who had provided data during the KAP surveys. In both countries, selection was then expanded through word of mouth until 15-20 farmers agreed to participate for each school, with Ghana holding two FFSs and Kenya three FFSs. FFSs in Ghana and Kenya meet on a weekly basis for approximately 32 weeks. This schedule was chosen according to the average length of time between the arrival of day-old chicks on the farm to the peak of egg laying. The FAO was responsible for all costs involved with the field school except for participant transport costs to the school. In Kenya, however, an issue with the distribution of funds resulted in FFS participants having to temporarily use their own funds to buy feed. Weekly meetings were occasionally interrupted by government-instituted COVID-19 restrictions and some lessons combined two sessions to make up for the lost time. All FFS were required to observe government instituted social distancing guidelines, wore masks, and washed hands and boots prior to entering and exiting the demonstration farms. See Table 1 for specific locations of FFS and number of participants.",

The positive association between biosecurity and farm size is consistent with previous work among pig farms in Belgium 29, 30 and cattle farms in Sweden 31 suggesting the relationship occurs across high-income and low-and-middle-income settings. In addition, biosecurity research on pig, poultry and cattle farms in Belgium demonstrated consistency across these production systems in the constraints to adopting biosecurity practices, including not having enough information on costs and how biosecurity will impact revenues. 30 While farmers in Ghana and Kenya are likely to face similar constraints, more nuanced examinations of the relationships between farm and farmer characteristics and AMU, AMR and biosecurity practices are needed to develop FFS curriculums tailored to the targeted communities and production systems.",

            "text": "Several limitations may impact our study results. First, our crosssectional design may have produced biased results if FFS participants, compared with non-FFS participants, initially had greater AMU/AMR knowledge levels, more prudent attitudes and practices and higher levels of IPC and animal health seeking. To assess this potential source of bias, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of our original KAP dataset from 2019. Several respondents from these original studies (N = 26) went on to participate in the FFS in Ghana and Kenya. Consequently, we could determine whether these individuals, compared with individuals who did not participate in the FFS, exhibited higher levels of AMU/AMR KAP, IPC and animal health seeking practices. Results of two-group t-tests comparing FFS participants (N = 26) with a random selection of non-FFS participants from the original study (N = 26) revealed that FFS participants were no more likely to have greater AMU knowledge, prudent attitudes and practices or animal health seeking practices (see Tables S5 to S7) . However, original KAP respondents who participated in the FFS did have significantly higher IPC scores. As such, we cannot rule out that some increases attributed to FFS participation were due to participants initially practicing better IPC. A second limitation, and related to biosecurity, is that most behavioural variables, including cleaning of drinkers and personal protective equipment, use of antimicrobials, and animal health seeking were largely limited to self-reported data. More objective measures of these behaviours, including enumerator observation, assessment of farm-records, passive collection of AMU data (e.g. discarding used bottles and packets in trash bins) and triangulation with records of agrovets and veterinarians would provide more robust assessments of the impact of the FFS intervention.",

            "text": "Our study results suggest several areas for future investigation. First, there is a need to longitudinally assess the on-farm impacts of FFS participation. The present assessment was conducted immediately after the FFS had concluded so we cannot ascertain the longer-term adoption of FFS lessons. Longitudinal assessments would permit a more sustained assessment of antimicrobial use, IPC, animal health-seeking, and farm profitability, the latter of which is likely the most important for sustained adoption of FFS principles. These studies would benefit from the inclusion of local veterinarians as assessors of FFS graduates. Existing tools, such as the ADKAR \u00ae tool, (standing for Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability and Reinforcement) could be used by local veterinarians to assess the barriers to adoption of FFS principles as well as providing a trust-building opportunity between farmer and veterinarian. 32 Results of these studies could provide robust evidence for the positive impacts of FFS, thereby increasing the likelihood that governments, development, and private partners invest in scaling-up FFS as a complex intervention to address AMR. Acquiring 'buy-in' from these partners will be critical as FFS represents a cost-intensive approach to agricultural extension, 33 and some combination of support from these partners and self-funding from FFS participants will be needed to ensure the FFS approach can be sustained and scaled up. Finally, the FFS curriculums should be expanded to emphasize AMR as a One Health issue, for example, through the inclusion of lessons relevant to AMU and AMR in public health. FFSs are well-suited to conveying complex causal relationships, such as those inherent in a One Health approach, due to their emphasis on critical appraisal of the interrelationships between people, their animals, and the environment. Farmer Field Schools as interventions to reduce AMR in agriculture who devoted several hours a week over an 8 month period. The authors would also like to thank the enumerators in Ghana and Kenya along with the Farmer Field School facilitators.",
