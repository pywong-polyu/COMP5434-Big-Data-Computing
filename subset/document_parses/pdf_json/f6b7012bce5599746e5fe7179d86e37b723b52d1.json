            "text": "The sudden lockdown measures imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (including social distancing, shielding, self-isolation, and travel restrictions) have affected many aspects of people's lives. Cross-sectional studies of diverse populations have documented the many consequences of lockdowns across the globe. These include reduced levels of physical activity [1, 2] , poorer diet [3] , and an increased prevalence of sleep problems [4] . Various psychosocial consequences of lockdown have also been reported, including higher rates of loneliness [5, 6] , less social cohesion (particularly in deprived communities) [7] , more mental health difficulties, and a decrease in psychological wellbeing [8] [9] [10] . Potentially positive consequences of lockdown have also been described; for instance, studies of adults in Egypt, India, and the US report a moderate increase in perceived social support during lockdown [11] [12] [13] . Older people, specifically those over the age of 75, carry the highest risk of mortality from COVID-19 [14] . Stricter home quarantine measures and attempts to shield those at greatest risk of severe illness during lockdown mean that older people are at a greater risk of social isolation, especially those who may already have limited contact with the outside world. Accordingly, this group could be particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially experiencing lockdown and its consequences on mental and physical health for a longer time and to a greater degree than others [15, 16] . On the other hand, there is emerging evidence from studies of European populations that compared with young and middle-aged adults, older people may be more resilient to some of the negative effects of lockdown: potentially experiencing fewer sleep problems [4] and mental health consequences [17] than their younger counterparts. However, the number of studies focusing on the experiences of older people is still limited and very few examine the broad range of potential psychosocial and behavioural consequences of lockdown for this population. A comprehensive assessment of these changes is important as they could have long lasting consequences for older people. Physical inactivity, poor sleep quality, social isolation, and low psychological wellbeing are variously associated with adverse outcomes in older age including cognitive decline, disease, and mortality risk [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . In addition, with only a few exceptions [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] studies into the consequences of lockdown measures have been cross-sectional, relying on participants' recollection of their prior states to infer how lockdown measures have affected change; objective evidence of changes in psychosocial and behavioural variables is currently limited.",

This information will also be of value in the case of any future pandemics. The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) provides a rare opportunity to examine changes in a range of psychosocial and behavioural variables longitudinally by comparing participant responses to the same questionnaires, which were completed before and during lockdown. Participant responses were mostly collected during the most recent wave of the LBC1936 study (2017-2019) and during two weeks of lockdown as part of the LBC1936 COVID-19 survey. At the time of lockdown in Scotland, LBC1936 participants were in their mid-eighties, an age at which (for most people) social contact is important for quality of life, happiness, mental stimulation, and for many who rely on others for caring duties [29] . Using these data, we were able to examine a range of psychosocial and behavioural variables that might be affected by the experience of national lockdown. With reference to variables identified in other studies on this topic, we specifically examine changes in physical activity, sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, loneliness, social support, and neighbourhood cohesion. We also tested for changes in subjective memory problems as this experience is common in older age [30] and closely linked with the other outcome variables in the study including loneliness [31] and psychological wellbeing [32] . We also test for correlations to explore whether these variables change in tandem. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect individuals differently; some people may cope well with the changes, whilst others may not. LBC1936 participants are richly-phenotyped individuals having completed five waves of assessments spanning 12 years. Using these data, we were able to examine whether participant characteristic including sex, living situation, occupational social class, childhood IQ, cognitive ability at age 82, years of education, history of depression or anxiety, and medical history were related to degree of change in psychosocial or behavioural variables during lockdown.",

Participants were considered eligible if they were currently registered with the study (note that this also includes participants who did not participate in the most recent wave of the LBC1936 study at mean age 82). The LBC1936 COVID-19 online questionnaire was designed to assess participants' knowledge and feelings about the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of lockdown measures on their lifestyle and health. It consisted of 145 questions including questionnaires administered at previous waves of the LBC1936 study. These repeat questionnaires assessed participants' experience of memory problems, loneliness, psychological wellbeing, social support, neighbourhood cohesion, physical activity, and sleep quality during lockdown. Participants who were unable to complete the questionnaire themselves could request that a welfare power of attorney, guardian, or nearest relative complete the survey on their behalf.

Age 11 IQ was derived from scores obtained from SMS1947 records and converted from Moray House Test scores to a standard IQ-type score (where mean = 100, SD = 15). Years of education and occupational social class were both recorded at Wave 1 of the study at mean age 70. Participants reported years of formal full-time education and their highest occupation before retirement. Occupations were then grouped into six occupational social class categories ranging from professional (coded as 1) to unskilled (coded as 5) following the Classifications of Occupations system [42] . For the main analysis, skilled manual and partly skilled manual categories were grouped together, as there were few participants in these categories (no participants were in the unskilled manual group). Most of the remaining covariates were assessed at Wave 5 of the study at mean age 82. At that wave, depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety and depression subtests [43] . Participants self-reported whether they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes or cardiovascular disease (CVD). Personality traits were measured with the 50-item International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) [44] , which has 10 items for each of the five factor model personality traits: emotional stability, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and intellect. We derived a measure of fluid cognitive ability \"gf\" using test scores on six non-verbal subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III U.K. (WAIS-III) [45] : Matrix Reasoning, Letter Number Sequencing, Block Design, Symbol Search, Digit Symbol, and Digit Span Backward. Factor scores representing gf were estimated using confirmatory factor analysis for all participants included in the analytical sample (with complete data on all other variables in the analysis; n = 137) using the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) method.

For mental wellbeing, neighbourhood cohesion, social support, subjective memory problems, and physical activity this was achieved using a latent change score modelling approach as described by McArdle and Hamagami [46] . Using this method, latent change between two time points (T2 change) can be estimated as part of a structural equation model. In each model, we additionally regressed T2 change on the score at T1 so that the change variable was independent of the participants' status at T1. We tested for associations with the covariate variables by regressing T2 change on each of the covariate variables in turn. The variables listed above were treated as continuous variables in the analysis. The remaining variables, sleep quality and loneliness, were assessed using single items with few response categories and were therefore not suited to latent change score analysis (it is possible to estimate a latent change scores using ordinal data; however, such models require more parameters to be estimated and are prone to convergence issues [47] , as was the case here). Instead, we used responses at T1 and T2 to calculate an ordinal change variable with three categories indicating whether the participant experienced an increase, no change, or a decrease in the outcome variable. We tested for associations using ordinal regression and including each covariate in turn while additionally controlling for status at T1. The proportional odds assumption that the odds ratio (OR) is equal at each threshold of the change variable was tested with the test of parallel lines. ",

We identified individual differences related to more positive or negative change in the outcome variables during lockdown.

This trend may have important implications for future cognitive and health trajectories of older adults.

It is possible that an increase in social support may help to alleviate some of the negative consequences of lockdown on older people's mental health.

In particular, the personality traits emotional stability, intellect, and extraversion were variously associated with more positive changes in wellbeing, neighbourhood cohesion, physical activity, or social support during lockdown. This finding corroborates some other reports. For instance, Kroencke et al. [59] found that the personality trait neuroticism (the opposite of emotional stability) was associated with higher levels of negative affect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants from the manual occupational class reported a greater increase in social support than participants from the professional occupational class. This result was unexpected as reports of low social support are more frequent among economically disadvantaged groups [60, 61] . However, this association remains to be explored in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting a history of cardiovascular disease was associated with more negative change in wellbeing and neighbourhood cohesion during lockdown. There is some evidence that cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19 [62] ; the more negative experience of participants with cardiovascular disease may therefore result from higher levels of concern or stricter social distancing measures in this group. Finally, living alone and symptoms of anxiety are typically associated with higher levels of loneliness; in line with some other reports [24, 63] , our results suggest that participants with these characteristics are at an even greater risk of becoming lonely during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, even in this sample, participants with certain characteristics (lower cognitive ability, more symptoms of anxiety, a history of CVD, and living alone) were more likely to experience negative changes during lockdown. Older people with these characteristics may especially benefit from additional support during the pandemic. Interventions to reduce loneliness, facilitate social connection, and create opportunities for physical activities could be beneficial. Efforts to support older people could also take personality differences into account, individuals with lower emotional stability, intellect, and extraversion may experience the challenges of lockdown more acutely than others.",

            "text": "We note several limitations of our study that should be taken into consideration. Firstly, owing to the novelty of the field and multiple significance tests carried out, this is an exploratory study; the results described indicate the relationships observed in the LBC1936 sample and identify hypotheses to be tested in further research. Many of the associations described in this study did not reach an FDR-corrected significance threshold. Therefore, our results might not generalise to the wider population of older people. Furthermore, we were only able to collect responses from participants with internet access and a certain level of technology proficiency. We found significantly higher levels of age 11 IQ, years of education, occupational class status, cognitive scores, and the personality traits emotional stability and intellect among those who took part in the online survey compared with those in the LBC1936 who did not. The LBC1936 sample is characterised by higher levels of healthiness, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic resources than the general population of older people in Scotland. Nevertheless, there is substantial variance in these variables in the LBC1936 sample. Studies using LBC1936 data have identified a range of genetic, health and fitness, psychosocial, and lifestyle variables associated with healthy ageing. These findings have been replicated in studies with other more diverse samples of older people [64] . Individuals from Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic populations, are not represented in this sample; this limitation is particularly relevant given that these populations have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 [65] . Although we were able to test for changes across a range of psychosocial and behavioural variables, additional outcomes of interest (assessed previously as part of the LBC1936 study) including diet quality and symptoms of anxiety or depression were not assessed as part of the LBC1936 COVID-19 survey and therefore could not be included as outcome variables in the study. Finally, because assessment occasions (before and during lockdown) were~2 years apart, it is possible that some changes were caused by the effects of ageing rather than lockdown measures. However, results from subsidiary analysis, testing for changes in physical activity or social support between earlier waves of the LBC1936 study, suggest that age-related changes are typically smaller than those documented in the present study.",

Our results illustrate some interdependence between psychosocial and health behaviour variables and their changes during lockdown. Individuals coping less well during this time may experience negative changes across multiple domains (e.g., mental wellbeing, loneliness, and memory problems). Our results also highlight that older people should not be viewed as a homogenous group in this context. Individual differences including cognitive ability, personality, living situation, and medical history predicted whether participants would experience more positive or negative changes during lockdown. In combination with findings from other studies with older people, this information could be used to identify and support those at highest risk in the case of further lockdowns.",
