Methods: Medical records of all reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive COVID-19 patients followed up in hospital and home isolation between 13 th of Mar 2020 and 12 th of May 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were from Kayseri Province, Turkey. Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and the factors associated with morbidity and mortality were analyzed. Results: Of all the patients, 773 (95.8%) were alive and 34 (4.24%) died. The fatality rate was 4.2%. There were differences between the age groups in terms of fatality rate (P<0.001). The fatality rate in patients above the age of 65 yr was significantly higher. The fatality rate in the male gender was 2.44 times higher (P<0.05). It was 1.104 times higher in advanced age (P<0.001) and 10.893 times higher in patients with at least one comorbid disease (P<0.05). Hypertension increased mortality by 3.635 times (P<0.05) and chronic pulmonary diseases by 2.926 times (P<0.05). Conclusion: Advanced age, male gender and accompanying chronic diseases have adverse effects on the course and severity of the disease and hospitalization. They also increased the rate and risk of mortality.",

Coronaviruses affect the upper and lower respiratory tracts of humans and animals and lead to the disease. COVID-19 has an incubation period of 14 days and patients are generally observed within 2-5 days after a con-tact (1, 2) . In China, while this period in 1,099 COVID-19 patients was stated as mean 4 days it was stated in another study that the symptoms developed within 11.5 days in 97.5% of the infected patients and 2.2 days in 2.5% (3, 4) . When the clinical spectrum of the disease is evaluated conditions that require mechanical ventilation such as respiratory failure, sepsis, septic shock and multiorgan failure can be observed as well as asymptomatic form. SARS-CoV-2 is basically transmitted by cough or sneeze generated droplets of the patients after a person touches the surface with these droplets as the agent contacts mucosa. While the transmission is mostly caused by the patients, asymptomatic cases also play a critical role in the transmission of the disease (5). All age groups are sensitive to COVID-19. Of the cases in China, 87% were in the age range from 30 to 79 yr. The probability of a severe course in the disease and mortality was higher in individuals of advanced age. The fatality rate was found 2.3% in all the cases, 8% in the age group between 70-79 and 14.8% in the age group above 80 yr (6) . Mortality increases and morbidity becomes severe with accompanying chronic diseases in COVID-19. In a study on 51 patients, the mean age for the incidence of the disease was 49 yr. Twenty two percent of the patients had comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease (7) . Oversell, 201 of the patients had chronic diseases and that course of the infection was more severe in these patients (8) . We aimed to reveal how chronic diseases, age and gender affected morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19.",

Throat or nasal swab samples were used for RT-PCR. Patients from all age groups were included. Records of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. Information about the comorbidities and process of the disease in patients was obtained from Public Health Management System (HSYS). As for comorbidities, histories of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, respiratory disease, hyperlipidemia, chronic renal diseases, cerebrovascular disease and malignancy were screened. Coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias were classified as cardiovascular diseases; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma were classified as chronic pulmonary diseases. All hospitalized patients had a national unique code, so there were no duplicates. Patients were divided into two groups as patients hospitalized and patients who were followed up at home. According to the hospitalization guideline published by the Ministry of Health, we considered \"Confusion or tachycardia (>125/min) or respiratory distress or tachypnea (>22/min) or hypotension (<90/60 mmHg) or SPO2<93% or bilateral pneumonia findings on computed tomography (CT) or posterior anterior chest x-ray or blood lymphocyte count <800/\u03bcl or serum CRP>40 mg/l or ferritin>500 ng/ml or D-Dimer>100 ng/m\". If patients had one of this findings or symptoms at the first admission, they were hospitalized. Patients who were not hospitalized were quarantined and followed up at home. The study variables were as follows: gender, age, outcome (including death or survival), type of comorbidity, and the result of RT-PCR tests. The approval of the Erciyes University Medical Faculty Ethics Committee was obtained (Date: 08.07.2020; Decision No: 2020/362) and additionally, Turkish Ministry of Health approval was obtained on 19 th of May 2020 for this study as required.",

The clinical characteristics, fatality rate and case fatality rate (CFR) of patients are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The median age of patients was 39 [0-96] and the highest number of patients was in the age range between 20 and 60 yr. Percentage of male patients was 50.3%. The age group above 65 yr had the highest fatality rate among the age groups (P: 0.001). The fatality rate in men (n=21; 5.2%) was higher, but there was no statistically significant difference. Median value of the number of chronic diseases in all patients was 0 [0-6]. There were 36.8% patients with at least one chronic disease. Fatality rate in patients with chronic disease was 11.1% (n=33) (P: 0.001). While fatality rate was 66.7%in patients with 6 chronic diseases as comorbidities it was 0.2% in patients without any comorbidities (P: 0.001). As it is shown in Table  2 , cerebrovascular disease, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes were the diagnoses with statistically significantly highest case fatality rates (66.7%, 27.3%, 21.7%, and 15.5% respectively). Fatality rate of patients who were hospitalized was higher than that of patients who were followed up at home (P: 0.001).Of all the patients, 514 (63.7%) patients were hospitalized. Out of these 514 patients, 91.6% received inpatient treatment, 9 (1.8%) patients were followed up in intensive care unit and 6 (1.2%) were intubated and 34 (6.6%) patients died. Age ranges of hospitalized patients and patients who were followed up at home were similar as shown in Table 3 (P: 0.188). Out of 34 patients who died, 33 (97.1%) had at least one comorbidity (P:0.001). However, hospitalization status of patients with chronic disease was similar (P: 0.376). As in Table 3 , patients diagnosed with hypertension were hospitalized more (P:0.025). Hospitalization status of the patients with other chronic diseases was similar. However, patients with CVH, chronic renal disease and coroner disease were hospitalized more. The control RT-PCR positive of the patients followed in the hospital was more than those followed at home (41.8% vs. 27.3%) (P: 0.001).",

In our study, male gender significantly increased mortality (OR=2.44, 95% CI: 1.09-5.97). This rate may be lower in women due to sex hormones and X chromosome known to play role in innate and acquired immunity system. Moreover, according tothe studies performed in China, ACE2 expression is more dominant in smokers and smoking is more common among men compared to women, which explains the higher rate in men (14, 15 In the results of our study, the risk of mortality was significantly higher in hypertension, chronic respiratory tract diseases and cancer (16) .",

Social distancing was an important tool in decreasing infections and mortality during previous pandemics and its effect against COVID-19 in China is obvious (17) (18) (19) .
