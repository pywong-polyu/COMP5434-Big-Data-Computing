Materials and methods: Patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR, admitted to ICU between March and April 2020 were enrolled. At ICU admission, BALF were analyzed by flow cytometry. Univariate, multivariate and Spearman correlation analyses were performed. Results: Sixty-four patients were enrolled, median age of 64 years (IQR 58-69). The majority cells in the BALF were neutrophils (70%, IQR 37.5-90.5) and macrophages (27%, IQR 7-49) while a minority were lymphocytes, 1%, TCD3+ 92% (IQR 82-95). The ICU mortality was 32.8%. Non-survivors had a significantly older age (p = 0.033) and peripheral lymphocytes (p = 0.012) were lower compared to the survivors. At multivariate analysis the percentage of macrophages in the BALF correlated with poor outcome (OR 1.336, CI95% 1.014-1.759, p = 0.039).",

The spectrum of clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vast, ranging from asymptomatic or patients with few symptoms to complication of severe viral pneumonia with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1] [2] [3] [4] . An excessive inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death and is associated with high levels of circulating cytokines, severe lymphopenia and mononuclear cell lung infiltration [5] . There are two distinct but potentially overlapping pathological subsets [6] , the first driven by the virus and the second by the host response. In the pulmonary disease, viral multiplication and inflammation in the lung is prevalent.",

Sample volume was noted including appearance, colour and possible contamination with peripheral blood. BALF samples were then filtered through a 70 \u03bcm nylon Cell Strainer filters (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, United States) and then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 7 min. The resulting cell pellet was incubated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in BD TruCount\u2122 tubes for 15 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by the addition of FACS Lysing Solution for 15 min at room temperature. The working panel of mAbs at eight colour assays used for the lymphocyte and monocyte evaluation in BAL samples were the following: CD3 FITC/HLA-DR PE/CD4 PerCP-Cy5.5/CD56 PE-Cy7/CD19 APC/CD8 APCH7/CD15 H450/ CD45 VH500 (BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA), CD66b FITC/HLA-DR PE/CD3 PerCP-Cy5.5/CD33 PE-Cy7/CD14 APC/CD16 APCH7/CD38 VH450/CD45 VH500 (BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA).

Before acquisition, instrument sensitivity was evaluated and monitored over time using the BDTM Cytometer Setting &Tracking system. In order to achieve consistent and comparable data over time, all the BD FACSCanto II cytometers were standardized using BD CS&T beads, creating an Application Setting and defining Target Values (TG).

Categorical variables were compared by the Chi-square test. The Pearson or Spearman correlation analysis was performed to show the correlation between clinical parameters and COVID-19 progression. To verify if there are some immunological aspects which may predict prognosis and distinguish between survivors and non survivors, demographic, clinical variables and laboratory values were tested for their association by means of univariate analysis. To assess the differences between groups, univariate logistic regression analysis with group of treatment as binary dependent variable was adopted. A multivariable regression model was made, with ICU-mortality as dependent variable. Variables were selected to be included in the multivariable model when a P < 0.10 was found in the univariable analysis. In addition, the following variables were chosen a priori to be included in the model because of their clinical relevance: age, sex, days from the onset of symptoms to ICU admission, interstitial pattern at chest radiography, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, TCD4+/TCD8+ ratio, neutrophils %, macrophages %. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. P value \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant.

Indeed, in the CALL score one of the four considered parameters is LDH and this appears to be a simple and accurate model for the prediction of COVID-19 progression to severe cases [27, 28] . This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the duration of mechanical ventilation is inversely correlated with percentage of TCD8+ but shows positive correlation with BALF TCD4+/TCD8+ ratio. Overall the present data suggest that in the second phase COVID-19 with lung viral infection in the lungs there is a relative lack of lymphocytes, in BALF that reflects lymphocyte depletion in the lung [7] , with decreased immune responses to control virus replication.",
