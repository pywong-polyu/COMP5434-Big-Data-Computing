Our objective was to examine the association of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, BDNF, and GDNF levels between postmortem plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain tissue in a heterogeneous diagnostic subject groups including normal controls, mood disorders only, mood disorders with AUD/SUD (alcohol abuse disorder, substance abuse disorder), and AUD/SUD without mood disorders. To address these questions we collected postmortem plasma (n = 29), CSF (n = 28), and brain (BA10) (n = 57) samples from individuals with mood disorder, mood disorder with AUD/SUD, AUD/SUD and normal controls. These samples were analyzed using a multiplex based luminex assay with a customized 4-plex cytokine/interleukins-IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, BDNF, and GDNF human acute phase based on xMAP technology platform. Protein levels were determined using a Luminex 200 instrument equipped with Xponent-analyzing software. We observed IL-6 (p = 2.1e-07), and GDNF (p = 0.046) were significantly correlated between brain and CSF. In addition, IL-6 (p = 0.031), were significantly correlated between brain and plasma. Overall diagnostic group analysis showed a significant difference with brain GDNF, p = 0.0106. Pairwise comparisons showed that GDNF level is-39.9 \u00b1 12 pg/ml, p = 0.0106, was significantly higher than in the brains derived from mood disorders compared to normal controls, -23.8 \u00b1 5.5 pg/ml, p = 0.034. Brain BDNF was higher in suicide (p = 0.0023), males compared to females (p = 0.017), and psychiatric medication treated vs. nontreated (p = 0.005) individuals. Overall, we demonstrate that blood IL-6, GDNF and BDNF could be informative peripheral biomarkers of brain biology associated with mood disorders, substance disorders, and suicide.",

Two areas of growing interest are the inflammation/interleukin and cell growth/neurotrophic factor cellular function pathways. Neurotrophic factors are involved in cellular proliferation, migration, differentiation, neuronal survival, as well as functional and structural maintenance of neurons in the adult brain 1,2 . Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) are crucial brain signaling proteins whose deficiency in key neural pathways has been associated with the development of psychiatric disorders 1, 3 . BDNF and GDNF have also been postulated to have a role in alcohol dependence, withdrawal and regulation of alcohol consumption [2] [3] [4] .",

Meta-analyses for MDD, schizophrenia, and BD all found elevated blood levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 8, 12, 13 . Another meta-analyses found elevated blood levels of IL-6 in MDD 14 . An abnormality in interleukins may also be associated with suicidal behavior and this observation is supported by a study from Tonelli et al. 10 . They found increased mRNA expression of IL-4 and IL-3 in the PFC (prefrontal cortex) of women and IL-13 in men who died by suicide compared with normal control subjects 10 . Janelidze et al. determined the levels of interleukins in plasma of suicidal and non-suicidal depressed patients and found that the levels of proinflammatory interleukins IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly higher in suicide attempters compared with non-suicidal depressed patients 15 . A qualitative review of inflammatory changes associated with suicidal behavior reported that IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 and BDNF were the most commonly altered inflammatory makers 10, 16 . The peripheral findings can arise from local production in the central nervous system (CNS) or translocation across the BBB from the periphery [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

Moreover this study reports the alteration in the levels of interleukins and neurotrophic factors across periphery and CNS between Mood disorder, mood disorder with AUD/SUD, compared to control subjects. Also we report in the study the differential levels of interleukins and neurotrophins based on gender, suicidal vs. non-suicidal and psychiatric medications across periphery and CNS. Figure 5 , depicts the details and the overview of the study, based on our major findings to understand the interlink between CNS and periphery in individual subjects which supports a psychoneuroimmunological understanding of mental illness pathology. Graphical illustration of main top-down, CNS-Brain/CSF to periphery and bottom-up (periphery to CNS) communication pathways through the receptors and summary of peripheral and central pathology through interleukins-IL-6 and Il-1\u03b2 and neurotrophins, BDNF and GDNF. However the increased permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB) in depression is high enough to let the neurotrophic factors and interleukins through specific receptors passing through BBB. The interleukins and neurotrophins produced in the periphery might pass through the dysregulated BBB into the CNS. Also, altered levels of IL-6 and GDNF in CSF and brain might be, at least partially, due to the restorative effect to the dysregulated BBB function. The present study is novel to the literature depict the role of interleukins in periphery and CNS in the same participants. Whenever using blood interleukins or neurotrophins to understand the biology of mental illness, the question arises if the results reflects what's occurring in the brain? BDNF in rodents has been studied and authors reported a correlation between brain and periphery 22 . But there is no direct study of brain and blood in humans. First we looked at this question by determining if there was a correlation of interleukins and neurotrophins levels between brain, CSF and plasma. To our knowledge the relationship between brain-CSF and plasma has never been directly shown in humans. Here we report for the first time the relationship between IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, BDNF, and GDNF from periphery to CNS using plasma, CSF and human postmortem brain. In the total sample we found IL-6, BDNF, and GDNF were significantly correlated between brain and CSF. IL-6, BDNF, and GDNF were also correlated between brain and plasma. Analyses from the, brain, CSF and plasma were from the same subjects, revealed a strong IL-6 correlation between brain-CSF-plasma. Surprisingly in this subgroup we also saw a significant correlation between brain IL-1\u03b2 and plasma IL-1\u03b2 which was not seen when all subjects were studied together.",

            "text": "These correlation findings may arise from a normal physiological peripheral-CNS relationship or a consequence of the breakdown of the BBB after death. Past research has demonstrated that regulated interleukins pass the BBB 23, 24 . However the role of neurotrophins still remains unclear. GDNF is reported to not pass the BBB 23 . With BDNF there are reports demonstrating passage and others that show it cannot pass the BBB [22] [23] [24] [25] . Based on these reports one would expect there to be differential levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, BDNF, and GDNF between the brain, CSF and plasma. Which is what we find with our data. Suggesting the BBB was present and our findings are not an artifact of necrotic tissue. GDNF is expressed abundantly throughout the brain, it is known to play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of glial cells, serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons 1, 4, 26 ; it also regulates noradrenergic and GABAergic pathways. GDNF is also known to protect both neurons and glia cells against oxidative stress 27 . Upregulation of GDNF by astrocytes and microglia may be a protective mechanism to restrain neuronal loss observed in different types of brain diseases. Here we observed GDNF level was significantly greater than NC in the mood disorders group. Prior studies have looked at GDNF in serum and found the level varies between different psychiatric diagnoses. Higher levels are reported in mood disorders, AUD and ADHD 26,28-31 . Zhang et al. did not find any effect of medication in GDNF levels 32 . Conversely, data from in vitro studies demonstrate increased levels of GDNF in the presence of antidepressants and mood stabilizing agents 1, 4, 27 . The majority of individuals were on certain psychiatric medications including mood stabilizers and antidepressants. With the number of individuals used in this study we are not able to parse out what influence if any medication treatment had on our result.",

We show the brain level of GDNF is higher for the subjects with a mood disorder compared to the control group and brain BDNF is higher in the treated groups. Although there is no direct evidence to prove inverse correlation in the levels of GDNF from brain to periphery. However the increased permeability of BBB in depression is high enough to let the GDNF passing through BBB. It might result from that the GDNF produced in the periphery would pass through the dysregulated BBB into the CNS to repair the impaired neurons in patients with depression. Also, the altered levels of GDNF in CSF might be, at least partially, due to the restorative effect of the GDNF to the dysregulated BBB function. The present study is novel to the literature to demonstrate the role of disease marker of peripheral and CNS levels of GDNF in depression and MDD and its role with antidepressant treatment. Hence, the interaction between dysregulation of BBB and neurotrophic levels of GDNF might play a role in the pathogenesis of depression. Together these findings indicate that increased GDNF could be a compensatory response that might appear in some MDD subjects. However, there are some limitations in our study. All subjects with a psychiatric diagnosis that are investigated in this study were receiving pharmacotreatment (mood stabilizing agents, antipsychotics, and/or antidepressants) and it is not possible to exclude the effect of drugs on the levels of interleukins and neurotrophic factors. The other limitation is that the mood disorders groups had individuals who had either major depression or BD. So the finding is not specific to a single psychiatric disorder. The overall number of subjects and also the findings of these changes in the levels of these inflammatory markers from the same individual's plasma, CSF and postmortem brain subjects included in the present study and the strict inclusion criteria must be considered strengths of our work, we have considered co-variates such as RIN, pH, and PMI for the postmortem brain subjects.",
