It was found that similar emerging epidemic scenarios would occur in the cities of Wenzhou, Guangzhou, Dongguan, or Shenzhen, with a wider disease transmission. We also used the matrix to determine that cities in Henan province, Anhui province, and Municipalities (such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing) have a high risk level of disease carriers after the outbreak due to a high influx or outflow of people.

In addition, inadequate criteria for early outbreaks may have contributed to some of the errors in the number of people diagnosed, and therefore, further research is needed.
