In particular, it was reported that in the case of low-income families, the socioeconomic inequity of minority adolescents resulting from differences in income, medical insurance, and education levels accumulated from childhood negatively affect their quality of life and health status as adults [2] [3] [4] . Adolescent health is shaped by the interaction of social determinants of health as well as risk and protective factors affecting health behavior [5] . Family socioeconomic status (SES) has long been identified as a strong determinant of adolescent health, and groups with low family SES generally exhibit lower health status, such as poor mental health and reduced wellbeing [6, 7] . On the other hand, family SES tends to have less influence on health among adolescents than for other age groups [7] ; hence, there is a lack of clarity regarding the relationship between family SES and adolescent health.",

Adolescence represents the transition to adulthood from childhood, and because physical, mental, and physiological growth and development take place actively, the balance of nutritional intake is essential for proper growth. As the dietary habits of adolescents are directly related to health problems, such as various diseases and obesity, even after they become adults, it is necessary to pay attention so that adolescents can have a healthy diet habit [15] . In particular, having breakfast in adolescence is among the health behaviors considered to be essential because it is necessary for performing learning activities and for maintaining health status; breakfast-eating is the driving force behind everyday life [16] . Adolescents' breakfast intake was found to be related to the economic level of households, which is one of the social determinants of health, and the rate of skipping breakfast was found to be high among low-income families [17, 18] .",

Notably, it was found that adolescents' perceptions of SES become more strongly linked to their subjective health [23] as adolescents are expected to become more aware of and responsive to social hierarchies [24] . However, the role of important health behaviors or statuses, such as the frequency of eating breakfast and perceived stress level, in the relationship between subjective health status and household SES has not been clearly determined. Therefore, this study examined the direct effects of subjective SES on the subjective health status of multicultural households with adolescents; we also examined the causal relationship between dietary behavior and perceived stress on subjective health status.

In April 2019, the 15th Youth Health Behavior Survey was conducted with 60,100 students (response rate: 95.3%) from 800 schools in 17 cities and provinces. The cities and schools were determined through population stratification, sample distribution, and sampling. The sample comprised multicultural adolescents, defined as those whose parents' nationalities were not South Korean; 500 of the 57,303 participants in the survey were classified as middle school students from multicultural families.

Nearly half of the respondents were male (47.6%), and approximately one-half (48.0%) were from suburban areas. The majority of the adolescents' living arrangements were family cohabitation (96.0%).

First, the index of the SES perceived by multicultural adolescents is a single item that represents the household's economic level, and there is a limitation in reflecting the sociocultural and environmental characteristics of adolescents (family possessions, social capital, institutions, and policies). Future studies should move beyond a single question about economic indicators and include composite factors including parents' occupation, educational level, parental income level, support for vulnerable groups, sociocultural indicators such as the frequency of participation in leisure activities, and the subjective social status of adolescents (i.e., adolescents' social position within their school and peer group) [43] , which need to be represented by an integrated score. Second, due to data limitations, interpersonal and community determinants (i.e., parental rearing attitude and poverty level in the residential area) could not be included among the social determinants of adolescents. If these measurements were analyzed as moderating factors, more important implications could have been determined.",

This study focused on the effects of subjective SES on adolescents' stress and health behaviors such as breakfast intake. Since relative SES may be regarded as a personal or subjective factor, it is suggested to combine an objective index for measuring SES. It should also be noted that psychosocial factors are formed by individual cognitive and perceived processes; thus, efforts to reduce socioeconomic health inequity should not be resolved only by individual care or treatment but through the integration of social, environmental, and policy alternatives. Additionally, since this is a cross-sectional study, a clear analysis of the causal relationship is necessary through longitudinal studies between subjective composite SES and health behavior and subjective health status. Additionally, health status according to SES may differ according to interaction with gender. In previous studies, dietary habits [44] , stress [45] , and subjective health [46] had different levels according to gender, and future studies could identify the mechanisms behind gender-specific determinants.",

Due to the pandemic, prolonged school closures and parental unemployment have been reported as threats to adolescents' health [47] . The number of children skipping meals is increasing due to the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic [48] , especially among adolescents of minority ethnic families, who constituted a high proportion [49] . To address this health inequity, an institutional foundation is needed to ensure universal health coverage from a holistic perspective (considering the whole life process), including the socioeconomic environment of vulnerable children and adolescents. It is also necessary to develop health promotion policies and programs to alleviate the fundamental social and economic inequity faced by vulnerable groups such as low-income multicultural adolescents.",
