            "text": "Open access in older age should not be defined henceforth by the absence of disease. Indeed, many older people suffer one or more health conditions, which, if well controlled, may have little impact on their well-being. 7 The WHO defines healthy ageing as \"the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables wellbeing in older age\", that is, that enables to continue to perform things that are important to them. 7 8 Functional ability is made up of the intrinsic capacity of the older individual, environmental characteristics and the interaction between them. Intrinsic capacity is defined as the composite of all the physical and mental capacities that a person can draw on to function in life. 7 The environment characteristics represent all the resources or barriers that will determine whether a person can engage in activities or not. 7 As represented in figure 1 (adapted from the Healthy Ageing concept), the WHO distinguishes five categories of abilities that enable people to be and do what they have reason to value: to meet basic needs, to learn, grow and make decisions, to be mobile, to build and maintain relationships and to contribute to society. 9 This redefinition of the concept places older person and its environments at the heart of the approach; opening huge perspectives in terms of prevention and levers of action, but also entailing major evolutions of the current systems. Programmes aiming at promoting and fostering healthy ageing have to be global, multidomain and interdisciplinary and to target intrinsic capacity as well as the environments to maximise functional ability of all. 7 10 This comprehensive approach gives larger opportunities of areas for action; each factor representing potential levers of intervention to favour healthy ageing: (1) social and psycho-social factors (loneliness, self-esteem, social network, social support\u2026), (2) environmental factors (living conditions, assistive technologies, access to transports, services and facilities, home adaptations to the limitations\u2026), (3) organisational (healthcare organisation and social welfare system) and (4) societal factors (representations of older persons perceived either as a burden or as a resource for our societies, ageism stereotypes, age-friendly communities\u2026). To do so, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are opening new perspectives in the issues of prevention (exercise training programme, cognitive stimulation activities, improved adherence to treatment\u2026), detection (falls, pain, cognitive decline\u2026), surveillance (personal emergency response systems, monitoring of patients with depression, chronic illnesses, dementia, cancer\u2026), home care well-being (assistive technologies to maintain older peoples' independence, communication tools such as assistive robots for socialisation to reduce isolation and to increase social participation) and eHealth (tracking in real-time the health condition of the person and provide feedback and support from distant facilities) for the elderly population. [11] [12] [13] [14] ICT represent promising lever of action on psychosocial, environmental and even organisational factors, although not so-easily implementable in the current elderly population, still far from ICT tools. These latter could have a crucial role to play in healthy ageing programmes. In the last 20 years, the number of technological innovations, devices, robots and platforms for the older population have dramatically increased. Yet, the large majority of them failed to prove their effectiveness due to a lack of high-quality studies or worse, to an absence of evaluation. 15 Therefore, paradoxically, the impact of ICT on healthy ageing has been rarely formally demonstrated whereas the perspectives offered by these technologies are huge, if appropriate and relevant. 16 17 Finally, to meet the challenges of ageing, individual and collective priority is clearly ageing in place. Ageing in place is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as \"the ability to live in one's own home and community safely, independently, and comfortably, regardless of age, income, or ability level\". 18 It is clearly the aspiration and desire of most of older people but has also become the priority goal of all ageing policies.",

For the first axis, nine services are proposed: transportation, shopping, housework, digital and administrative support, animals, visits, care and well-being (hairdresser, beauty care, relaxation\u2026). In addition, BeeVA also proposes several options to facilitate daily life such as an easy-to use digital calendar (with appointment reminders), video call, weather forecast, radio, emergency numbers, serious games, family pictures and City news. BeeVA has been designed to reduce apprehension and fears about technology usage and consequently digital divide in the elderly population. Two pilot studies, conducted on subsamples of elderly users aimed at working on both, the choice of the future services that will be provided by the platform according to the needs reported by the elders interviewed and on the choice of the device and its evolutions. The first one conducted on 53 elders (60-83 years) in experimental situation, aimed at testing the SoBeezy voice assistant in two specific tasks: answering questions and vocal expression of demand by elders. The second, closer to the real life utilisation of the device (with BeeVA installed at home of 18 elderly persons living at home (11 women, 7 men), aged on average 76 years old and followed-up 5 weeks with three qualitative and quantitative evaluations). These studies showed good acceptability and ease of use and three profiles of users have been identified: (1) curious and dynamic individuals rapidly autonomous in the utilisation of the voice assistant (seven persons), (2) persons with initial apprehension to use the device (mainly due to a lack of self-confidence) who required stronger technical support at the beginning, but managed to use the device after 1 week of utilisation (seven persons); (3) three individuals with mild cognitive impairment and one with illiteracy have needed substantial support to manage to use the device.",

            "text": "Loneliness and social isolation are now recognised as a real scourge of modern life, which grows at an impressive pace in modern societies. Now identified as major social cohesion and public health concerns, policymakers start to take up this issue. In 2018, the United Kingdom has appointed a minister for loneliness and constituted a cross-governmental group to create policies to address the growing problem, which affects 9 million Britons, that is, 14% of the population. 21 The other industrialised societies are not spared. In France, we estimated that more than 5.5 million French people are affected. Among the most vulnerable, the elderly and those living with disabilities, the prevalence is much higher. With ageing, the likelihood of losing close family and friends increases, whereas the chance of meeting new people decreases. In addition, mobility restrictions limit the ability to get out of the house, to participate and to be engaged in activities. Among those aged 75 and older, 1.5 million of French people would suffer from loneliness and 300 000 would be in a situation of social death (ie, without any family, friendship, or neighbourhood contact). 22 23 Besides the problems of poorer quality of life, having no one to talk to or share thoughts and experiences with, can be as damaging to health as well known risk factors such as smoking, sedentary lifestyle or obesity. 24 Indeed, people suffering from loneliness are more likely to present behavioural and lifestyle risk factors (sedentary lifestyle, poor eating, smoking and alcohol consumption, Open access withdrawal\u2026), 25 26 increased risk of chronic diseases (depression, anxiety, cardiovascular, Alzheimer's disease \u2026), [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] activity limitation in daily living 32 and premature death. 31 33-35 A recent review of the literature showed that a poor social network was associated with an increased risk of 29% of coronary heart disease (95% CI 1.04 to 1.59) and of 32% of stroke (IC95% 1.04 to 1.68), 28 while JAMA published in 2017 an article entitled \"Loneliness might be a killer, but what is the best way to protect against it?\". 33 To tackle loneliness, SoBeezy proposes to target as a priority, older people living alone and/or suffering from loneliness. This screening is achievable thanks to the involvement of the frontline actors in the management of the elderly population: social services of the Municipality, general practitioners, pharmacists, nurses, physiotherapists, dentists, home care services and all relevant local partners, such as associations. To tackle loneliness, SoBeezy provides specific services such as visits at home by citizens or trained volunteers from associations. Another less direct and probably less stigmatising way to combat loneliness is the experiences and activities sharing component of the SoBeezy programme. Finally, being personally involved for other people into the system and belonging to the SoBeezy community should also contribute to prevent and lower loneliness and isolation.",

[36] [37] [38] [39] [40] In the MacArthur Study of Successful Ageing study, feeling of worthlessness was associated with greater risk of all studied outcomes: mobility restriction (OR=3.08 CI 1.35 to 7.07), limitation in basic ADL (OR=2.65, CI 1.05 to 6.68) and death (OR=3.13, CI 1.43 to 6.84), independently of many confounders. 36 In addition, people suffering from worthlessness are also more likely to have unhealthy behaviours (sedentary, tobacco and alcohol consumption, withdrawal and reduced social participation). 41 42 Several studies suggest that giving to everyone the opportunity to feel useful, even modestly, could have substantial benefits in terms of quality of life, autonomy and to remain at home longer. 41 42 The SoBeezy programme provides opportunities to everyone to get involved for other people, even though simple contribution such as an empathetic ear or occasionally giving a hand to solve a material problem.

This team is composed of employees of the SoBeezy system, local volunteers involved in the SoBeezy organisation and finally of members of the SoBeezy community registered on the platform for digital training. Therefore, the easy-to-use BeeVA represents a real strength of the system compared with the other social support platforms that failed to reach the most vulnerable ones of our society, mainly digitally excluded.",

The three sites were selected for their diversity in terms of size of the population (from 6700 to 62 000 inhabitants), territory size (from 19 to 100 km\u00b2), population density (from 670 to 1600 inhabitants/km\u00b2), rural/urban areas, medical and paramedical demography, access to services and digital coverage. In total, 66 800 inhabitants of these three cities are aged 18 years and older and represent potential users of the platform (beneficiaries and/or contributors). With an acceptation rate depending on age category (5% in the 18%-59% and 10% in the 60 and over), we estimate that globally 7% of the adult population will use the system, that is, 4700 subjects. Among them, around 2200 will be aged 60 years and older (ie, 47% of the users), among whom one third lives with digital divide (ie, non-user of a smartphone, digital tablet or computer) according to the recent data for France. 52 These older persons will be equipped with the BeeVA, that is, around 750 elderly subjects. All BeeVA users will be also equipped with an internet connection (when necessary), with enhanced human support and training. The users will be approached through large public communication campaigns and focused campaigns on specific targets (older persons, isolated individuals, frail\u2026), as well as with the support of social services, medical and care services and local associations. The SoBeezy intervention mainly targets psycho-socioeconomic precariousness (PSEP) which is characterised by an accumulation of 'weakening' factors, such as loneliness, financial insecurity, lack of social support, digital divide\u2026 that is associated to a higher risk of deleterious outcomes, such as mortality 56 57 or cognitive decline. 58 59 However, in addition to this group at higher risk, we also hypothesise that this intervention will benefit to the nonprecarious elderly, according to other levers of action, such as feeling of utility, self-esteem, the meaning given to one's actions, social support perceived when necessary or even participation in the City's life.",

The older subjects, all living in the community, will be invited to participate to the experimentation through large public communication campaigns and focused campaigns on specific targets (older persons, isolated individuals, frail subjects\u2026). Identification, recruitment and support of potential beneficiaries of the programme will also be conducted by local partners such as well as local social, medical and care services and local associations. The experimentation will start as soon as the sanitary COVID-19 situation will allow it, for a period of one year. As details below, a sample of older individuals has been involved all along the design process of the programme. 2. How were the research question(s) developed and informed by their priorities, experience, and preferences? The research questions explored in this study have been based on -The challenging current context of ageing for all societies worldwide and the necessity to foster healthy ageing, -The fact that loneliness and social isolation are now recognised as a real scourge of modern life, which grows at an impressive pace in modern societies, with significant impact on well-being and ageing, -The Healthy ageing concept proposed by the WHO which focuses on functional ability, intrinsic capacity and environments, -The development of a concrete interventional public health programme (SoBeezy) to promote healthy ageing, -The 30-year experience in epidemiological cohorts on ageing of our research team. 3. How was public involved in? A subsample of older persons has been associated at the very beginning of the SoBeezy programme. These elders have been associated to the technological choices, particularly in the selection of the device (voice assistant with a screen) and also participated to the testing phase of the prototypes. In addition, they also participated to the structural choices of the platform (identification of the main needs of the elderly population in daily life, selection of the services proposed by the platform, formulation of the services on the digital platform\u2026). However, they have not been associated to the choice of the outcome measures of the experimentation; these choices being based on the data collected on more than 14 000 elderly people living in the community, participants in population-based cohorts on ageing conducted by our research team for more than 30 years. Regarding recruitment to the study, two main approaches will be conducted: public communication campaigns (with also targeted campaign on specific populations) and the involvement of our local partners including Municipality (elderly population Department) and associations of older persons. These partnerships will also be used to work on the methods and plans for dissemination of the results. Results will be disseminated through scientific communications (articles and congress), public conferences, media and also specific communication to the participants to the programme (specific articles, conferences\u2026).",
