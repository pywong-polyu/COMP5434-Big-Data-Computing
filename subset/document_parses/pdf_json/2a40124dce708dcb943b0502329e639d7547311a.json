Twelve additional studies examined mixed diagnosis populations including a large RCT. Across these studies, a number examined implementations to specific populations, with a large number, particularly PTSD studies, conducted with veterans or military personnel, and others focusing on populations with difficulties attending clinic settings in person, including people with difficulties leaving the home, people living in rural or remote areas, prison inmates, and geographically dispersed members of migrant populations. Less than half of studies were conducted within the person's home/residence, with many especially older studies, involving visiting a local clinic using telehealth equipment to connect with a therapist in a different location. The types of technology used for videoconferencing included dedicated telemedicine hardware, analogue videophones, and, increasingly, using Internet-based videoconferencing software on computers or smartphones.

Both conditions showed significant posttreatment improvements on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) as the primary outcome, and non-inferiority analyses showed videoconferencing was non-inferior at midtreatment and 12-week follow-up, but not immediately post-therapy. Egede et al. (2015) obtained more conclusive results in a larger non-inferiority trial with 241 older veterans with major depression. Comparing videoconferencing delivery using a videophone system with in-person delivery, non-inferiority was established with no significant differences observed in trajectories of improvement on the BDI and Geriatric Depression Scale, with rates of recovery similar between conditions. Smaller studies have additionally demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of delivering CBT-based therapies via videoconferencing to specific populations such as women with post-partum depression or anxiety (Yang et al., 2019) and Korean migrants with depression (Jang et al., 2014) . Among other notable studies, Scogin et al. (2018) conducted a small RCT of a 10-session CBT-based treatment for comorbid depression and insomnia delivered via Skype, which found superiority over usual care on a measure of insomnia, but not the HRSD. Finally, in treating self-harm, Sayal et al. (2019) commenced a small RCT (N = 22) of problem-solving therapy for young adults following presentation for self-harm and mild depression. However, this was discontinued due to recruitment difficulties (an analysis of which did not attribute these to the use of videoconferencing).",

(2018) reported on a standard 16-week CBT treatment for their 10 OCD patients. Symptom reduction pre-post treatment, strong therapeutic alliance, high rates of satisfaction with treatment, and 100% retention, supported the effectiveness and feasibility of the intervention. Further, two studies (Goetter, Herbert, Forman, Yuen, & Thomas, 2014; Vogel et al., 2014) successfully used exposure and response prevention (ERP) to treat OCD via videoconferencing, with post-treatment symptom reductions. Vogel et al. (2014) noted high engagement with treatment, an ability to observe exposure exercises as they occur in participants' natural environments, and an opportunity to involve family members and carers, thus addressing family accommodation to rituals where appropriate.",

(2015) reported lower satisfaction ratings primarily related to negative experiences of the clinic setting that was attended for videoconferencing (also used in the in-person condition), suggesting specificity to the potentially impersonal experience of attending a clinic for a video-based appointment. Conversely, found that housebound people with depression receiving in-home therapy via videoconferencing were more satisfied than those being visited by a therapist.

Among qualitative client reports, a period of early discomfort and adaptation to using videoconferencing technology was also an experience reported by participants across studies Dunstan & Tooth, 2012; Fitt & Rees, 2012; Germain et al., 2009; Lichstein et al., 2013; Simpson et al., 2005 Simpson et al., , 2006 Simpson et al., 2015; Yuen et al., 2015) . For some participants, attitudes towards videoconferencing (including scepticism, anxiety, unfamiliarity) were linked to the experiences of discomfort in early sessions (Arnaet, Klooster, & Chow, 2007; Fitt & Rees, 2012; Simpson et al., 2005 Simpson et al., , 2006 . For most, this early discomfort was reduced over time, as participants got more comfortable with the technology Dunstan & Tooth, 2012; Simpson et al., 2005 Simpson et al., , 2006 Simpson et al., 2015) or their interactions with their therapist became more 'natural' (Yuen et al., 2015) , although this did not always occur Choi et al., 2013; Lichstein et al., 2013; Simpson et al., 2005) . Therapists reported similar experiences of initial apprehension and discomfort, before becoming more confident in using videoconferencing technology and adapting to the modality (Dunstan & Tooth, 2012; Michell et al., 2008) . This is balanced by other reports of participants embracing the novelty and use of technology in therapy delivery (e.g., Aranaet et al., 2007; Choi et al., 2013; Dunstan & Tooth, 2012) . It should be noted that many of these studies were conducted before the widespread day-today use of videoconferencing platforms, and less adaptation may be required in the 2020s.",

This suggests that prior experience is not a requirement to benefit. However, prior experience of therapy appears to predict completion. In their study of uptake, Deen et al.

Furthermore, nearly all well-powered RCTs that directly compared client ratings of the therapeutic relationship with in-person delivery found no significant differences (Table 2) , consistent with observations in smaller studies (e.g., Morgan et al., 2008; Scogin et al., 2018) . Additionally, in an analysis of equivalence, Maieritsch et al. (2016) found confidence intervals for the working alliance fell within a priori bounds of equivalence in their trial of CPT. An exception to these findings is the CPT trial by Morland et al., (2015) , which found statistically, but marginally, lower ratings for videoconferencing in the second session, with no differences at later time points. It is notable that, mirroring the adaptation to discomfort reported in some studies, some studies have also observed that videoconferencing clients rate a stronger alliance as sessions progress (Ertelt et al., 2011; Germain et al., 2010) .",

These quantitative findings correspond to therapist reports of some difficulties in detecting emotion and ability to read body language through videoconferencing (Dunstan & Tooth, 2012; Simpson et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2020; Yuen et al., 2013) .

Most commonly, the practical logistic changes to how components of therapy were delivered involved using other technologies to share documents (e.g., mailing, faxing, emailing, or screen sharing worksheets and homework) (Gros et al., 2011; Himle et al., 2006; Lindsay et al., 2017; Luxton et al., 2015; Matsumoto et al., 2018; Turek, Yoder, Ruggiero, Gros, & Acierno, 2010) . Clinical variations included removing situation-specific in vivo exposure exercises from videoconferencing sessions and asking participants to complete exposure as homework only (Gros et al., 2011; Yuen et al., 2013) , or creatively adapting or restricting exposure exercises so that they would be suitable for delivery within the virtual environment (e.g., talking on the phone to someone; Yuen et al., 2013) . While feasible, for some clients, exposure tasks via videoconferencing were perceived to be less real and less engaging when compared with in-person (Yuen et al., 2013) . Conversely, where videoconferencing was delivered by smartphone, opportunities were identified in using the portability of the device to observe and conduct exposure activities within the person's environment (Franklin et al., 2017; Turek et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2012 , Vogel et al., 2014 .",

Advantages include accessibility, particularly to persons without local in-person services, but also in terms of convenience, reducing time and financial costs, and circumventing stigma, self-consciousness and privacy concerns. Disadvantages include therapists finding it harder to judge body language, both clients and therapists experiencing initial discomfort with the modality while adapting to it, and interruptions arising from inevitable technical issues. However, it appeared that these concerns became less as clients and therapists adjusted: It may be that these issues become less of a concern as familiarity with videoconferencing grows across the population.",

Across anxiety, obsessive-compulsive spectrum and eating disorders, there is also emergent evidence supporting use. Notably, there was a lack of study of videoconferencing therapy delivery to people with psychosis (although see Santestaban-Echarri et al., 2020, for findings of broader service delivery, such as psychiatry appointments, being acceptable to this population).",

It is notable that trauma-focused therapies, as some of the most confronting therapeutic approaches, are the best evidenced, which suggests that an in-room presence is not required to deliver quite challenging therapies. Nonetheless, studies with available data have primarily utilized behavioural therapies. This leaves it unknown how therapies that use greater Socratic dialogue and reflection may operate within a videoconferencing environment, where some of the technical issues such as lag may prove more interruptive to the therapy process. Likewise, it is not known whether therapies for complex presentations, such as personality disorder and psychosis, which require more careful monitoring of in-session rapport, would be equally successful.",

Of note, the clearest finding of videoconferencing having slightly poorer outcomes than in-person therapy was in a trial for bulimia nervosa with a predominantly female group (although also using older telemedicine technology). On the other hand, the female-only study by Morland et al. (2015) also found non-inferiority and broadly similar results and observed that outcomes were in fact better among civilians compared with veterans. Nonetheless, these limitations in the available data urge some caution in assuming that videoconferencing therapies will function as well as in-person therapy with all therapies and populations. It should also be noted that we did not aggregate and metaanalyse mean scores for variables across studies, so there may be small between group differences that individual trials were not powered to detect.",

We did not identify any studies that contrasted videoconferencing with telephone as the other widely accessible communication modality. While, in a non-clinical client group, Day and Schnier (2002) failed to find any advantages of video counselling over telephone on process or outcome measures, considering the contrasting uses of these two widely accessible platforms, and understanding whether visual non-verbal feedback facilitates maintaining rapport, is needed in clinical populations. Further study also needs to be directed at examining the opportunities that may be presented by using videoconferencing as a therapeutic medium. Observations suggest there are particular affordances of video, allowing access to the home environment and potentially for portability, which may have advantages in better connecting with the person's daily life, and developing more ecologically valid therapeutic exercises. Rather than considering videoconferencing second to a presumed gold standard of in-person therapy, attention to these affordances is needed to evolve videoconferencing-based therapy practice in its own right.",
