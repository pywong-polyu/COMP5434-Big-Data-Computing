Spriet lspriet@uoguelph.ca 1 Human Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada cycle phases, and health and performance issues related to menstrual cycle disruption. Importantly, areas for future research are identified, and important methodological considerations for the required investigations are discussed [4] . The fifth paper in this supplement addresses the global trend of a transition towards the consumption of a more plant-based diet, which includes an increase in the consumption of plant-based proteins over animal-based proteins [5] . This way of eating is also very popular in sports nutrition, and it is known that ingesting proteins derived from soy and wheat results in lower post-meal muscle protein synthesis rates than does ingesting an equivalent amount of animalderived protein. This raises the concern that athletes ingesting mainly plant-based protein may need to ingest more protein [5] . However, the authors discuss ways that athletes can compensate for the lower anabolic effect of plant-based proteins and that additional research comparing plant-and animal-based proteins in foods is warranted.",

However, the effects of the two most abundant cannabis constituents, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have been largely uninvestigated in the sports world. Clearly, the potential of THC to affect performance has not been properly studied, but there is some evidence that CBD may improve sleep quality, pain, and mild traumatic brain injury in certain athletes [6] .
