In three 10-week periods, this study compared THR, HM, and control on salivary cortisol, self-reported stress, parent-reported social responsiveness, and heart-rate variability. This crossover design included 27 participants (12-21 years) randomly assigned to order of intervention. Findings suggest that HM and THR manualized protocols are equally beneficial in decreasing cortisol levels immediately following a session, but HM sessions had more impact on heart-rate variability. There was no significant effect on follow-up cortisol levels within a week after either intervention, but THR had more impact on decreasing some self-reported stressors.",

            "text": "The need for non-pharmacological interventions for adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has grown. In 2014, in the United States, the prevalence rate of ASD was 1 in 59 eight-year old children (Baio et al., 2018) . As this group reaches adolescence, just like any developing adolescent, they have the need for autonomy, competence, and belonging for successful transition (Deci & Ryan, 2012; Roeser & Zelazo, 2012) . Moreover, youth on the autism spectrum have higher rates of stress and social anxiety, especially in the context of mainstream school settings (Bennett et al., 2018; Hebron & Humphrey, 2014; Kreiser & White, 2014; Lai et al., 2019; Spain et al., 2019; Zainal & Magiati, 2019) . In addition to the hallmarks of ASD in DSM-5, consisting of persistent deficits in communication/social interaction and restricted, repetitive behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) , approximately 70% of individuals with ASD have one mental health co-morbidity impacting their quality of life (Kuhlthau et al., 2017; White et al., 2009) . Van Steensel et al., (2011) found that 36.6% of autistic children under 18 have a co-morbid anxiety disorder which includes phobia (29.8%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (17.4%) and social anxiety (16.6%). Adolescents with ASD report more solitary than social activities and difficulty forming and maintaining relationships (Hilton et al., 2008; Mazefsky et al., 2013; Orsmond & Kuo, 2011; Seltzer et al., 2004) . Evidence exists that social stress levels and fear of negative evaluation in social settings, especially in the transition to adulthood, are related to social interaction patterns (Capriola et al., 2017; Corbett & Simon, 2014; Maddox & White, 2015; Picci & Scherf, 2015; Pickard et al., 2017; Taylor & Seltzer, 2012; White et al., 2014) . Unfortunately, social anxiety in adolescents with ASD can impede adolescent developmental tasks, adaptive behaviors, and independent function in adult life (e.g. forming love relationships, and employment) (McGeowen et al., 2013; Picci & Scherf, 2015; Taylor & Seltzer, 2012) . Finding evidence of an effective way, without medication, to address stress in young adults with ASD, will have implications for overall wellness and quality of life (Hong et al., 2016; Shattuck et al., 2007) .",

Both the social context and the perception of the stressor are important in the way neurological and physiological aspects of social contact influences stress for people with ASD (Bishop-Fitzpatrick et al., 2017; Corbett et al., 2019) . When individuals perceive external demands exceeding his/her resources, coping with stress requires both cognitive and behavioral actions to meet the demands (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) . When compared to typical peers in the community, adults with ASD have significantly higher perceived stress and stressful life events (Bishop-Fitzpatrick et al., 2017; Bitsika & Sharpley, 2015) and poorer ability to cope with stress in everyday life (Hirvikoski & Blomqvist, 2015; Tomarken et al., 2015) . In fact, the higher the individual's autism spectrum quotient (AQ) score, the more subjective stress/distress in everyday life (Hirviskoski & Blomqvist, 2015) . For youth with ASD who are transitioning into adulthood, elevated stress levels may translate into: (1) lack of emotional regulation, sleep disturbances (Goldman et al., 2017) , and poor subjective quality of life and life adjustment (Bishop-Fitzpatrick et al., 2017; Hong et al., 2016) ; (2) interference with learning capability in school (Stahmer & Aarons, 2009 ); (3) and diminished ability to complete activities of daily living (Muris et al., 1998) . Anxiety relates to the anticipation and apprehension related to interaction with the environment (Corbett & Simon, 2014) . While anxiety is a separate construct from perceived and objective stress, stress and anxiety are related (Corbett & Simon, 2014; Lanni et al., 2012; White et al., 2009) . Prolonged repetition of stress, especially during adolescent transition, may create poor regulation of the HPA axis and difficulty with emotional regulation (Corbett & Simon, 2014) . Potential interventions that decrease stress, promote resilience, and support positive transition may improve treatment for people with ASD (Bishop-Fitzpatrick et al., 2017; Corbett & Simon, 2014) .",

During the day, cortisol values decline and the lowest levels are in the evening (Corbett & Simon, 2014) . Goldman et al. (2017) found similar cortisol levels in individuals with and without ASD. However, other studies have found differences. When compared to those who do not have ASD, adolescents with ASD have elevated evening cortisol levels (Muscatello & Corbett, 2018; Tomarken et al., 2015) with evidence of a blunted diurnal slope; a more stable level of cortisol throughout most of the day rather than a decline that is seen in typical adolescents (Edmiston et al., 2017; Taylor & Corbett, 2014; Tomarken et al., 2015; Tordjman et al., 2014) . Some adults with ASD, without a co-morbid diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression, exhibit low cortisol levels throughout the day suggesting disregulation of the HPA axis (Baker et al., 2019) . Another study found a small proportion of adolescents with ASD lacked a decline of cortisol throughout the day, indicating dysregulation of the diurnal rhythm (Bitsika et al., 2017) . Likewise, evidence suggests that elevated evening cortisol levels in adults with ASD are associated with poor sleep (Baker et al., 2019) . It has been suggested that cortisol response in adolescents with ASD is different because the regions of the brain impacted by ASD such as the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala share connections with the HPA axis (Corbett & Simon, 2014; Muscatello & Corbett, 2018) .",

Heart rhythm patterns reflect the dynamics and provide information on the degree of synchronized activity or coherence. Coherence is the opposite of stress in that it is measure of the stability and order of the heart rhythm (McCraty & Zayas, 2014) . Positive emotions such as appreciation, care, and love generate a smoother sine-wave like pattern in the heart's rhythms (McCraty & Tomasino, 2006; McCraty et al., 1998) .",

Since lack of self-regulation in the face of high levels of stress in social settings is a barrier to social interaction and independence in the community (Maisel et al., 2016) , recreational therapists use protocol-driven interventions to manage stress in social situations (Abishira et al., 2020; Kemeny et al., 2019) . Therapeutic horseback riding (THR), a specific modality of animal-assisted interventions using horses, has been studied primarily with children with autism up to 18 years of age (Abihsira et al., 2020; Goodwin et al., 2016; Kemeny et al., 2019) .

Less research has been conducted with other animals such as dolphins and guinea pigs (O'Haire, 2017) . In canineassisted interventions research, touching the animal is an important link to stress reduction (Wijker et al., 2019 (Wijker et al., , 2020 , and time-on-task (Hill et al., 2020) . Moreover, studies using parent-report suggest that interaction with dogs improves social communication (e.g. giving commands and prompting questions) and emotional regulation (e.g. self-calming) and better understanding of their emotional state (Berry et al., 2013; London et al., 2020) . The human-animal interaction has been shown to decrease arousal (Barker et al., 2010; Odendaal & Meintjes, 2003) and social stress through a positive focus of attention (Fine & Beck, 2015) . In an exploration of service dogs living with a child with autism, Viau et al. (2010) found a reduction in the stress-related cortisol level only during the time that the dog was with the family, suggesting sensitivity of the measure to the human-animal bond. There is some evidence that when a youth with autism interacts with animals, they perceive a greater reward and less sense of threat (Solomon, 2012; Whyte et al., 2015) .",

Taking advantage of neuroplasticity during adolescence, mindfulness training over an extended period of time is associated with modification of cognitive and emotional processes that become second nature, supporting academic success and well-being (Moffitt et al., 2011; Oberle & Schonert-Reichl, 2014) .",

However, due to the cognitive processes involved in thought restructuring, CBT may not be appropriate for every adolescent with autism (Lickel et al., 2012) . Mindfulness-based interventions (Oberle & Schonert-Reichl, 2014) , in which the adolescent learns resilience by becoming more aware of their internal state and how to tolerate stressful situations, are recognized by some as a more effective avenue for emotional regulation for people with ASD . When comparing CBT and mindfulness therapy, Sizoo and Kuiper (2017) found that both interventions were equally effective in treating anxiety and depression with respect to autistic symptoms, rumination, and global mood. However, mindfulness was a preferred technique for people with ASD and co-morbid anxiety.",

When an individual has inappropriate ANS arousal, reduced heart-rate variability, and emotional dysregulation, HM techniques are designed to self-regulate stress (McCraty & Zayas, 2014) . The first step of most of the techniques is \"heart-focused breathing\" which includes putting one's attention in the chest center and breathing using visualization. Deliberate regulation of breathing at 10 s rhythm increases cardiac coherence (McCraty & Zayas, 2014) . After this technique is learned and strong emotions are experienced, breathing decreases the intensity of the reaction. With conscious control of breathing over time, it allows the participant to modulate and gradually increase stability of the vagal afferent nerve traffic, sympathetic outflow, and the emotional experience (McCraty et al., 2009) . The method also depends on the shift to increased cardiac coherence with self-induced positive emotions (McCraty et al., 2014) . Mindfulness has been associated with lower cortisol levels during conflict discussion and more positive cognitive appraisals (Hertz et al., 2015) . HeartMath interventions have improved emotional regulation of stress in adolescents with ASD and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Aguinaga, 2006; McCraty et al., 1999) .",

Not all adolescents have access to both THR and mindfulness sessions. Since there is limited time and resources, which intervention is more effective for the adolescent with autism? Several systematic reviews have suggested that there is large variability among individuals with autism (McDaniel-Peters & Wood, 2017; O'Haire, 2017) and suggest the importance of determining which people benefit from EAS and under what circumstances. One way this might be accomplished is through comparative effectiveness research (Arnold, 2015; McDaniel-Peters & Wood, 2017) . O'Haire (2017) suggests the need for objective assessments to corroborate parent report which are prone to bias and the need for controls and/or comparisons. Others have suggested the need for manualized protocols that specify dose, activity sequence, and duration (McDaniel-Peters & Wood, 2017; Mesibov & Shea, 2011) . This review also reported that only 9% of studies confirmed that research participants had diagnoses of ASD, indicating a need for more research with participants who have received a formal diagnosis (McDaniel-Peters & Wood, 2017) . Similarly, with regard to mindfulness interventions for people with autism, several systematic reviews concluded there were too few controlled studies, lack of consistency in interventions across studies, too many small samples, and measures that relied on parent-report (Hartley et al., 2019; Hourston & Acchtley, 2017) . Mazefsky et al. (2013) suggests a multifaceted approach (e.g. subjective, behavioral, physiological) to understanding emotional regulation.",

The results of randomized control trials comparing THR to a barn no-horse control for children up to 16 years with ASD are promising for THR, indicating improvements in measures of irritability, social communication, social cognition, and hyperactivity (Gabriels et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2019) . A prospective study found a reduction in severity of autism symptoms for children with ASD following THR treatment (Kern et al., 2011) . In one comparative effectiveness study with individuals with ASD, Souza-Santos et al. (2018) found that THR and dance combined was more effective for ASD symptoms and functional independence than either intervention by itself. A similar comparative effectiveness study in people with ADHD found no difference between medications and EAS in terms of attention, impulsivity, and quality of life (Oh et al., 2018) . Likewise, Hesselmark et al. (2014) compared group mindfulness to a generic group recreational activity, finding that group mindfulness was more effective in self-reports of quality of life and lack of dropout. No known studies compare THR to a mindfulness intervention and control for youth on the autism spectrum in order to better understand the effectiveness for managing stress levels. Although the two interventions may appear quite different, both involve a social component (interaction with other humans and/or animals). Both also involve a degree of awareness of the present; within the HM mindfulness protocol, this is facilitated. The THR intervention requires participants to direct and communicate with a large animal that is responsive to human feedback-this is likely to encourage participants' attention to the present moment (Earles et al., 2015) . The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of HM mindfulness techniques, THR, and no intervention control on stress and emotional regulation of adolescents with ASD as measured by self-report, parent-report, salivary cortisol, and heart rate variability.",

Interventions included THR, HM, or control, with a \"wash out\" period of at least 2 months between each 10-week period (Fig. 1) . The researchers collected outcome measures and monitored the process, but separate certified individuals facilitated each intervention. To heighten treatment fidelity, the same THR and HM facilitators were used throughout the research study. Moreover, to control for the impact of the outdoor farm environment, the HM sessions were held in a building on the same property about 0.5 mile away from the equestrian center with the same view of woodlands and pastures as the THR group. However, the HM group could not see or interact with the horses. The outcome measures for stress level were: (1) salivary cortisol; (2) perceived stress from the perspective of the adolescent with ASD; and (3) parent report of social responsiveness. Emotional regulation (coherence) was measured through heart rate variability (HRV). As seen in Fig. 1 , before (baseline) and after (follow-up) each 10-week period (THR, HM Mindfulness, or Control), salivary cortisol, selfreport of perceived stress (Cohen et al., 1983) , self-report of stress survey for persons with autism (Goodwin et al., 2007) and parent report of social responsiveness scale (SRS-2) (Constantino, 2012) were collected.

Baseline and follow-up, before and after each 10-week period, saliva samples were collected from home over two consecutive days at four time points per day to obtain cortisol values to characterize the diurnal rhythm of each participant. Baseline samples were collected over a Saturday and Sunday within 1 week of starting each of the three periods, and follow-up samples were collected over a Saturday and Sunday within one week of ending each of the three periods. For each of the two days, the sampling times were awakening, 30-min post-awakening, afternoon at time of intervention, and 30-min before bedtime, thus resulting in 8 home samples in total. Parents and participants were provided with specific instructions for sample collection and sampling restrictions, along with a check sheet to assist with keeping track of sampling times or note any issues. Samples were taken using the passive drool method by allowing saliva to pool in the mouth and allowing it to drain from the mouth to a collection tube. For participants who had difficulty with this method, samples were taken by holding a SalivaBio Children's Swab Device (Salimetrics LLC, State College, PA) under the tongue for 60 s. Parents were asked to plan ahead so that participants did not eat a meal within 60 min prior to sampling or brush teeth within 30 min prior to sampling. Snacks or drinks (including water) were prohibited within 10 min prior to sampling times. During the intervention periods (HM or THR), saliva was also collected in the same manner immediately before (pre) and after (post) each 1-h intervention in the afternoon at the same times each day. The loss of sample from parent-collected saliva was 4%. All saliva samples were stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C until analysis. ",

During the HM Mindfulness session, the participant held the small 3 inch \u00d7 2.5 inch device. At the end of each session, the sensor data was downloaded into the emWave Pro software system on a desktop computer. The coherence level identified by the emWave Pro is a measure of sine-wavelike signal with a very narrow, high-amplitude peak in the low frequency (LF) region of the HRV power spectrum with no major peaks in the very-low-frequency (VLF) or high-frequency (HF) regions, calculating a coherence ratio which reflects peak power/[total power-peak power] based on the integral in a window 0.030 Hz wide, centered on the highest peak in that region (HeartMath Institute, 2020). Heart rhythm data creates a complex set of frequencies all represented in the average. In high coherence, many of these influences quiet, and the heart and breath synchronize into one frequency resulting in one dominant peak clearly defined at the coherence frequency around 0.1 Hertz (HeartMath Institute, 2020).",

T-test comparisons suggested increased perceived stress in the social and unpleasant categories for the HM phase and food for the control phase. When focusing only on descriptives for the scale variables, with the exception of \"stress about positive events,\" THR intervention showed a decrease in the mean values for perceived stress while HM showed an increase in self-perceived stress in all areas except PSS total. During the control phase, participants increased their stress level for all scales except anticipation, sensory, social and the PSS total. One difference in the THR, HM, and Control periods is that the HM period sessions focused on the topic of stress, stress triggers, and specific goal-oriented education on learning to self-regulate [ Table 3 ]. There is a possibility that overt awareness and identification of stressors during the HM sessions may have increased self-perceived stress in the area of social and unpleasant events at follow-up after the sessions. in their research on emotional regulation and ASD indicate that individuals with ASD often lack the motivational component integral to on-going emotional regulation. Moreover, cognitive factors (e.g. deficits in problemsolving, rigidity, and lack of perspective-taking promote further difficulties in emotional regulation . Perhaps, during the facilitation of the HM mindfulness session, the participant can be guided to better coherence, but at the end of the HM phase, they have more awareness about stress, but less ability to practice stressreduction on their own. Individuals need both awareness and coping self-efficacy (Oswald et al., 2018) . The participants experienced physiological stress-reduction during HM sessions (cortisol levels drop and coherence rises), but they need continued support and facilitation to experience stress-reduction on their own. On the other hand, with THR, the stress-reduction mechanism is less an education process and more experiential. O'Haire (2017) reports that a high frequency of positive outcomes from AAI related to social interaction, verbal language, and positive emotions. The THR sessions allowed for more natural social interaction and touching the horses rather than only interacting with people. Moreover, Wijker et al., (2019 Wijker et al., ( , 2020 suggested that touching the animal promoted stress reduction. The emphasis in the sessions was interacting, grooming, and directing the horse, and practicing emotional regulation in a natural setting (i.e. waiting for other participants to mount) rather than cognitively examining stress triggers or actively working at stress reduction. In other words, the time with the horse creates a positive focus of attention (Fine & Beck, 2015) to interact with an accepting animal with little \"fear of negative evaluation\" that (Capriola et al., 2017) . Other research supports that caring for the horse through grooming and interacting promotes self-efficacy and a sense of control (Goodwin et al., 2016) .",

O'Haire (2017) suggested that the core of the SRS focuses on internalizing and externalizing behaviors, but her review found these behaviors are not typically impacted by AAI. Parents reported a substantial increase in fidgetiness in the control phase, but a slight decrease in difficulty relating to peers and not understanding cause and effect. Pan et al. (2019) found a decrease in hyperactivity and irritability with therapeutic riding but not control. In this study, fidgetiness actually increased during the control phase with an absence of any intervention. By anecdotal report, both participants and parents positively anticipated participating in either intervention. It is possible that the parents noticed more restlessness when the child had a lack of intervention during the control phase. In the HM phase, parents reported decreases in anti-social behaviors such as behaving strangely, difficulty with changes in routine, and wandering aimlessly between activities. This parent report fits the salivary cortisol and coherence findings, but does not correspond to the self-report findings about HM and self-perceived stress of unpleasant events (if these are considered unpleasant events for the person with autism). The HM session did include a booklet which the participants brought home. In some cases, the parents may perceive that the adolescent was calmer over the HM phase as they were asked to comment on behaviors over a wide span of time, but the self-report was an indication of how the adolescent felt in the moment of filling it out.",

            "text": "In the THR phase, there was an improvement in a prosocial behavior and recognizing unfairness, and a decrease in anti-social behaviors such as avoidance of initiating social interactions, difficulty relating to peers, and walking between two people who are talking. The parent report of improvements in recognizing unfairness and decreases in anti-social behaviors correspond with decrease in salivary cortisol with THR as does the participants' self-report of positive improvements in their response to participating in a group and having to wait. Gabriels et al. (2015) , also used the SRS and found improvements in communication and cognition, but no change in motivation or awareness with equine-assisted activity. Parent perception of AAI captured by other research has reported the presence of animals improved motivation, engagement, communication, and (London et al., 2020) . One discrepancy with the self-report and salivary cortisol findings was the parent report of an increase in the participant being tense in social settings after the THR phase. While \"being tense\" should have some relationship to self-reported stress, coherence, and salivary cortisol, it is important to recognize that the follow-up is completed after the phase and may not reflect how the participant is reacting on a session day to THR. Perhaps, certain aspects such as a stress in a group is defined or perceived differently by the parent and the adolescent participant. The participant would be determining stress levels from internal levels, where the parent would be using observation to determine if their child is \"being tense.\" There is an advantage to viewing the results from multiple perspectives: the parents, the adolescent themself, and biometric measures. However, differences in perception may impact the self-report and parent-report measures. Van der Steen et al. (2019) compared outcome measures of one child with therapeutic riding and found differences between outcome measures on the same child with autism. On the other hand, Ozsivadjian et al. (2014) found agreement between self-report and parent-report in youth with autism on the areas of anxiety, depression, and negative thoughts.",

            "text": "Participant salivary cortisol was higher in the morning and decreased throughout the day, with the lowest values just before bedtime. However, there was some variability between the salivary cortisol concentrations, even within the control phase. Corbett et al. (2008) found that, compared with a group of children without ASD, children with ASD had higher between and within subject variability in diurnal cortisol values, as well as higher values at night, which was hypothesized to possibly correspond to stressful events of the day. Our mean bedtime cortisol concentrations were all lower than the afternoon session time cortisol concentrations for baseline and follow-up, and most of our variability was seen in the morning samples. As this was a crossover study, any variability in our findings was within subjects. Brosnan et al. (2009) found that adolescent males diagnosed with Asperger syndrome showed a diurnal decrease in cortisol throughout the day, but lacked a significant CAR, while the control group of participants without Asperger syndrome displayed a consistent and significant CAR, as well as a diurnal decrease in cortisol throughout the day. We found that participants lacked a CAR at baseline for THR and HM. Participants displayed a CAR at follow-up of HM and control, but lacked a CAR at follow-up of THR. Another study where children with ASD were placed with a service dog found the CAR to decrease from 58 to 10% following the addition of the service dog, and then increase again to 48% once the service dog was removed (Viau et al., 2010) . The authors of that study hypothesized that better quality of sleep due to the presence of the service dogs may have led to the decrease in CAR. There could have been a \"de-arousing effect\" due to the presence of the animal (Berry et al., 2013) . A metaanalysis of studies evaluating CARi found increased CARi to be associated with general life stress and job stress, and decreased CARi to be associated with positive psychological traits, as well as fatigue and exhaustion (Chida & Steptoe, 2009 ). The participant self-reports denoted decreased stress level for the THR phase and would support the CARi decrease being associated with lesser stress. Another study found that children who participated in cardiovascular exercise displayed increased CARi, whereas children in the motor exercise group displayed decreased CARi (Wegner et al., 2019) . A meta-analysis found lower basal cortisol to be associated with increased physical activity or physical fitness (M\u00fccke et al., 2018) . Physical fitness was not evaluated in this study and the participants underwent low intensity exercise in the TR phase, but perhaps higher intensity riding exercises or more frequent lessons could lead to statistically significant differences in future study. When comparing individual sessions, there was a significant decrease in salivary cortisol concentration after the intervention in all of the THR sessions and seven of the HM sessions, and the overall post-session median cortisol concentration was significantly decreased from pre-session for both treatments, indicating that salivary cortisol was reduced through both interventions. Similarly, in a pilot study of children with ASD, Pan et al. (2019) found that salivary cortisol concentrations decreased following THR lessons; however, in that study there was no difference from the control group practicing unmounted activities in the barn using a stuffed horse. Barker et al. (2010) found that 30-min interaction with an unfamiliar dog or the participant's own dog was found to be associated with decreases in salivary cortisol, blood pressure, and heart rate below no-dog baseline measures following exposure to a stressor. In our study, when comparing control baseline cortisol concentration to post-session cortisol concentrations, post-THR session and post-HM session cortisol concentrations were significantly lower than control baseline samples taken at the same time of day, further supporting that both interventions were effective in reducing salivary cortisol concentrations. We found no difference when comparing overall session cortisol concentrations between the two treatments (but both had statistically significant decreases in salivary cortisol from pre-post session), indicating that both interventions could be equally useful for stress management for adolescents with ASD.",

Although THR involved low-intensity riding skills, changes during the activity, such as going from walk to trot, could alter HRV. On the other hand, some of the difference may be related to the protocol for collecting the heart-rate variability values. While on horseback, so that they could hold the reins, the participants wore the device in a light backpack on their backs. During the mindfulness sessions, the participants held their devices and could see the values on the devices. In this case, the devices may have been reinforcing more even breathing and calmer responses as the participants saw an immediate result of their practice. By nature of the intent of each session, HM is more focused on self-management of stress. In the THR sessions, the participant was not being focused on self-management of stress; the participant was focusing on the content of the therapeutic riding session.",

While they both are used in practice to reduce stress, one focuses completely on facilitator/peer social interaction and the other focuses on animal interaction with some facilitator interaction. Both interventions did allow the participants to move around gently (with no strenuous aerobic exercise in either intervention). However, there is certainly more movement and vestibular-cerebellar stimulation in THR related to the movement of the horse (Arnold, 2015) . Although they were not the only measures used in the study, self-report and parent-report have inherent limitations as the results may be influenced by response bias (e.g. not understanding, misreading, rushing, or social desirability) (Rosenman et al., 2011) . Moreover, this study did not compare the participants in their response to THR and HM based upon verbal skills, adaptive functioning, behavioral level, anxiety level or sleep patterns. The sample was too small to compare the response to interventions based on gender, race, or ethnicity. While this study did not measure anxiety level, self-reported stress and cortisol levels are related constructs. Furthermore, not enough is known about the variability of anxiety among people with autism (Kerns et al., 2014) and how individuals respond to non-pharmacological interventions. Research on autism and anxiety disorders has raised concerns about a one-size fits all approach (Herrington et al., 2017; South et al., 2017) .",

Therapeutic riding does not require the same extent of interpersonal communication as the HeartMath; although participants may be asked to verbally communicate with the instructor, peers, volunteers, or the horse, there is a greater emphasis on non-verbal communication with the horse. Because of the greater response of the horse to touch versus verbal cues (Arnold, 2015) , THR may be a better approach for stress reduction for participants with lower verbal skills. Therapeutic riding may also be more motivating for some individuals than others. It would also be interesting to evaluate the effectiveness of THR programming that intentionally incorporates mindfulness activities and evaluates mindfulness as an outcome. Earles et al.

Both interventions, with the manualized protocol, could be considered in the non-pharmacological options for interventions. Therapeutic riding may be an intervention that will be effective despite verbal communication ability, while HeartMath may be more effective for adolescents/young adults with better receptive and expressive verbal skills. In the time of COVID-19, it is easier to practice physical distancing from others with therapeutic riding, but HeartMath would be more easily delivered via telehealth mechanisms.
