A total of 163 drug protein targets were identified, and 125 biological processes involving the drug targets were significantly enriched based on a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) was used as an ontological platform to represent the anti-coronaviral drugs, chemical compounds, drug targets, biological processes, viruses, and the relations among these entities. In addition to new term generation, CIDO also adopted various terms from existing ontologies and developed new relations and axioms to semantically represent our annotated knowledge. The CIDO knowledgebase was systematically analyzed for scientific insights. To support rational drug design, a \"Host-coronavirus interaction (HCI) checkpoint cocktail\" strategy was proposed to interrupt the important checkpoints in the dynamic HCI network, and ontologies would greatly support the design process with interoperable knowledge representation and reasoning.",

In addition to COVID-19, two related betacoronavirus-induced diseases, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 2 , had triggered public health crises. SARS emerged in China in November 2002, in an epidemic that lasted for 8 months and resulted in 8,098 confirmed human cases in 29 countries with 774 deaths (case-fatality rate: 9.6%) 1, 3 . Approximately 10 years later in June 2012, the MERS-CoV, another highly pathogenic coronavirus, was isolated in Saudi Arabia from the sputum of a male patient who died from acute pneumonia and renal failure 2 . MERS-CoV outbreaks resulted in 2,260 cases 1 in 27 countries and 803 deaths (35.5%) 4, 5 . To successfully fight against future coronavirus infections, intensive studies are required to identify effective and safe measures against the current and past outbreaks.",

Ontology has played a significant role in knowledge and data standardization, integration, and analysis [10] [11] [12] [13] . Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) is a community-based open source biomedical ontology that systematically represents entities associated with coronavirus diseases, including their etiological causes, phenotypes, host-coronavirus interactions, diagnosis, drugs, and vaccines 14 . For drug representation, CIDO reuses terms from three existing ontologies, including Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology (ChEBI) 15 , National Drug File -Reference Terminology (NDF-RT) 16 , and Drug Ontology (DrON) 17 , which have been frequently used for drug studies 18, 19 . ChEBI is a database and ontology of over 56,000 molecular entities of biological significance with a focus on small chemical compounds. ChEBI ontologically classifies these compounds based on different categories such as structural and functional features. Produced by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, NDF-RT organizes drugs in a hierarchical and formal representation by modeling drug characteristics including ingredients, chemical structure, physiologic effect, mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetics. DrON provides an ontological representation of the drug contents on the RxNorm terminology 20 that contains all medications available on the US market. Once a list of drugs is identified, tools such as Ontofox 21 can be used to extract these drugs and their related characteristics from an ontology and perform specific analyses [22] [23] [24] [25] . The extracted terms can also be imported into CIDO, and new axioms can also be generated to interlink different terms as a way for computer-interpretable knowledge representation.",

Coronavirus infection lifecycle requires three processes: viral entry (or viral invasion), viral replication, and viral release. To fight against coronaviruses, drugs can function to interrupt any one of these steps. For example, an anti-coronaviral drug can interrupt the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and human ACE2 receptor and thus block the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 to human cells. Coronaviral infection can also cause many damages to the human cells and induce a series of host responses. Some anti-coronaviral drugs can modulate the host immune responses such as cytokine storm, thus preventing severe outcomes induced by these overreactive responses (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "As a drug used to successfully treat the first COVID-19 patient in the USA 26 , remdesivir has become a highly promising drug for treating COVID-19. Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog, which inhibits viral proliferation by inhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP, or Nsp12) ( Fig. 1) 6 . It has been shown to effectively fight against several kinds of viruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in vitro 7 . Its anti-viral effects were also identified in the rhesus macaque model infected with MERS-CoV 8 . A recent study showed remdesivir can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro 6 . Moreover, remdesivir has been evaluated in two clinical trials 27, 28 , showing that the hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving remdesivir treatment recovered faster than similar patients who received a placebo. As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed remdesivir to be distributed and used to treat adults and children hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (https://www.fda.gov/ media/137564/download). However, the utility of remdesivir for treating COVID-19 may be limited only to hospitalized patients due to rapid first-pass hepatic clearance when administered orally and thus requires infusion for adequate delivery 29 . Its usage may also require initiation before the peak of viral replication, which might not be feasible in the clinical situation 30 . Figure 2 demonstrates how CIDO represents remdesivir as a drug and remdesivir as a chemical entity. We used ChEBI as the default ontology for chemical entity representation. Initially, remdesivir was not in ChEBI. Therefore, we submitted a request and provided needed remdesivir information to the ChEBI development team. Eventually, this term was added to ChEBI. We then imported this term and other anti-coronaviral chemical entity terms as described earlier to CIDO. As defined in ChEBI, remdesivir is a carboxylic ester and has antiviral and anti-coronaviral agent roles. Furthermore, we added a new role to this drug, termed 'chemical role against SARS-CoV-2 replication' (Fig. 2) . To link the chemicals with chemical targets or viruses, we have also generated new relations, such as 'chemical inhibits in vivo replication of virus' , and used it to represent the relation between remdesivir and SARS-CoV-2:",

Chlorpromazine also interacts with the serotonin receptors (HTRs) and histamine receptors (HRHs) (Fig. 5) . Based on ontology analysis, chlorpromazine functions as an antagonist or inhibitor of multiple dopamine receptors, adrenergic receptors, and histamine receptors. Although how chlorpromazine exhibits anti-coronavirus properties is not fully understood, adrenergic antagonists and histamine antagonists have been shown to inhibit RNA viruses such as Ebola and Marburg viruses 36 . As another hub drug, dasatinib has been annotated for over 20 protein targets and approximately half of them belong to tyrosine kinase proteins. Dasatinib, together as imatinib (another coronavirus drug), is an inhibitor of the Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) pathway, a signaling pathway involved in cell differentiation, cell adhesion, and cellular stress response. Previous studies showed that dasatinib and imatinib can both inhibit BCR-ABL interaction and prohibit virus fusing with S protein of host cells 37, 38 . As the 3 rd hub, anisomycin has 13 annotated protein targets in our ontological representation. Although there are no annotations for the role it plays in these interactions, it may be involved in protein translation since 10 of the protein targets are ribosomal proteins (Fig. 5) .",

Several studies have shown that lopinavir (an enzyme inhibitor) can have favorable outcomes in treating SARS and MERS in combination with ritonavir (another enzyme inhibitor) in human and nonhuman primates 39, 40 . A case study showed that the lopinavir/ritonavir combination significantly decreased viral load on one COVID-19 patient in Korea 41 . However, a clinical study with a total of 199 adult COVID-19 patients showed no significant benefit in improving clinical outcomes 42 . Human coronaviruses can delay IFN induction and dysregulate Interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) effector functions in primary human lung epithelial cells 43, 44 .

We are currently in the process of developing such a tool. Before such a tool is available, the researchers can use our manually annotated results in Excel or CSV format, which has categorized the drug mechanisms in different groups. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 literature is growing and the results are being updated at an unprecedented rate. We commit to periodical updates to provide an up-to-date version of the experimentally confirmed and well-annotated results.",

For example, while they all use S protein as the ligand, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins bind to the ACE-2 49,50 , but MERS-CoV S protein binds to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; CD26) receptors 51 . Therefore, ACE-2 receptor blockers become a therapeutic approach for COVID-19 52 , and anti-DPP4 (CD26) is a therapeutic option for fighting MERS-CoV 53,54 . SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 also have different immune responses in humans. For example, compared with SAR-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in ex vivo infected human lung tissues 55 . The biological processes stimulated by these three viruses in the hosts also differ in many ways 56 . Therefore, more research is required to further explore in depth the subtle differences of these viruses in their induced immune responses and drug effects.",

A recent study performed comparative viral-human protein-protein interaction (PPI) and viral protein localization analysis for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, and detected host factors that functionally inhibit coronavirus proliferation 56 .
