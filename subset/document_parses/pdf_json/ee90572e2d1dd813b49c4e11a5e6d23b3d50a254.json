Understanding intensive care unit nurses' sources of distress is important when planning interventions to support them. Purpose: To describe Canadian intensive care unit nurse experiences providing care to COVID-19 patients during the second wave of the pandemic. Design: Qualitative descriptive component within a larger mixed-methods study. Participants and research context: Participants were invited to write down their experiences of a critical incident, which distressed them when providing nursing care. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Ethical considerations: The study was approved by the ethics committee at the researchers' university in eastern Canada. Results: A total of 111 critical incidents were written by 108 nurses. Four themes were found: (1) managing the pandemic, (2) witness to families' grief, (3) our safety, and (4) futility of care. Many nurses' stories also focused on the organizational preparedness of their institutions and concerns over their own safety. Discussion: Nurses experienced moral distress in relation to family and patient issues. Situations related to insufficient institutional support, patient, and family traumas, as well as safety issues have left nurses deeply distressed. Conclusion: Identifying situations that distress intensive care unit nurses can lead to targeted interventions mitigating their negative consequences by providing a safe work environment and improving nurses' well-being.",

These events may involve behaviors or activities affecting certain outcomes and are meaningful to those involved. 18 Working retrospectively, the person is asked to reflect on behaviors or actions that could have led to an outcome or result. Thus, researchers attempt to gain an understanding of participant experiences and the behaviors or actions taken to handle the situations. 18, 19 Over the years, CIT has been increasingly used in healthcare research and nursing, in particular. 19, 20 The guide on CIT by Schluter et al. 18 was used for the development of questions and ensuing analysis as it focused on CIT's applicability in nursing research and outlines how the basic CIT questions can be modified for issues relevant to nurses. Participants were initially asked to describe a situation when caring for a COVID-19 patient made them feel distressed. The situation could refer directly to patient care, equipment used, or any other aspect within the ICU setting. Following this, five questions were asked regarding the particular situation (see Table 1 ).",

For some participants, recollections of incidents were short, revealing little about the situation itself. Other participants had detailed descriptions of events and ensuing actions. During the second phase, initial codes were attributed to each document containing the critical incidents. We also coded all content in relation to the incidents, as they further explained participant thoughts and actions. Three separate members of the team created the initial codes. After several documents were coded, the team met regularly and discussed the coding system until consensus was reached. The codes were collapsed into categories mid-way through the analysis, and finally, broader themes. At the end, the team collectively confirmed the final themes. Data saturation was obtained halfway through the analysis; we nonetheless continued analysis with the existing codes since the data were already collected. A total of 111 critical incidents were identified and several participants shared more than one incident. The time completing the survey ranged from 20 min to 24 h as the survey allowed participants to save their responses and complete their answers later.",

The concerns were based on three issues they believed were problematic: frequent policy and guideline changes, lack of resources and staffing shortages. Policies and guidelines changed frequently, sometimes day-to-day, which from nurses' perspective was far too often. These rapid procedural changes left nurses feeling anxious and vulnerable. At some level, nurses understood that the rapid increase in knowledge of treatment modalities would be reflected in the care of critically ill patients. Nonetheless, nurses found this troublesome because they believed that many knowledge gaps arising during the first wave should have been resolved before the second wave occurred. Examples were given of policies regarding patient visits, isolation requirements, PPE, and patient code status.",

(Participant 64) Nurses also felt that constant changes in infection control guidelines were not always based on evidence. The consequences of this were a deep-rooted distrust of management. Nurses spoke about the lack of resources within the ICUs. These resources were related to shortages of equipment, lack of human resources, and limited negative pressure rooms. Management dealt with regular PPE shortages in different ways, often resulting in a lack of transparency about PPE availability. Nurses were sometimes asked to reuse PPEs or make do with what they had. One nurse noted that her supervisor asked her to reuse isolation gowns as they were running short, while another supervisor asked the nurses to bring their isolation gowns home to wash. Faced with unsatisfactory actions, nurses went to the next level of management to acquire the appropriate protective gear. Nurses felt that they were at high risk of contagion and blamed management for not being prepared to handle the high number of COVID-19 cases during the second wave. One nurse noted: \"We did not have a plan, nor coordination to manage high-intensity situations while maintaining these precautions. It takes discipline that comes from training, and we had no training\" (participant 104). Nurses indicated they wanted clearer guidelines, more education, and involvement in unit decisions.",

Makeshift units were quickly created to accommodate the increasing patients, but there were often issues with the implementation of these new spaces. As a result, nurses felt that the shortage of ICU nurses compromised patient care. Another nurse noted, \"Understaffed intensive care unit is a perfect ground for mishaps and accidental deaths.

One nurse stated \"I should not be the last voice they (patients) hear. It should be someone they love\" (participant 39). Nurses acted as an intermediary communicating between family and patients. This had its own set of challenges as patients were often intubated and not responding. IPads with Facetime were used and enabled family members to say their last goodbyes. The use of Facetime was very distressing for both families and nurses. Moreover, time constraints made it difficult dealing with many competing interventions. Some nurses resented having to prioritize iPad use (e.g. adjusting the angle of the iPad to give the family a view of the patient that would be the least upsetting for them) over providing complex care to patients who were proned with multiple lines.",

In these cases, other healthcare workers took a back seat to family interventions because of fear of contagion. Nurses generally felt powerless to change the outcomes of care and guilt that they could not do more to alter patient outcomes. Several participants indicated that they have provided care to over 100 COVID-19 positive patients. One participant expressed, But I have had 3 patients die suddenly, shortly after admission, despite our best efforts. And then when medical interventions fail and the family get the bad news, they don't understand. And I know their grief and understanding is interrupted and I can't fix that . . . And I feel guilty that the family has this trauma to process, and I couldn't do more for them to help them emotionally heal. (Participant 69) They appeared fatalistic about the outcomes, knowing that the odds were that the patients would not recover, or if they did, they would still have serious ramifications.",

Many nurses have felt insufficiently supported by their institutions during the pandemic. 9, 14 Moreover, organizational support is associated with reduced anxiety in nurses. 40 Employers have a responsibility to provide a safe working environment for nurses and, according to the Canadian Nurses Association Code of ethics, both employers and governments have a duty to protect nurses during disasters and pandemics. 41 This includes transparent communication, improving the state of preparedness of healthcare organizations, appropriate staffing levels and providing different types of support for nurses in relation to childcare and self-isolation.",

An advantage of using this methodology is that it enabled nurses to explore specific events occurring in their work environment. Using a web-based survey as a means to collect data also allowed nurses to express themselves freely when they were able to. It also gave participants the opportunity to write as little or as much as they wanted to. One of the main limitations of written CIT is that, unlike in-depth interviews, we were unable to probe further and elicit more information from participants. A second limitation was that our data gave us only one perspective of events unfolding within ICU settings. The perspective of physicians, frontline and middle managers would have greatly enriched our understanding of the complexities of the work environment during the pandemic.",
