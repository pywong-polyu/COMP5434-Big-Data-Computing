Leveraging on the MD simulation results, we suggest possible binding regions belonging to RRM2, which may be responsible for the fragment aggregations. The choice to analyze the conformational variation of each fragment independently from other possible partners is based on the hypothesis of the conformational selection model [18, 19] validity. According to this theory, the bound conformations can be sampled by the protein even when it is not bounded to its corresponding partner: in other words, the conformational change of a protein can occur before a binding event, rather than being induced by the event itself [20] .",

The method, characterized by a low computational cost compared to the commonly used version in three dimensions, examines portions of the molecular surface of two hypothetically interacting protein structures in terms of their local shape complementarity. Through an extensive sampling analysis of molecular patches, this superposition-free method is able to associate the probability of interaction between a patch and any other of the corresponding molecular partner. Using this formalism, we study the shape compatibility between different \u03b2-sheet regions as emerged from molecular dynamics frames. Moreover, to find the complexes binding poses, we perform docking selecting the poses whose binding regions met two requirements: a high number of involved \u03b23 and \u03b25 (two beta-sheets of the RRM2 domain) residues and high shape complementarity between the two surfaces, as calculated by Zernike descriptors. Finally, we perform additional 20 ns-long MD simulations to better characterize these interactions and analyze the molecular stability of the predicted complexes.",

Figure 2a1 shows that the RMSD of Fragment A has a steady behavior, with a mean value of 0.598 \u00b1 0.065 nm. On the other hand, the RMSD of Fragment B, shown in Figure 2b1 , is characterized by a sudden peak between 5.5 \u00b7 10 2 ns and 6.5 \u00b7 10 2 ns; this behavior is discussed in Section 2.2. To reduce the computational cost and facilitate the interpretation of the results, we selected the most representative structures in accordance with a clustering analysis. In particular, we firstly performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the covariance matrix of the atomic positions explored during the two MD simulations. Projecting each MD frame on the plane defined by the two first principal components, we obtained an essential representation of the fragment's motions, shown in Figure 2a2 and Figure 2b2 for Fragment A and B respectively. Then, we executed a clustering analysis of the MD frames, according to such projection. Our aim is to find the most representative conformations, i.e., those closest to any other explored one, assumed by each simulated fragment at equilibrium. The appropriate number of clusters is evaluated by maximizing the Silhouette Coefficient (SC), a measure of cluster cohesion and separation (see Section 4.3 for more details).",

Since the R g of a protein is a measure of its compactness, this confirms the loss of the ordered structure of Fragment B and, therefore, the presence of a transition from the folded state to the unfolded state. While the fragment is stably folded (for about the first 5.5 \u00b5s and last 3.5 \u00b5s of the simulation), it maintains a relatively steady value of R g . On the other hand, in the interval between 5.5 and 6.5 \u00b5s, the R g abruptly increases, highlighting the unfolding process.",

Two similar patches, if defined by the same reference point, have a small distance between the Zernike vectors, since perfectly complementary patches are equal under roto-translation. For each point i of one of the two surfaces, the distance between the Zernike descriptors of its patch and all the patches built on the points of the other surface is computed. The minimum of these values is selected, and, after all points had been studied, these minimum values are mapped in [0, 1] and inverted. At the end of the process, points whose corresponding patches have high complementarity with the other surface are associated with a value of binding propensity (BP) near one. Thus, with a smoothing procedure, each point is associated with the mean BP value of the points in its neighborhood: the interacting regions should be made up mostly of elements with high complementarity and, therefore, a high average value of BP. Finally, we associate to each residue the mean BP value of the corresponding points in the surface. We apply this procedure to each surface in all the possible pairings.",

For each pairing, we look at the first 20 docking poses of the two corresponding conformations (i.e., the ones obtained with our MD simulations) provided by the H-dock server. To select the docking predictions that present \u03b23, \u03b25 residues in the binding sites, we perform a contact analysis (see Methods for details). We then compute the percentage of \u03b23, \u03b25 residues involved in the bond and select the complexes associated with the highest values. The results are shown in Figure 5a . To associate these complexes to the pairings found with the Zernike algorithm, we search for the ones whose mean Z-score of the residues involved in the bonds (m B ) is higher than the mean Z-score of the residues not involved (m nB ), thus selecting the regions with the highest probability of interacting in accordance with the method based on the Zernike formalism (see Figure 5b ). These results show that the binding sites identified with our method are not always predicted in the best complexes of the docking algorithm. Therefore, docking provides a set of possible molecular complexes but does not represent a replaceable solution to the approach used in this work, which is specifically based on the shape complementarity at the binding interface. However, by exploiting the optimization process of the binding pose performed by the docking method, we can propose structures derived by molecular docking in which the interacting regions are characterized by a high binding propensity predicted by the Zernike-based method.

Moreover, we note that even if several approaches to computationally predict a protein structure from its primary sequence have been developed, efficient exploration of the conformational space proteins can visit remains a hard task.

It results in the grouping of the MD conformations in similar structures, that are assumed to behave similarly. In particular, we selected the centroid of each cluster as a representative conformation for that class of structures.

Only the former will constitute the patch. Once the patch has been selected, the mean vector of the normal vectors of the patch points is computed and oriented along the z-axis. Thus, given a point C on the z-axis, we define \u03b8 as the largest angle between the z-axis and a secant connecting C to any point of the patch \u03a3. C is then set so that \u03b8 = 45 \u2022 , and each surface point is labeled with its distance r from C. As a next step, a square grid is built, where each pixel is associated with the mean of the r values associated with the points inside each pixel.

Once a patch is represented in terms of its Zernike descriptors, the similarity between that patch and another one can be simply measured as the Euclidean distance between the invariant vectors. The norm of each coefficient z n m = |c n m | constitutes one of the Zernike invariant descriptors. Since z n m does not depend on the phase (i.e., it is invariant for rotations around the origin of the unitary circle), two patches can be assessed by comparing the Zernike invariants of their associated 2D projections, without considering their orientation. On the other hand, the relative orientation must be taken into account: if we search for similar regions we must compare patches that have the same orientation once projected in the 2D plane, i.e., the solventexposed part of the surface must be oriented in the same direction for both patches (for example as the positive z-axis). If instead, we want to assess the complementarity between them, we must orient the patches contrariwise, i.e., one patch with the solvent-exposed part toward the positive z-axis ('up') and the other toward the negative z-axis ('down'). Thus, to assess whether two surfaces have regions with a relevant shape complementary, we (i) compute the Zernike descriptors of the patches centered in all the points of the two surfaces up to the selected maximum expansion order n (The two surfaces have to be oriented in opposite verse along the z-axis.). (ii) For each point i of the two surfaces, we compute the distance between the Zernike descriptors of the patches of one surface and all the patches built on the points of the other surface. The minima of these values are selected. Next, the found minima values are normalized in the range [0, 1] and inverted so that higher values correspond to higher shape complementarity matches [22] .
