Health information management software allows individuals to control and share their health data with other users and healthcare experts. Patient health records (PHR) may be intelligently examined to predict patient criticality in healthcare systems. Unauthorized access, privacy, security, key management, and increased keyword query search time all occur when personal health records (PHR) are moved to a third-party semitrusted server. is paper presents security measures for cloud-based personal health records (PHR). e cost of keeping health records on a hospital server grows. is is particularly true in healthcare. As a consequence, keeping PHRs in the cloud helps healthcare institutions save money on infrastructure. e proposed security solutions include an optimized rule-based fuzzy inference system (ORFIS) to determine the patient's criticality. Patients are classified into three groups (sometimes known as protective rings) based on their severity: very critical, less critical, and normal. In trials using the UCI machine learning archive, the new ORFIS outperformed existing fuzzy inference approaches in detecting the criticality of PHR. Using a graph-based access policy and anonymous authentication with a NoSQL database in a private cloud environment improves data storage and retrieval efficiency, granularity of data access, and response time.",

            "text": "Cloud computing is a fast-developing technology that has sparked a slew of technical advancements throughout the information technology sector. It has brought forth unprecedented advancement in a variety of fields. However, as a result of this remarkable expansion, it is susceptible to a wide range of security vulnerabilities, which may harm both the suppliers and the customers of cloud-based services. Cloud-based security concerns largely revolve around the protection of information travelling through and being kept in the cloud, as well as the availability of information, access to information, and privacy of information. A number of different ways to data encryption and service authentication have been developed in order to address these concerns. is section investigates and discusses a variety of such security challenges, as well as potential security solutions that have been used in the industry to enhance cloud security [1] . e taxonomy of cloud security is shown in Figure 1 . Cloud storage solutions are confronted with several security concerns in cloud service models such as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and deployment patterns such as private, public, and hybrid clouds, among other scenarios [2] . ese challenges are divided into two categories: security issues encountered by cloud service providers (CSP) and security issues faced by cloud service customers (CSC). e cloud provider must focus on the infrastructure and data security of its customers, while the user must guarantee that their application is strengthened by using secure authentication methods. Figure 1 represents cloud security. If the cloud service provider wants to prevent unwanted on-site access to CSC data, the actual location of the cloud data centre must be protected by security measures. It is impossible to safeguard data against physical theft with firewalls and encryption alone. Because the CSP is in charge of the physical infrastructure, they should establish and maintain proper infrastructure controls, such as staff training, physical location security, and network firewalls, as well as monitor and maintain these controls. Another point to emphasize is that the CSP is not only responsible for storing and processing data in certain countries but also for complying with the privacy requirements of those nations [3] . e failures linked with the hardware, technology, and services supplied by the CSP are considered to be these risks. Resource sharing, isolation issues, and dangers associated with switching cloud service providers, or portability, are all concerns in the public cloud because of its multi-tenancy capabilities. It is recommended that CSP do routine maintenance and audits on the infrastructure. Inadequate understanding of the applicable jurisdiction, changes in the applicable jurisdiction, contract provisions that are illegal, and continuous legal disputes are all examples of risks related to the law. For example, depending on where you live, certain CSP may be required by law to send over sensitive information if the government so requests it from them [4] . e hazards associated with data security are many and must be taken into account. Data integrity, confidentiality, and availability are the three most important attributes that must be maintained at all times.",

Patient health information may be shared between medical specialists, hospital organizations, academics, and health policymakers using the cloud as a platform for exchanging information [12] . Because of this, it is necessary to implement an access control mechanism for PHR data that is appropriate for the situation. In the current attribute-based encryption system (ABE) [2] , the records are encrypted with users' private key attributes and access policy. which is stored in the cloud. e decryption of health data can be done only when the users have an appropriate matching set of attributes. Anonymous authentication [3] is a phenomenon in which user authentication is done without the knowledge of users' identity, before storing the PHR in the cloud. is is achieved in the proposed leveraged decentralized multiadministrator attribute-based signature (L-D-MA-ABS). However, such cloud-based multiauthority attributebased encryption schemes are vulnerable to attacks. Instead of using the knowledge-rich content that is concealed inside the database to make clinical decisions, physicians frequently rely on their perspective and experience rather than on their perception and experience. A collusion attack throws light on a specific type of attack in which no two users can collude on the access of data or perform self-authentication if they are individually not authorized [5] .",

In light of the extensive study, source authentication is one of the concerns that should be examined in the field of information security. In order to ensure the authenticity of information sources on the Internet, a variety of sophisticated signature techniques, including the ABS, have been made available to users [16] .

As a result, recognizing rules that are satisfied from the rule base is still a work in progress. Selecting just those qualities from the data sets capable of minimizing rule search is done using the already constructed rule sets. With the number of reduced rules, satisfied rules are extracted from the rule base [4] . is algorithm overcomes the problem of rule search where the number of rules in the rule base is very high. e architecture diagram of the proposed ORFIS is shown. In the proposed ORFIS, fuzzy rules are sorted alphabetically that in turn generates the index for sorted fuzzy rules that contains constant attribute and the corresponding index reference [5] . e values of the constant attributes are acquired while adding the record and sent to the index, which returns the number of rules to be searched finally. e information about these constant attributes is present in the metadata repository. For example, each patient can have one type of chest pain at a time, which is denoted as 1 -typical angina, enough to search for the rules having only one type of chest pain [6] . is property is called rule reduction. is process will be repeated until all the attributes are forwarded to the diagnosis logic block. e proposed ORFIS for extracting rules from the rule base and the flowchart for ORFIS is shown in Figure 6 . e effectiveness of ORFIS is analyzed as follows: input I -set of fuzzy rules; 82,944 sample rules are formed; input II -search for rule; chest pain type: asymptomatic angina, blood pressure: low; cholesterol: medium; blood sugar: normal; ECG: hypertrophy; max heart rate: low; old peak: risk; thallium scan: normal, gender: female; and age: very old. In the proposed ORFIS, the algorithm produce index, which is used to generate the Index, has three constant attributes: the kind of chest pain experienced, the results of the thallium scan, and the gender of the person who is experiencing the chest pain. In the sample heart disease data set, there are a total of 82,944 rules that are connected with the chest pain type. e reference index generated using the B+ tree contains four indices, namely indexes 1-4 for each chest pain type, namely asymptomatic angina, atypical angina, nontypical angina, and typical angina that contains 20,736 rules each. Similarly, the next constant attribute in the rule set is thallium scan that includes three types: fixed defect, normal, and reversible defect. e generate index () algorithm takes index 1 with 20,736 rules as input resulting in 6,912 rules for each thallium scan type reference index 11. e third reference index for the constant attribute gender that has two values, namely male and female, contains 3,456 rules each. us, the rule reduction and extraction take place with the B+ tree index and constant attributes in the sample dataset.",

It is addressed the current challenges in personal health records (PHR), such as privacy and security, access control, key management, and the time it takes to search for keywords as well as storage complexity. e suggested system incorporates criticality analysis with ORFIS, which minimizes the amount of time required to search for rules in a rule-based FIS. e suggested secure modified ECC algorithm is used to provide secure access to PHR. When a personal health record (PHR) is transferred to the cloud, security and privacy concerns arise. In order to address the security and privacy concerns, this study presented better attribute-based encryption algorithms for use in both the personal and public domains of personal health records (PHR). Implementing attribute and user revocation procedures in the relevant domains was advised to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to data. Also being developed is enhanced tokenization (ET), which will be used to avoid the collusion attack in multiowner settings with a large number of users. It is recommended to use a graph-based access structure in conjunction with decentralized anonymous authentication of PHR in the cloud to avoid replay attacks and assure privacy preservation in a domain-based PHR environment. When compared to the present ABE, the suggested security techniques increase the efficiency of the PHR domain by 34.79% in terms of encryption, decryption, and key generation time. It has also been shown that the suggested scheme is noncollusive, and the security analysis assures that user privacy and confidence between users and authorities are maintained. is results in an increase in the security of PHR users in a multiowner environment. ese security methods were tested in AVISPA, and the results demonstrated that the PHR configuration is immune to collusion attacks. Furthermore, the suggested ISABE increases the efficiency of the PHR system in the cloud by reducing the complexity of the storage system and the time required for PHR users to search for keywords in a multiowner cloud environment.",
