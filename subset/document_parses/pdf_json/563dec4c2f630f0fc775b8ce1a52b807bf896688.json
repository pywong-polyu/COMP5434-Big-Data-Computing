Success of these efforts is often dependent on effective communication across the One Health disciplines at local, regional, national, and global scales; and among scientists, policy makers, and the public. Historically, human and animal health have been viewed and treated as two distinct disciplines [4] , typically segregated among practitioners, policy makers, and academics despite acknowledgment of their linkages through 'One Medicine' [4] . However, the need to address emerging zoonotic diseases with an interdisciplinary approach has become increasingly Specifically, the following questions were addressed: (1) Are there dissimilarities in key term frequency usage within the AMR published literature across the One health domains;",

Quantifying the scale of language disparities among the One Health domains will improve future searchability and accessibility to create a more inclusive and collaborative understanding, while continuing to promote interdisciplinarity within AMR research. This quantification using neutral and replicable methods necessitated bringing together an interdisciplinary group of scholars across the One Health domains and experts in text data mining (TDM) and natural language processing (NLP). The team performed an open-access search of all One Health and AMR relevant available publications in European PubMed Central (Europe PMC) , and analyzed the results across the three One Health domains (human, animal, environment). This study is novel in its application of natural text parsing and large data analytics to the One Health domains which, to our knowledge, has not been attempted before this effort. By including experts across the One Heath domain with data scientists from project conception through data analysis, this team was able to show the impact of language use dissimilarities on effective communication and publication access across the One Health disciplines.",

We found that when writing about antibiotic resistance, each of the four term bins (Human, Animal, Environment, and the combined bin of One Health) had its own common language (i.e., theme) that did not overlap with the other bins. Additionally, the majority of articles recovered in our search used the term \"antibiotic resistance\" instead of \"antimicrobial resistance,\" regardless of the domain. We also identified temporal trends in language and acronym use from our investigation. The next sections summarize key findings in each of these areas and describe factors that may be important to consider for future research and language harmonization efforts within the One Health domains.",

Using TDM, we analyzed key term frequency within 20,000 representative AMR articles to determine consistent, and at times inconsistent, language use within articles categorized into four independent term bins (Human, Animal, Environmental, and One Health bins). As language use is key to interdisciplinary group dynamics, terminological imprecision can result in dissimilar vocabulary that presents a barrier to moving to the shared cognition required for strategic interdisciplinary problem solving [19, 25, [27] [28] [29] [30] , particularly as it relates to AMR [24] . We identified that when using a consistent search term string, the key term usage deviated amongst the individual domains, with search term clusters shown within each bin ( Figure 1 ). Term frequency and usage becomes increasingly less consistent with articles containing terms from multiple domains. Articles that used human and animal terms in the title and abstract used the term 'human' 2x more and 'ecosystem' 11x less on average within the article body than articles with human and environment title and abstract terms. ContentMine identified search terms that were specific to each of the four bins. However, there was no distinct overlap in the language used across the One health domains. The limited overlap observed in the title and abstract key terms highlights the lack of shared language, and potentially shared cognition, among AMR researchers in different One Health domains ( Figure 1 ).",

In 2013, the Animal and Environmental-associated search terms began to increase, while the humanassociated search term frequency began to decrease in all articles.

This trend correlates with broader adoption of the One Health concept and an increase in funding for animal and environmental AMR research, which began in the late 2000s and is ongoing with the creation of national and international One Health funding programs and initiatives, such as the Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance, the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) AMR Fund, and the US Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA) AMR funding initiative [37] [38] [39] .

The range of One Health associated search terms used in JDS was expected to be smaller compared to the large dataset of open-access journals due to the niche JDS audience. However, the result that the term \"One Health\" was not found in journal articles from JDS may suggest that One Health articles are more likely to be published in journals specifically geared towards the One Health concept rather than in animal-specific journals.

The inherent diversity and potential bias in choosing where to publish highlights the importance of using appropriate search terms and key words to find relevant articles. For example, a scientist studying the effects of antibiotic usage in dairy cows may never find a useful, relevant article if they only searched within animal science and not One Health or environment-associated journals. PLOS ONE, Frontiers in Microbiology, and One Health were the open-access journals that returned the most One Health binned articles in our TDM analysis (Table S3 ). In another example, there were not any One Health binned articles (i.e., one-health, one-medicine) from the British Journal of Cancer, which highlights that articles that specifically use \"One Health\" or \"One Medicine\" in their title/abstract are not publishing in the same journals as the Human, Animal, and Environmental subdisciplines. This finding mirrors what was identified with the JDS case study. As the One Health domains gradually become more communicative and use common language, the focus on where to publish to reach the most researchers in Human, Animal, and Environmental disciplines will become more judicious. To increase communication and common language usage within One Health a preference should be given to publishing open access.",

The search strings used for the four binned groups in this study came from multiple brainstorming sessions with the authors, librarians, and a group of AMR-focused researchers, veterinarians, economists, and extension specialists from a USDA-NIFA funded workshop (detailed at https://osf.io/g7amj/, accessed on 1 April 2021). After using TDM to gather the count frequency of the search terms from the queries, the top 100 words from each domain were analyzed. The NLP analysis identified several terms that were not part of our search queries (Table S8 ). Among these, the word \"cell\" occurred most frequently in all three domains (Human, Animal, and Environment), with \"study,\" \"gene,\" and \"protein\" also found in all three domains. The human and animal group shared four additional terms (\"patient,\" \"cancer,\" \"human,\" and \"expression\"), possibly due to the conceptual links and overall health goals of both human and veterinary medicine. In contrast, the human and environment group only shared one additional term (\"treatment\"). We suspect that the term refers to caring for a patient in the Human domain and processing wastewater in the Environmental domain, another example of how the same word conveys different meanings across One Health teams. The Human and Animal groups each had one word in the top ten list that was unique to their group (\"disease\" and \"level,\", respectively). The Environment group had four terms that were unique, highlighting fundamentally different perspectives and subject matter of the environmental pillar compared to the other two groups. Interestingly, the search term \"resistance\" was within the top ten search terms found only in the Animal and Environmental groups. The top ten words returned among all the binned articles included words specific to molecular research levels (i.e., cell, gene, protein, expression, and cancer) (Table S8) .",

One hypothesis for the unique and rather clumped molecular and medically related terms being more frequently used in all the analyzed articles may be related to funding sources within each domain. . This work identifies a need for researchers to consider using keywords and controlled language that may be outside their discipline, with the understanding that different assumptions and search algorithms of the various databases (Europe PMC, PubMed, Agricola, Scopus, Web of Science, etc.) will not capture all relevant publications across the One Health domains when language use is domain specific.

While this could be coincidental, it is also possible that the resources being used to study AMR within the One Health domains shifted to focus on the influenza outbreak, decreasing antibiotic-resistance related research and ultimately publications in 2009 and beyond [43, 44] . The TDM analysis provided critical insight into a potential shift in research within the One Health domains after the 2009 HIN1 pandemic, which resulted in a 26% decrease in resistance related terms in 2010. At the time of publication of this work, the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 coronavirus is ongoing.

This COVID-19 era highlights the importance of communication and having a common language to inform all stakeholders (i.e., essential workers, health care workers, school teachers etc.) of the current situation. Although AMR research is 20-30 years ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is not a consensus surrounding AMR language within the One Health domains. Similar to the AMR research conducted here, TDM and NLP techniques can be used in the future to understand the beginning trends of COVID-19 research and how common language, or inconsistent language, was used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there is not enough academic literature to conduct this analysis, but in time, this type of study can be used to identify and coalesce a common language for COVID-19 related research without having to wait a quarter of a century to do so.",

GetPapers is an open-source text mining tool, ran on NodeJS, designed to identify and retrieve open-access, peer-reviewed, full-text articles from Europe PMC [51] . GetPapers can pull the full text and metadata from Europe PMC, IEEE, ArXic, and Crossref via their respective APIs (application programming interface). These APIs allow for large scale recursive search and retrieval of articles without the need to manually do so via the website. This enabled automated replicable data collection to mine the large numbers of articles necessary. By using GetPapers, our search queries had the same functionality and parameters as searching those repositories directly with the added benefit of automating the large-scale collection. An example of the GetPapers Europe PMC query syntax can be found in the Supporting Information ( Figure S2 ). Multiple terms related to the same topic, such as \"multi-drug resistance\" and \"antibiotic resistance\" were pulled/retrieved if the domain experts felt that the terms are used interchangeably or in different frequencies within the term bins. The intention of this data pull was to pull as many related articles to these search terms, and redundant terms increased the potential search sample. Each search domain category (Human, Animal, Environment, One Health) is classified as a term bin. The search was restricted to articles written in English. Full-text articles were returned as both PDF and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-formatted files that were binned into groups (i.e., bins), initially, based on the One Health search domains. NodeJS was used to run the ContentMine library. Workflow of the data collection, processing, and visualization is detailed in Figure S3 . Table 1 . Specific search key terms binned by One Health domains used to query and return articles from ContentMine containing the key terms in the title or abstract, with at least one word from the 'AND' row in the article's title or abstract and not articles returned with words from the 'NOT' row. Initially, One Health specific key terms (i.e., one health, one medicine) were included in each binned search query. However, that resulted in the binned queries occasionally returning articles that only contained One Health terms in the title or abstract, and not being related to AMR. These hits artificially raised the total counts per bin without providing data that informed the experimental questions related to AMR language use across the One Health domains. To enhance relevant sample size and text representation in all domains, One Health as a search term was added as a fourth term bin (i.e., domain), and articles were further processed downstream to confirm utilization of One Health terms and utilization with respect to AMR as an additional group (Table 1) .",

To create a workable and representative sample size, up to 2000 articles were pulled from Europe PMC for each search term bin for every year from 2000-2019. Additionally, a data pull was done for each search term bin for the years 1990-1999, again with a 2000 article cap. As there were less articles in Europe PMC during that duration, one pull was sufficient to gather the majority of the articles. All pulled articles were used to create a data lake of up to 168,000 total articles with full text and metadata. It was not possible to search the terms for each bin without yearly constraints, as the EuroPMC API defaults to providing the most recent articles first. By specifying and running multiple queries per term bin, we were able to ensure that every year was represented, and no year was overly represented in the sample, as long as papers with those terms existed during that year. From this article data lake, 5000 randomly selected articles were pulled for each term bin to create a dataset of 20,000 articles for downstream TDM analysis. This created fixed, uniform sample sizes for each term bin that could then be analyzed.",

[52] , the silos that exist within journals that cater to the readership of a specific discipline may limit access to information for interdisciplinary researchers within the One Health context. JDS was chosen as an example disciplinespecific journal, because the manual review of an initial search revealed that the animal domain more frequently had relevant AMR articles in non-open/restricted access journals compared to the other domains surveyed. In addition to its clear categorization within the animal domain of the One Health triad, the JDS data structure allowed for an automated search via EBSCOhost database using the same queries that were used to search Europe PMC via ContentMine. Unlike the millions of open-access articles returned from Europe PMC that were subset into 5,000 articles per topic bin from 1990-2019, the JDS search queries returned 689 Human, 1,853 Animal, 340 Environment, and 14 One Health binned articles.

All search queries, keyword binning, manuscript retrieval and processing methods, script files, and raw data can be found on our Open Science Framework (OSF) site (https://osf.io/g7amj/, accessed on 1 April 2021). While our search queries specified open access articles, which primarily have a CC BY license attached, we have not provided the individual text articles, as the exact copyright requirements for each document cannot be assumed. These search queries are specific and will pull a near identical set to the data we collected. Natural Language Processing (NLP) trained libraries were used to extract data from published peer-reviewed articles. NLP, among other functions, creates structure out of unstructured text through analyzing, understanding, and deriving meaning from human written language [53] . Using NLP can give researchers insight into the meaning, purpose, sentiment, and more of natural (i.e., human-written) text information that was previously locked primarily behind individual or group manual interpretation. Downloaded PDFs were first converted to plain text files using the python package pdf2text. The NLP package NLTK (www.nltk.org) was then used to create consistency with letter case style, remove punctuation, tokenize, remove stop words, and lemmatize the text. Lemmatization, in NLP context, means to reduce alternate forms of a word, for example \"am\", \"are\", and \"is\" are all grouped together under the verb \"be\", and \"cars\", \"car\", and \"car's\" are all grouped together under the noun \"car.\"",

Terms that were comprised of two or more words (i.e., antibiotic resistance) were counted with text processed in bi-grams. The total number of words per article was used to provide a percentage of term counts related to each unique article. Percentages based on the total word count were used to standardize against differing article lengths. Data were trimmed to remove articles that comprised the bottom and top 10% of search term frequencies. This was done to further normalize the data and omit outliers (i.e., a 48-page review on antibiotic usage in agriculture and related public health implications that used the word \"resistance\" 409 times (PMC6017557, [54] ) compared to the average and standard deviation term count (16 \u00b1 28) across all articles analyzed.",

            "text": "Using TDM methods, our study highlights what many researchers in the One Health domains already perceive with respect to AMR: we do not communicate well outside of our trained disciplines, and this is reflected in the peer-reviewed literature. This is in part due to the differences in our use of key search terms, where we publish, and how we identify interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research articles. Moving forward, we suggest the following for authors publishing AMR-related research within the One Health context: (1) increase title/abstract searchability by including both antimicrobial and antibiotic related search terms; (2) include \"One Health\" in the title/abstract and keywords; and (3) prioritize publishing open-access. Additionally, we suggest that in order to bridge the gap between the One Health domains, researchers need to incorporate specific, and multiple, search terms when looking for relevant AMR research (i.e., include both antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance term groups). Table 1 from this study can be used as a guide for choosing relevant terms. Throughout this article, we specifically chose to use antimicrobial resistance as our key term to include bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral resistance representation, following the common language used by the World Health Organization (WHO) for AMR global action plan and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). While we chose to use AMR here, our study found that antibiotic resistance was the more frequently used key term, suggesting that the use of different derivatives of this term (i.e., antimicrobial, multidrug, etc.) may not be accessed by One Health researchers actively searching for antibiotic and not antimicrobial. The keywords used to collect the articles, and in turn the data used, were intentionally terms that are broadly used throughout the One Health domain. This study acts as a first milestone on this research, reaffirming the notion that disparate language use within One Health is prohibitory towards collaboration and crosstalk between domains. With that milestone, a crucial next step will be to replicate this research and data collection with a new list of terms specific to one domain or research area to isolate examples of this happening, and begin qualifying and quantifying the language discrepancies.",

Further, these methods, both search term frequency and context, can be incorporated when analyzing writing intended for a greater audience (i.e., not solely peer-reviewed articles). This study can be scaled to include consumer and extension databases, web pages, blogs, and trade magazines to understand how AMR is communicated to those outside academia. Our python scripts have been made open source and are readily adaptable to new search terms, articles, or domains, enabling future language studies by researchers seeking to understand how topics and terms differ across disciplinary lines. Additionally, the links to our interactive Tableau dashboards can be found on our OSF site (https://osf.io/g7amj/, accessed on 1 April 2021). The strength of NLP lies in the fact that it can be used to predict the direction of the field based on past research. We hope that once a common language is established within One Health for AMR research, NLP can be used to predict the gaps and next steps to holistically address AMR globally through team science that is truly interdisciplinary; this starts with understanding differences in language use and language context.

However, most Animal and Environmental AMR funding sources (i.e., US USDA, and US CDC) do not require research to be published open access. Promotion of open-access publishing among the animal and environmental domains could partially address this gap. 2.5.4. Implications for Accessing the Literature Given the differences in language use among the domains and over time, barriers likely exist for researchers to access publications from different disciplines. Differences exist in how major search engines identify publications based on keywords and/or controlled language [41]. For example, in PubMed, a search for antibiotic resistance returns the following search: \"drug resistance, microbial\" [MeSH Terms] OR antibiotic resistance [Text Word]. In contrast, a search for antimicrobial resistance returns a different search string: \"anti-infective agents\" [All Fields] OR \"anti-infective agents\" [MeSH Terms] OR antimicrobial [Text Word] AND resistance [All Fields]",
