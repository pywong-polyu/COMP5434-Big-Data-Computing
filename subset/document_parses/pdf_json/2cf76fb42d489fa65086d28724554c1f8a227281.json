Most patients have a mild disease course, while approximately 20% have moderate to severe disease, often requiring hospitalization and, in some cases, care in the intensive care unit. By investigating a perceived increased rate of indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus results in hospitalized COVID patients, we demonstrate that severely ill COVID-19 patients have at least a 6-fold reduction of interferon gamma (IFN-g) levels compared to control patients. What is more, over 60% of these severely ill COVID-19 patients' peripheral T cells were found to be unable to produce measurable IFN-g when stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a potent IFN-g mitogen, reflected by an indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus result. This defect of IFN-g production was independent of absolute lymphocyte counts and immunosuppressive therapy. It was associated with increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), which was a predictor of patient outcomes for our cohort when measured early in the course of disease. Finally, in a subset of COVID-19 patients, we found elevated IL-10 levels in addition to IL-6 elevation. In addition to finding a significant limitation of interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) testing in severely ill COVID-19 patients, these data provide evidence that many of these patients demonstrate a focused Th2 immune response with inhibition of IFN-g signaling and, in many cases, significant elevations of IL-6.",

To determine if an indeterminate IFN-g control result was associated with overall mortality, we compared the overall probability of survival using a Kaplan-Meier estimator of survival and found there was no statistical difference between COVID-19 patient IFN-g production measured by IGRA and survival outcome within our cohort (Fig. 4B) . It is clear from the Kaplan-Meier estimate that most of these patients are critically ill, with a survival rate of 70.6% in the acceptable IFN-g control patients versus 72.7% survival in the indeterminate IFN-g control patient group over the course of 10 weeks, which is typically observed among critically ill COVID-19 patient cohorts (13, 14) .

These levels of IL-6 are often seen during overwhelming bacterial sepsis or in cytokine release syndrome (15, 16) . Additionally, we found that nine of the 34 patients (27%) had cytokine levels greater than 400 pg/ml (the maximum measurable concentration for our assay). While not statically significant (P = 0.766), we found that COVID-19 patients who had indeterminate IFN-g controls had a median concentration of serum IL-6 of 84.4 pg/ml and a mean of 128 pg/ml (standard deviation [SD], 6142; standard errors of the means [SEM], 630.9) versus patients with acceptable IFN-g.

We found that our surviving patients had significantly (P = 0.039) lower levels of IL-6 at the time point near or at the time IGRA samples were drawn. This supports the hypothesis that IL-6 serum levels are good predictors of patient outcomes. Exploring further if high concentrations of IL-6 could be associated with mortality, we excluded patients with IL-6 levels below 100 pg/ml taken at the time of or near IGRA sample collection. As expected, there was no difference between these survival groups (Fig. 5C) . Interestingly, there is a subset of survivors that also had IL-6 levels that were above 400 pg/ml at given time points during hospitalization. Many of these high IL-6 measurements above 400 pg/ml occurred later in the disease course, whereas the IL-6 levels measured in Fig. 5C in our deceased patients were typically measured early in the disease course. These analyses provide evidence that higher serum concentrations of IL-6 early in the course of disease, specifically those above 100 pg/ml, are associated with increased risk for COVID-19 mortality.",

We identified seven patients in our study cohort that had this additional data ( Table 2 ). Six of these seven patients demonstrated serum IL-6 levels above the normal reference range of 2.0 pg/ml (or 5 pg/ml, depending on the platform the assay was performed on). Similar to the previously discussed results, we found that patients with IL-6 levels higher than the reference range did worse, based on the WHO clinical progression scale for COVID-19, and that the severity of their disease was loosely associated with the degree of IL-6 elevation. Not surprisingly, all seven patients had IFN-g levels below the threshold level of the test, including all those who tested negative with IGRA. Overall, the IFN-g results further demonstrate that many patients with COVID-19 have diminished IFN-g levels systemically. Of our patients for whom multiple cytokine measurements were performed, we found the only other cytokine that appeared to be elevated consistently was IL-10. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that none of the severely ill patients in our COVID-19 cohort had elevations in Th1 cytokines.

As a result, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection, through some direct or indirect mechanism(s), subverts the ability of peripheral T cells to generate IFN-g. Indeed, similar to previous reports (8), we found that both the indeterminate and acceptable IFN-g COVID-19 patient groups in our study were lymphopenic; however, only the indeterminate group failed to generate adequate IFN-g in response to phytohemagglutinin, indicating there is a qualitative difference in the population of the T cells between these two groups. As a cytokine, IFN-g is important for humoral and innate immune responses and T-cell differentiation, and it has been hypothesized that regulation of the immune system is altered during COVID-19 infection (8, 9, 17) . IGRAs have become one of the preferred methods for high-throughput screening of patients and staff for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) (18, 19) . As such, it is a test of choice when patients exhibit respiratory disease symptomology, and tuberculosis is considered in the differential diagnosis. This study demonstrates that IGRA may be limited as an adequate tool for the detection of LTBI in patients with active COVID-19. Additionally, other IGRAs, such as T-spot.TB, might be similarly affected in COVID-19-infected patients.",

Decreased production or the inability to produce IFN-g may have hindered these patients in our study from generating an effective Th1 immune response. This hypothesis is supported by our observations in the seven patients who had a cytokine panel performed that showed no measurable increase in Th1 cytokines, IFN-g, IL-2, IL-2R, and IL-12. Thus, using a model of Th1 versus Th2 immune response, the COVID-19positive patients in our cohort demonstrated a shift toward the Th2-based response, with most COVID-19 patients demonstrating an increase in the Th2 cytokine IL-6 and a subset of COVID-19 patients demonstrating increased IL-6 and IL-10 levels. However, it must be noted that this was not a robust Th2 response, since other Th2 cytokines, specifically IL-4 and IL-5, were not increased in any of the seven COVID-19 patients who had these cytokines measured. Nevertheless, it is interesting that a Th2-directed immune response is known to promote type 1 hypersensitivity (21, 24) . Therefore, it is possible that promoting a Th2 immune phenotype leads to a hypersensitivity-like immune response that could promote lung and other organ injury, as observed in many severe COVID-19 cases (25) . Future studies will need to be performed to better test this hypothesis. Studies have reported (8, 16, 17, 23) that severely ill patients with COVID-19 have findings consistent with a cytokine storm. This has resulted in many COVID-19 patients being treated with pan-immunosuppression via steroids. Moreover, other studies have demonstrated that IL-6 is elevated in patients with COVID-19, and this has resulted in patients also being treated with IL-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab (19, 26) . Finally, IL-6 has been shown by several studies (27, 28) to be upregulated in COVID-19 patients, especially those who are critically ill. When comparing the levels of serum IL-6 between survivors and nonsurvivors (Fig. 5B) , we found that patients who succumbed during the course of disease had significantly higher concentrations of IL-6. Based on data from our patients, it seems that serum IL-6 levels are most predictive of disease course outcome when taken early in the acute phase of infection.",

Our cohort is composed of COVID-19 patients with worse disease course, composed mainly of severely ill COVID-19 patients in the ICU. Our observations, especially those from the cytokine panel, are from a small sample size. While these findings provide additional data to the existing literature, future studies will need to be completed to confirm our findings. Finally, there is the confounding variable of immunosuppressive therapies or immunosuppressive conditions in the COVID-19 patients included in our study, as nearly all patients that had elevated IL-6 levels were treated with tocilizumab.",
