Early estimation of mortality risk is crucial to decide which patients need prompt treatment or might have self-limiting disease. Current triage systems and early warning scores in the ED mainly focus on deviating vital signs and less on underlying disease or comorbidity. 2 3 Comorbidity can increase the risk to acquire an infection especially if altering the immune function (eg, in case of diabetes mellitus, malignancy, chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or HIV). 4 However, less is known about whether presenting comorbidity in the ED also affects outcome due to infection and, if so, on which term. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a chart review instrument that assigns weights to seventeen comorbidities and age in order to estimate mortality risk. 5 6 The CCI was developed in 1987 to predict 1-year mortality and was validated during a 10-year follow-up. Weights were updated in 2011 based on relative risk of in-hospital mortality, resulting in a reduced index with twelve comorbidities. 6 The CCI was previously proposed as an",

Combining the NEWS with the CCI yielded the highest predictive performance for short-term mortality. However, this increasing trend was largely explained by adding age to the NEWS, and not much by adding comorbidities to the NEWS. An explanation for the improving prediction by age can be that elderly are less resilient to cope with stressors such as a serious infection, for example, due to immunosenescence 26 or sarcopenia. 27 This hypothesis corresponds to previous research about tolerance to surgery in elderly 28 and was also observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. 29 Our study has limitations. We used retrospectively collected data making our study prone to bias. However, the quality of available data was high as all data used was essential for daily clinical practice. We had no data on measures for frailty (ie, weight loss, mobility, muscle weakness), which can be useful to further characterise the effect of age on short-term mortality. Also, we chose to select all patients with a blood culture-proven infection in the ED to represent a patient group with true serious infection, thus missing culture negative infections. Finally, our study was performed in a tertiary care centre and, therefore, the prevalence of (complex) underlying comorbidity and the risk of adverse outcome is likely higher compared with lower level care centres.
