At present, vaccine immunity is still the most effective method to control the spread of PED. In this study, we have constructed a novel recombinant L. casei-OMP16-PEDVS strain expressing PEDVS protein of PEDV and OMP16 protein of Brucella abortus strain. To know the immunogenicity of the recombinant L. casei-OMP16-PEDVS candidate vaccine, it was compared with BL21-OMP16-PEDVS-F, BL21-OMP16-PEDVS, and BL21-PEDVS recombinant protein.",

Pigs of all ages can be infected with different symptoms and the mortality rate in piglets is up to 100% [3] , which have led to huge economic losses all around the world. To control the spread of PEDV, most kinds of vaccines are constructed, such as aluminumhydroxide-adjuvanted inactivated vaccine, bivalent inactivated Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) and PEDV vaccine, and attenuated PEDV vaccine [4] . Although these vaccines play an important role in controlling PED, they all have their defects. Inactivated vaccines cannot activate cellular immune responses, attenuated vaccine is not very safe, and they all cannot induce sufficient production of virus-specific IgA antibodies of mucosal immune responses. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to develop a new vaccine to control PED.",

Meanwhile, it can be used as a delivery system to regulate the T-helper cell response and stimulate the secretion of specific IgAs for mucosal immunity [6] . On the other hand, Lactobacillus casei recombinant vaccine is easier administration, lesser chance of hypersensitivity reaction, and more costeffective compared with traditional vaccines. Based on the reports, Lactobacillus casei recombinant vaccines have been successfully used in the prevention and control of human papillomavirus, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Escherichia coli [7] [8] [9] . There are also some similar attempts in designing of PED vaccines. The researches find that a recombinant Lactococcus lactis strain expressing a variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus S1 gene could induce high levels of IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 in immunized mice [10] . Lactobacillus casei-based anti-PEDV vaccine expressing microfold cell-targeting peptide Co1 fused with the COE antigen of PEDV could also induce effective immune response [11] . To improve the effectiveness of PEDV vaccine. In this study, we construct a new Lactobacillus casei recombinant vaccine of PED, which can stimulate stronger mucosal, humoural and cellular immune responses against PEDV infection via oral administration.",

However, traditional vaccines are all designed based on CV777 classical strain which cannot supply sufficient protection to PEDV variant [4] . To control the spread of PEDV and reduce the economic losses, novel vaccines of PEDV variant strains are also designed. At present, PEDV inactivated vaccine and attenuated vaccine of PEDV variant strains are all approved by Chinese government and there are all exhibiting promising prospects in controlling PED. But defects are also existed in the two kinds of novel vaccines. PEDV infects swine through the digestive tract and has intestinal tissue tropism. Therefore, Mucosal immunity is more effective than systemic immunity in preventing PEDV entry into intestinal epithelial cells, and vaccines must provide mucosal protection effectively in the intestinal tract. So, In this study, we construct a new kind of vaccine which can stimulate stronger anti-PEDV-specific IgG and sIgA antibodies. Lactobacillus casei has potential immune-modulatory properties as a vaccine delivery vehicle and the expression of bioactive compounds on the cell wall of this Fig. 3 The IgG antibody levels of candidate vaccines in the serum of immunized mice. Serum was collected on days 0, 14, and 28 days before or after immunization and examined via commercial ELISA kits and measured at an absorbance of 450 nm.

It is widely used for expressing several heterologous antigens of human papillomavirus, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Escherichia coli as vaccines in animal models, which all showed excellent immunogenicity [7] [8] [9] . Compared with the inactivated vaccine and attenuated vaccine, the Lactobacillus casei vector vaccine can also stimulate higher IgA level and cellular immune response. Studies have shown that IgA's first line of defense in the intestine would be better than IgG in protecting piglets from PEDV infection [10, 30] . Therefore, it is promising to develop a kind of Lactobacillus casei vector vaccine of PED.",

The core neutralizing epitope (COE) can induce strong neutralizing antibodies against PEDV [31, 32] . Combining with the antigenicity analysis, a partial sequence of the S1 gene (1477-2124 bp) was selected to construct the recombinant plasmid. The selected small fragment was proved that not only had good immunogenicity but also contributed to the secreted expression of Lactobacillus casei. On the other hand, Pasquevich found that Brucella abortus outer membrane protein 16 could activate dendritic cells in vivo, induces a th1 immune response, and was a promising self-adjuvanting vaccine against systemic and oral acquired brucellosis [15] . Similar research that unlipidated outer membrane protein omp16 from Brucella spp. as nasal adjuvant could induce a th1 immune response and modulates the th2 allergic response to cow's milk proteins was also proved [16] . Therefore, a partial sequence of the omp16 gene was chosen to construct recombinant plasmid to enhance to immune function in our study.",

But the IgA and neutralizing antibody levels were obviously higher than that of in BL21-OMP16-PEDVS-F, BL21-OMP16-PEDV S, and BL21-PEDVS recombinant vaccine immunized mice. The results showed that L. casei-OMP16-PEDVS could induce stronger humoral immune responses, especially IgA antibody level.
