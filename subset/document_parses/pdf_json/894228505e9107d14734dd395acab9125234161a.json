            "text": "Containing the spread of the virus relies on diagnostic tests particularly in identifying asymptomatic infection. There are two main diagnostic approaches for SARS-CoV-2. The first and still considered the most accurate approach detects viral RNA by PCR amplification using DNA primers and reverse transcription [7] . RT-PCR and qPCR are considered the gold standard by the FDA and ECDC due to their superior sensitivity and specificity. Improvements in sensitivity and simplicity have come from loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [8] . The second method is to directly detect viral components (antigens) most commonly a specific viral protein not found in uninfected humans. Antigen tests are commonly found in point-of-care devices used to diagnose several respiratory pathogens, including bacterial (streptoccocal), viral (influenza, HIV) and parasitic (malaria) infections [9] . Such point-of-care assay devices are now in widespread use for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection [10] . Antigen tests in these devices often originate from laboratory-based sandwich enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). These systems employ a capture agent and a detection agent; the requirement is that both bind to non-overlapping regions of the antigen. Antibodies are most commonly used in ELISA tests due to their high sensitivity, specificity, established manufacturing processes and safety. The sensitivity of ELISA is dependent on factors including the binding affinity between antigen and the antibodies, the selectivity of the antibodies (no non-specific interactions or off-target binding), and whether antigen-capture leads to occlusion of the other epitope and the colour change system. In point-of-care devices (also known as lateral flow immunoassays (LFIs)), the capture antibodies are often immobilized on nitrocellulose and the probe antibody, modified with a colorimetric nanoparticle, is incubated with the test sample, thus becoming the 'mobile phase' of the device. Thus, in addition to the constraints of ELISA, there are important technological and manufacturing factors that need attention to develop a diagnostic device [11] . However, where lateral flow devices are intended to give only a positive or negative result, ELISA-based systems are inherently quantitative and have a wide dynamic range. There are currently 36 approved lateral flow devices that have passed regulatory evaluation in the UK. Nanobodies (Nbs, also known as the V H Hs) are the variable antigen-binding region that arise in single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) derived from a single heavy chain antibody variant found in camelids and in cartilaginous fish. The small size (13-15 kDa) and stability of nanobodies makes them an attractive alternative to antibodies. Nanobodies have revolutionized structural biology, and have entered clinical trials as therapies and tools [12] . We have previously reported nanobodies derived by DNA shuffling affinity maturation from a parent nanobody, identified from a naive llama V H H library that bind to the Spike protein [13] . One of these, H4, was shown to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with nM potency [13] . We have recently reported another set of nanobodies with pM binding affinity (agents C1, F2, C5) [14] . Structural analysis of nanobodies revealed that one group (cluster 2 antibodies [15] ) (H4, C5) bound to an epitope on the RBD that overlapped with the ACE2 binding epitope [13, 14] . A second group (cluster 1 antibodies [15] ) (C1, F2) bound to a non-overlapping epitope at a different location on RBD [14] . This second site was first disclosed by the potent neutralizing human antibody CR3022 [16, 17] . We have previously shown when CR3022 and H4 were combined they gave additive neutralization [13] .",

We switched to use 3,3 0 ,5,5 0tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrate of HRP, since this commercially available molecule has higher sensitivity and faster colour development than ABTS [19] . We found that H4-Fc-HRP when used as the probe gave unreliable detection results. Dot blotting of H4-Fc-HRP with other nanobodies suggested it may have non-specific interactions; the other nanobodies did not show this behaviour. The results from the various remaining combinations are given in table 1 and figure 3. The estimated LOD varied from 5 \u00d7 10 3 pg ml \u22121 (biotin x -H4-Fc, C1-Fc-HRP) down to 200 pg m \u22121 (biotin x -C5-Fc, C1-Fc-HRP) depending on the combination (table 1). As LOD is dependent on the standard deviation (s.d.) of replicates, the slope of linear regression was used in place, with a higher regression value indicating greater sensitivity. The biotin x -C5-Fc, F2-Fc-HRP gave a regression gradient (79)comparable to the reverse pairing biotin x -F2-Fc, C5-Fc-HRP-but since the former combination had higher overall absorbance, it was selected as the optimal combination.",

Previous studies have used this method for site-specific conjugation of radioactive probes, fluorescent dyes as well as introducing orthogonal functional tags in the Fc region of antibodies [22] . Since the capture nanobody, namely C5Fc, used in our ELISA is fused with an Fc tail and hence has the conserved 'tag' sequences, we decided to employ enzymatic transglutamination to specifically functionalize the glutamine residue of the PREEQYNST sequence in the Fc region (figure 5a). In order to better expose the target glutamine residue for reaction, we cleaved the N-linked glycans using PNGase F digestion. Amine-PEG3-Biotin was added to the PNGase digested antibodies along with the transglutaminase enzyme and incubated at 37\u00b0C. The progress of the reaction was monitored by mass spectrometry (figure 5b and electronic supplementary material, figure S6 ). In addition to the required product, we consistently observed another product in our reactions which showed a loss of mass of 15 Da. We believe that the addition of an internal lysine residue was a competing reaction which resulted in the observed product with a loss of mass when compared to the deglycosylated C5-Fc.",

We concluded either V H H was not readily adsorbed onto the plate or when absorbed onto the plate its binding site was obscured. Other workers [24] targeting a different protein have observed similar issues with V H H domains and drawn similar conclusions. Switching to biotinylated protein and streptavidin-coated plates gave much better results. The use of Fc fusion simplifies the biotinylation strategy since the Fc portion has multiple lysine residues, enabling rapid amine functionalization using standard protocols. Furthermore, the Fc region has native conserved residues which can be tagged enzymatically to afford selective biotinylation with advantages of better surface orientation. We identified the optimal combination for detection of Spike protein to consist of biotin x -C5-Fc as the capture agent with F2-Fc-HRP as the probe agent. This combination gave an LOD of 514 pg ml \u22121 (table 1) . The ELISA showed a linear response indicating it would be suitable for reliably quantitating Spike. Other nanobody combinations also gave a LOD below 1000 pg ml \u22121 , demonstrating their high specificity. By using site-selective biotinylation the LOD was reduced to 147 pg ml \u22121 for Spike protein. The use of the nanobody pairs thus gave an ELISA that is simple to use as a laboratory tool to monitor the heterologous production of Spike protein. We have shown that C5 has a potent therapeutic effect when administered topically or intraperitoneally to hamsters [14] . This, combined with our previous observation of additive neutralization between non-overlapping neutralizing agents [13] , suggests that C1 or F2 could be effective in combination with C5.",

The C1 nanobody was shown to bind equally well to multiple variants of the virus [14] . Repeating the assay with the beta and delta variant RBD (electronic supplementary material, figure S7 ) shows as expected that the delta variant RBD is detected but the beta variant RBD is not. The advantage of nanobodies is that they are relatively straightforward to raise (either by llama immunization [14] or phage display approaches [13] ) against new antigens in comparison to their human antibodies.

We also obtained evidence that the assay was sensitive to the 'quality' of protein, virus inactivated by FA (which is expected to chemically alter the binding epitopes) was not detected. SARS-CoV-2 virus inactivated with the mild detergent Empigen [24] was detected with a sensitivity of 103 ffu ml \u22121 (140 TCID50 ml \u22121 ). We excluded the possibility that Empigen was responsible for the gain by showing it had no effect on the detection of Spike protein (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ). Using the reported estimate of 1000 virons in an ffu [27] , 25 spikes in each virion [28] and 600 kDa as the weight of the Spike trimer, this corresponds to around 30 pg of Spike per ml. We attribute this 20-fold gain the polyvalent presentation of the Spike protein on the viral membrane and thus we gain from avidity. Pseudovirus, where the protein is presented on the viral membrane, was detected at 21 TCID50 ml \u22121 , the very low threshold consistent with an avidity driving a gain in the sensitivity of the ELISA. figure S4 . Absorbance values above the dotted line were not actually measured, rather the sample was first diluted then measured. In order to probe the robustness of the assay, we used four independent batches of heat-Empigen inactivated SARS-CoV-2 with our site-selective C5-Fc-SS-biotin. These viral batches varied by the time harvested post-infection (72 h or 48 h) and host cells for propagations (Vero CCL81 or Vero E6-TMPRSS2). We observed a weak correlation between incubation time and ELISA sensitivity, with longer incubations tending to lower limits of detection. Since purified RBD and Spike proteins give highly consistent results, we attribute the observed assay variability to viral batches. The observed LOD ranged from 16 ffu ml \u22121 to 69 ffu ml \u22121 (electronic supplementary material, figure S4 ). In absolute terms, the C5-Fc-SS-biotin and F2-Fc-HRP combination was able to detect less than 7 ffu of heat-Empigen inactivated virus.",

Nanobodies themselves have been engineered in other multivalent forms, including trimers [30] .

A viscous carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) overlay was added and plates incubated a further 22 h. The medium was then removed, monolayers fixed with 4% FA (30 min), and cells stained for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid by a standard primary/secondary-HRP procedure. Titre was measured as focus-forming units per ml (ffu ml \u22121 ) [31] . Pseudovirus was produced by co-transfection of HEK-293T cells with a pNL4-3 (\u0394Env, luciferase) lentiviral plasmid and a plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike gene. Transfection was with polyethylenimine (PEI) for 4 h. After which, cells were washed, fresh media (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% P/S) applied and virus production left to proceed for 48 h. The virus was harvested by pooling supernatant and concentration by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. Titration of pseudovirus was performed by infecting cells overexpressing ACE2 (MDCK-ACE2) for 48 h with a limiting dilution of virus stock. The readout was by standard luciferase assay of cell lysate, with each well classified as positive or negative for infection. Titre was measured in units of TCID50 ml \u22121 . Inactivation of infectious virus stocks was carried out either by FA fixation or combined heat/detergent inactivation. For FA fixation: 32% stock solution was mixed with virus sample to achieve a final 4% FA concentration and incubated for 30 min before removal from the CL3 facility. For heat/detergent inactivation: Empigen detergent was diluted in MilliQ water to a 5% solution. This was mixed 1 : 10 with the virus sample (final Empigen concentration 0.5%). The sample was then heated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C.",

Briefly, the virus was irradiated with 11 kGy of X-rays at +4\u00b0C using a MultiRad 225 KeV system (Precision X-rays, USA). Absorbed dose was collected in real time using a UNIDOS E reference dosimeter fitted with a Semiflex 31010 ionization chamber. Inactivation of the virus was demonstrated by a reduction of 6-logs in infectivity post-inactivation and monitoring cytopathic effect and viral mRNA over three serial 7-day passages each in Vero E6 cells.

Instead, we tested intact pseudotyped NL4.3 HIV-1 backbone virus displaying surface SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins. This pseudovirus is based on the genomic backbone of HIV-1, with two frameshifts which render it Env (viral envelope protein) negative and Vpr (viral protein R) negative. Without the expression of these two proteins, this clone is competent for a single round of replication and non-infectious. Our lower LOD was 21 TCID50 ml \u22121 of infectious pseudotyped virus (figure 4a, table 2).
