Although most of the times characterized by a favorable prognosis, when particularly severe COVID-19 is associated with acute respiratory failure, significant hypoxemia and high mortality rate [2] . SARS-CoV2 has been classified among those causes potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [3, 4] . In previous observations [5] , a substantially high compliance was described in mechanically ventilated patients affected by COVID-19 ARDS, emphasizing the atypical nature of COVID-19 ARDS compared to classical ARDS. This difference has not been confirmed by more recent studies [6] . To which extent COVID-19 ARDS differs from a classical ARDS and whether this difference matters from a diagnostic and therapeutic point of view is still an unsolved and highly debated issue [7] [8] [9] . The mechanisms leading to the evolution of lung injury toward the most severe forms of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 still need better clarification. The asymptomatic hypoxemic hyperpnoea and high respiratory drive leading to patient self-induced lung injury (P-SILI) [10, 11] , as well as the activation of a cytokine storm [12] , have been proposed as potential causes leading the progress of lung injury in COVID-19 patients. To date, no data fully support these hypotheses [13, 14] .",

The extension of each lung compartment was expressed as percentage of the total lung volume analyzed in a given chest CT slice (defined in Figs. 2 and 3 as % of total lung volume). The extension of pathologically altered lung was defined as the sum of hypoinflated and non-inflated (atelectatic) parenchyma [24, 25] distributed in not-dependent or external regions. For each of the 20 slices selected per CT scan, lung volume, gas volume and lung weight have been calculated according to established methods [21, 22, 26] applying the following equations: Table 1 Descriptive statistics of all COVID-19 patients included in the study Data were reported as median values (IQR) or numerosity (%).

In particular, spontaneous breathing for longer than 14 days from the onset of symptoms, a high tidal volume and a longer stay on the ventilator were associated with a progress of lung injury. Moreover, the magnitude of COVID-19-associated lung injury correlated with several clinical features describing patients' ability to oxygenate, ventilate and regulate fluid balance. Correlations between lung injury, inflammatory and thrombotic markers have been observed.",

            "text": "COVID-19-associated lung injury showed a specific sub-pleural distribution ( Fig. 2 and Additional file 2: Figure S1 ) coexisting with a varying involvement of the core areas of the lung. This confirmed what has been previously described in a qualitative manner [7, 8, 20] . However, our results did not support a strict division between two respiratory phenotypes [7] , but rather a more gradual evolution from a subpleural to a more central distribution of lung injury [8] . The prominent subpleural distribution was confirmed for both dependent and non-dependent lung regions and so unrelated to a gravitational distribution, which means we could exclude confounding by atelectasis and pleural effusion that typically affect the dependent regions of the lung. As already known, normoinflation was mainly distributed in subpleural regions [28] . To date, the reasons for a primary distribution of COVID-19-associated lung injury on subpleural regions are not fully clarified. Gattinoni and coworkers [7] speculated about the possibility that subpleural regions are areas of interface between lung structures with different elastic proprieties, hence converging higher stress and strain [29] . A complementary explanation is provided by the physics of the deposition of inhaled viral particles. Particles of the size of the virion (0.15 \u03bcm), deposit mainly in the terminal alveolar region [30] , being scarcely affected by inertial impaction or gravitational sedimentation on airways walls. The following phase is characterized by an inflammatory pattern that spreads centripetally, possibly following the direction imposed by the ciliar beats on mucus and the watery periciliary liquid [31] . The higher proportion of injured central regions of the lung after 14 days of spontaneous breathing has been demonstrated in our study (Fig. 3) .",

Hypothesizing a causal association between these variables, one can speculate that the exposure to invasive ventilation can favor the progress of lung injury in COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure as previously shown in other forms of ARDS [32] . However, an alternative explanation may be that patients with more advanced lung disease are more likely to need invasive ventilatory support compared to patients with a milder lung disease. For those patients undergoing invasive ventilation, we found that a less protective tidal volume [33] , higher than 6 mL/kg PBW, was linked to an extended lung injury visible by CT (Fig. 3) .",

A longer period of spontaneous breathing (more than 14 days) between the onset of the respiratory symptoms and the CT scan in patients in need of intensive care was associated with a progression of lung injury. Patients spontaneously breathing for less than 14 days may include patients intubated early, thereby having longer controlled ventilation as well as patients in an earlier stage of COVID-19. Therefore, injurious consequences of a prolonged uncontrolled spontaneous breathing ventilation for those patients that after 14 days of acute respiratory failure are still in need of intensive care can be hypothesized. The hyperpnoea, characterizing the COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure, can be associated with an increased and dangerous transpulmonary pressure [34] . This prolonged high-stress ventilation, combined with the fluid leak characterizing the inflammatory state to which the lung is exposed, can in the end lead to P-SILI [32, 35] .",

Our results do not support this more liberal ventilatory approach. Recent studies indicate the importance of a protective ventilation in ARDS patients [14, 39] , including COVID-19 patients [14] .

A recent study by Grasselli and coworkers [14] shows that high plasma D-dimers are correlated to high 28-day mortality in COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure. A number of changes toward a pro-thrombotic state, including an increased level of D-dimers and activation of the lectin pathway of complement activation, have been observed in patients with severe COVID-19 [45, 46] . The correlation found between lung injury and D-dimers was consistent with a spread phenomenon of pulmonary micro-thrombosis observed in histological studies [47] . Nonetheless, the activation of a pro-thrombotic state at the alveolar level is one of the events characterizing all forms of ARDS and leading to the intra-alveolar fibrin deposition, vascular injury and micro-thrombi occurrence [48] .",

The subgroup of patients selected for the radiological investigations was sicker compared to the whole cohort, showing higher 20 day mortality (36% vs 16%) and SAPS3 (57 vs 51) ( Table 1) . Positive end-expiratory pressure levels and other ventilatory settings selected during the acquisition of chest CT scans varied depending on best clinical practice, adding an element of heterogeneity in the comparisons of different CT scans ( Table 2 ). The CT scans were performed on clinical indication. The consequent non-standardized approach derived from the good clinical practice guidelines in force during the first pandemic wave when local and international routines for management and transportation of critically ill COVID-19 patients were still under development. Patients numerosity as well as the number of chest CT scans usable for the current analysis was limited by the necessity of including only chest CT scans acquired without contrast agent. The contrast mean can variably alter the HU scale depending on its blood concentration and the regional distribution of tissue. The inclusion of images containing contrast would have introduced a further source of heterogeneity whose resolution would have required rely upon assumptions and analysis whose complexity is beyond the scopes of the present contribution. The lack of a control group with classical ARDS made the comparison between COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure and other forms of ARDS impossible. The correlations tested in this study did not necessarily imply causality. The choice of 14 days for estimating the influence of timing of mechanical ventilation is based on the evidence that in different studies this is the time point within which the most of the patients are intubated [27, 49] .",

In a cohort of COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure, a predominant subpleural distribution of lung injury was observed, associated with a variable involvement of more central regions. COVID-19-associated lung injury correlated with: 1) exposure to mechanical ventilation, 2) ventilatory patterns potentially leading to P-SILI, 3) prothrombotic conditions. The practical implications of the present study are: 1) chest CT is useful to infer the course of the disease; 2) long duration of spontaneous breathing and high tidal volumes in critically ill COVID-19 patients may increase the spread of lung alterations centripetally.
