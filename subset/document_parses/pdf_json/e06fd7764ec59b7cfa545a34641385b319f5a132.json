For non-responsive patients, targeted synthetic DMARDs, inhibiting several kinases-Janus kinases (JAKs), mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)-Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) (SYK-BTK) [3] as well as biologic agents for blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukine 1 (IL-1), interleukine 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)are administered.",

After the protein trimer has been formed, TNF binds to its receptors, leading, respectively, to the initiation of several inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g., NF-\u03baB, JNK, p38-MAPK) [1] . Soluble TNF binds mainly to TNFR1, while transmembrane TNF binds to TNFR2. The monomeric and dimeric forms of TNF are inactive, and thus, in order to block the TNF relevant signaling, the inhibition of the trimeric form of TNF has been suggested [6] .",

However, these antagonists are mainly biologics, i.e., monoclonal antibodies (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab) [7, 14, 15] and fusion proteins (etanercept) [16] , which bear certain drawbacks. Such disadvantages include causing hypersensitivity, increased risk of patients to develop serious infections, such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B because of the caused immune system suppression, loss of patients' response during therapy due to arisen immunogenicity, and intravenous/subcutaneous administration as well as high cost of production and supply [8, 10, 11, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Thus, there is a great need for the development of potent small molecules that will efficiently inhibit TNF activity, as they can be inexpensively produced and distributed; they can be formulated to accommodate a plethora of administration routes (e.g., per os) while they can also present lower immunosuppressive side effects than biologics [8, 10, 11, 21] .",

            "text": "The first small molecule identified as a TNF inhibitor in vitro was suramin, synthesized in 1916 [23, 24] . Hence, it has been used as a template for identifying other compounds with inhibitory activity, such as Evans blue and Trypan blue, while also setting the basis of structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies for this biomolecular target [25] . He et al. [6] developed SPD304, which exhibited a micromolar inhibitory activity in TNF-TNFR1 interaction, binding to the TNF dimer as revealed via X-ray crystallography, thus blocking the formation of the active TNF trimer. The structure elucidation of the bound ligand afforded valuable SAR information, which surprisingly does not include any hydrogen bond or electrostatic interactions of the bound ligand with the TNF dimer. All interactions were hydrophobic, while interactions of the ligand with TNF residues Tyr59 and Tyr119 were identified as highly important for TNF inhibition [5] . Starting from the ligand SPD304 in 2005, several small molecule TNF inhibitors have been developed, including heterocyclic compounds, small organic ligands, natural products (NPs) and metal-complexed compounds [10] [11] [12] [26] [27] [28] . Blevitt et al. [29] discovered an inhibitor that forms an aggregating conglomerate, which antagonizes a protein subunit of the TNF trimer and alternates the quaternary structure of TNF upon binding. Thus, the formation of the TNF-TNFR1 is disrupted, due to the quaternary structure change induced by the aggregate. O'Connell et al. [27] and Dietrich et al. [12] developed small molecules with oral bioavailability that bind deeply in the TNF homotrimer, being able to allosterically stabilize an asymmetric complex or the trimer itself, leading to signaling inhibition. Xiao et al. [30] also proposed a compound that deforms the TNF trimer upon binding, leading to deregulated signaling upon binding of the TNF trimer to TNFR1.",

Computational modeling supports drug development, as it reduces both the time and the cost spent; it can predict clinical responses and it supports the 3R (replacement, reduction and refinement) concept requests [33] . Five novel TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors were identified, following a structure-based virtual screening in combination with in vitro experiments [33, 34] . Saddala and Huang [35] used a chemoinformatic workflow which employed pharmacophore modeling, docking and ADMET property prediction within the ZINC database to identify potential lead candidates with oral bioavailability for the inhibition of TNF; however, their biological activity has not been addressed. Recently, Melagraki et al. [36] developed two dual TNF-RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03ba-B ligand) micromolar inhibitors, thus impeding the active biological form of both cytokines, which play a determinant role in chronic inflammatory diseases. Two compounds have been identified employing the Enalos [37] in silico workflow, which combines a structure-based chemical library screening approach together with a ligand-based consensus quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model filtering and molecular dynamics simulations in order to further investigate computationally the compounds' binding mode [31, 32, 35] . Continuing their work in dual inhibitors, Melagraki et al. [9] proposed a NP, named A11 (Ampelopsin H), which efficiently blocks both TNF and RANKL, using a further automated version of the EnalosMD [9] workflow, which was recently included in the Enalos Asclepios KNIME nodes.",

Development of small-molecule PPI inhibitors is very challenging [38] , as a PPI inhibitor can act on certain \"hot spots\" on the protein surfaces [39] [40] [41] , that are typically large, flat and solvent-exposed, while they are predominantly characterized by non-specific features (hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions) [42, 43] . The large size and solvent exposure of the binding site require additionally that PPI inhibitors should achieve high potency and exhibit low molecular weight (MW), optimal lipophilicity and solubility [10, 21, 43] . To attain these pharmacokinetic properties of a prospective TNF small molecule ligand, we focused on NPs, deeming that, due to their natural origin as plant metabolites, they would bear an improved pharmacokinetic profile in comparison to synthetic compounds. Towards the identification of prospective PPI compounds with TNF inhibitory action in chemical libraries datasets, our group has further optimized the Enalos computational drug discovery pipeline. Conclusively, in this paper, we used our in silico pipeline to discover new NP lead compounds as potential TNF inhibitors, continuing our previous work in the field [9, 36, [44] [45] [46] .",

More specifically, a data mining procedure was performed, using the Enalos PubChem similarity node [37, 49] , searching for NPs that would be analogs of Ampelopsin H. Molecular similarity (termed also as chemical similarity) suggests that structurally similar molecules are likely to have similar biological and physicochemical properties. This concept is widely known as the similarity principle, and it is fundamental in cheminformatics, as it is the basis of many property prediction models, as well as compound design models [50] . Our model uses a similarity method to search PubChem for molecules, which are similar to the structure of enquiry (Tanimoto similarity 85%) [51] . This search yielded 113 relevant compounds, which were selected for molecular docking simulations.",

The docked SPD304 conformation reproduced its crystal form between the docked and the crystal SPD304 structure, while the docking score of SPD304 binding to TNF was calculated to be \u221254.269. After their preparation and their geometry optimization with the QM (quantum mechanics) node of the Enalos Asclepios workflow, the NPs that were identified by the similarity search were docked into the active site of TNF, and the highest-scored docking poses were selected. More specifically, the highest score of ampelopsin H was \u221245.140.

The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of the compounds' efficacy in the L929 TNF-induced assay as well as the half maximal lethal concentration (LC50) values for the influence of the compounds in the L929 cell survival, are described in the table of Figure 1D . As for their toxicity, compounds Vitisin B, Kobophenol A and Flexuosol A reached a plateau of maximum cytotoxicity at >85% survival at a high concentration range, attaining a good therapeutic window (cf.

However, Miyabenol A did not manage to interrupt the TNF-TNFR1 binding more than 70%, indicating that Nepalensinol B is probably a more promising inhibitor of the TNF-TNFR1 complex formation. Surprisingly, although Flexuosol A did not produce promising results ex vivo, it downregulated in vitro TNF-TNFR1 binding with an IC50 of 1.8 \u00b1 0.45 \u00b5M at about 50%.",

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy of binding calculations were conducted for the compounds exhibiting a pharmacological response to validate and enhance the predictive ability of our computational models, while investigating the binding mode of the compounds to TNF. The poses selected for complex formation and MD simulation, derived from the aforementioned docking procedure, in the classic merge of molecular docking and MD simulations. Each pose-receptor complex was embedded within TIP3P water solvent, and the 7 systems ran for 1 \u00b5s. According to the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) graphs, the MD for all our ligands gave us stable trajectories ( Figure 4) . The analysis performed focused on the following aspects: (a) the number of the hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions that are formed between the cavity residues of TNF and the ligand compound, which are maintained until the end of the simulation for each ligand, (b) the conformational changes of the receptor after the simulation and (c) the binding affinity prediction and its most crucial terms.",

C\u03b1-RMSD values for TNF complexes with the compounds were particularly stable, with an average deviation of 1.5-2.5 \u00c5 from the crystal structure ( Figure 4 ). The ligand RMSD values for each TNF complex showed non-considerable changes throughout the trajectory. Miyabenol A, Nepalensinol B and Flexuosol A complexes showed RMSD 1.5-2.5 \u00c5, with the most noteworthy fluctuation being observed in the first~125 ns of the Miyabenol A-TNF simulation and after~282 ns in the case of Flexuosol A-TNF simulation ( Figure 4) . . Schematic representation of the experimental workflow, containing a combination of pharmacological studies with computational models. The workflow starts by applying a molecular similarity search in PubChem, which yields 113 compounds. These compounds are further refined via a docking process in a homology model based on PDB: 2AZ5 (TNF dimer complex with ligand SPD304), resulting in 53 candidate ligands with a prospective affinity. Out of these compounds, 9 were commercially available, and thus they were acquired and further tested. An initial ex vivo screening in L929 cells verified that 2 compounds exhibit promising potency. Their optimal pharmacological profile was affirmed by further ex vivo testing in primary murine joints' SFs and in vitro testing, evaluating the potential of the compounds to interrupt TNF binding to its main receptor, TNFR1. To investigate the compounds' binding mode, a set of molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations was performed, suggesting that one of the two compounds, Nepalensinol B, could better serve as a candidate lead structure for anti-TNF drug design. .

SPD304, when bound to TNF [6] , was found to reduce L929 TNF-induced death (IC50 5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M), presenting however high toxicity (LC50 7.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M) [9, 87] . Notably, the new two best NPs identified, although~5-fold less effective than SPD304, presented much less toxicity on the cells (in the range of two orders of magnitude). Additionally, mostly Nepalensinol B, and to a lesser extent, Miyabenol A, were able to downregulate chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), which was found to be, among others, a pathogenic chemokine, being used for drug testing, both in human RA [88] and mouse chronic polyarthritis [89] . Both Nepalensinol B and Miyabenol A reduced CCL5 in both hTNFtg SFs, which spontaneously secrete high levels of chemokines, and wild-type (WT) SFs exogenously stimulated with human TNF in order to increase their pro-inflammatory potential. Using both cell settings, we show that compounds regulate the SFs responses by interfering with the TNF pathway itself. The combination of low toxicity along with the anti-inflammatory properties could assign to the most effective compounds, Nepalensinol B and Miyabenol A, a highly promising therapeutic potential, as they can serve as lead compounds addressing drug development for chronic inflammatory diseases. Miyabenol A and Nepalensinol B proceeded also to TNF-TNFR1-binding ELISA studies. Interruption of TNF-TNFR1 interaction contributes to the compounds' desired properties, as disruption of TNF binding to its principal receptor, TNFR1, has been a longdesired goal in the development of novel therapeutics in chronic inflammatory models of disease [90] . Nepalensinol B interrupted TNF-TNFR1 binding at low concentrations devoid of cytotoxicity, indicating that this compound could be employed as a direct TNF inhibitor. Interestingly, Nepalensinol B completely abolished TNF-TNFR1 interaction at tested concentrations over 50 \u00b5M ( Figure 2D ), while Ampelopsin H achieved a downregulation of around 60% of TNF-TNFR1 binding in the same concentration range [9] .",

Interestingly, Miyabenol A did not yield a relatively high docking score (\u221223.104). On the contrary, Ampleopsin H was the highest ranked (second after SPD305 which was the reference compound) with a docking score value of \u221245.140, followed by Kobophenol A with \u221243.617, Vitisin B with \u221237.549, and trans-Diptoindonesin with \u221244.674. As these docking scores did not comply with the biological effect of the compounds, and in an effort to further investigate the binding and SAR of the ligands, we proceeded to conduct MD simulations. The elucidation and analysis of SAR afforded from the MD simulations led to a better understanding of the pharmacological profile of the compounds. Nepalensinol B's docking pose exhibits interactions between the ligand and the carbonyl of the Gln52 amide group. Noteworthy hydrophobic pi-pi stacking interactions were observed between the two resorcinyl moieties of the ligand with their adjacent Tyr110 of each TNF subunit. The hydrogen bonds from visual inspection and distance analysis of the docking structure are formed between the backbone of amino acids Ser60, and Gln61 and the ligands' phenolic hydroxyl group. This, in combination with the strong hydrophobic nature of the interactions that can be observed with the bulky phenol groups of the ligand, rises as the main driving force for the ligand's core stabilization deep inside the cavity. These hydrophobic interactions are formed via the Leu57, Tyr57, Tyr119 and Tyr151 side chains.",

After~150-200 ns and until the end of the simulation, the Tyr110 pi-pi interactions are no longer present, but they preserve the hydrophobic environment, and they contribute indirectly to the further establishment of the hydrogen bond network, while also maintaining the local hydrophobicity. Additionally, interactions with the ligand and the side chains of Gln61, Gln209 and Tyr299, start gradually to be developed between the compound and the receptor. The strongest hydrogen bond interactions are observed after~550 ns simulation, when the ligand changes orientation and enters even deeper inside the groove between the two dimers. There, Tyr299 tends towards the Gln209 side chain and opens space for the ligand to enter, facilitating interactions with the backbone of the latter. This change further stabilizes the interaction with the Tyr299 and Gly269 backbone and locks the ligand in this deeper position, causing further stabilization of the complex. The interactions described above, in combination with the hydrophobic interactions between the phenyl moieties of the ligand and the bulky phenyl groups of an array of tyrosines (Tyr59, Tyr119, Tyr299, Tyr207, Tyr267) as well as the aliphatic chains of Leu57, Ile 303 and Leu 205, act like a flexible hydrophobic horseshoe that covers the planar hydrophobic core of Nepalensinol B, providing the chemical environment for the ligand.

The interaction pattern, which is formed especially after the second half of the 1\u00b5s MD, where the ligand slightly enters even deeper inside the cavity, suggests a strong affinity of Nepalensinol B, further refining the protein-ligand interactions.

Van der Waals hydrophobic interactions-especially pipi stacking-between the ligand and the Tyr59, Tyr119 and possibly the Tyr207 further contribute to the stability of the interactions between the ligand and the side chains of Leu57, Ile303, Leu205, Val271, Ile155 and Leu205 ( Figure 6B , Supporting Information Figure S1B ). Initially Gln61 amide forms hydrogen bonds towards the outer part of the cavity, but after~200 ns of simulation, the ligand slightly shifts again towards the inner part of the cavity. As a result, the van der Waals hydrophobic network is enriched by additional interactions with the backbone amino groups of Gly121 and its adjacent Gly122. Even though Miyabenol A showed some relative instability during the first~200-250 ns, by moving deeper inside the cavity, its hydrophobic interactions were eventually increased, due to gaining proximity towards Leu205, Ile303 and Leu57. Comparing the cores of Miyabenol A with Nepalensinol B, the former is much more flexible, thus allowing some significant mobility in the receptor's cavity. As a result, the ligand moves further from the Gln61, a fact that does not seem to happen in the case of Nepalensinol B (Figure 6A) , where the core is more rigid, and its dimensions fit much better within the cavity. In the case of Miyabenol A, the hydrogen bonds interaction network is less rich, but the core's dimensions, despite its flexibility, allow optimal fitting inside the cavity, forming significant van der Waals interactions. Moreover, this flexibility allows Miyabenol A to form some noteworthy contacts with the Val13 side chain of TNF. Thus, the high potency of Miyabenol A can be attributed mainly to the formation of a rich hydrophobic network composed of strong and robust interactions. Thus, Miyabenol A can serve as an example of the importance of hydrophobic interactions in ligand binding; however, it can be argued that the two additional H bonds forming in Nepalensinol B exhibit their superiority when comparing the experimental TNF-TNFR1 binding results. provides an explanation of the ligand potency observed in our pharmacological data and mainly in the TNF-TNFR1 assay, despite its planar core. For Miyabenol A, the main hydrogen bond interactions network can be observed between the ligand and the Tyr151 side chain hydroxyl group as well as the backbone amino group of Gly121 of TNF.

Compared to them, Flexuosol A's core is the least planar. Nonetheless, the binding inside the cavity throughout the trajectory remains stable, due to the van der Waals hydrophobic interactions between the bulky Tyrosines of the binding cavity and the phenol groups of the ligand. In the docking pose and the initial steps of the MD trajectory, the main interactions are the one hydrogen bond between the phenolic fragments of Flexuosol A and the amide of Gln61 as well as the noteworthy hydrophobic interactions between the Leu205, Ile303 and the side chain of Leu57. The pi-pi stacking interactions between the ligand and Tyr59 are also possible, due to the latter's adjacency.",

In addition, Flexuosol A does not seem to move deeper in the cavity, limiting its hydrophobic network to some interactions with the backbone carbonyl group of Leu268 and in a further proximity to some possible hydrophobic and polar interactions with Leu242 side chain and its backbone amino group, respectively ( Figure 6C , Supporting Information Figure S2A ).

However, docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that this is not enough for even more successful binding and potency. More specifically, this flexibility drives the ligand to adopt a more packed conformation within the cavity, forming hydrophobic interactions of a lower quality that prevent the formation of the interaction's network observed in the cases of Miyabenol A or Nepalensinol B. However, some hydrogen bonds are formed between the resorcinyl group of the ligand and the Tyr59, Tyr267 as well as the backbone of Ala304. Although this hydrogen bond pattern with the above residues was also observed in Nepalensinol B (representing a fraction of its rich hydrogen bond network), the hydrogen bonds formed by Kobophenol A were weaker and not as robust throughout the simulation. Interestingly, the hydrogen bonds' formation takes place after a close contact of Kobophenol A with His15, forming a pipi stacking interaction that provides an initial stabilization of the ligand, necessary for the latter to begin forming gradually the hydrogen interactions, starting with the Tyr59. Hydrophobic interactions are formed between the ligand and an array of bulky aliphatic side chains, including Leu36, Leu57, Val271, Ile303, Leu305, Ile155, Ile294 and Val13, but despite their number, they contribute only slightly to the hydrophobic stabilization of the ligand after~750 ns of simulation. Secondary hydrophobic interactions, with even lesser effect, that seem to surround the ligands' phenol moieties can be observed in Figure 6D , Supporting Information Figure S2B . It is, therefore, shown that the SAR of Kobophenol A is in agreement with its pharmacological profile, with a higher IC50 when compared to Miyabenol A, Nepalensinol B, and Flexuosol A in the L929 TNF-induced death assay.",

Therefore, we performed a series of free energy calculations (MM-GBSA calculations Table 1 ; absolute free energy calculations, Figure 7) to further evaluate the binding thermodynamics of the aforementioned compounds. Initially, free energy calculations were conducted fully automatically with the Enalos Asclepios KNIME workflow for each complex, employing MM-GBSA on the previously conducted 1 \u03bcs MD simulations (Table 1, Figure 7) .

In addition, the big difference in the calculated \u2206G of binding values (reaching to \u2206\u2206G in the range of 10-15 kcal/mol) should yield a tremendously stronger binding, which, in turn, is expected to be depicted in the biological activity of the ligands. This does not happen, as the experimental IC50 values in the L929 TNF-induced death assay suggest a difference of 1-2 orders of magnitude between all the active ligands, which does not comply with such large differences in the free energy of binding. This becomes even more concerning since the compounds with highest and lowest |\u2206G|, Nepalensinol B and Ampelopsin H experimentally are in the same IC50 range. In general, MM-PB/GBSA is a method most appropriate for free energy calculations in screening procedures, and such disadvantages are expected. Nonetheless, these results show a trend and provide insights to the thermodynamic profiling of ligand binding. The aforementioned methodological drawbacks can be addressed with more sensitive and accurate calculations of the absolute free energy of binding becoming feasible and being included in the computer-aided drug design (CADD) routine [92, 93] .",

For absolute free energy of binding (\u2206G o ) calculations, the method used applies several intermediate states between the initial and final states and simultaneously calculates the free energy differences between adjacent states. In this approach, several intermediate states are used between the initial and final states, and simultaneously calculates the free energy differences between adjacent states. The resulting final snapshots from the previously conducted MD simulations were selected as input for the \u2206G o calculations, and the respective values are presented in Figure 8 . Comparing the results with the MM-GBSA histogram (Figure 7) , we can observe that Nepalensinol B remains the best binding ligand (\u221211.851 \u00b1 0.367) but there is a significant improvement in the results of Miyabenol A (\u221210.334 \u00b1 0.465 kcal/mol) and Ampelopsin H (\u221211.591 \u00b1 0.443).

In the case of Miyabenol A (\u2206G o = \u221210.334 \u00b1 0.465 kcal/mol), it can be observed that despite its relative core flexibility, it seems to develop not only some hydrogen bond interactions but also the richest hydrophobic network among all the ligands tested, as can be suggested from our MD simulations. The nature of its interactions could explain the observed increase in the estimated activity closer to the most potent ligands (Nepalensinol B and Ampelopsin H) and in agreement with the pharmacological results, compared to MM-GBSA, where we observe high deviation (Table 1) . Similarly, focusing on Ampelopsin H, the hydrophobic interactions in combination with the rigid core that allows better fitting within the cavity support the improvement of the absolute binding calculation.",

A phenolic hydroxyl group and a furan oxygen atom are enough to convert Nepalensinol B into Ampelopsin H. YANK offers the possibility of \u2206G o calculation after mutations of the ligands, allowing us to compare the fitting of such similar compounds with different binding modes. Hence, after a 1 \u00b5s MD simulation, conversion of Nepalensinol B into Ampelopsin H was conducted in the final snapshot of the MD. The two mutations, i.e., the addition of the -OH group and the substitution of the methylene group into oxygen, were conducted to form Ampelopsin H, and the new complex underwent a \u2206G o calculation accompanied by an energy minimization and a number of short molecular dynamics to reach equilibration. The resulting extremely low absolute free energy of binding (\u2206G o = \u22122.471 \u00b1 0.790) showed that the binding mode of Nepalensinol B would not be preferred by Ampelopsin H, possibly due to the polar -OH group presence that causes steric clash with the Tyr209, resulting in lack of free space within the cavity. Eventually, the hydroxyl group addition is abolished by the tyrosine, causing binding instability. Additionally, Ile303 can possibly contribute towards this instability, due to its adjacence to the hydroxyl group.",

The ligand preparation nodes for docking and MD include a combination of MM and QM methods (DFT option was selected) for ligand geometry optimization to further refine the ligands before docking. The TNF receptor was prepared, protonated and hydrogen treated with PDBFixer, which was included in Asclepios as an automated part of the workflow. The same node was used also for filling the missing heavy atom. SPD304 was defined as a reference ligand. Docking calculations were conducted, using rDock (University of York, York, UK) molecular docking software [52] as part of workflow nodes. To define the active site of TNF the \"reference ligand method\" was employed with a radius of 6 \u00c5 around the bound SPD304; this area of the cavity was defined as the grid. The radius of the small and large probes used for mapping the TNF binding site was set to 1.5 \u00c5 and 4.0 \u00c5, respectively. The integer for the maximum number of acceptable cavities was set to 1 with a minimum acceptable cavity volume of 100 \u00c5 3 . A \"cavity restrain function\" with a weight of 1 was employed to prevent the ligand from exiting the docking site. Once the active site of TNF was defined and generated, each ligand was docked, using a 50 runs per ligand rDock job. The highest-scored docking solution of each ligand was selected, and the AMBER14SB force field option and ANTECHAMBER were used for the complexes' formation as input for the MD simulations.",

            "text": "Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with all-atom, unrestrained MD simulations with both the CPU and the GPU version of OpenMM 7.5 [106] of the Enalos Asclepios KNIME workflow node. The geometry optimization of the compounds was obtained with GAMESS-US [100] at the HF/6-31G*, using the DFT option of the QM refinement node of Enalos Asclepios workflow. AMBER topology and coordinates files were produced for each of the complexes for 1000 ns MD. The workflow included the following steps of the systems' preparation, MD simulations and MD trajectory analysis procedures. Initial model structures were constructed with AmberTools19 [101] . The ff14SB force field [110] was used for the protein atoms, and the generalized AMBER force field (GAFF) [103] was used for parameterization of the SPD304, Miyabenol A, Flexuosol A and Nepalensinol B ligands. Geometry optimization and AM1-BCC partial charges [104] and formal charges were assigned by the ANTECHAMBER program. The AM1-BCC approach is based on a fast and effective parameterization method that reproduces particularly precise RESP charges [111] . Simulations were performed for each of the ligands in complex with the TNF homology model in the explicit TIP3P water model [107] solvent in a periodic boundary box of 10 \u00c5 cutoff. The particle mesh ewald (PME) method [109] was used for the long-range interactions treatment; periodic boundary conditions with a cutoff distance of 1 nm and a Langevin thermostat with collision frequency set at 2.0 ps \u22121 for the temperature regulation were used [108] . NPT ensemble, with a Monte Carlo barostat to keep constant pressure throughout the simulations, was used. The TNF complexes were neutralized by adding 4 Na + counterions. Each minimization stage was carried out in 5000 cycles with a 1 nm cutoff. Hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm, and the AMBER14SB force field was selected for all of our complexes' MD simulations. Equilibration and production runs were carried out, using the OpenMM 7.5 program. Our systems were minimized for 5000 steps, using the steepest descent method, followed by 5 ns equilibration with an NVT (constant particle number, volume, and temperature) setting. During the equilibration, the ligands were positionally restrained, whereas the proteins were allowed to relax. Restraints were removed for subsequent production runs that were carried out at 300 K and 1 atm pressure with an integration time step of 2 fs. CPPTRAJ [112] of AmberTools19 (University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA) was used for the data analysis of the MD output results: RMSD, atomic fluctuations, and hydrogen bond calculations. For the binding stability of our ligands within the TNF protein, for each snapshot, we then applied the MM-GBSA method as a method for more sensitive rescoring of our ligands' binding after docking.",

The ligand intramolecular contacts are kept, and there is an annihilation of the intermolecular ligand interactions to other molecules, provided that the temperature and pressure are steady. (7) The (5) and (6) in combination give Equation (7). Our receptor-ligand complexes used as input for absolute free energy calculations are the final snapshots of the 1 \u00b5s MD simulations. These well-equilibrated structures were selected, and the free energy calculations and the analysis was conducted, using YANK v0.25.2 (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA) [95, 116] , using its absolute binding calculation default protocol for runs with implicit solvent. The method combines the MD simulations with the absolute free energy calculations of the well-equilibrated structures. The last frame of the MD trajectory is used for \u2206G binding calculation with the Multistate Bennet Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) 116 method. The strategy of the method includes some similarities to the wellestablished method for absolute free energy calculation method of MP-CAFEE. [117] The \u03bb = 0 state implies full interactions between the ligand and its surrounding atoms. The \u03bb = 1 state implies the lack of these interactions. The free energy differences are calculated between the two states for the protein-ligand complexes (\u2206G o complex ) and the ligand-only systems (\u2206G o ligand ). In our case, 16 states between \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb = 1 were used in order to make the two states close enough, between which the free energy difference would be feasible to be calculated. For each of these states, the simulation was 1 ns. The input structures before the calculation were minimized for 500 iterations to further refine the receptor-ligand interactions, and 1000 iterations were selected with 500 steps for each iteration (steps 500,000 in total) for the simulations between each state. The parameters for the protein were the FF14SB force field and GAFF2 for ligand parameterization. The MD simulations for each state were conducted under the NVT ensemble at 300 K temperature; the charge method applied was BCC-AM1 and implicit solvent (OBC2 method) [114] was used for lower computational cost. No cutoff was selected as a non-bonded method. For the default harmonic restraints applied to keep the ligand near the protein, Langevin dynamics were run with a time step of 2 fs. We first switched off the electrostatic interactions (\u03bb electrostatics = 0 \u03c4o \u03bb electrostatics = 1), and then the van der Waals (\u03bb sterics = 0 to \u03bb sterics = 1). We used 22 points: 11 \u03bb electrostatics (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0) and 11 \u03bb steric (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0). Then, the free energy was then analyzed for each of all the trajectory snapshots via the (MBAR) [94] for the least biased free energy estimation between the two states.",

These NPs block PPI by directly preventing the formation of the TNF trimer, while they exhibit low cytotoxicity levels and promising potency. The binding modes of the most efficient commercially available compounds were studied via docking and MD simulations, yielding valuable SAR information and providing insight into topological characteristics, which promoted the stronger binding of Nepalensinol B and Miyabenol A. The combination of MM-GBSA and absolute free energy of binding calculation also helped explain the stronger binding of Nepalensinol B and Miyabenol A, compared with the other less potent compounds tested. These compounds were further supported by either the strong hydrogen bond network (Nepalensinol B) or the rich van der Waals hydrophobic contacts (Miyabenol A) via the lower desolvation penalty and the lower \u2206G, when compared with the other tested compounds. The MM-GBSA gave relatively poor correlation with the experimental results, the \u2206G values differed disproportionately, and the standard deviation values were high. However, with the supplement of \u2206G o calculations, the results were significantly improved, providing an overall confirmation of the pharmacological data and also illustrating that Nepalensinol B can accommodate a second binding mode. Overall, Nepalensinol B and Miyabenol A were more potent in eliminating the TNF effect on L929 and primary murine joint fibroblasts, while the former interrupted more efficiently TNF-TNFR1 binding. Finally, the EnalosMD pipeline was advanced by adding the necessary modules to further refine our toolset; thus, it can successfully be used to identify new small molecules.
