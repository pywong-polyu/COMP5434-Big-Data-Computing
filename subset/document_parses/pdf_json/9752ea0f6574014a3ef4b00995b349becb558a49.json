Experts have expressed particular concern regarding potential increases in loneliness [or perceived social isolation; (9, 10) ], defined as subjective distress resulting from a discrepancy between desired and perceived social relationships (11) . Mortality attributable to low social support (162,000 deaths in 2000) exceeds that for cancer or stroke in the US (12) , and in the UK it is estimated that the cost of loneliness to employers is more than $3 billion annually (13) . Loneliness also has a substantial personal burden and is a major risk factor for physiological and health outcomes (14) , including coronary heart disease and stroke, increased healthcare use in older people, cognitive decline, depression, and increased risk of all-cause mortality (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) .",

            "text": "Loneliness and mental health are likely interrelated, underpinned by a combination of psychological and physiological pathways (20) . Indeed, much research has examined the relationship between loneliness and depression, but many of these studies have important limitations (i.e., crosssectional, small samples, and single-item measures of loneliness) and few have assessed bidirectional relationships (17, 21) . Some evidence supports a reciprocal relationship (14, 22, 23) , but research has not always been consistent (24) . Cross-sectional evidence supports associations between loneliness and diagnosed anxiety disorders (25) , although few studies have examined the bidirectional relationship between loneliness and anxiety. One such study demonstrated a bidirectional relationship between loneliness and social anxiety (26) , while experimental evidence in which feelings of loneliness and social connectedness were hypnotically induced showed that loneliness increased anxiety (and depressive) symptoms (27) . This is particularly concerning given the COVID-related deleterious impact on mental health (7), potentially creating a negative feedback loop between deteriorating mental health and loneliness. However, despite initial concerns and cross-sectional evidence of high pandemicrelated levels of loneliness (9, 10), early longitudinal evidence suggested only minimal changes in loneliness (28) . Nonetheless, loneliness also was not improved across time, and there will likely be longer-term effects of the pandemic; for example, living in economically and socially challenging conditions is associated with higher levels of loneliness (29) .",

Moreover, potential confounding from time-invariant factors (e.g., genetic susceptibility to loneliness and/or impaired mental health) and the time-varying effects of psychosocial risk factors known to be associated with both loneliness and depressive symptoms [e.g., low social network size and high perceived stress; (22, 24) ] have not been adequately considered.

            "text": "Analyses were conducted in STATA 14.2. Summary statistics were means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables. T-tests and Cohen's d effect sizes assessed differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms and loneliness between participants with and without data at follow-up. Using the maximum likelihood-structural equation models method, dynamic panel models with fixed effects were applied to assess associations between anxiety and depressive symptoms and loneliness (44) . These models use variation within individuals to estimate the relationships between variables of interest. Thus, major sources of confounding from all time-invariant confounders that may be correlated with anxiety and depressive symptoms and loneliness (e.g., genetics, sex, race, childhood experiences, lifetime diagnosis of anxiety/depression, etc.) are eliminated (31, 45) . Panel models, including reciprocal paths between independent and dependent variables and lagged values of both dependent and independent variables, were used to clarify the direction of the association between anxiety and depressive symptoms and loneliness. The fixed effects term was modeled as a latent variable and allowed to correlate with all time-varying independent variables (46) . Allowing these correlations supports the claim that these models control for all time-invariant confounders (31) . Crosslagged association was accommodated by declaring anxiety and depressive symptoms and loneliness as \"sequentially exogeneous\" independent variables, which allows for the possibility that they could be affected by prior values of the dependent variables. Mechanically, the independent variable at time t is allowed to correlate with the error term for the dependent variable at any prior time point (47) . COVID-19 containment strategies were not lagged and were included as \"strictly exogenous\" independent variables, meaning they could not be affected by prior values of the dependent variable. Separate models were created with regression coefficients constrained to be equal or free to vary across time and model fit was compared using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), a relative fit statistic which approximates the Bayes factor and is typically superior to other fit indices in finding the true model in larger sample sizes (48) . A lower BIC indicates a better fitting model, with differences of 0-2, 2-6, 6-10, and >10 indicative of weak, positive, strong, and very strong evidence, respectively (49, 50) . Models were also created controlling for social network size and stress as lagged, sequentially exogenous variables. To reduce bias introduced by missing information, full-information maximum likelihood estimation was used (51, 52) . Model fits were assessed using the Chi-Square statistic, comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis fit index (TLI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA ",

Findings from the Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study indicated that loneliness predicted subsequent changes in depressive symptomatology but not vice versa (24) . However, most research has demonstrated bidirectional relationships, albeit with variability in the magnitudes of the associations (14, 22, 23) . In contrast to the current study, these previous studies have focused on middle-aged to older adult cohorts and had follow-up periods ranging from 2 to 14 years. It seems plausible that age and follow-up period may influence the relationships of interest, although future research is required to test if and how they do moderate the loneliness-mental health relationships. Additionally, compared to these prior studies, an important strength of the current study was the use of standard fixed effect methods which effectively rule out all time-invariant confounding, a central threat to valid causal inference in epidemiological studies, which may contribute to some differences in findings.",

In this study, being young, a woman, and living with children, especially preschool-age children, were strongly associated with increases in mental distress. However, the entire sample was under strict lockdown and adherence was not assessed, so associations between different recommended or actual containment behaviors and mental health were not examined. Previous cross-sectional evidence from the current cohort showed that, compared to individuals who were social distancing, individuals who were self-isolating reported higher depressive and anxiety symptoms (35) .

Firstly, although the use of fixed effects models effectively rule out time-invariant confounding, and reverse causation is controlled for by alternatively using panel models allowing for lagged and reciprocal relationships, experimental evidence would confer greater confidence in the causal role of loneliness on depressive and anxiety symptoms and vice versa. Secondly, the use of a convenience sample resulted in a sample that was not representative of the US population, thereby limiting the generalisability of the findings. Additionally, participants who dropped out following the baseline survey had slightly higher depressive and anxiety symptoms and loneliness, meaning the analytic sample had comparatively better mental health. This could lead to an underestimation of the true effect as a potential negative feedback loop between depressive and anxiety symptoms may be stronger among those with worse mental health. Thirdly, self-reported depressive and anxiety symptom measures could lead to more measurement error than clinical interviews, though such measurement error was not expected to be related to our hypotheses. Nonetheless, whether the current findings for depressive and anxiety symptoms extend to clinical diagnoses is unknown. Finally, future research is required to test whether the relationships observed here persist beyond the pandemic.",
