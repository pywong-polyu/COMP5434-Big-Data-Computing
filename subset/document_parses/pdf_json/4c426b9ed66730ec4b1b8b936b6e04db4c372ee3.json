Our goal was to develop a strategy to predict high titers of nAbs based on the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays and the clinical characteristics of CP donors. Study Design and Methods: A total of 214 CP donors were enrolled and tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) using two commercial immunoassays: EUROIMMUN (ELISA) and Abbott (Chemiluminescence). Quantification of nAbs was performed using the Cytopathic Effect-based Virus Neutralization test. Three criteria for identifying donors with nAbs \u2265 1:160 were tested: -C1: Curve ROC; \u2212 C2: Conditional decision tree considering only the IA results and -C3: Conditional decision tree including both the IA results and the clinical variables. Results: The performance of the immunoassays was similar referring to both S/CO and predictive value for identifying nAbs titers \u22651:160. Regarding the studied criteria for identifying CP donors with high nAbs titers: (a) C1 showed 76.1% accuracy if S/CO = 4.65, (b) C2 presented 76.1% accuracy if S/CO \u22654.57",

As of August 23, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection reached about 23 million confirmed cases worldwide in more than 213 countries and caused more than 800 000 deaths (https://covid19.who.int).

Preliminary data showed a reduction of viral load, shorter hospital stay, and lower mortality in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 treated with CP in comparison to those who were not. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Possible mechanisms related to the efficacy of CP therapy in SARS-CoV-2 include the passive transfusion of neutralizing antibodies and an immunomodulatory effect via amelioration of severe inflammatory response. 9, 10 Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 usually develop a primary immune response by days 10-14, which is followed by virus clearance. 11 Therefore, theoretically, it should be more effective to administer the CP at the early stage of disease. A recent matched study suggested that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation. 12 However, other treatments might influence the relationship between CP and antibody level, including antiviral drugs, steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin.",

Moreover, we also have evaluated the level of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and the absence of RNAemia in a blood sample before plasma collection. As nAbs play important roles in virus clearance and have been considered as a key immune product for treatment against viral diseases, in concordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we established that CP units for transfusion should contain nAbs with minimum titer of \u22651:160 (https://www.fda.gov/media/136798/download).",

Plasma samples were initially inactivated for 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C. We used 8 dilutions (2-fold) of each plasma (1:20 to 1:2560).

Then, the plasma plus virus mixture was transferred onto the confluent cell monolayer and incubated for 3 days at 37\u00b0C, under 5% CO 2 .

For this analysis, the initial sample of 214 donors was divided into tertiles according to the date of the enrollment. The first two thirds of sample (development sample) were used to develop the criteria, while the last third of the sample (validation sample) was used to assess the performance of the proposed criteria.

This treatment was used more than a century ago during the A/H1N1 Spanish Flu outbreak in 1917-1918 and more recently for AIDS, MERS, SARS, and EBOLA viral epidemics. 1,21-23 It brings a patient suffering a severe and even lethal infection, immunoglobulins and possibly other immune regulatory factors obtained from plasma of immunized donors. The action mechanism of plasma therapy is not fully established and probably goes beyond administration of neutralizing antibodies. Especially in severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology, an immunomodulatory effect through administration of anti-inflammatory cytokines could be involved. 9 Up to now, there is no well-designed prospective randomized clinical trial demonstrating the efficacy of CP against infectious disease. However, the Brazilian Ministry of Health is permitting the use of CP as an investigational treatment for patients with moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. 24 It is considered an investigational treatment because clinical studies have started but have not yet been completed. The success of CP is related to the presence of high titers of nAbs in the donated plasma. To our knowledge, the present study was the first to correlate the results obtained from two broadly available immunoassays designed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the nAbs titers.",

This correlation is very important since many services do not have access to measuring nAbs, and, in this scenario, an immunoassay can be used as a screening to detect the presence of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the samples of convalescent donors.",
