            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is the viral pathogen causing the COVID19 global pandemic. Consequently, much research has gone into the development of preclinical assays for the discovery of new or repurposing of FDA-approved therapies. Preventing viral entry into a host cell would be an effective antiviral strategy. One mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry occurs when the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to an ACE2 receptor followed by cleavage at two cut sites (\"priming\") that causes a conformational change allowing for viral and host membrane fusion. TMPRSS2 has an extracellular protease domain capable of cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. A validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 protease activity would be a valuable tool for studying the impact TMPRSS2 has in viral entry and potentially be an effective antiviral therapeutic. To enable inhibitor discovery and profiling of FDA-approved therapeutics, we describe an assay for the biochemical screening of recombinant TMPRSS2 suitable for high throughput application. We demonstrate effectiveness to quantify inhibition down to subnanomolar concentrations by assessing the inhibition of camostat, nafamostat, and gabexate, clinically approved agents in Japan. Also, we profiled a camostat metabolite, FOY-251, and bromhexine hydrochloride, an FDA-approved mucolytic cough suppressant. The rank order potency for the compounds tested are nafamostat (IC 50 = 0.27 nM), camostat (IC 50 = 6.2 nM), FOY-251 (IC 50 = 33.3 nM), and gabexate (IC 50 = 130 nM). Bromhexine hydrochloride showed no inhibition of TMPRSS2. Further profiling of camostat, nafamostat, and gabexate against a panel of recombinant proteases provides insight into selectivity and potency.",

Given that no approved therapeutics for treating any coronaviruses existed at the time SARS-CoV-2 emerged (late 2019), early attention has focused on drug repurposing opportunities. 1,2 Drug repurposing is an attractive approach to treating SARS-CoV-2, as active drugs approved for use in humans in the United States or by other regulatory agencies, or unapproved drug candidates shown to be safe in human clinical trials, can be nominated for fast-track to the clinic. For example, remdesivir (GS-5734, Gilead Sciences Inc.), is an inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that had previously been in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus. Remdesivir was rapidly shown to be active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in clinical trials, which resulted in the FDA granting emergency use authorization and full approval in Japan. 3 The delineation of targets and cellular processes that mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication forms the basis for the development of assays for drug repurposing screening and subsequent full-fledged therapeutic development programs.",

            "text": "One therapeutic target receiving significant attention is the human host cell transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2, Uniprot-O15393 4 ) that is expressed in epithelial cells of the human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. 5 TMPRSS2 is anchored to the extracellular surface of the cell, where it exerts its enzymatic activity. While its precise physiologic substrate is not clear, TMPRSS2 gene fusions are common in prostate cancer, resulting in its overexpression. 6, 7 The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells via its spike protein first binding to the cellsurface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and evidence suggests that TMPRSS2 then proteolytically cleaves a sequence on the spike protein, facilitating a conformation change that \"primes\" it for cell entry ( Figure 1A) through both virus-cell fusion and through cell\u2212cell fusion that results in syncytia formation. TMPRSS2 was first shown to facilitate viral entry of the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 in cells engineered to overexpress TMPRSS2, and by inhibition with the trypsin-like serine protease inhibitor, camostat. 8 When the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak occurred, TMPRSS2-overexpressing cells were again shown to facilitate cell infection, TMPRSS2 was shown to degrade the MERS-CoV spike protein, and camostat was shown to limit cell entry. 9 The structurally related trypsin-like serine protease inhibitor nafamostat was shown to similarly inhibit spike protein-mediated cell fusion of MERS-CoV. 10 Additionally, in vivo mouse models for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a TMPRSS2 gene knockout caused a reduction in lung pathology after viral infection while not seeing any effect on development or survival. However, it was noted that a decreased inflammatory chemokine and cytokine response mediated by a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist may suggest an unidentified physiological role. 11 The protein Figure 1 .

At least eight clinical trials for treating patients are currently underway. 20 It was developed by Ono Pharmaceuticals (Japan, patented in 1977 19, 21 ) . While a specific report of its development does not appear to be published, it is a highly potent inhibitor of trypsin (IC 50 \u2248 50 nM), 22 and it crossinhibits other proteases. When given as a treatment, it is hydrolyzed in plasma (t 1 / 2 < 1 min) to 4-(4guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic acid (FOY-251), which has shown a similar profile for inhibition of trypsin, thrombin, plasma kallikrein, and plasmin. 22 Two other structurally related inhibitors, nafamostat (Torii Pharmaceutical, Japan) and gabexate (also from Ono, FOY-307), are also approved in Japan for treating pancreatitis and show potential for activity against SARS-CoV-2, and trials with nafamostat have also been reported. 23 While TMPRSS2 biochemical assays have been reported for understanding its role in prostate cancer and influenza, 24,25 these three inhibitors have not yet been directly demonstrated to inhibit TMPRSS2, and the mechanism has been inferred by inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell models such as the lung-derived human cell line Calu-3. 26 Conversely, bromhexine (BHH), an FDA-approved mucolytic cough suppressant, has been identified within a TMPRSS2 biochemical screen as the most potent hit (IC 50 = 750 nM) and further shown to demonstrate efficacy in mouse models to reduce metastasis of prostate cancer. 25 With this reported activity as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, it is being investigated within a COVID19 clinical trial. 27 In response to the COVID19 public health emergency, we are developing both protein/biochemical and cell-based assays to interrogate several biological targets to enable identification of potential therapeutic leads. Our initial focus is on performing drug repurposing screening for each assay and rapidly sharing the data through the NCATS OpenData portal for COVID19. 28 As part of this effort, we sought to develop a biochemical assay for measuring the activity of TMPRSS2 to enable the evaluation of existing drug repurposing candidates, virtual screening, 29\u221231 and new inhibitors.",

The concentration of substrate selected for the biochemical assay was set below K m at 10 \u03bcM to ensure susceptibility to competitive inhibitors (detailed protocol provided in Table 1 ). Positive and negative control conditions were assessed in 384-and 1536-well plate formats to determine a signal/background (S:B) and a Z\u2032 appropriate for HTS. The S:B and Z\u2032 in a 384-well plate were 3.6 and 0.86, respectively ( Figure 2E ), and in a 1536-well plate the S:B and Z\u2032 were 3.2 and 0.86, respectively ( Figure 2F ). These data demonstrate appropriate performance for this assay within both plate formats to be useful for HTS. Using the established assay, we tested the inhibition of TMPRSS2 using COVID19-relevant and putative TMPRSS2 inhibitors: camostat, FOY-251, nafamostat, gabexate, and BHH ( Figure 3 ). We found that nafamostat (currently in clinical trials) (IC 50 = 0.27 nM) is the most potent among the inhibitors, while camostat (currently in clinical trials) shows low nM potency (IC 50 = 6.2 nM) and its primary metabolite, FOY-251, has a \u223c5-fold potency loss (IC 50 = 33.3 nM). Gabexate was significantly less potent (IC 50 = 130 nM). Notably, we did not detect inhibition by BHH (currently in clinical trials). Because our reported IC 50 values were \u223c10\u2212 100-fold lower than our enzyme concentration (1 \u03bcM), based on the manufacturer's supplied concentration, we used the TMPRSS2 activity (%) from our dose\u2212response curves for camostat and nafamostat to calculate an active TMPRSS2 concentration and apparent dissociation constants for the enzyme\u2212inhibitor complex (K i app ) using the tight-binding equation, also known as the Morrison equation (eq 1). 35 ",

The counter-assay demonstrated that these inhibitors had no dose\u2212response effects on the fluorescence from AMC, indicating there was no quenching of AMC fluorescence from the inhibitors tested (overlaid data, Figure 3a\u2212e) .

We developed a fluorogenic biochemical assay for measuring recombinant human TMPRSS2 activity for high-throughput screening that can be readily replicated and used to demonstrate inhibition as we show with nafamostat (most potent), camostat, FOY-251, and gabexate. The fluorogenic assay approach taken here has advantages and disadvantages. The assay was readily scaled to a 1536-well format for potential high-throughput robotic screening and can be monitored in real-time. Also, activity is easily detected by the liberation of a fluorophore. The substrate was selected based on the maximal activity of TMPRSS2 against it compared with other substrate candidates, and can be considered a tool substrate, rather than one that is physiologically relevant in the context of the action of TMPRSS2 against its SARS-CoV-2 spike protein cleavage site. A disadvantage that is common to all fluorescence-based assay readouts is the potential for inhibitory compounds from screening to be false-positive artifacts, by quenching the fluorescence of the AMC product, but a simple counter-assay for AMC quenchers can be used to identify false-positives. This counter assay was done on those inhibitors profiled here to demonstrate there was no dose\u2212response quenching of AMC fluorescence (overlaid data, Figure 3a \u2212e).",

Lucas et al. examined TMPRSS2 in the context of prostate cancer. They reported a HTS at a single concentration that produced several hits including their most potent hit, BHH (IC 50 of 750 nM reported), which is an FDAapproved mucolytic cough suppressant. 25 It has also been included as a potential drug repurposing TMPRSS2 inhibitor and been shown to reduce the ICU admissions, intubation, and mortality rate in patients with COVID19 in a 78 patient openlabel, randomized clinical trial. 27, 40, 41 Unfortunately, few details of the assay utilized, scale of assay, or its development were described, but the substrate identified in our study as the most amenable for HTS (Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC) was also used in the Lucas et al. study. Notably, we did not detect inhibition of TMPRSS2 from BHH, and confirmed 99.9% purity of our BHH sample (Supplementary Figure 3) . One significant distinction between the reports is the recombinant TMPRSS2 construct used. Both were expressed in yeast, yet the Lucas et al. TMPRSS2 (aa 148\u2212492) is without the LDLRA domain, whereas our TMPRSS2 (aa 106\u2212492) composes the full extracellular domain. It is not known how this difference could lead to a discrepancy in inhibition data. In potential agreement with our results, a recent report demonstrated a lack of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated pseudotyped particle entry from bromhexine, suggesting no direct inhibition of TMPRSS2. 42 Additionally, a metabolite of bromhexine, ambroxol, that is also used as a mucolytic agent did not show any TMPRSS2 inhibition at 40 \u03bcM (data not shown). These data suggest the mechanism of action from these mucolytic agents may be an indirect effect on TMPRSS2 or other proteases involved in proteolytic priming of the spike protein, such as trafficking and secretion. 43, 44 Meyer et al. examined several peptide AMC substrates for TMPRSS2 and used a biochemical assay to assess modified peptide substrates as TMPRSS2 inhibitors, some with observed inhibition constants of approximately 20 nM. 24 They found a high correlation between inhibition constants of inhibitors between TMPRSS2 and matriptase, similar to the cross-inhibition seen from the inhibitors profiled within our assay. Additionally, they report a low active TMPRSS2 concentration in the enzyme stock solution. In our study, the enzyme concentration used was 1 \u03bcM based on the manufacturer's supplied concentration. However, using our dose\u2212response data from camostat and nafamostat for fitting to the Morrison equation allowed us to calculate the active TMPRSS2 concentration to be approximately 0.14 nM.",

Given the clinical trial attention on camostat and nafamostat for treating COVID19, our finding that nafamostat demonstrates greater potency against TMPRSS2 supports its evaluation in clinical trials. A recent molecular dynamics and Markov modeling study explains the increased potency from nafamostat and the molecular mechanism of TMPRSS2 inhibition. 45 Protease profiling revealed activity against a range of trypsin-like serine proteases (and greater potency than against TMPRSS2), but activity was restricted to this protease class and compounds did not generally inhibit other protease classes such as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), caspases, and ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs). Camostat and nafamostat development was reported to focus on trypsin, plasmin, and kallikrein, 22,46 because of the role these targets played in pancreatitis, reflux esophagitis, and hyperproteolytic conditions, and activity against these enzymes was certainly observed in the protease panel.",

            "text": "Beyond the evaluation of current inhibitors, we demonstrated acceptable reproducibility and S:B indicating its suitability in a drug repurposing screen and to support the development of new TMPRSS2 inhibitors through virtual screening efforts. 29\u221231 There are several reasons why a new clinical candidate may be valuable. A number of coronaviruses have been shown to rely on TMPRSS2 for cellular entry (described in the introduction), so a potent, orally available TMPRSS2 inhibitor could be invaluable as a repurposing candidate for treating future emergent coronaviruses. COVID19 is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The lung pathology of the ARDS shows microvascular thrombosis and hemorrhage, and has been characterized as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with enhanced fibrinolysis, or as diffuse pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy. 47, 48 This coagulopathy can lead to pulmonary hypertension and cardiac injury. Trypsin-like serine proteases are involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (TMPRSS2), in the coagulation cascade (APC), and in the enhanced fibrinolysis (plasmin). As shown from profiling the protease panels, camostat, nafamostat, and gabexate directly inhibit enzymes involved in all these processes. Clinical development of this class of compounds could thus be directed toward treatment of the infection through inhibition of viral entry, toward treatment of the coagulopathy, or conceivably, both. However, the strategies used to treat viral infection and coagulopathies are very different. The former aims to achieve maximum viral suppression, with dose limited by safety and tolerability. The latter seeks to strike the delicate balance between suppression of thrombosis while managing the inevitable increased risk of bleeding. For this reason, the known clinical trials planned or underway for nafamostat and camostat can be divided into three categories: those for which the primary end point is focused on limiting or preventing ACS Pharmacology & Translational Science pubs.acs.org/ptsci Article infection, those for which the primary end point is focused on management of ARDS and advanced disease, and those which may capture the treatment benefit through either mechanism. Nafamostat is approved and marketed in Japan and South Korea and is typically prescribed to treat acute symptoms of pancreatitis and to treat DIC. 49 It is administered by IV infusion and has a plasma half-life (t 1/2 ) of about 23 min. 50 The main metabolites of nafamostat are 6-amidino-2-naphthol and 4-guanidinobenzoic acid which, unlike nafamostat itself, do not inhibit the trypsin-like serine protease, prostasin. 51 It is unknown whether these metabolites would inhibit TMPRSS2. Clinical trials to test the hypothesis that nafamostat can lower lung function deterioration and need for intensive care admission in COVID-19 patients, and that nafamostat can improve the clinical status of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia have been registered. 23 Indeed, in a small case report, three high-risk elderly patients in South Korea who required oxygen, improved and could be discharged following IV administration of 200 mg daily for 4 to 13 days. 52 Camostat is approved in Japan for the treatment of acute symptoms of chronic pancreatitis and postoperative reflux esophagitis. 53 The treatment regimen is typically 200 mg PO, every 8 h. Camostat is a pro-drug as the parent drug is not detected in plasma. The terminal ester is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma (t 1/2 < 1 min) to 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic acid (FOY-251) which has a mean terminal half-life of 1 h. 54 FOY-251 and camostat are reported to have similar activities against trypsin, thrombin, plasma kallikrein, and plasmin, 22 and here we show a \u223c5-fold decreased potency by FOY-251 (IC 50 = 33.3 nM) compared to camostat (IC 50 = 6.2 nM) for TMPRSS2 inhibition. There are eight registered clinical trials studying camostat, of which only one is focused on coagulopathy. 20 The other trials are focused on early, mild, or moderate disease. Given the short half-lives for camostat and nafamostat, the limitation of a biochemical assay on purified TMPRSS2 alone is that the in vivo effects may also result from metabolites of the parent. Accordingly, we tested TMPRSS2 inhibition by FOY-251, the primary camostat metabolite. Literature suggests it is unlikely the metabolites from nafamostat would inhibit TMPRSS2. Another critical piece, not considered within this report, that may contribute to in vivo effects are inhibitor kinetics, demonstration of reversibility, and off-rates for the parent inhibitor. Gabexate is an IV drug approved for marketing in Italy and Japan and was shown to be effective in treating patients with sepsis-associated DIC and treating acute pancreatitis. 55 It is clearly much less potent than nafamostat, and there are no registered COVID-19 clinical studies with it. In summary, of the three drugs in the class, nafamostat is being studied as the preferred drug in an ICU setting as it can be titrated against coagulation markers as a treatment for coagulopathy, while considering its antiviral effect as a bonus. In outpatient, early diagnosis, or prophylactic settings, camostat is being studied predominantly with the primary purpose as an antiviral. In these latter settings there is room for new, selective TMPRSS2 inhibitors which could achieve higher levels of inhibition without incurring a bleeding risk. However, it is unclear whether a selective TMPRSS2 probe molecule would in turn be an effective antiviral therapeutic as other extracellular trypsin-like serine proteases, such as TMPRSS4, have been shown to affect viral entry. 16, 56 Consequently, a TMPRSS2 probe molecule may avert the increased risk of bleeding from off-target trypsin-like serine protease inhibition, while sacrificing antiviral efficacy due to the need to inhibit redundant proteolytic activity from other trypsin-like serine proteases on the cell surface. Here, protein expression differences between the various trypsin-like serine proteases may affect the amount of antiviral efficacy from TMPRSS2 inhibition alone.",
