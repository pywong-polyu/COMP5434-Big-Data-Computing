Currently-more than four months after declaration of the pandemic-the BCG-hypothesis needs reexamining. An ecological study was conducted by obtaining data of 61 factors in 173 countries, including BCG vaccine coverage (%), using morbidity and mortality as outcomes, obtained from open resources. 'Urban population (%)' and 'insufficient physical activity (%)' in each country was positively associated with morbidity, but not mortality, after adjustment for PCR-tests. On the other hand, recent BCG vaccine coverage (%) was negatively associated with mortality, but not morbidity, even with adjustment for percentage of the population \u2265 60 years of age, morbidity, PCR-tests and other factors. The results of this study generated a hypothesis that a national BCG vaccination program seems to be associated with reduced mortality of COVID-19, although this needs to be further examined and proved by randomized clinical trials.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Currently, more than four months since declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th, 2020, more than 14 million people have been infected with the virus and more than half a million have died worldwide. Marked differences in COVID-19 mortalities have been observed in different countries. For example, the mortality per million population is till now several tens of times or even higher in Western countries, e.g., Belgium (845), the United Kingdom (UK, 664), the United States of America (USA, 426) and Germany (109), than in Asian countries, e.g., India (19) , Japan (8) and China (3), as of 17 July 2020. This is quite the opposite of what was reported during the 1918-20 influenza pandemic, the so called Spanish flu, in which the population mortality was over 30-fold higher, with excess death rates observed in low-income countries, such as India, than in high-income countries, such as those in the West [1] . Higher morbidities and mortalities may be explained by easy access to diagnostic polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR-tests) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in these Western countries. In contrast, they may be underestimated in middle-and low-income countries due to low capacities of PCR-testing and poor access to health care. Alternatively, there is growing concern that racial and ethnic minority, as well as socioeconomic and biological factors may influence the high morbidity and mortality. A retrospective study of integrated health care systems suggested that Black race compared with White race, increasing age, male sex, having a greater burden of comorbidities, type of public insurance, residence in a low-income area and obesity were associated with increased odds of hospital admission [2] . On the other hand risk of in-hospital mortality increased only in aged patients and was not associated with the Black race, sex, comorbidities, obesity and other factors after multivariate adjustment [2] ; this phenomenon was also confirmed in other races, i.e., Asians and Hispanics, compared with the White race [3, 4] . Moreover, since COVID-19 is an infectious disease that spreads mainly through the droplet route by close contact in dense human societies, metropolitan areas, such as New York City in the USA [5] and Lombardy in Italy [6] , Paris in France [7] , Sao Paulo in Brazil [8] , and so on, have tended to be regional epicenters. However, associations between population dynamics, e.g., population size, density, migrants and urbanization and the morbidity/mortality of COVID- 19 have not yet been well examined.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 94, "text": "19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 635, "end": 639, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 648, "end": 651, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 990, "end": 993, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1833, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2039, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2150, "end": 2153, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2154, "end": 2156, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2354, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2377, "end": 2380, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2399, "end": 2402, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2425, "end": 2428, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2628, "end": 2630, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In addition to the factors listed above, several scientists proposed a hypothesis [9] [10] [11] [12] that Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination has preventive effects not only against tuberculosis, i.e., the target disease of the vaccine, but also other non-specific infectious diseases, i.e., off-target diseases such as COVID-19, through epigenetic mechanisms [13] [14] [15] . In fact, ecological studies have suggested that both COVID-19 morbidities and mortalities were less in BCG-vaccinated countries than in BCG-non-vaccinated countries [16] [17] [18] . However, because these studies only obtained data during the early phase of the pandemic, by which time the disease load had escalated in Western countries, but not yet escalated in low-and middle-income countries where BCG is given at birth and did not adjust for any potential confounders, including PCR-test number per million population, the BCG-hypothesis needs to be reexamined now, more than four months after declaration of the pandemic, since the number of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases are still growing in many countries. We therefore aimed to explore whether recent BCG vaccine coverage is associated with COVID-19 morbidity and/or mortality rates, using linear regression models to explore associations between the two continuous random variables adjusted for a variety of potential confounders, such as median age and body mass index (BMI) in individual countries through this ecological study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 82, "end": 85, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 86, "end": 90, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 91, "end": 95, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 96, "end": 100, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 367, "end": 371, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 372, "end": 376, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 377, "end": 381, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 549, "end": 553, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 554, "end": 558, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 559, "end": 563, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Institutional review board approval for this work was not sought due to the use of publicly available data obtained from open resources.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ethics Statement"}, {"text": "This ecological study compared population data of each country.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Study Design"}, {"text": "All data were obtained from open resources: Information on total number of cases, total number of deaths and number of PCR-tests performed per million population were obtained from 'Coronavirus Update' [19] , data regarding population dynamics were obtained from 'World Population Clock' [20] , socioeconomic covariates were obtained from 'the United Nations database' [21] , BCG vaccine coverage data were obtained from 'The BCG World Atlas' [22] and 'The global health observatory' on the WHO homepage [18] and other health related data were from the same WHO site [23] .

Only one variable among biologically similar variables, e.g., 'median age (years)', '\u2265 60 years of age (%)' and '\u2265 70 years of age', was selected to maximize adjusted R 2 in the multi-linear regression models to avoid the influence of collinearity.

However, some countries with a current national BCG vaccination policy have high mortality rates. Plausible reasons for this discrepancy may be: (1) low coverage of BCG vaccination in these countries (% coverage-mortality per million population), e.g., Ireland (18%-354); Portugal (32%-165); and Greece (50%-19): (2) late introduction of BCG vaccine program (year of introduction-mortality per million population), e.g., Iran, (1984-162): (3) oral delivery of the BCG vaccine, e.g., Brazil retained oral delivery of the vaccine until 1977: (4) UK administered the vaccine to older children (12 to 13 years of age) and (5) connection with endemic country by land, e.g., Mexico, Panama, Peru and Chile.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 199, "end": 202, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 311, "end": 315, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Higher morbidity, but fewer PCR-tests, were associated with higher mortality.

On the other hand, older age was associated with higher mortality, which is consistent with previous articles [2] [3] [4] .

First, although we selected 61 covariates in this study, we did not evaluate range and timing of non-pharmaceutical interventions, e.g., school closures, workplace closures, cancellation of public events, restrictions on public gatherings, stay-at-home restrictions, restrictions on internal movement, international travel controls, etc., all of which would also have had significant effects on COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the present study results are burdened with an extreme error. Second, the study design was ecological. Therefore, the outcome of this work should be considered highly limited, with a potential risk of high bias. Consequently, only the hypothesis that BCG vaccination mitigates COVID-19 mortality can be proposed here; cohort or case-control studies and randomized clinical trials, similar to the BCG-CORONA study [31] , are required to test this hypothesis. Third, the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, although we have confirmed the results using the latest data. However, the results may be different a few months from now. Fourth, it is clear that an extremely large number of covariates, i.e., 61, were selected for the limited number of 173 countries. This sample size could allow use of a maximum of 10 covariates in multiple regression analysis.

Then, multivariable linear regression using the screened variables were performed after adjustment for PCR-tests and morbidity (Table 5 for morbidity  and Table 6 for mortality).
