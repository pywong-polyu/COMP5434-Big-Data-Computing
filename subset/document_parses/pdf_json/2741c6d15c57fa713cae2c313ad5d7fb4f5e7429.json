MYSTIC relies on data extracted from discrete fields keyed in by the paramedics; therefore, documentation error is another potential limitation, and we are also unable to ascertain documentation accuracy at this time. In our pilot, we had 5-10% missing or erroneous data. Another challenge for MYSTIC is to keep focus on identifying systemic areas for the training and refining of protocols, rather than coming across as punitive or overly penalize individuals based on their audit performance alone. A myopic emphasis on clinical audit criteria may drive some individuals to manipulate the system by false documentation to \"pass'\" or avoid audit, which ultimately could not be detected by our audit methods.
