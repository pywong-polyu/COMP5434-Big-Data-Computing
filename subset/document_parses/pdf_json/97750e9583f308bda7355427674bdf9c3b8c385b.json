The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines and their protonation/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here we report the pK a calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using a newly developed GPU-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with an asynchronous replica-exchange scheme. The calculated pK a 's support the catalytic roles of the Cys-His-Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological pH, among which is C270/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro. Simulations revealed that the BL2 conformational dynamics is coupled to the titration of C271/270, in agreement with the crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Simulations also revealed that BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is very flexible, sampling both open and closed states despite the lack of an analogous cysteine. Our work provides a starting point for more detailed mechanistic studies to assist structure-based design of broad-spectrum inhibitors against CoV PLpros.",

The PLpro monomer (about 300 residues), which is the predominant form in solution 11 , is comprised of an independent Nterminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain (first 62 residues) and a C-terminal catalytic domain ( Fig. 1a and b) . The latter folds in a canonical thumb-palm-fingers like structure, with the Ubl domain anchored to the thumb. The interface between the thumb (residue 107-113, 162-168) and palm (residue 269-279) forms the substrate binding site leading to the catalytic triad of the active site comprised of Cys111, His272, and Asp286 (Fig. 1b) . The substrate binding site is solvent exposed and flanked by a flexible \u03b2 -hairpin loop called the blocking loop 2 or BL2 (G266-G271). The fingers subdomain contains a zinc finger coordinated by four cysteines, which upholds the structural integrity and is essential for the PLpro activity 12 . The structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is nearly identical to that of SARS-CoV PLpro 13 , as expected from the highly similar sequences (96% similarity and 83% identity, Fig. 1c ). In contrast, although the structure of MERS-CoV PLpro overlays well with the SARS-CoV PLpro structures, small differences are visible (Fig. 1a) , as expected from the larger sequence differences (66% similarity and 30% identity with SARS-CoV PLpro, Fig. 1c ).",

If multiple chains were available in the xray crystal structure, only the first chain was used. Any small molecules or solvent were removed. For each structure, the acetylated N-terminus and amidated C-terminus along with all missing hydrogens were added using the CHARMM program (C36b2) 25 . In the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (PDB 6W9C), a disulfide bond is present in the fingers subdomain in place of a zinc ion. Considering that zinc ion cannot be represented in implicit-solvent simulations, we removed the zinc ion and added an analogous disulfide linkage between the closest non-adjacent cysteine pairs in all other structures to maintain the integrity of the fingers subdomain. The disulfide linkage should not affect the pK a 's of discussed residues, as they are located far away in other subdomains (Fig. 1a) . Following the addition of hydrogens and disulfide bridge, the structure was subject to a 20-step energy minimization with the heavy atoms restrained, and a 20-step energy minimization with all atoms restrained but the disulfide bonded cysteine pairs. The minimization used 10 steps of steepest decent and 10 steps Newton-Raphson methods. From there the force field parameters and coordinate files were constructed from the CHARMM output with the LEAP utility in AMBER. 23 The ff14sb force field 26 was used to represent the protein, and the GB-Neck2 (igb=8) implicit-solvent model 27 was used to represent solvent. The mbondi3 intrinsic Born radii were modified for improving titration simulations of His 28 and Cys 29 sidechains. The structure was then energy minimized and equilibrated in the GB-Neck2 implicit solvent 27 , following our previous protocol 21 . The energy minimization was performed using the steepest decent algorithm for 5000 steps and the conjugate-gradient algorithm for 1000 steps. The equilibration was performed at pH 7 in four stages, each having 2000 MD steps with gradually decreased restraining force constants of 5, 2, 1, and 0 kcal/mol/ 2 . The final structure was used for CpHMD titration simulations.",

Our previous work showed that pH replicaexchange enhances both protonation and conformational state sampling, allowing pK a 's to rapidly converge. 16, 30, 31 In the protocol, 9 pH replicas were placed at pH values ranging from pH 4.5 to 8.5 at an interval of 0.5 pH units. An exchange of two adjacent pH conditions was attempted every 1000 MD steps (or 2 ps). Each replica was run for 55 ns, resulting in an aggregate time of 495 ns for each. The \u03bb values were recorded after each exchange attempt. All sidechains of Asp, Glu, His, Cys, and Lys were allowed to titrate, with their titration model parameters taken from our previous work.

            "text": "We performed pH replica-exchange CpHMD simulations to estimate the pK a values of Asp/Glu/His/Cys/Lys sidechains and assess possible proton-coupled dynamics in SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV PLpros. The titration simulations were conducted in the pH range 4.5-8.5 and lasted 55 ns per replica (aggregate simulation time of 495 ns for each protein). The protonation states were well converged. Consistent with our previous work 31 , we found that the protonation states of His residues converge rapidly within 10 ns per replica, and those of Cys converge more slowly due to the formation of hydrogen bonds that are not present in the crystal structure (see later discussion). The time series analysis of protonation state sampling and replica walks along the pH ladder are given in see supplementary material. For the ease of discussion, we refer to the \"standard\" protonation states as the default settings in the MD programs, i.e., deprotonated Asp/Glu (negatively charged), deprotonated His (neutral), with one proton on either \u03b4 or \u03b5 nitrogen, protonated Cys (neutral), and protonated Lys (positively charged). Our simulations showed that several Cys, His residues and one Asp are in the \"non-standard\" protonation state or can switch to this state at physiological pH in all three PLpros (Table I) . A complete list of the calculated pK a 's are given in supplementary material. a. Protonation states and hydrogen bond network of the catalytic triad. We first consider the catalytic triad in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. The catalytic Cys111 is located in the thumb, His272 is located in the foothill of the palm adjacent the flexible loop BL2, and Asp286 is located at the end of \u03b2 18 (Fig. 1b) . Currently, no measured pK a data are available. Biochemical experiments of SARS-CoV PLpro suggested that the Cys serves as a nucleophile, while the His functions as a general acid with the assistance of a negatively charged Asp 12 ; however, it is unclear whether the reactive nucleophile is the thiolate of the Cys\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7His ion pair or the neutral thiole which becomes deprotonated upon binding of the substrate 4 . The calculated pK a 's of Cys111 and Asp286 are <4.5, whereas the pK a of His272 is >8.5, indicating that the catalytic triad residues are all in the charged state at physiological pH. Thus, our data supports the mechanism in which the reactive nucleophile is the thiolate ion, rather than the neutral thiol that needs to be first activated by the substrate. 4 The CpHMD simulations showed that the Cys-His-Asp triad maintains a catalytic geometry through several hydrogen bonds, which support their protonation states. The catalytic His272 forms a hydrogen bond simultaneously with Cys111 and Asp286 in the entire pH range 4.5-8.5, stabilizing His272 in the doubly protonated state and Asp286 and Cys111 in the deprotonated states ( Fig. 2a and d) . The doubly protonated form allows His272 to perform its role as a general acid. 4 The catalytic Cys111 forms a hydrogen bond not only with His272 but also with the indole nitrogen of Trp106, which provides further stabilization for the thiolate form and explains the significant downshifted pK a relative to the solution value of 8.5 (Table I) . The Cys111\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Trp106 hydrogen bond is important, as it maintains the position of Trp106; the analogous residue in SARS-CoV PLpro has been hypothesized as the oxyanion hole residue that donates a hydrogen bond to stabilize the negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate developed in the course of peptide hydrolysis. 13 The three hydrogen bond interactions in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro are consistent with those in SARS-Cov PLpro (Fig. 2b) .",

            "text": "In MERS-CoV PLpro, Trp106 is replaced with a Leu, which is incapable of forming a hydrogen bond with the catalytic Cys or with the negatively charged intermediate. The has been hypothesized as a cause for the significantly lower catalytic activity of MERS-CoV as compared to SARS-CoV PLpro 36 . In addition to the missing Cys\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Trp hydrogen bond, CpHMD simulations of MERS-CoV PLpro showed that the hydrogen bond between the catalytic His and Asp is nearly abolished (Fig. 2c) . The loss of hydrogen bond interactions involving the catalytic His and Cys appears to provide less stabilization to the respective charged states in MERS-CoV PLpro, as suggested by the partial titration at the highest and lowest pH condition, respectively (see supplementary material). To test whether the loss of hydrogen bond network affects the flexibility of the regions near the catalytic triad, we calculated the root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) of the C\u03b1 atoms of the catalytic triad and nearby 5 residues (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, the RMSFs of the loop residues that are sequence neighbors of the catalytic triad in MERS-CoV PLpro are increased as compared to those in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV PLpros, which are similar except for the flexible BL2 loop (267-271) region. The loop (106-116) adjacent to \u03b14 which harbors the catalytic Cys, the BL2 loop next to the catalytic His, and the \u03b2 -hairpin loop next to the catalytic Asp all display enhanced mobility ( Fig. 3a and b) . The largest increase in RMSF is seen for the BL2 loop, whereby the RMSF in MERS-CoV PLpro is nearly doubled relative to SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, which shows a somewhat higher mobility than SARS-CoV PLpro. The extremely high flexibility of the BL2 loop in MERS-as compared to SARS-CoV PLpro is consistent with the lack of electron density for the region in the first X-ray structure of the apo MERS-CoV PLpro 36 . b. Proton-coupled conformational dynamics of the BL2 loop in SARS-CoV/CoV-2 PLpro. The BL2 loop is perhaps the most prominent feature of the substrate binding site in SARS-CoV PLpro, as its movement modulates the substrate and inhibitor binding 4 . Crystal structures show that BL2 is open in the unbound SARS-CoV PLpro and it closes by about 1.5-2 \u00c5 in the bound form, which allows hydrogen bonds to form between Tyr269/Gln270 and the inhibitor 4 . Upon inspection of the X-ray structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, We noticed that the BL2 loop is open in the pH 7.5 structure (PDB 6W9C) and a zinc ion is found within the binding distance of Cys270; however, in the structure determined at pH 4.5 (PDB 6WRH), the BL2 loop closes in by 1.9 \u00c5 (C\u03b1 distance between Tyr268 and Asp164) and the zinc ion is absent. Thus, we hypothesized that the BL2 loop dynamics is coupled to the titration of C270. CpHMD titrations gave the pK a 's of 6.7 and 6.9 for Cys270 in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and the equivalent Cys271 in SARS-CoV PLpro, respectively (Table I) . Thus, Cys270/C271 samples both protonated and deprotonated states at physiological pH. The pK a downshifts relative to the model Cys pK a of 8.5 is due to the formation of local hydrogen bonds which favors the thiolate state. In the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, Cys270 does not interact with Thr265. The titration simulations showed that the distance between Cys270 and Thr265 varies widely between 5 and 15 \u00c5, when Cys270 is protonated (\u03bb value close to 0); however, when Cys270 is deprotonated (\u03bb value close to 1), the distance is locked to 1.5-2.5 \u00c5, indicating the formation of a hydrogen bond (Fig. 4a) . In addition to the hydroxyl group of Thr265, the deprotonated Cys270 can also accept a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide groups of His272 and Gly271, stabilizing the charged state (Fig. 4b) . The same hydrogen bonds were also formed in the simulations of SARS-CoV PLpro, which explains the similarly downshifted pK a of the equivalent Cys271.",

The equivalent Tyr269 in SARS-CoV PLpro is an important residue, as it forms a hydrogen bond with the inhibitors that bind to the S3 pocket 4 . When Cys270 is protonated, the probability distribution of the Tyr268-Asp164 distance covers a broad range of 8-20 \u00c5 with a peak at around 12 \u00c5; however, when Cys270 is depro- tonated, the distribution samples a narrower range of 14-20 \u00c5 with a peak at around 16 \u00c5 (Fig. 4c) . Thus, the CpHMD data suggests that the deprotonated Cys270 is correlated with the BL2 conformations that are more open and rigid, which might be attributed to the aforementioned hydrogen bond formation between the deprotonated Cys270 and the surrounding residues. Turning to SARS-CoV PLpro, Fig. 4c shows that the BL2 movement is coupled to the protonation/deprotonation of the analogous Cys271. However, in SARS-CoV PLpro, it appears the BL2 with a deprotonated Cys270 can sample a wider range of 10-20 \u00c5 as compared to SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, although the peak remains around 16 \u00c5. The wider range of BL2 movement may be attributed to the somewhat weaker hydrogen bonds involving the deprotonated Cys271. The movement of the BL2 loop is very similar between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 PLpros when Cys270 is protonated.",

For broad-spectrum inhibitor design, it is important to understand the difference in the BL2 conformation across the three PLpros. The distributions of the Tyr269/268-Asp165/164 distance for SARS-CoV/CoV-2 and the equiva- lent Thr274-Asp164 distance for MERS-CoV PLpro at physiological pH (Fig. 5a and Fig. 4d) show that the widest position of the BL2 loop is about the same across the three PLpros; however, the BL2 in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro samples the narrowest range, followed by SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV PLpro which samples the widest range between 5-22 \u00c5. The enhanced flexibility of the BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro may be attributed to the lack of a Cys equivalent to Cys271/270 in SARS-CoV/CoV-2 PLpro which can form hydrogen bonds with neighboring residues to restrict the loop motion and perhaps also the loosening of the nearby catalytic His which no longer forms double hydrogen bonds as in SARS-CoV/CoV-2 PLpro.",

            "text": "d. The Ubl domain contains an Asp with a highly upshifted pK a . As expected, nearly all Asp/Glu residues adopt standard protonation states (i.e. charged) at physiological pH; however, Asp12 in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro has a pK a abnormally upshifted from its model pK a of 4.0 to 6.7 (Table I) , making it possible to occasionally sample the protonated state at pH 7.4. Trajectory analysis suggested that this upshift is in part due to the protonated Asp12 acting as a hydrogen bond donor to either (deprotonated) Glu67 or Asn15 (Fig. 6a and c) , which stabilizes the protonated state. The two hydrogen bonds are mutually exclusive such that Asp12 is a hydrogen bond donor 82-96% of the time when it is in the protonated state (Fig. 6a) . In addition to hydrogen bonding, Asp12 is buried in a hydrophobic pocket with a very low solvent accessible surface area, which increases as Asp12 becomes deprotonated at higher pH (Fig. 6b) . In SARS-CoV PLpro, the analogous Asp13 experiences a similar degree of hydrogen bonding and solvent sequestration, resulting in a upshifted pK a of 5.9. In MERS-CoV PLpro, the analogous Asp11 primarily donates a hydrogen bond to Asn15, as the analogous residue to Glu67 is missing (see supplementary material). Compared to Asp12/13 in SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro, Asp11 is more solvent exposed in the lower pH range (see supplementary material), which may contribute to a smaller degree of pK a upshift of Asp11 in MERS-CoV PLpro as compared to SARS-CoV/CoV-2 PLpro. e. Histidines that can switch protonation states at physiological pH. CpHMD titrations revealed that three histidines unique to SARS-CoV/CoV-2, H74/73, H90/89, and H176/175 (Fig. 7) , have pK a 's around 7 (Table I) and can sample both protonated and deprotonated states at physiological pH. His74/73 located on the C-terminal end of \u03b12 in SARS-CoV/CoV-2 has a pK a of 7.3/7.3. Analysis suggested that the pK a upshift relative to the model value of 6.5 is due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with Phe70/69, Asn129/128 or a salt bridge with Glu71/70 (see supplementary material), which stabilizes the charged state. His90/89 located on the Cterminal end of \u03b13 in SARS-CoV/CoV-2 has a pK a of 7.0/6.9. Analysis showed that a small pK a upshift relative to the model pK a is due to the stabilization of the charged state by the occasional hydrogen bonding with the backbone carbonyl of Ser86/85 or transient salt-bridge interaction with Asp107/108 located near the oxyanion hole of the CoV PLpro (see supplementary material). His176/175 is located on the C-terminal end of \u03b17 and opposite to His74/73. The increased pK a of 7.4/7.3 can also be attributed to local hydrogen bonding, either with His172 in SARS-CoV-1 or Tyr171 in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (see supplementary material). f. All-atom fixed-charge MD of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. To provide support for the protonation states determined by GB-CpHMD titrations and test the proton-coupled dynamics of the BL2 loop, we performed conventional all-atom fixedcharge MD simulations of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with the catalytic sidechains fixed in the charged states and Cys270 fixed in the protonated or deprotonated state. All other residues were fixed in the standard protonation states. Two 1-\u00b5s trajectories were obtained with each Cys270 protonation state. Consistent with the GB-CpHMD simulations at physiological pH, the catalytic triad remained very stable, with the hydrogen bond between His272 and Cys111 being the strongest, followed by the His272\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Asp286 and Cys111\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Trp106 hydrogen bonds, as shown in the hydrogen bond occupancy plots (Fig. 8a) . Interestingly, while the effect of Cys270 protonation/deprotonation appears negligible for the latter two hydrogen bonds (occupancy change is below 5%) , protonation of Cys270 weakens the His272\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Cys111 hydrogen bond (occupancy decreases by over 20%). This decrease is consistent with the GB-CpHMD data, which shows that the catalytic His\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Cys hydrogen bond is significantly weakened below pH 6 as Cys270 becomes fully protonated in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (Fig. 2a) .",

The simulations showed that the catalytic Cys, His, and Asp are charged in the entire simulation pH range of 4.5-8.5 for all three PLpros, which supports the mechanism in which the reactive nucleophile is the thiolate ion and the catalytic His serves as a general acid stabilized by the catalytic aspartate.

Our finding suggests that in the absence of a ligand, protonation of C270/271 induces the closure of BL2 in SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro, which raises the possibility that a conformational selection mechanism may be operative, in which inhibitor binding shifts the BL2 conformational population to the closed form, perhaps by favoring the protonation of C270/271. While the unliganded crystal structures show that BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is more open than in SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro, CpHMD simulations suggest that BL2 has an increased flexibility in MERS-CoV PLpro and it can sample closed conformations. This finding challenges a current hypothesis, according to which SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors do not bind to MERS-CoV PLpro due to the more open BL2 loop as a result of the sequence difference and one extra residue 24, 37 .
