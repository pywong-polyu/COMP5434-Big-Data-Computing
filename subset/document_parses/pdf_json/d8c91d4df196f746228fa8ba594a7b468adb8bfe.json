The BRIDGE \"Building Regulation in Dual Generations\" Program treats maternal MI using Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills with a paired curriculum that promotes non-reactive and emotionally validating parenting designed to improve child mental health and ultimately prevent MI. The pilot feasibility trial (n = 28 dyads) included mothers and their preschool-aged children. The 20-week program was completed in a group-based format using mixed methods questionnaires and interviews. Results indicate high feasibility and acceptability (86% retention). Consistent improvements were seen across program targets and outcomes including maternal depression (d = 1.02) and child mental health (d = 1.08), with clinically significant symptom reductions for 85% of clients. Mothers with higher adversity exhibited greater reductions in parenting stress. Qualitative results highlighted efficacy in promoting positive parent-child relationships, rewarding parenting experiences, competence, and child development. Evidence suggests high feasibility and accessibility for BRIDGE in addressing intergenerational mental health needs. There was strong satisfaction with the program material and efficacy across key outcomes. BRIDGE holds promise for offering a transdiagnostic approach to preventing child MI in families of at-risk preschool aged children.",

Children with MI, including disruptive behaviour, attention deficit hyperactivity, anxiety and mood disorders, experience low quality of life similar to children with chronic physical health conditions [3] . Early exposure to maternal MI is a risk factor for the emergence of children's own MI, given the primary role of caregivers to young children's well-being as well as heritability components shared by mothers and their children [4, 5] . Notably, the intergenerational transmission of MI risk is understood to be largely transdiagnostic, such that early life exposure to one type of maternal MI (e.g., depression) confers broad risk across child psychopathology symptoms, as opposed to specific risk for a given child MI disorder or category (e.g., internalizing or externalizing) of problems [6] . Effective interventions are needed to treat maternal MI and promote mental health in at-risk children [7] .",

            "text": "Despite the identification of unmet needs for mothers with MI and their children, there are limited programs that effectively support both maternal and child mental health to ultimately prevent intergenerational transmission [8] . A lack of programming that integrates maternal mental health and parenting support poses significant obstacles for mothers given the logistics of attending two separate programs and the challenges of learning two different sets of therapeutic techniques [9] . Programs that only target adult MI reduce maternal mental health symptoms but have limited effects on child outcomes [10] . These approaches rarely transfer skills to parenting contexts or promote accessibility for parents through childcare, transportation or meals, which are well-documented barriers for mothers [11] [12] [13] [14] . Parenting programs designed to prevent child MI in families with maternal MI have had, on average, small effects, but there is emerging evidence that simultaneously addressing both maternal MI and child needs improves program efficacy by up to 50% [8, 14] . Upon review of parenting programs designed to prevent child MI and promote healthy development, maternal MI, in particular depression, has been linked to lower program engagement and more limited program efficacy. Mothers who also struggle with interpersonal relationships (e.g., attachment anxiety) [15] are particularly vulnerable to these program outcomes. We and others have previously advocated for the value of addressing both maternal mental health and parenting needs to maximize long-term impacts of interventions on child mental health [4, 9, 14] . Adaptations of existing parenting programs (e.g., Triple-P, Family Check-Up) have largely included minor adaptations designed to target maternal depression, while some mental health programs have likewise included minor adaptations relevant to the parenting context [reviewed in: 14; 9] . However, minimal work to date has systematically paired both maternal MI and parenting skills therapy into a comprehensive and integrative intervention.",

DBT has emerged as promising transdiagnostic treatment for MIs that include emotion regulation difficulties (e.g., depression, anxiety, traumatic stress, and eating disorders), which have been identified as underlying mechanisms of psychopathology [16] [17] [18] .

Many DBT skills were also taught using family context examples (e.g., Checking the Facts when a babysitter cancels). The parenting skills are drawn from behaviour management, emotion socialization, and mindfulness parenting strategies. Behaviour management training is a well-established treatment approach for reducing externalizing behaviours through clear instructions, positive reinforcement and purposeful ignoring [19] [20] [21] . BRIDGE provides mothers with various behaviour management skills aimed to help them think ahead and plan for difficult situations. These include using clear directions or 'When-Then' statements, sticker charts and motivators, and pre-teaching desired behaviours in reinforcing ways, such as using goofy superhero skills (e.g., super sidekick = staying close together in grocery store; stealth mode = extra quiet at the library).",

High feasibility and acceptability metrics were expected, given team efforts to engage in client feedback during program design to identify topics of interest (e.g., managing tantrums, building a positive relationship) and encourage accessibility (e.g., community locations, childcare, meals). Mothers, as opposed to 'parents,' were selected for inclusion based on focus group preference for speaking with other mothers about genderlinked MI stigma stressors in parenting roles as well as the elevated rates of MI is mothers, as opposed to fathers, of young children [29] . Recruitment was based on depression, and co-occurring conditions, because (1) our community partner agencies communicated preference for this clarity in recruitment materials and (2) our clinical research team decided that there would be a benefit to having diagnostic similarity given the limited power in a pilot trial. As described in the methods section, this was a diagnostically complex sample in which many mothers experienced cooccurring mental health problems across anxiety, substance use, and trauma-related diagnoses.",

As part of a program incentive, some mothers brought their children who participated in unstructured childcare, elsewhere within the community agency while they attended the program. Additional incentives to participation included the provision of meals for attendees and their children in care as well as bus tickets for parents who did not drive to the program. Parenting content included role-plays and small group discussions to share skills use ideas and scaffold social support. Participants received binders of parenting material at the beginning of the program, which included the DBT skills manual and parenting materials (one handout and one worksheet) designed for each week. Parents also received a binder of short interactive activities that built on weekly concepts (e.g., mindful breathing with stuffed animals, emotion naming in books, routines to for tough times of day) to provide fun at-home practice on core parenting techniques. Therapeutic groups were co-led by MA or PhD clinical psychology graduate students and/or a Program Development clinician. Training in DBT-Skills included a 6-week online course in DBT Skills training through Psychwire [31] along with the DBT Skills Training Manual and Handouts Worksheets [32] . The clinical team participated in an adherent 90-min DBT-consultation group with a local private practice as well as 90-min of weekly didactics and supervision on DBT and parenting skills content by the principal investigator (first author). Clients who missed sessions were invited to come early to the next session to catch up on relevant material. Consistent with DBT therapeutic agreement, a participant was considered to have dropped out if they missed four sessions in a row and declined make-up sessions. Multiple commitment and re-engagement strategies were made to promote retention, consistent with DBT therapeutic principles, including phone calls, texts, emails, and occasional individual sessions (no more than four over the course of the program), if needed, to catch up on materials or manage a particular challenge that could not be addressed in group, such as substance use or the emergence of suicidal behaviour.",

Of note, 85% of clients had a clinically significant reduction in symptomology, defined as at least a 5-point decline or decreasing categorical levels of severity on the BDI-II [57] . Changes in maternal emotion regulation skills were also observed, with moderate effect size. This is not surprising given the low (non-clinical) levels of DERS scores at baseline. DBT skill use was correlated with changes in both depression and emotion dysregulation, providing evidence supporting the application of DBT skill interventions for depression in this demographic, and consistent with theory about the transdiagnostic relevance of emotion regulation skills and our recent meta-analyses highlighting DBT as effective for depression [17, 18] .

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis on group-based parenting programs for childhood behaviour problems, found medium to large effect sizes for externalizing behaviour outcomes and small to moderate effect sizes on internalizing behaviour outcomes [58] . These findings suggest promising potential of the current program for improving child MI outcomes. Notably, exploratory analyses showed that changes in child MI symptoms were significantly associated with changes in maternal BDI and parenting stress, but only marginally associated with parent approaches to coping with children's negative emotions. Findings related to children were supported by the current study's qualitative interviews where parents disclosed decreases in parental stress and increased bidirectional communication with their children and understanding of emotions. Future research should both (1) obtain alternate responder or observational assessments of children's behavioral and emotional wellness and (2) examine the relevant contributions of improvements in child MI symptoms from reductions in maternal MI symptoms and improvements in parenting. Developing a parenting measure designed to examine BRIDGE-specific skills would be of particular help in this endeavor. Both quantitative and qualitative results highlighted the increased social support from BRIDGE and the value of being part of group with other mothers.",

Ongoing research also aims to extend the BRIDGE program to primary caregivers of various parent identities (e.g., fathers, grandparents, mothers) in different agency contexts. Finally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a telehealth version of the program to be delivered through an online platform in a similar group-based format. Telehealth therapy for treating depression has growing evidence to support its efficacy, but there has been limited such work in maternal mental health research to date [60] .",

This pilot feasibility study examined the effects of the BRIDGE program, which pairs DBT skills for maternal MI with a parenting curriculum that promotes nonreactive and emotionally validating parenting behaviours. The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of the program in sample of mothers with depression and their preschool aged children using a mixed-methods approach. Results indicated high feasibility and acceptability (86% retention) in addition to qualitative and quantitative evidence supporting client satisfaction with the program. Among primary program outcomes, clients had clinically significant reductions in symptoms of depression and improvements in emotion regulation skills. Findings also demonstrated consistent improvements across program targets, such as DBT skill use, readiness to change, and increased social support along with reductions in harsh and dismissive parenting behaviours. There was also a large reduction in child MI symptoms, which were associated with changes in maternal depression and stress. Additionally, ACEs and recent stressful experiences predicted greater reductions in parenting stress suggesting that the program may be more effective for mothers with chronic stress exposure. These findings suggest the promising potential of the BRIDGE program for promoting intergenerational mental health, which also treated as preliminary evidence, due to the small sample size, lack Increased sense of competence in new and existing parenting skills \"The positive reinforcements, umm, the consequences, that was really something that I think I was already doing but it was reassuring.\" \"I've taught them something that is gonna be a really good skill later on in life.\"",

Taken together, the BRIDGE program holds substantial promise for offering a single-program approach to preventing child MI and treating maternal MI in families of preschool aged children at risk for intergenerational transmission. Delivering BRIDGE in an accessible cost-effective group format has strong potential for scalability in transdiagnostic relevance in improving family well-being and support child health and development.",
