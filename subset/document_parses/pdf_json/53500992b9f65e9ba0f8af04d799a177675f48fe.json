Hospital wastewater is the main pollution source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and ARGs in the environment. Expanding our knowledge on the bacterial composition of hospital wastewater could help us to control infections in hospitals and decrease pathogen release into the environment. In this study, a high-throughput sequencing-based metagenomic approach was applied to investigate the community composition of bacteria and ARGs in untreated wastewater from three different types of hospitals [the general hospital, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) hospital, and stomatology hospital]. In total, 130 phyla and 2,554 genera were identified from the microbiota of the wastewaters, with significantly different bacterial community compositions among the three hospitals. Total ARG analysis using the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB) and Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) revealed that the microbiota in the wastewaters from the three hospitals harbored different types and percentage of ARGs, and their composition was specific to the hospital type based on the correlation analysis between species and ARG abundance, some ARGs contributed to different bacterial genera with various relationships in different hospitals. In summary, our findings demonstrated a widespread occurrence of ARGs and ARG-harboring microbiota in untreated wastewaters of different hospitals, suggesting that protection measures should be applied to prevent human infections. Concurrently, hospital wastewater should be treated more specifically for the removal of pathogens before its discharge into the urban sewage system.",

            "text": "Antibiotic resistance poses a serious challenge to the treatment of pathogenic infections. However, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are not only the outcome from human clinic settings, but it can also come from the interaction with animals, plants, soil, sea, and environmental samples. Two-thirds of antibiotics are consumed by animal husbandry (Done et al., 2015) , and some were used in crops (Taylor and Reeder, 2020) , which increase the ARGs in the environment. This may be relevant to human health interventions on food, water, and sewage. Except for the precision medication in the clinic with antibiotics, the controlling of ARGs need the social system's efforts in the whole world (Zinsstag et al., 2011; Hernando-Amado et al., 2020) . Since the COVID-19 outbreak, people from most countries are still being newly infected, which is recognized in the microbiology world as the concept of all humans sharing \"One Health\" (Ruckert et al., 2020) . As most antibiotic resistance (AR) pathogens are released into the natural ecosystems by humans and animals (Karkman et al., 2019) , analysis of ARGs in wastewater from hospitals, farms, and wastewater treatment plants is essential (Karkman et al., 2018; Manyi-Loh et al., 2018; Kayali and Icgen, 2020) . In hospital wastewater, the levels of AR are different from those in the natural environment (Rodriguez-Mozaz et al., 2015) . Hospital effluents are a mixture of different compounds, including pharmaceuticals, diagnostic agents, disinfectants, and metabolites of these compounds. They are highly hazardous because of their infection rate and toxicity. These wastewaters should be treated to reduce transmission of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) to the ecosystem, which is one type of intervention to control resistance (Petrovich et al., 2020) . Another intervention is controlling antimicrobials use, such as selecting novel antimicrobials with limited capacity to ARBs or using fewer antimicrobials. Moreover, traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) were used in the treatment of infectious diseases to avoid antibiotic resistance (Cai et al., 2017; Su et al., 2020) .",

There were positive correlations between selected ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetQ, and qnrS) and the concentrations of certain antibiotics in the wastewaters of five hospitals in Xinjiang, China (Li et al., 2016) . There were also correlations between antimicrobial residues and bacterial populations as well as between the prevalence of ARGs and bacterial populations in a wastewater treatment plant system of an urban hospital (Varela et al., 2014) . However, the types and concentrations of antibiotics in hospital effluents vary. The categories of drugs administered and the duration of administration also vary depending on the type of hospital. In addition, the consumption of antibiotics was found to be seasonally dependent in one city, with no correlation between the seasonal consumption of antibiotics and the total levels of antibiotics in the city's wastewater (Coutu et al., 2013) . By examined hospital effluents from four different types of hospitals (university hospital, general hospital, pediatric hospital, and maternity hospital) and the amount of pharmaceuticals in wastewater varied according to their scale (Santos et al., 2013) . In fact, antibiotic usage in the treatment of different clinical departments should vary. For the treatment of odontogenic infections, common antibiotics such as amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, azithromycin ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, gentamycin, and penicillin are used (Poveda-Roda et al., 2007) . However, for the primary health sector, the drugs with high concentrations in wastewater were furosemide, ibuprofen, oxytetracycline, and ciprofloxacin (Stuer-Lauridsen et al., 2000) . Thus, these factors may lead to differences in bacterial populations and ARG prevalence in wastewaters.",

Enterococcus contributed more than 50% for the tobramycin and sisomicin ARG type in B and C groups, while it contributed 12.80 and 13.31% for tobramycin and sisomicin ARG types in A and B groups, respectively; and they were both only 0.85% in C group. These results indicated that to reduce one type of ARGs in hospital wastewater, different types of bacterial species should be considered. Then, a network analysis approach was applied to explore the correlation between ARG types and microbial taxa on antibiotic type level ( Figure 5B ). There were 10 antibiotic types ARGs co-occurring with nine genera of bacteria. Acinetobacter was the possible host positively associated with six types of ARGs: amikacin, isepamicin, sulforamide, tobramycin, sisomicin, and netilmicin. Acidovorax was positively correlated with seven types of ARGs: amikacin, tobramycin, sulfonamide, netilmicin, sisomicin, dibekacin, and isepamicin. In addition, there were positive correlations between six ARGs types and Bacteroides. Enterococcus and Streptococcus were found to be host of tetracycline and macrolide ARGs.",

            "text": "Hospital wastewater contains high concentrations of antibiotics and several types of pathogenic bacteria, which are the main source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and ARGs (Hassoun-Kheir et al., 2020) . In this study, we attempted to elucidate the differences in the composition of bacteria in wastewaters from three university-affiliated hospitals in Luzhou city, Sichuan Province, PR China, using high-throughput sequencing analysis. These three hospitals consisted of one general hospital, one general TCM hospital, and one stomatological hospital. By comparing the corresponding species and taxonomic annotation information with the NCBI NR database, our results showed that the community composition of bacteria in the wastewaters was different between hospitals at both the phyla and genera levels with significantly different communities of bacteria in each of them (Figures 1, 2) . In the wastewater from three comprehensive hospitals with general departments, the community compositions of bacteria were more similar, Arcobacter, Acinetobacter, and Dechloromonas phyla were predominant with different relative abundances (Wang et al., 2018) . The bacterial community composition of wastewater from the oncological hospital have shown a higher difference compared to the general hospital (Szekeres et al., 2017) . The cluster tree and PCoA analysis for the relationship of community abundance between the three groups in this study also were similar to these results. The composition of bacteria in the wastewaters of the A and B groups was more similar to each other than to that of the C group. This may have occurred because both the A and B groups covered general medical practice, while the C group only focused on stomatology. Herein, relative protection should be applied as a measure to avoid the spread of infections according to the different bacterial compositions in the wastewater of the hospital. For example, Arcobacter was the main contributor to the wastewater from the C group; thus, more resources and attention should be focused on preventing infections and treating the wastewater specifically against Arcobacter. In addition, wastewater pretreatments can be targeted to harmful bacteria considering their properties. As Firmicutes live in an anaerobic environment and also are associated with high antibiotic and pollutant levels (Li et al., 2011; B\u00e4umlisberger et al., 2015) , monitoring the condition of wastewater may control the abundance of bacteria of this phylum. Currently, most wastewaters are treated with sewage processing techniques before discharging into the urban sewage, which can remove some antibiotics resistance bacteria (Huang et al., 2012; Majeed et al., 2021 ). Yet, it still contains higher ARGs than natural water, and one of the main sources of ARGs is hospital effluent (Verlicchi et al., 2010) . There were fewer types of ARGs in the wastewater from specialized hospitals compared with general hospitals (Szekeres et al., 2017) . In this study, the ARGs in wastewaters from three hospitals were analyzed using the ARDB and CARD. As shown in Figure 3 , the diversity of the ARGs was the lowest for the C group, however, the ARGs types and percentages in the wastewaters were different between the three groups. Among the 15 main types of ARGs, six types differed in the wastewaters of the three hospitals. For the common antibiotics (bacitracin, tetracycline, and tobramycin), there were significant differences in the levels of bacitracin ARGs among the three groups. In addition, the abundance of bacitracin-resistant bacteria in the C group was significantly more than that in the other two groups. Thus, disinfection and preventive measures used in hospitals that specialize in stomatology should target these specific bacteria.",

We found that significant differences in the bacterial community characteristics and ARG composition among the three hospitals and they differed between the types of hospital. Based on the differences in the bacterial communities and ARG compositions between the three types of hospitals, our results suggested that targeted prevention and control measures against related microbiota should be considered, and hospital wastewaters should be treated more specifically for pathogens that are present in it before the discharge into the urban sewage system. However, the wastewater samples were collected in the same season, which cannot cover the bacteria composition during the rest of the year, thus more samples from different seasons may give more information. Otherwise, there were no data about the antibiotic types in raw hospital wastewater, though it gave a negative correlation between the concentrations of antibiotics and ARGs (Wang et al., 2018) . Another limitation of this study was that there was no physiochemical analysis for the raw wastewater, which may be affected by the seasons or other environmental conditions. This should be considered in future studies on hospital wastewater. Moreover, special techniques for preventing pathogen infection and release need to be identified according to the medical treatments being offered in a hospital.",
