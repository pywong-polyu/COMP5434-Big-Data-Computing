We sought to investigate the details, determinants, and prognostic significance of symptom burden in hospitalized patients with HF. Methods and results We prospectively evaluated consecutive hospitalized patients with HF as primary diagnosis at our institution using the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS) both on admission and at discharge. The IPOS, which is a well-validated multi-dimensional symptom assessment scale among advanced illness, consists of 17 questions for enquiring about physical symptoms (10 items), emotional symptoms (4 items) and communication and practical issues (3 items) using a 5-point Likert scale (0 [best]-4 [worst] points). Clinically relevant symptoms were defined as \u22652 points for each IPOS item. Worsening symptom burden was defined as the total IPOS score at discharge being poorer than that on admission. Of 294 patients (mean age: 77.5 \u00b1 12.0 years, male: 168 patients, New York Heart Association class IV: 96 patients, mean left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]: 44%, and median N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] level: 4418 ng/L), the median (IQR) total IPOS score on admission was 19 (12, 27) and they were widely distributed (minimum: 0maximum: 52). The total IPOS score on admission was not correlated with the HF severity, including LVEF (Spearman's \u03c1 = \u00c00.05, P = 0.43), NT-proBNP levels (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.08, P = 0.20) or in-hospital mortality prediction model (GWTG-HF risk score) (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.01, P = 0.90). Total IPOS scores significantly decreased during hospitalization as a whole (median [IQR]: 13 [6, 21] at discharge; P < 0.001 vs. those on admission). All of the four emotional symptoms (patient anxiety, depression, family anxiety and feeling at peace) remained in the top 5 of clinically relevant symptoms at discharge, whereas none of 10 physical symptoms were nominated. Worsening symptom burden was noted in 28% of the patients during hospitalization, and was independently associated with higher all-cause mortality after discharge (hazard ratio: 2.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-5.09; P = 0.044) even after adjustment by age and HF mortality prediction model (MAGGIC risk score). Conclusions We revealed that hospitalized patients with HF had multi-dimensional symptom burdens which varied among individuals and were not correlated with the disease severity. Emotional symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, were the main clinically relevant symptoms at discharge. A worsening IPOS score was noted in a quarter of patients with HF and was associated with a poor prognosis, suggesting the importance of holistic symptom assessment during the course of hospitalization for HF.",

To date, there is a paucity of studies regarding holistic symptom assessment during the course of hospitalization for HF.",

The details of the registry were described previously. 15 Briefly, the diagnosis of HF was confirmed based on the Framingham definition of HF by two or more cardiologists at a conference at the cardi-ology department of the hospital. 16 The objective of this registry is to evaluate the current status of symptom burden (such as physical, psychological, social, and spiritual symptoms) using validated scales in a holistic manner among hospitalized patients with HF, and to investigate the predictors and prognostic significance of these symptoms in patients with HF. We herein report the baseline characteristics, determinants, temporal change and short-term prognostic significance of symptom burden in patients with HF who were hospitalized at our institution between October 2019 and July 2021. Follow-up was censored on 9 August 2021. We excluded patients who were unable to fill out the IPOS questionnaires. The reasons for exclusion in this study were as follows: unwillingness to respond to the questionnaire, dementia, prior stroke, depressed level of consciousness, hard of hearing, death soon after admission, early discharge, worsening HF, incomplete IPOS response and others ( Figure 1 ). For patients with multiple admissions, only the first hospitalization during the study period was analysed. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethical committees of the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center (20-014).",

Emotional symptoms and communication issues are graded by frequency. The practical issue is scaled for the occurrence of the addressed problem. A higher score indicates higher symptom levels and clinically relevant symptoms were defined as \u22652 points for each item according to a previous study. 20 The values of the individual IPOS scores were added up to a total score ranging from 0 (minimum burden) to 68 (maximum burden). 10, 20 We used a Japanese translation of the IPOS patient version 3 day recall period in this study. A clinical research coordinator at our department guided the patients through the answering of the questionnaires if necessary and it took approximately 10 minutes to complete the questionnaires. There was an extra item in the IPOS questionnaire asking if they filled out the questionnaire alone or with the help of healthcare staff or family/ 1964 Y. Hamatani et al. friends. We obtained IPOS questionnaires both on admission and at discharge during hospitalization for HF. When we were unable to obtain the questionnaires, we assessed the reason for non-response in each case. We excluded patients lacking \u22651 IPOS items (defined as incomplete IPOS response). The results of IPOS questionnaires were not shared with the attending physicians during the study period.",

The relationship between total IPOS score on admission and important baseline characteristics (GWTG-HF risk score, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] levels and left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]) was determined by Spearman correlation analysis. Second, we investigated the distribution and details of the IPOS score at discharge. We evaluated the prevalence of clinically relevant symptoms (\u22652 points for each item) among 17 items during hospitalization for HF, and ranked the frequency of symptoms based on the framework of three subscales (10 physical symptoms, 4 emotional symptoms, and 3 communication/practical issues). Third, we evaluated the temporal changes in IPOS score during hospitalization for HF. The paired Wilcoxon test was applied to assess the difference between the IPOS score on admission and at discharge. Thereafter, we defined worsening symptom burden as the IPOS Symptom assessment using IPOS in hospitalized HF score at discharge being higher than that on admission, and compared the baseline characteristics between patients with worsening symptom burden and those without it. Lastly, we investigated the association of worsening symptom burden during hospitalization with mortality after discharge. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and log-rank testing was performed to assess differences among groups. The hazard ratio of the events was calculated using Cox proportional hazards model. We adjusted the results by age and MAGGIC risk score in multivariable Cox models. All tests were two-tailed and a value of P < 0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were performed using JMP version 14.2.0.",

After adjustment by age and MAGGIC-risk score in the multivariable Cox regression analysis, worsening IPOS score during hospitalization remained an independent predictor of all-cause mortality after discharge (hazard ratio: 2.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-5.09; P = 0.044) ( Table 3 ).

In this study, comprehensive symptom assessment using IPOS identified a large symptom burden, including physical, psycho-social and spiritual issues, in hospitalized patients with HF. Ideally, symptom burden should be routinely and regularly evaluated in the course of HF; however, it is difficult to keep track of this in a busy cardiovascular medical service. Under such circumstances, hospitalization constitutes a convenient and suitable time point to start holistic symptom assessment because hospitalization is a hallmark that can easily be identified and is a strong predictor for poor prognosis in patients with HF. Moreover, hospitalization is considered to be a great opportunity for the multi-disciplinary team to become involved in the management of patients with HF. We believe that assessment using the IPOS by multi-disciplinary team including nurses can be integrated into hospital man-agement, complementing existing practice without requiring additional equipment. Of note, the symptom burden varied among individuals (range: 0-52), and the total IPOS score was not associated with the baseline characteristics such as NYHA class, HF stage, history of hospitalization, LVEF and natriuretic peptide levels. While HF is associated with a variety of co-morbidities, there was no significant association between IPOS score and co-morbid conditions except for a history of depression. Previous studies also demonstrated that no clinical background factors correlated with PROMs, including the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaires (KCCQ), the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire and the Euro-QoL 5D scores. 26, 27 Taken together, we were unable to predict the impaired PROMs using the patient background and symptom burden can only be identified by asking the patients, suggesting the importance of holistic symptom assessment using validated screening tools in all patients with HF. Indeed, a European position statement recommends that a symptoms and needs assessment-based approach be provided regardless of disease severity. 28",

We revealed that emotional symptoms remained at discharge, as shown in Figure 4 , in hospitalized patients with HF. Anxiety, depression and psychological needs were reportedly the most frequent concerns among patients receiving interventions by the palliative care team (mainly those with cancer). 29 The course of HF is characterized by uncertainty and loss of control, thus patients with HF can develop emotional distress similar to those with cancer. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that both anxiety and depression are common among hospitalized patients with HF using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. 15 Psychological symptoms might be under-diagnosed and under-treated in daily practice unless healthcare staff pays attention to them. However, psychological symptoms are associated with increased mortality and rehospitalization in patients with HF. Therefore, addressing psychological symptoms is recommended as a multi-domain approach for HF, 30, 31 and our studies strongly support the importance of screening psychological symptoms in patients with HF. The unique feature of the IPOS when compared with other PROMs is that it integrates the patients' perspectives and views on the concerns of their families. Our survey using the IPOS revealed that more than half of the patients had family anxiety even at discharge, which was the most common clinically relevant symptom at discharge. Self-assessment tools for caregivers revealed that family anxiety is highly ranked in patients with advanced illness. 32, 33 HF is considered to be a disease that places burdens on their family. Indeed, previous small studies suggested that the majority of caregivers of patients with HF, mainly their family, had anxiety. 34, 35 These studies and ours underline the importance of holistic care for relatives as well as for patients. From this perspective, IPOS, which encompasses the domain of family anxiety, is considered to be a more useful PROM than other scales among patients with HF.",

As shown in Figure 5 and Table 3 , a worsening IPOS score during hospitalization was associated with a poor prognosis after discharge. PROMs, such as KCCQ or Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, are independently associated with subsequent death in patients with HF, 36, 37 although the precise pathophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. In addition, change in KCCQ is associated with a poor prognosis in these patients. 38 To date, the prognostic significance of temporal IPOS changes during hospitalization has not been reported. Deterioration of the IPOS score may merely indicate the progression of HF; however, there were little differences in disease severity between patients with and without a worsening IPOS score in our study ( Table 2) . Although the relationship between temporal IPOS changes and adverse outcomes remains to be elucidated, holistic symptom assessment during the course of HF may constitute a starting point for more customized care, and our study suggested that it is imperative for health care providers to evaluate PROMs from the acute phase to the chronic phase in patients with HF. The IPOS is easy to respond because of its briefness and minimization of the text, and enables healthcare staff to identify and rank the patients' symptom burdens. Indeed, a substantial proportion of hospitalized patients with HF were willing to complete the questionnaires and no adverse effects were reported or conceptually occurred by this intervention, indicating that the IPOS can be routinely used during the course of hospitalization for HF. Specific referral criteria for palliative care have not been determined in daily practice. We hope implementation of palliative care based on IPOS questionnaires will be able to improve the quality of life among patients with HF.",

Third, approximately one-fourth of the total hospitalized patients were unable to respond the IPOS questionnaire, possibly introducing selection bias. Indeed, patients with IPOS data on admission were younger, less often NHYA class IV and had a lower NT-proBNP level on admission than those without (Table S1 ). However, IPOS can be used as a proxy assessment in patients who are unable to complete the questionnaires, even though we did not investigate its utility in this study. Fourth, the coordinator who guided the patients through answering the questions did not receive any specific training for administrating the IPOS questionnaires, resulting in some unavoidable bias. In addition, we did not collect the data about acceptability or feasibility of IPOS questionnaires in this study. Fifth, we did not obtain the quantitative scale about frailty which could be associated with symptom burdens in patients with HF.
