The effects of and response to the pandemic in humanitarian settings are not well understood as data are limited and of poor quality. The number of cases in such settings has increased over time [2] , yet reported cases and deaths have not reached high levels of other countries like Brazil or India [2] , nor the gloomy scenarios from initial modeling exercises [3, 4] . Vulnerabilities specific to humanitarian contexts include precarious living conditions, poor access to water, overcrowding, lack of cleaning supplies, and dependence upon external funding [5, 6] . These factors raised concerns about governments' and the international community's capacities to respond to the pandemic and to maintain essential health services [7] . Furthermore, diverting funding and attention to the pandemic may increase vulnerability to and negative outcomes from other diseases. In previous large scale epidemics (e.g., Ebola in West Africa and cholera in Yemen), there was excess morbidity and mortality from communicable and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) [8] .

Observed viral transmission, measured by IRs, was lower in the refugee camps compared to their respective governorates and Jordan during the same time period (Table 4 ); in Zarqa (where Azraq is located), the IR was 3,856/100,000 persons, and in Mafraq (where Zaatari is located), it was 3,660/100,000 persons. Both camps' IRs were lower than the national level in Jordan (5,974/100,000 persons) for the same time period [11] . IRs in Azraq and Zaatari followed similar, but delayed, trends in their respective governorates and in Jordan (Fig 1) . Spikes in Zaatari followed increases in Mafraq. Azraq also followed increases in Zarqa, except for a spike in epi week 43 that is likely an artifact due to delayed testing of previous weeks. Consequently, Azraq and Zaatari were likely affected by outside transmission rather than driving the epidemic in the governorate. Lower IRs in Zaatari could be partially explained by lower testing capacity than the national level (testing rate was 58,003/100,000 persons in Jordan compared to 39,367 in Zaatari during the study period). However, the testing rate in Azraq was twice the national level (98,187/ 100,000 persons), suggesting a lower infection rate. Testing (as well as hospitalization and vaccination) was free for refugees as they were included in the National Preparedness and Response COVID-19 plan, whose whole-of-society approach meant both Jordanians and non-Jordanians living in host communities and in camps had the same access to health services [16] . Furthermore, a positive test result did not have any implications in terms of status or access to service or livelihood supports, besides the need to isolate (as with nationals). Barriers to testing were, therefore, mainly on the supply side (i.e., testing availability). The Government of Jordan's effort to integrate refugees into the national response plan is an important step toward universal health coverage and an important path toward ending the pandemic.",

These nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were likely important factors in successfully delaying the introduction of COVID-19 among refugees in the camps and reducing its transmission. Such measures may have been easier to implement in enclosed and regimented settings and, therefore, could have been more effective within camps than among the general population and out-of-camp refugees in Jordan. More community behavioral data are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Furthermore, this is no indication that NPIs are more easily accepted or acceptable in camps, nor that camp-like settings are a desirable solution to prevent the spread of diseases. Durable and integrated solutions that strive for better living standards without mobility limitations remains UNHCR's long-term goals for refugees.",

It could also indicate changes in health seeking behavior that led to reduced care for RTIs, possibly due to fear of being tested, isolated, and quarantined due to COVID-19.

Values for ANC1 are often overestimated as women may seek care in multiple facilities. While a reduction in ANC1 was observed when the pandemic began, the historic trend is difficult to disentangle from COVID-19 due to high variability. Similarly, live births attended by health personnel did not seem to be affected by COVID-19. The impacts of COVID-19 on maternal health services have been diverse in non refugee settings ranging from no changes reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo except for urban centers [27, 28] , to positive changes in Kenya [29] , with mixed effects in Uganda [21, 22] . UNHCR and its partners attempted to maintain maternal health services by switching to a hybrid delivery model including telemedicine to reduce exposure for pregnant women; this could have had a positive effect on maintaining services. Immediate reductions were observed in both camps for family planning services for new consultations and existing clients. This may reflect a reluctance to visit health facilities that resolved over time and movement limitations for nonurgent care. However, since drug prescriptions were extended from 1 to 3 months from April 2020, such a drop in consultations may have limited disruption in contraception utilization. Interviews of family planning users could shed light on this aspect, but were beyond the scope of this study.",

First, treating the COVID-19 period as a single uniform period with a clear starting point may not capture the dynamics of this time, as different NPIs were introduced or lifted, transmission patterns varied, and attitudes and behavior changed. Second, other events that affected outcomes may have occurred both in pre-COVID-19 period and in the COVID-19 period. Factors such as policy changes, arrival of new populations with different health profiles, and changes in funding for service provision made it difficult to establish a pre-COVID-19 comparison. For example, mortality was unexpectedly elevated in the first half of 2018 in both camps. ANC1, deliveries, and diabetes consultations showed important heterogeneity or erratic patterns, which reduced the model fit and limited the capacity of the analysis to identify changes. Third, COVID-19 is one of the many factors affecting displacement settings, which makes it difficult to identify a \"normal\" time with which to compare. Finally, seasonality may have been a time-varying confounder that varied over years, and the autocorrelation structure of order 1 used in analysis may not adequately capture autocorrelation.

While before COVID-19, health utilization rate had a long-term decreasing trend, when the pandemic began, there was an immediate drop that was not explained by this longer trend, accounting for long-term trend and seasonality. Estimates for change in slope during the COVID-19 period are very close to 1, indicating that the slope of the utilization rate remained relatively stable during COVID-19 period compared to pre-COVID-19 period.

LRTI show an increase in both camps, but results are not sustained over time, and results are not statistically significant. ILIs show an immediate decrease in both camps (not statistically significant) and a significant decreasing slope. Model fit is satisfactory for all RTIs except for ILIs, for which a Gaussian model is used.

Reproductive health. Family planning indicators report an immediate drop when the pandemic began in both camps (Fig B in S3 Supporting Information, Additional Results).

Estimations for Zaatari are less stable than for Azraq due to high variability in values, reflected in wide CIs, poor model fit, and a nonstatistically significant result for new consultations. Change in slope over time is positive for the new family planning indicators in each camp; however, it differs from pre-COVID-19 trend for new consultations only in Azraq (IRR: 1.071, 95% CI: [1.011 to 1.135], p-value = 0.020). For Zaatari, there is an increase change of 7% per month since beginning of COVID-19 period, but the CI is wide, and results are not statistically significant (IRR: 1.073, 95% CI: [0.990 to 1.164]). Mortality. Absolute number of deaths in both camps over the entire study period is low: 5.9 registered deaths per month in Azraq on average (1.93 deaths/1,000 people/year) and 12 in Zaatari (1.85 deaths/1,000 people/year). Consequently, model fit is problematic for Azraq (Box-Ljung p-value = 0.0205), and CIs are large.
