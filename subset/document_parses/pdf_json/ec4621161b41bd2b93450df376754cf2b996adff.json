            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) booster vaccination has been proposed and is undergoing experiments or pilots in response to the new challenges of COVID-19 brought by highly contagious variants [1] . A striking example of such a COVID-19 variant is the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant, which has led to a surge in infection cases across the globe [2] . Moreover, the effectiveness of approved COVID-19 vaccines against variants remains unclear. One recent study reported that the effectiveness of two-dose BNT162b2 (mRNA) and ChAdOx1 (adenovirus vector) vaccines remained as high as 88% and 67%, respectively, among patients with the Delta variant [3] . Another laboratory study found that the antibodies produced by mRNA vaccines still offered protection against the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta) variants, but the protection was much less strong [2] . Until May 2021, three inactivated vaccines, one adenovirus vector vaccine, and one recombinant subunit vaccine against COVID-19 have been used in China, and all of them were domestically produced [4] . Among them, inactivated vaccines possessed the largest market share and were the most frequently administered [5] . An Indian case-control study published in November 2021 showed that the adjusted effectiveness of the two-dose BBV152 (inactivated vaccine) at least 14 days before testing was 47% and suggested that the relatively low effectiveness might be due to the high prevalence of the circulating delta variant in India [6] . Infectious disease experts have carefully weighed the need for booster shots for certain vulnerable groups or the entire population to protect against the circulating new variants and improve immunity level, as the duration of protection remains unknown [7] . As concerns about variants and protection duration continue to alarm the public of the importance of booster shots, it is imperative to make some preparations in advance to understand the demands for booster vaccination.",

In China, the mass immunization program has been progressing smoothly since its launch on 31 December 2020 [10] , and the country has delivered 2.47 billion vaccine doses as of 27 November 2021 [11] . Clinical evidence supports the widely acknowledged two-dose vaccination schedule [12] , but limited clinical evidence is available to support the necessity of boosters in China [13] . However, it was reported in late September 2021 that China would launch COVID-19 booster vaccinations for priority populations aged 18-59 years old who had completed two-dose immunization six months before. Later, local areas such as Zhejiang and Henan provinces officially announced the implementation of booster vaccination programs, which could soon be launched throughout the country.",

A declining trend of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rates has been found in China [17] and the United States [18, 19] , and it has been noted that many factors could be considered in the interpretation of varied vaccine acceptance in different countries [14, [20] [21] [22] [23] . Another issue with the blooming controversy is whether the COVID-19 vaccine needs annual (or regular) boosters to maintain high levels of immunity against both the original virus and variants, similar to annual seasonal influenza shots. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the public acceptance of COVID-19 boosters to prepare for effective promotion strategies [14, 15] .",

Briefly, the survey was launched on the largest online survey platform, Wen Juan Xing (Changsha Ranxing Information Technology Co., Ltd., Changsha, China), which consists of over 2.6 million Chinese members with confirmed personal information and diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, and allows automatic logical proofreading to reduce input errors and avoid missing values [24] . The Vaccines 2021, 9, 1461 3 of 17 target population of the survey was Chinese adults living in the mainland of China, and a sampling method stratified by age and location was adopted to match the characteristics of the Chinese adult population in the Wen Juan Xing sample database. A total of 3280 adults were invited to participate in the survey via Wen Juan Xing, and 1167 completed the survey with a response rate of 35.58%. We limited our study sample to respondents aged 18-59 years old because older adults often have difficulties accessing online surveys. Then, the final sample was 1145 adults aged 18-59 years old (22 aged 60 and above were excluded from the 1167 survey participants). This study was ethically reviewed and approved by the Peking University Institutional Review Board (IRB 00001052-20011).",

The HBM model comprises six dimensions (i.e., five positive aspects and one negative aspect) [32] [33] [34] . For a patient in need of certain health-related behaviors, positive aspects include (1) perceived susceptibility: believing to be susceptible to the disease; (2) perceived severity: believing that the disease will negatively impact quality of life; (3) perceived benefits: believing that adopting the behaviors is beneficial to reduce susceptibility or severity; (4) self-efficacy: having the capacity to engage in the behaviors; and (5) cues to action: having motivations to adopt the behaviors. The negative aspect refers to perceived barriers: believing that there are some restrictions or obstructions when adopting the behaviors [32] [33] [34] .",

Based on the HBM model, we conducted unadjusted analyses followed by a multiple logistic regression analysis to examine associations of perceptions, vaccination history, and sociodemographics with COVID-19 booster vaccination acceptance. A two-sided p value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Additionally, bar diagrams were used to depict the characteristics of reasons for accepting or not accepting booster vaccination. Finally, the distribution of annual WTP for booster vaccination was examined. All data were analyzed using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).",

Our findings indicated that a large proportion of respondents (84.80%) expressed their intention to receive COVID-19 booster vaccinations. At present, few studies have been published on booster acceptance, and it is difficult to make direct domestic or inter-country comparisons. We compared our findings of booster acceptance rates with the public acceptance of non-booster COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates, and found that generally, the booster acceptance rate was close to some non-booster vaccine acceptance rates reported in China, such as the 88.5% shown in a longitudinal study in the well-contained phase (Nov-Dec 2020) [17] . However, the booster acceptance rate in this study was much higher than the non-booster vaccine acceptance rate (55.3%) reported by Zhao et al. in Jan-Apr 2021 [39] . The higher acceptance rate of boosters reported in this study may be partly explained by higher public expectations of boosters facing the new challenges of variants [11] , as well as the observed increasing trend in COVID-19 vaccination acceptance in the first half of 2021 [39] since this study was conducted in June 2021, several months after Zhao et al.'s survey.",

Vaccine efficacy has been reported as an important predictor of vaccine acceptance and uptake [15, 30, 40] , and a discrete choice experiment (DCE) study conducted in China found that high effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines was the most favored attribute [41] . The importance of perceived barriers has likewise been reported in previous studies of COVID-19 vaccines [15, 42] , and it was emphasized that strict surveillance during booster development should be organized. It is important to improve health promotion and reduce barriers to booster vaccination. Hence, public health intervention programs should focus on increasing beliefs about vaccine effectiveness and reducing perceived adverse effects and safety barriers if boosters are widely approved for mass vaccination against COVID-19 variants in the future.",

Prior studies also found that vaccination history had a positive effect on individual vaccination intention [27, 43, 44] . For example, one study in Australia found that the acceptance of previous influenza vaccination had the largest effect on the willingness to be vaccinated against H1N1 during the 2009 pandemic (OR = 5.03) [27] . Previous vaccination history should be carefully considered when designing vaccination schedules and targeted measures. The multiple logistic regression of sociodemographic characteristics indicated that respondents aged 41-50 and with a higher education level expressed significantly lower booster acceptance, while employment or belonging to priority groups for vaccination remained indicators of higher booster acceptance. These results were inconsistent with previous studies in China concerning COVID-19 vaccine acceptance that highlighted the impacts of gender, marital status, and regional or rural/urban differences [17, 20, 29] . Further studies are needed to investigate the differences in sociodemographic characteristics between vaccine acceptance and booster acceptance. The associations between sociodemographic characteristics and booster acceptance in this study could provide preliminary results to help the design of booster-targeted vaccination strategies to increase coverage.",

For booster refusers, there were also differences between previously vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The previously vaccinated group was more concerned about vaccine recommendations or the need to be vaccinated again, while the unvaccinated group posed more concerns about contradictions and vaccine efficacy. Therefore, for previously vaccinated respondents, more efforts could be made concerning recommendations from reliable information sources and emphasis on the need for and importance of boosters; for previously unvaccinated respondents, more attention could be paid to the correct understanding of vaccine contradictions and the effectiveness of booster shots.",

Second, self-reported responses may be subjective to recalling bias and a tendency to report socially desirable responses. We designed an anonymous survey with most questions asking respondents' thoughts and feelings at the moment, which may have helped to minimize the effect of self-reporting bias. Third, booster acceptance and WTP were derived based on hypothetical COVID-19 booster vaccination before the approval of final products [52] .
