To reduce their facial pressure ulcer risk, prophylactic dressings can be used; however, the biomechanical efficacy of this intervention has not been studied yet. We, therefore, evaluated facial soft tissue exposures to sustained mechanical loads in a prone position, with versus without multi-layered silicone foam dressings applied as tissue protectors at the forehead and chin. We used an anatomically realistic validated finite element model of an adult male head to determine the contribution of the dressings to the alleviation of the sustained tissue loads. The application of the dressings considerably relieved the tissue exposures to loading. Specifically, with respect to the forehead, the application of a dressing resulted in 52% and 71% reductions in soft tissue exposures to effective stresses and strain energy densities, respectively. Likewise, a chin dressing lowered the soft tissue exposures to stresses and strain energy densities by 78% and 92%, respectively.

[2] [3] [4] The PU risk increases 3.3-fold when insensate patients are placed prone, with respect to a supine position. 5 Facial PUs are among the most common anatomical sites for PUs associated with prone positioning, which is typically used in all spinal surgeries, in large-volume liposuctions, in nephrolithotomy (for treating large or complex renal stones) and where surgical access to the posterior head and neck is required. 6 Intraoperatively-acquired PUs are reported to occur 5% to 66% of the times, correlating to an increase in the length of hospital stays by 6.7 days for those patients affected by PUs, therefore, adding approximately $1.3-billion in annual healthcare costs in the United States alone. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The longer the surgery time is, the greater the risk of an intraoperatively acquired PU. 11 In addition to surgery, the use of prone positioning is also rising sharply in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide, where mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting from the coronavirus 2019 disease are placed prone. Prone ventilation sessions of approximately 9 to 24 hours (depending on the practice across different facilities and patient conditions) appear to improve the chest wall mechanics, lung recruitability, and tissue oxygenation in ARDS COVID-19 patients and to lower their risk of ventilator-induced lung injuries. [12] [13] [14] Clearly, however, these COVID-19 patients are also susceptible to facial PUs during the prone ventilation sessions, which is highlighted in new international clinical guidelines published since the outbreak of the pandemic. 15, 16 Prone positioning is associated with several important and potentially catastrophic complications, such as haemodynamic changes, [17] [18] [19] [20] ophthalmologic and neurological complications, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] visual loss, 6, 8, 17, 28, 29 and of course, PUs. 6, 8, 9, 17, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] During prone surgical procedures, the primary support areas of the head are the forehead and chin, especially for patients positioned on an Andrews frame for prolonged spine procedures. 31, 33 In addition to the muscle flaccidity and hypotensive effects associated with anaesthesia and the blood loss during surgery, the face has little muscle mass to provide blood supply to the skin and subcutaneous facial tissues under the sustained deformations caused by the weight of the prone head. This promotes the development of facial PUs, particularly at the primary support regions of the prone head, that is, the forehead and chin. 8, 28 The overall thin facial tissue structures imply that the sustained deformations would have a damaging effect that extends beyond the skin, and indeed, there is anecdotal evidence that some of the facial PUs associated with a prone position is deep tissue injuries (DTIs). 7, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] The DTI nature of these facial injuries (which are difficult to heal without significant scarring compared with category 1/2 PUs 35 ) requires a more comprehensive bioengineering approach to protect the facial soft tissues in prone positioning. Specifically, an adequate prophylactic intervention targeting the forehead and chin should have good biomechanical efficacy in alleviating both the superficial and deep facial soft tissue loads.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 171, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 366, "end": 369, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 370, "end": 373, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 374, "end": 377, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 486, "end": 487, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 798, "end": 799, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1086, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1090, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1094, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1098, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1103, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1193, "end": 1195, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1775, "end": 1779, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1780, "end": 1784, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1789, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2014, "end": 2017, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2020, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2150, "end": 2154, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2155, "end": 2159, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2160, "end": 2164, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2165, "end": 2169, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2217, "end": 2221, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2226, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2227, "end": 2231, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2232, "end": 2236, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2237, "end": 2241, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2242, "end": 2246, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2247, "end": 2251, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2265, "end": 2267, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2268, "end": 2270, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2271, "end": 2274, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2275, "end": 2278, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2279, "end": 2281, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2302, "end": 2304, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2305, "end": 2307, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2308, "end": 2310, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2311, "end": 2314, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2319, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2320, "end": 2324, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2325, "end": 2329, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2330, "end": 2334, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2335, "end": 2339, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2529, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2530, "end": 2532, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2970, "end": 2972, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2973, "end": 2975, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3248, "end": 3250, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3251, "end": 3255, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3256, "end": 3260, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3261, "end": 3265, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3266, "end": 3270, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3271, "end": 3275, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Typically, pressure ulcer prevention (PUP) involves routine skin assessments, frequent off-loading of pressure points, and repositioning. Frequent off-loading and repositioning reduce pressures, frictional forces, and shear in soft tissues, however, these interventions can pose a challenge in patients who are critically ill or treated prone. 40 The anaesthesia delivered to surgical and to ventilated ICU patients neutralises their ability to move spontaneously or otherwise respond to or report the discomfort and pain that precede tissue damage in PU formation. From a PUP perspective, the option of repositioning prone patients is either non-existentthat is, during surgery -or very limited, for the ARDS COVID-19 patients who are mechanically ventilated and connected to a variety of monitors, probes, and tubing. Only small micro-shifts to offload pressure are recommended during the prone period due to the risk of dislodgement of tubes and devices and concerns over the loss of the physiological benefit of proning. 41, 42 In addition, moving ARDS COVID-19 patients into and out of the prone position is labour-intensive, and requires multiple highly trained nursing staff to coordinate the positioning safely. For patients in the prone position, alternative approaches to reducing facial tissue loads should, therefore, be considered. Prophylactic intervention alternatives for lowering the risk of facials PUs in such scenarios, therefore, reduce to conducting regular skin assessments, skin hygiene regimens, and redistributing the contact loads by means of head positioners and prophylactic dressings. 1, 7, 15, 17, 30, 31, 43, 44 With reference to the latter, perioperative nursing guidelines highlight the protective benefits in using dressings prophylactically to pad the eyes and facial tissues during prone surgeries, 43 similarly to the practice of protecting other at-risk areas using dressings in supine procedures (ie, the sacrum and heels). 4, 7, 15, 17, 43, 45, 46 Also relevant is the common nursing practice of protecting the bridge of the nose using dressings cut to shape, prior to continuous positive airway pressure treatments in order to cushion the mask-face interface. 47 Nevertheless, the biomechanical efficacy of prophylactic dressings in protecting facial weight-bearing sites during prone positioning has not been studied so far.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 344, "end": 346, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1025, "end": 1028, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1029, "end": 1031, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1617, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1620, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1624, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1628, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1632, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1636, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1640, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1643, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1836, "end": 1838, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1964, "end": 1966, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1967, "end": 1969, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1970, "end": 1973, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1977, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1981, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1982, "end": 1985, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1988, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2202, "end": 2204, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "\u2022 prone positions are used during surgery and ventilation of COVID-19 patients \u2022 these surgical and COVID-19 patients are at risk for facial pressure ulcers \u2022 a computer model of a prone head was used to determine facial tissues loads \u2022 the contribution of prophylactic dressings to load reduction was calculated \u2022 dressings applied to the forehead and chin effectively protect these regions", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Key Messages"}, {"text": "Here we addressed the above problem for the first time by investigating the biomechanical performances of the Mepilex Border Flex dressing design (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care, Gothenburg, Sweden) in protecting facial tissues while the head is prone.

The upper and lower plots per each VOI depict exposures to effective stresses and strain energy densities, respectively prophylactic dressings applied at the forehead and chin. For this purpose, we developed two configurations of a computational, 3D anatomically realistic validated adult head model, which is rested prone, with or without the protective dressings, and used the FE method to analyse the skin and subcutaneous fat tissue loading states in each such configuration. Consistent with our published work on the efficacy of soft silicone-foam multi-layered prophylactic dressings in alleviating skin and deeper tissue loads, 47, [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] 64, 65 we found that the presently studied dressings have a remarkable protective effect on facial tissues (Figures 2 and 3) . We attribute this protective efficacy to multiple factors that are all related to the engineering design of the specific dressings that were studied here. First, the dressings are soft and thick to the optimal extent that provides localised cushioning at the primary support contact areas of the prone head, that is, the forehead and chin. Second, the multi-layered alternating stiffness structure of these dressings is effective in absorbing shear loads within the dressing, as demonstrated in our published work with regard to other body parts, for example, the sacrum and heels. [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] 64, 65 Third, the considerable flexibility of the dressing structure (achieved through the repeated Y-shaped cut patterns embedded in its retention and spreading layers) appears to add to its capability of alleviating the bodyweight loads, as we have demonstrated before for sacral multilayered prophylactic dressings tested against simple and conventional dressing designs (Figures 2 and 3) . 54, 56, 58, 59 In clinical practice, multi-layered silicone-foam prophylactic dressings have become a widely accepted adjunct PUP method in patients considered to be at-risk. Clinical trials conducted with these dressings in patients in the supine position have demonstrated positive outcomes. 45, 46 While there are limited experimental studies in the form of clinical trials for the use of these dressings in patients in the prone position, the biomechanical evidence presented here supports the use of these dressings to reduce facial PUs during prone positioning. The possibility of integrating research into clinical care can take considerable time initially to obtain the necessary ethical approvals for the research, and later to fully train the study team before initiating the project. Public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, create an urgent need to prevent negative outcomes, including PUs, and therefore, to use materials that are currently available and techniques we already know. The use of soft silicone-foam multi-layered prophylactic dressing is a practical solution in clinical care, and the present computational modelling work strongly supports this approach.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1028, "end": 1031, "text": "47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1036, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1041, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1046, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1051, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1056, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1061, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1066, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1070, "text": "64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1073, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1780, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1781, "end": 1785, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1786, "end": 1790, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1795, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1800, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1801, "end": 1805, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1806, "end": 1810, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1814, "text": "64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1817, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2205, "end": 2208, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2209, "end": 2212, "text": "56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2216, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2217, "end": 2219, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2499, "end": 2502, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2503, "end": 2505, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1174, "end": 1191, "text": "(Figures 2 and 3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2202, "text": "(Figures 2 and 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The above dressings have been recommended for and applied to areas at-risk of PUs in COVID-19 prone patients. 15, 43 Recent publications concerning prone patients suggest that soft silicone-foam multi-layered prophylactic dressings are generally well-tolerated and demonstrate adjunct efficacy in PUP. 66, 67 These dressings minimise shearing of the skin when the patient is placed in the prone position and also wick away moisture and allow perspiration to evaporate and not remain on the skin, which further contributes to the reduction of the frictional forces acting on the skin. [68] [69] [70] [71] Considerations for use of prophylactic dressings on the facial area comprise the dressing sizes, the applied skin assessment protocol, and the frequency of dressing changes. The dressing sizes used for COVID-19 prone patients clearly depend on the head dimensions of the individual, but coauthor MBJ who treated a substantial number of COVID-19 patients noted that the dressing types studied here were suitably sized for protecting the face of COVID-19 patients at her medical facility. Pulling back the dressings and inspecting the skin beneath them on a daily basis is recommended. The recommended frequency of dressing changes is given in the manufacturer's instructions. Lastly, these dressings should be used in conjunction with other comprehensive PUP strategies, such as careful positioning and small micro-shifts to the head and chin every 2 hours to offload pressures. 15 The analysis of SED distributions in the skin and subcutaneous fat tissues revealed similar concentration patterns, but with more intensity and spread of the forehead SED concentrations in fat than in skin, suggesting greater risk for a forehead DTI than direct skin damage for prone positioning ( Figure 3) . Indeed, clinical reports describe forehead injuries associated with prone positioning as DTIs rather than as skin lesions. 7, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] The involvement of the DTI pathway calls for applying a more holistic approach in protecting tissues so that the prophylactic measures target both the superficial and deeper facial soft tissue structures. The latter, deep tissue protection can be achieved, for example, by using the fluidised positioner technology, which has been demonstrated to have high biomechanical efficacy in protecting scalp tissues, and is, therefore, likely to also be effective in facial protection against PUs. 44, 49 Limitations are inevitable in any modelling work and should be discussed here for completeness. An important assumption is that the anatomy and biomechanical properties of tissues considered in the modelling represent healthy conditions, and do not account for aged, diabetic, or abnormally fragile skin. While prophylactic dressings will not necessarily induce the same biomechanical conditions in tissues of different individuals, they are expected, based on the present work, to substantially lower the patient-specific tissue load levels with respect to a no-dressing-protection state. In other words, the application of dressings on the forehead and chin of prone patients will always provide facial tissue protection at the sites of application, but not the same level of protection for all patients. The individual level of protection would depend not only on the skin conditions but also on the subdermal tissue quality, the shapes of the skull surfaces and the weight of the head of the person, as well as on the functions of the body system that are relevant to PU aetiology, particularly the inflammatory and cardiovascular systems, as reviewed in the literature.
