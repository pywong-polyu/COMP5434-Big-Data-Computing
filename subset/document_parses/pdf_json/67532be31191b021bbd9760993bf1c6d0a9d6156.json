            "text": "As an important basis of navigation safety decisions, ship domains have always been a pilot concern. In the past, model parameters were usually obtained from statistics of massive historical cumulative data, but the results were mostly historical analysis and static data, which obviously could not meet the needs of pilots who wish to master the ship domain in real time. To obtain and update the ship domain parameter online in time and meet the real-time needs of maritime applications, this paper obtains CRI as the weight coefficient-based PSO-LSSVM method and proposes to use short-term AIS data accumulation through the riskweighted least squares method online rolling identification method, which can filter nonhazardous targets and improve the identification accuracy and real-time performance of nonlinear models in the ship domain. The experimental examples show that the method can generate the ship domain dynamically in real time. At the same time, the method can be used to study the dynamic evolution characteristics of the ship domain over the course of navigation, which provides a reference for navigation safety decisions and the analysis of ship navigation behavior.

            "text": "The ship domain is an important concept of water transportation, which was defined in 1975 by Goodwin [1] . To ensure their own safety, ships need to maintain a certain safe distance from surrounding ships during navigation, and the ship domain model is the way to describe this space scope [2] . Research on ship domain models has experienced decades of development. Building a practical ship domain model can better describe ship behavior. For example, Reference [3] proposes the novel concept of the probabilistic ship domain, which depicts the ship domain boundary as a vague value. An adaptive ship safety domain is proposed with spatial risk functions in Reference [4] . The reasonableness and superiority of establishing a ship domain model considering the factors affecting both one's own ship and other ships are analyzed in Reference [5] . Reference [6] presents a new ship domain model that is both realistic and practical, including various factors considered by seafarers based on the awareness values formed. In Reference [7] , a free-form ship domain was developed empirically for navigation in confined waters, and the size of the ship domains was assumed to be dynamically enlarged with increased ship speeds. Through the use of a machine learning algorithm, Reference [8] develops intelligent ship domain models, which better represent the usual navigation practice than traditional approaches. From the perspective of the development process of ship models, their research methods and shapes have gone through a process from experience, statistics, analytical expression, data mining and intelligent technology, from simple geometric shapes to complex shapes, and from static to dynamic shapes [9] . The utilization of AIS information has received increasing attention, and many scholars have begun to use massive AIS data to analyze and obtain ship domain models [10, 11] . Reference [12] observes ships sailing during a four-year period by AIS, estimates how closely ships pass each other and fixed objects, and then establishes an empirical minimum ship domain. Considering the navigation characteristics of ships with limited maneuvering capability and the influence of ships on the ship effect, an algorithm to determine the boundary of the ship domain model is proposed, and experiments are carried out using AIS trajectory data in Reference [13] . According to Reference [14] , the surrounding waters of the target ship are divided into grids, and then the grid densities of ships are calculated to determine the shape and size of the ship domain. By analyzing a large number of ship-encounter samples obtained from AIS data, the available maneuvering margin (AMM) can be used in Reference [15] to explain the first evasive maneuvere, and finally, the size of the ship domain can be empirically estimated. From Reference [16] , through AIS data, the relationship between ship-avoidance behavior and the nearest encounter point is analyzed; the ship-avoidance behavior is quantified, and then the ship domain boundary is obtained. In Reference [17] , the method was proposed by using a large volume of AIS data to obtain the ship domains in restricted waters.",

Different from traditional statistical methods, the method in this paper makes AIS data serve navigation safety better, enables ships to quickly perceive the dynamics of surrounding ships, identifies the actual parameters of the ship domain, and generates the boundary of the ship domain so that pilots can grasp the dynamics of their own ship domain in time and provide a basis for their navigation safety decisions more quickly.

This is significantly different from the results obtained from massive data mining. Therefore, it is necessary to solve the problem of reliability of the method and meet the requirement of the minimum dataset required for identification. Based on the above considerations, this paper proposes the following identification schematic. The core idea is to achieve the required dataset identification through short-term data accumulation. The dataset is updated by rolling to meet the requirement of real-time results. Differential data processing can be realized through collision risk to improve the identification progress. At the same time, the average collision risk and the number of identification data points were used as references for the reliability of the conclusions. Combined with the average collision risk and dynamic identification results, the pilot can better grasp the real-time dynamics of the ship domain. Compared with the traditional model, the pilot can also understand the safety margin of the compressible space in the ship domain. The results are a research method of the dynamic evolution of the ship domain and a reference for navigation safety decision-making. The schematic diagram includes single identification and dynamic rolling identification. ",

Through the test, it is found that selecting approximately 1 hour of data accumulation can meet the requirements of data volume and data distribution, and approximately 10 minutes of dynamic update can observe significant changes, which basically meets the requirements of dynamics. Two ordinary cargo ships of the same size are selected for the experiment. Periods close to the same day are selected to eliminate weather and other disturbances as much as possible and enhance comparability. For example, a general cargo ship (with a length of 190 m and a width of 32 m) exits the port through the South Channel of the Yangtze River Estuary and enters the port through the north deep-water channel. The AIS track is shown in Fig 6. The AIS data approximately 1 hour before the start of identification were used to train and test the PSO-LSSVM. After the training met the requirements, it was used to obtain the CRI of the target ship during the online identification. To compare the characteristics of the methods, the WLS method in this paper is used to identify the ship domain parameters online, and it is compared with the least square (LS) method. Sixty minutes of AIS data accumulation are adopted, updated, and iterated every ten minutes, rolling real-time online identification of the ship domain.",

From Fig 9, there is a significant difference between the results identified by the WLS and LS methods in this paper. The ship domain identified by WLS changed from nearly round to more elongated ellipses. The result of LS identification is a flatter ellipse. The WLS method is less affected by the low-risk target in the transverse position. In contrast, the LS method is obviously affected, and the domain shape is pulled flat, which is inconsistent with the general understanding that the longitudinal length of the ship domain is greater than or equal to the transverse length. In comparison, the WLS method is more suitable for online identification, with an obvious filtering effect of low-risk targets and more accurate identification results.",

The results were more reliable with a In open waters, the length of the domain is eight times that of the own ship, and the corresponding long axis of the domain is 0.41 nautical miles. All of these are obviously smaller than the results in this paper. The Fujii model can be considered as a ship domain with CRI of 1, and then the long-axis results of the two models will sometimes be relatively close. For example, in Fig 9(T1) , the long axis of the ship domain is approximately 1.5 nautical miles, and the corresponding \ufffd CRI is 0.28. When CRI is 1, the long axis of the domain is adjusted to 0.42 nautical miles after conversion, which is close to the Fujii model in open water. However, the ship domain model identified in this paper is still larger than the Fujii model, because the pilot will actually maintain a larger safety area when conditions permit, to ensure navigation safety. Fig 10, the ship's speed changes roughly in a pattern of deceleration first and then acceleration. Corresponding to Fig 11, the long axis of the ship domain identified by the WLS method also roughly shows a process of shortening first and then lengthening, while the short axis has no obvious change. This shows that the long axis of the ship domain will become longer with increasing ship speed and will become shorter with decreasing ship speed. The experiment shows that the driver hoped to maintain a larger safety distance with the longitudinal position when the ship speed increased, but the safety distance in the lateral position did not change significantly.",

By selecting representative waters, the characteristics of the ship domain in ship-routing waters and unimplemented ship-routing waters are analyzed experimentally. It is found that the ship domain changes dynamically in the sailing process, and to some extent with the waters environment and ship motion parameters, which can provide a reference for the study of similar waters.",

In this paper, dynamic, real-time and procedural research methods are proposed to lay a foundation for research on dynamic characteristics in the ship domain. In the future, it will be possible to study ship domains in complex scenes, such as analyzing the change characteristics of ship domains with ship navigation environments by considering weather conditions, visibility, wind direction, sea state, water depth, and tide, etc.",

In Fig 7, the fitness of PSO decreases gradually during the training process, indicating that the error converges and the training is effective. Fig 8 reflects the comparison between the CRI of output and the CRI of fuzzy calculation. The training results in Fig 8(A) are very close to the original data, and the testing results in Fig 8(B) are also close, so the CRI model established by PSO-LSSVM can be used for subsequent identification. Through the comparison between Fig 8(A) and 8(C), and between Fig 8(B) and 8(D), it can be seen that the PSO-LSSVM has better results than the LSSVM in training and testing.",

At present, there is more compression space in the ship domain. 4. Compared with the classic Fujii model, the ship domain presented in this paper is dynamic and correlated with CRI. According to the Fujii model, in narrow waterways, the length of the domain is six times that of the own ship, and the corresponding long axis of the domain is 0.31 nautical miles.",

Fig 13 shows that the identification results of WLS are closer than those of LS, and the domain boundary of WLS identification is smaller. For ships sailing in the North Channel, the inbound time interval is approximately 6 minutes, the speed range is 10-15 knots, and the corresponding inbound distance interval is 1-1.5 nautical miles. The WLS-identified long axis of the ship domain is approximately 1.2 nautical miles, which is roughly consistent with the law of vessel traffic flow. 3. Comparing Fig 13 with Fig 9, \ufffd CRI in the North Channel is larger than in the South Channel, indicating that ships in the North Channel are more closely spaced and that the corresponding identification ship domain is smaller. 4. Fig 14 shows that the ship's speed fluctuates. In Fig 15, the long axis of the ship domain identified by WLS fluctuates slightly, while the short axis is basically unchanged. The boundary change of the ship domain is not obvious, and it is more influenced by navigation regulations of ship routing.",
