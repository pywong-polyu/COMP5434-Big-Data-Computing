College students experienced a higher degree of food insecurity than the general population prior to the pandemic [10] . In addition to financial limitations, college students may be more susceptible to food insecurity due to housing uncertainty, higher perceived stress, and lower awareness and/or use of public benefits [10] . A 2019 national survey found that approximately 41% of students at 68 four-year institutions were food insecure [10] . Previous 2018 and 2019 Students aged 18-30 years enrolled at ISU as of March 2020 and that were physically present in the campus area prior to closure were eligible to complete an online survey on food security and changes in food practices that resulted from the pandemic. Due to COVID-19 precautions, students were asked not to return to campus after dismissal for spring break (16-20 March 2020) . Between 26 and 30 April 2020, one email invitation was sent to 29,810 students' university email addresses via Survey Monkey software (San Mateo, CA, USA). Professional students in the College of Veterinary Medicine were ineligible and not invited. Those studying abroad or those exclusively enrolled in online courses and otherwise off-site (prior to the virtual learning mandate) were ineligible. Of the invitees, 19 ,152 opened the email, 1907 started the survey, and 1434 had complete data for analysis (7.5% response rate). No reminder emails were sent due to the limited funding for incentives and the large pool of participants (n = 1434). Information on informed consent, including the possibility of deidentified data sharing, was on the first page of the survey. Completion of the survey was considered informed consent. The average time spent on the survey was 17 min. A $5 gift card to a major retailer was provided to respondents who answered at least 75% of the survey. The Iowa State University Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol (#16-289). Data from this study on pulse (dry beans, peas, lentils, and chickpeas) intakes and knowledge, and predictors of plant-based alternatives to meat consumption are reported elsewhere [18, 19] .",

A validated ten-item food frequency screener for fruits, vegetables, and fiber was used to provide estimates of dietary intake [24, 25] . Food security during the last 30 days was measured using the USDA ERS six-item Core Food Security Survey Module [26] . Seven cooking self-efficacy questions were asked to assess confidence in meal preparation skills (not at all, a little, somewhat, and very confident) [27] .

After examination for normality of the frequency distributions, some categories with less than 5% of responses were combined to form approximately equal tertiles or quartiles, e.g., self-reported health, alcohol consumption, hours worked, and housing locations. The food security total scores were categorized into high, low, and very low per instrument guidelines [26] . The cooking self-efficacy questions were totaled to create a score on a scale from 4 to 28. Comparisons by bivariate residence type (with parents/on own) and food security status (secure/insecure) were conducted using chi-square for independence and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Those factors that demonstrated statistically significant differences by food security status or that were theoretically important (e.g., gender) were entered into logistic regression analysis to predict food insecurity. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

There was a significant shift in living situations following campus closure and more than half (53%) of the students in this study lived at home after COVID-19 restrictions. According to the Pew Research Center, about 22% of US adults knew someone who had to change their residency or they themselves had to change their residency due to COVID-19 [33] . Moves often occurred due to college dormitory closure, perception of unsafe communities, or the inability to afford housing [34] . In a similar pandemic study of students in Texas, researchers found that those living with parents or other relatives had lower odds of being food insecure compared to those living independently [34] . Another study showed students who moved in with family or otherwise received familial financial support had higher odds of reporting an improvement in food security status [30] . Similarly, a pre-pandemic study found that students living at home had lower rates of food insecurity [35] .",

Nationally, 62% of families decreased take-out/fast-food/already prepared meals and 73% increased consumption of home-cooked meals during the pandemic [31] . This study is consistent with a university study in Alabama, which found students living off campus and categorized as \"very low food secure\" had lower cooking self-efficacy scores and prepared meals at home less often [38] . Students living on their own and/or those with food insecurity may have less time to commit to meal preparation due to employment or other obligations, resulting in an increased reliance on take-out or fast food. The need to work longer hours in addition to keeping up with regular coursework could supplant the intent or desire to prepare home-cooked meals. Though potentially counterintuitive from a financial perspective, the tendency of food-insecure individuals to seek take-out or fast food more often than their food-secure peers is likely multifactorial and deserves additional scrutiny. For instance, the behavior might serve as a coping mechanism for greater stress levels.",

Current living arrangement was the strongest predictor of food security status with students in this study. The greatest predictors of food insecurity among the students in Texas were current living arrangements and/or a loss or reduction in employment [34] . The ability, or need, to move home may have been influenced by work status with students in the current study. Students living at home were more likely either to have lost their job due to the pandemic shutdown or were not working for pay in the spring semester and students living on their own were more likely to be working over 11 h per week. Food-secure students may be more stable financially without the need to work for pay, while food-insecure students may work due to financial obligations. Significantly more food-insecure students also receive financial aid. The logistic regression model demonstrates good predictive validity (p < 0.001), indicating that the selected predictors collectively provide meaningful indicators of student food security or insecurity in the era of COVID-19. Furthermore, the model correctly classifies a large percentage (83.5%) of observations. Given the relatively rare condition of food insecurity, the model correctly classifies 10.1% of such cases compared to 99.1% of cases of food security. Future models could use different combinations of variables with different degrees of predictive validity and subsequent analyses could use alternative cut-points other than the 0.5 value used in this analysis that would result in a greater ability to predict the rarer outcome of food insecurity.",

            "text": "These data support further research to assess effective programs that aim to reduce food insecurity on college campuses and its negative impact on students. For example, given that students experiencing food insecurity were more likely to have lower cooking self-efficacy scores, possibly due to arbitrary and subjective beliefs about the time and skill level required to prepare satisfying meals, interventions targeted at improving confidence could help to alleviate some of the distress related to food insecurity. This research highlights the characteristics of students who may be at higher risk and, as such, could receive proactive outreach. Additionally, since this study elucidates a specific time during the pandemic, continued assessment of college student behaviors and livelihoods as affected by the pandemic is warranted.",
