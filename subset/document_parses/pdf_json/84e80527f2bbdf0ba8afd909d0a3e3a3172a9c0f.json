The SARS-CoV-2 variant virus that has emerged in the UK in December 2020, the so-called \"English variant\" (VOC 202012/01), attracts particular attention due to its high contagiousness [1] . This variant presents multiple spike protein mutations (deletion 69-70, deletion 144, substitutions N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, and D1118H) as well as mutations in other genomic regions [2] . Among them, N501Y is of major concern because it involves one of the six key amino acid residues determining a tight interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) with its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [3, 4] . This mutation has also appeared, independently, in a rapidly spreading variant in South Africa [5] .",

In fact, this variant harbors multiple mutations in the spike protein, improving the ability of the virus to bind and penetrate cells. One major concern is the possibility that a profoundly mutated spike protein may alter the recognition by neutralizing antibodies, raising concerns about the protective ability of the recently issued vaccines that are based on original spike protein sequences. The evidence provided in the present study, according to a recent report [13] , indicates that the VOC202012/01 variant is sensitive to the neutralizing activity of antibodies produced by patients in response to previously circulating viral strains, and the neutralizing titers are identical to those established by using as virus challenge a different strain that was isolated several months ago and is used nationwide to establish the neutralization titer of hyperimmune convalescent plasma preparations in Italy. These data are reassuring, in that all those who have overcome the disease and have produced good levels of protective antibodies may be protected against a possible reinfection sustained by an even distant SARS-CoV-2 strain. Furthermore, the administration of hyperimmune plasma may be considered a good protective opportunity against distant strains of SARS-CoV-2, irrespectively of the characteristics of the strains that had induced the antibody response. In line with these considerations, Xuping Xie et al. [14] have recently shown that antibodies produced by the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 are effective against the isogenic Y501 SARS-CoV-2 developed on the genetic background of the N501 clinical strain USA-WA1/2020, which also provided the genetic background of the BNT162b2-encoded spike antigen. With respect to this study, our evidence adds important information, as the viruses used in the present study are authentic circulating strains that are both sensitive to the same extent to antibodies elicited by different viral strains.",
