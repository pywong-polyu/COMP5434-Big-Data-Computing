Two of the three peaks of infection correlated with the germicidal solar flux received in Argentina, suggesting a seasonal component and a role for the virus persisting in the environment. A massive public gathering crowding the presidential square in Buenos Aires, during which nearly half of those present were without face masks, did not alter the infection curve in that city. Comparative epidemiological data (standardized per million inhabitants) shows that COVID-19 in Uruguay, a neighboring country whose capital is at a similar latitude than Buenos Aires and who did not mandate lock-downs or curfews, progressed much slower (until vaccination started) than in Argentina. The number of yearly deaths caused by respiratory diseases and influenza in Argentina before the pandemic was similar to the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 cumulated on April 25, 2021, more than a year after the pandemic started. The failure to detect any benefit on ameliorating COVID-19 by the long and strict nation-wide lock-downs in Argentina should raise world-wide concerns about mandating costly and ineffective restrictive measures during ongoing or future pandemics.",

The starting assumption of the present study was that any beneficial effect of lockdowns, quarantines and curfews should be amply evident in Argentina, if such effect exists.",

On these photographs we could score accurately 329 persons as either wearing face mask or not. Epidemiological data for Uruguay was obtained from the country's government daily updates. 12 The epidemiological data corresponding to COVID-19 for Argentina and Uruguay were confirmed by the compilation made by the John's Hopkins' Center for System Sciences and Engineering. 13 The germicidal solar flux received in Argentina (Buenos Aires) through the year and its virucidal effect on SARS-Co V-2 has been previously published elsewhere. 14 Causes of death pre-pandemic were obtained from statistics released in 2018 by the government of Argentina. 11",

Exceptions to this policy included public and private clinics and hospitals, veterinary clinics, supermarkets and hardware stores serving to persons with documented addresses nearby (it is mandatory to carry identification documents at all times in Argentina). Persons considered at risk, including obese persons (with Grade II, body mass index 35-39.9 kg/m 2 ), were not allowed to return to work even to perform in the exempted occupations listed above (Resolution of Ministry of Labor # 207/2020). Essential workers must carry a written or digital permit while nonessential individuals may request a temporary circulation permit for going to the doctor, hospital or caring for a sick relative. This circulation permit (called CUIDAR) holds personal data and a QR code to control legitimacy. Persons detained without proper identification or circulation permit were fined or jailed (varying with the province or circumstances) and their vehicles impounded. In addition, face masks, hand washing and social distancing of 1.5-2 meters (5-7 feet) were also required. The Argentinean Minister of Health declared on July 8, 2020 that \"all bad colds are coronavirus until proven the contrary\", 15 and recommended not to laugh, sing or speak loudly to reduce contagion. 16 In addition, The Ministry of Health of Argentina released on April 2020, \"Recomendaciones para sexo seguro\" (Recommendations for safe sex) stating that to prevent COVID-19 close contacts, including sex should be avoided. 17 The measures mandated in the 1 st DNU (#297/2020) were prorogated every 15 days, remaining in force until July 18, 2020 when a new decree (DNU #605/2020) partially relaxed restrictions. 18 Under the measures mandated by DNU # 605/2020 (called by the government Distanciamiento Social Preventivo Obligatorio, DISPO or generally known as Phase II, depicted as Region C in Figure 1 ) industrial, commercial, or services activities were allowed as long as they had an operational permit approved by the provincial sanitary authority within the guidelines mandated by the national sanitary authority. Among other restrictions, the national sanitary authority limited operation of working activities to no more than 50% of the covered area of the installation. It was left to provincial sanitary authorities to rule particular days and hours for the performing of sporting, artistic or social activities as long as (by national guidelines) the number of participants remained below 10 individuals. In addition, the occupational density in close quarters (offices, restaurants, changing rooms, etc.) was limited to one worker per 2.25 square meters. These measures excluded personnel at risk, including obese individuals, from returning to work as decreed on March 19, 2020 (see above). Cinemas, theaters, cultural gatherings, and sports involving more than 10 persons or that could not preclude more than 2 meters separation between players remained prohibited. Tourism and the use of local and long-distance buses, except for personnel with proper authorization were impermissible. Social gatherings and family reunions remained prohibited regardless of numbers, except by people living in the same home.",

The strictest confinement measures in force during this period (known in Argentina as Phase 1) did not prevent the increase in infections that started during mid May, 2020 and continued until the end of October 2020 (Phase II, zone C in Figure 1 inactivate 90% of SARS-CoV-2 in Buenos Aires after 19 or 29 minutes of exposure, respectively. 14 The increase of infections in July-October 2020, as well as the peak beginning at the end of March 2021 correlate with minimal or decreasing germicidal solar radiation received in Argentina (0.04 Jm -2 min -1 during solar noon) when 90% of SARS-CoV-2 should persist infectious during relatively long time (several hours or days) in Buenos Aires. 14 After peaking in October 22, 2020, the sharp decrease in daily infections during November, 2020 correlates with the solar transit to the Tropic of Capricorn with increasing solar flux in Argentina and relatively rapid inactivation of SARS-Co V-2 (90% in 19 min of noon sunlight in Buenos Aires) reaching a minimum of infections through the summer (December 2020 in Figure 1 ). The positive correlation between daily infections and germicidal solar flux in at last two of the infection peaks in Argentina indicates that inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in the evolution of the pandemic. The present finding of seasonality of COVID-19 in Argentina agrees with previous studies suggesting a role of virus persisting in the environment during COVID-19 since direct person-to-person transmission does not afford enough time for viral inactivation by solar radiation (requiring several minutes exposure). 28 However, one of the three peaks in infections initiated in summer 2021 when solar radiation was abundant ( Figure 1 ). This particular unseasonable raise in infections not correlated with solar flux begun increasing at the end of December 2020 and peaked approximately on January 11, 2021. This summer peak could be explained by infections at family gatherings during the Holydays (Christmas and New Year). However, two large national gatherings in Argentina did not affect the infection curve. Infections remained low after more than 200,000 people gathered at the funeral of Maradona and traveling of over 2 million during Easter did not alter the increasing slope of the third peak presented in Figure 1 . Thus, gathering of people during a previous large event and a later Holiday do not support increased infections during celebration of Christmas and New Year in Argentina.",

Therefore, deaths attributed to COVID-19 in Argentina could be over-reported. Regardless of the extent of over-reporting, deaths attributed to COVID-19 equaled pre-pandemic deaths by respiratory disease (including influenza) only after more than one year of pandemic. In spite of a mortality attributed to COVID-19, similar to yearly deaths by respiratory causes pre-pandemics, Argentinean society had to endure during the crisis 119 days of strict lock-down (Phase I), 304 days of less restrictive lock-downs (Phase II), and 35 days of curfews (see the Policies section above).",

The findings reported here, in agreement with those noted above, 3, 14, 28, [30] [31] [32] [33] demonstrate that virtual computer simulation could complement but never replace real epidemiological data in policy making. These findings suggest that governments should refrain from reacting to unproven and apocalyptic predictions. Instead, carefully selecting to manage the pandemic of scientific leaders with specific and documented experience (by peerreviewed publications in pertinent disciplines like field epidemiology, virology of rapid and lethal viruses, infection control, and/or immunology) seems as the best (and perhaps only) defense for avoiding the unproved measures that resulted so costly to the society and economy of Argentina as well as to those other countries adopting similar policies.",
