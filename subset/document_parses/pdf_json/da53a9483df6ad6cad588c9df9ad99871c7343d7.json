She sought the emergency department for a one month complaint of melena with chronic liquid diarrhea at a rate of three stools a day, accompanied by fever and weight loss, but without rectal syndrome. On admission, the patient was conscious, presented with a Glasgow coma score of 15/15, was hemodynamically and respiratory stable, febrile with a body temperature of 38 \u00b0C, heart rate of 100 per min, respiratory rate of 20 cycles per min, blood pressure of 110/40 mmHg, weighting 46 kg, in addition to an oral candidiasis with possible esophageal involvement. On the abdominal examination, the patient had pain on the right upper quadrant, epigastric tenderness associated with a homogeneous hepatomegaly (21 cm) and splenomegaly (14 cm) and the hernia orifices were free. The abdominal ultrasound showed multiple collections at the level of the segments I, IV, and V related to liver abscesses of which the largest lesion measured 5.8 by 4.2 cm with hepatomegaly associated with an anechoic peritoneal effusion of moderate abundance ( Figure 1 ). The patient was treated empirically with ceftriaxone, metronidazole and gentamicin for the liver abscesses, fluconazole for oral and esophageal candidiasis, and a medication to slow down the intestinal transit.",

The percutaneous drainage is indicated for patients who continue to be febrile even after 72 h of adequate medical treatment and aspiration; liver abscesses > 6 cm; and clinical or ultrasound features suggesting impending perforation, but drainage should always be undertaken before surgery to promote the comfort of the patient and reduce costs.
