In the second experiment, individually-grown saplings were treated with EDU (0, 200 and 400 mg L \u22121 ) and exposed to ambient O 3 in two growing seasons and to elevated O 3 in the succeeding two growing seasons. The two experiments revealed that EDU concentrations of 200-400 mg L \u22121 could protect Japanese larch seedling communities and individual saplings against O 3 -induced inhibition of growth and productivity. However, EDU concentrations \u2264 200 mg L \u22121 did offer only partial protection when seedling communities were coping with higher level of O 3 -induced stress, and only 400 mg EDU L \u22121 fully protected communities under higher stress. Therefore, we conclude that among the concentrations tested the concentration offering maximum protection to Japanese larch plants under high competition and O 3 -induced stress is that of 400 mg EDU L \u22121 . The results of this study can provide a valuable resource of information for applied forestry in an O 3 -polluted world.",

Ground-level ozone (O 3 ) concentrations have increased since the preindustrial era, and research projects showed that Japanese larch is susceptible to elevated O 3 exposures. Therefore, methodologies are needed to (1) protect Japanese larch against O 3 damage and (2) conduct biomonitoring of O 3 in Japanese larch forests and, thus, monitor O 3 risks to Japanese larch. For the first time, this study evaluates whether the synthetic chemical ethylenediurea (EDU) can protect Japanese larch against O 3 damage, in two independent experiments.

Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi (Lamb.) Carr.) is an important timber species for wood production in Asia as well as in Europe, where its wood has been used for multiple purposes such as railway sleepers, construction, pit props and pulp industry (Ryu et al. 2009; Kurinobu 2015; Da Ronch et al. 2016) . For instance, Japanese larch is a major plantation species in Japan, and has a breeding history of about 70 years (Kurinobu 2015) . However, its breeding has focused on the improvement of wood quality and resistance to pests and diseases (e.g. needle cast disease) so far (Ryu et al. 2009; Kurinobu 2015) , and Japanese larch and its hybrids have been found susceptible to ground-level ozone (O 3 ), with often suppressed plant size and reduced biomass at elevated concentrations (Koike et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2015; Agathokleous et al. 2017; Sugai et al. 2018) .",

Average daytime O 3 levels, when plants are fully functioning physiologically and 'breathe' most O 3 , have increased since the industrial revolution, and remain elevated in rural and urban areas throughout the Northern Hemisphere nowadays Schultz et al. 2017; Mills et al. 2018) . In general, based on vegetation exposure indices, the highest O 3 concentrations occur in mid-latitudes including north, north-west and east China, the Republic of Korea, and Japan (Mills et al. 2018) . These regions happen to be major habitats of the Japanese larch too, suggesting a potential risk for O 3 -induced damage (Hoshika et al. 2020 ). The complex chemistry of O 3 and its trans-boundary transport make difficult its control (Ganev et al. 2008; Kleanthous et al. 2014; Gao et al. 2020) , and predictions for 2100 indicate that O 3 may remain at potentially phytotoxic levels even with the most optimistic 2100 climate scenario (Sicard et al. 2017) . The difficulty in decreasing O 3 levels is further documented by a recent study showing that, while many other air pollutants decreased, O 3 levels have considerably increased in cities due to the COVID-19 lockdown imposed in 2020 (Sicard et al. 2020) . For these reasons, research is needed to invent methodologies to protect Japanese larch and other tree species against O 3 damage.",

            "text": "Several research projects have been directed to protect plants against O 3 damage, by using various methods or approaches: (1) introducing symbiotic microbes into the plant system to mediate plant response ), (2) modifying the irrigation management practices to reduce O 3 uptake from stomata (Harmens et al. 2019) , (3) applying substances on leaf surface to create a protective \"membrane\" and prevent O 3 from entering the leaf tissue (Agathokleous et al. 2016b) , and (4) treating plants with chemicals that systemically protect plants against O 3 damage (Tiwari 2017) . However, only approach (4) has been widely researched and shown to produce sufficient protection. In spite of the many chemical compounds tested in the framework of approach 4, the largest research effort has been placed on ethylenediurea (EDU) (Tiwari 2017) . EDU sufficiently protected a wide array of plant species and numerous cultivars and genotypes against O 3 damage (Feng et al. 2010; Manning et al. 2011; Oksanen et al. 2013; Singh et al. 2015; Agathokleous 2017; Chaudhary and Rathore 2020) . The vast majority of these studies concerns cultivated crop plants, while relatively few studies concern broadleaved tree species. A literature survey suggests that whether EDU can protect coniferous trees against O 3 damage has not been tested to date. The EDU mode of action in protecting plants against O 3 damage remains unclear (Singh et al. 2015; Agathokleous 2017; Tiwari 2017; Gupta et al. 2020) . However, it appears that EDU protects plants within a hormetic framework, by acting as a xenobiotic to activate defense mechanisms at low doses, in contrast to adverse effects at high doses (Wang et al. 2007; Agathokleous 2017; Salvatori et al. 2017; Tiwari 2017; Gupta et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2019) ; however, reactions on the leaf surface also occur and partly reduce some O 3 effect (Ashrafuzzaman et al. 2018) .",

            "text": "For the first time, this study aims at assessing whether EDU can protect Japanese larch against O 3 damage, in two independent experiments. In the first experiment, a dose-response evaluation was conducted to study EDU effects (4 concentrations) on Japanese larch communities of generating seedlings under ambient or elevated O 3 , with the aim to identify the EDU concentration offering the highest protection against O 3 damage. A unique feature of this experiment is that it simulates regenerating highly dense communities of Japanese larch, as previous experiments studying EDU effects on tree species included individual trees with no intraspecific competition (Paoletti et al. 2009; Agathokleous 2017; Xu et al. 2019) . The only EDU experiment with mesocosms was with manna ash (Fraxinus ornus L.); however, saplings were planted with a low density and subjected to only ambient O 3 , and the experiment was directed to assess the temporal variation in physiology but not effects on growth and productivity (Salvatori et al. 2017) . Therefore, this is the first study testing whether growth and productivity of communities of a tree species can be benefited from EDU in an O 3 -polluted atmosphere. In the second experiment, the research question was whether EDU can offer long-term protection of Japanese larch plants against O 3 damage. To this end, individually-grown saplings were exposed to ambient O 3 for 2 years and to elevated O 3 for 2 more years (4 years in total), while treated with EDU (3 concentrations). Nearly all the published studies of EDU effects on plants lasted for only one growing season, while only one experiment with a fast-growing O 3 -susceptible hybrid poplar lasted for several years (Hoshika et al. 2013; Katani\u0107 et al. 2014; Carriero et al. 2015; Giovannelli et al. 2019) . Therefore, this experiment with Japanese larch is of high value for potential forestry applications in the future.",

Two-year old saplings of Japanese larch, which were kept in low temperature under dark, were offered from the nursery of Forestry Research Institute of Hokkaido Research Organization at Bibai city near Sapporo (saplings were obtained from trees growing under full sunlight). Saplings were moved to Hokkaido University, Sapporo campus, on May 15, 2014, and stored in an incubator at 3 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C) under light. On 5 June, each of 23 uniform saplings was planted into a 15-L plastic pot filled with a mixture of two types of commercial soil (without organic matter and poor in nutrients) prepared at the rate of 1:1. The soils were well-weathered volcanic ash Akadama and well-weathered pumice Kanuma. The pH of the mixture was 5.92 \u00b1 0.02; the reader may refer to Agathokleous et al. (2016a) for more details about the soils. One-third of the pots of each EDU treatment were placed on a fully randomized design (pot-to-pot distance = 30 cm) in each of three ambient plots at the experimental nursery of Field Science Center of Hokkaido University. The plotto-plot distance was > 30-100 m (the plots were different in each growing season). Throughout the growing seasons, the pots position was re-adjusted randomly biweekly to avoid edge effects. Likewise, the pots of each plot were subjected to rotation across plots on a monthly basis. Initial measurements of the saplings were taken as described for experiment I (\"Experiment I\" section). The average values of shoot height, crown span, stem diameter, and number of branches per sapling were 15.7 \u00b1 0.11 cm, 6.8 \u00b1 0.05 cm, 2.7 \u00b1 0.02 mm, and 8.0 \u00b1 0.13, respectively.",

The finding of successful protection of this coniferous tree over multiple growing seasons is in agreement with the only long-term experiment studying EDU effects on plants (Hoshika et al. 2013; Katani\u0107 et al. 2014; Carriero et al. 2015; Giovannelli et al. 2019) . In that experiment, weekly applications of 450 mg EDU L \u22121 protected the growth and productivity of a broadleaved hybrid poplar over multiple years, improved its seasonal sap flow by increasing leaf area for sapwood unit, and positively affected the community of mycorrhizal fungi (Katani\u0107 et al. 2014; Carriero et al. 2015; Giovannelli et al. 2019 ). Conversely to experiment I, where EDU200 did not provide as sufficient protection as EDU400, EDU200 offered a similarly sufficient protection with EDU400 in experiment II. This may be attributed to the fact that saplings were individually grown in experiment II, in the absence of competition for resources, and, thus, under lower level of stress than seedlings in experiment I.

Data were tested with repeated measures general linear model (GLM) at \u03b1 = 0.05 Preliminary evidence from broadleaved plant species suggests that the maximum amount of EDU needed is \u2248 10-30 mg m \u22122 leaf area per treatment (Agathokleous 2017) . Leaf area was not measured in this coniferous species. Based on the foliage biomass measured at the end of the experiment in the control EDU0 treatments (to represent the maximum amount of EDU needed), the amount of EDU in each EDU200 treatment was 54.7 mg g \u22121 foliage (109.4 mg for EDU400) in experiment I and 39.6 mg g \u22121 foliage (79.3 mg for EDU400) in experiment II. Therefore, a maximum amount of 109.4 mg EDU g \u22121 foliage was sufficient to protect the seedling communities throughout the growing season in experiment I, whereas a maximum amount of 39.6 mg EDU g \u22121 foliage was sufficient to protect the individual saplings throughout the growing seasons in experiment II. Measuring the foliage biomass (as an alternative of area) in conifers over time is practically difficult because destructive sampling would require a considerably higher number of plants, but further evaluations of the amount of EDU per foliage biomass at different time points would be needed. Nevertheless, the present estimates can be helpful to calculate the required amount of EDU in Japanese larch plants with greater foliage.",

However, the protection of concentrations \u2264 200 mg EDU L \u22121 was only partial when seedlings were coping with high competition and a considerably high level of O 3 stress, thus, 400 mg EDU L \u22121 would be needed for plants under Fig. 5 Biomass of Japanese larch saplings treated with 0 (EDU0), 200 (EDU200) or 400 (EDU400) mg L \u22121 ethylenediurea (EDU) and exposed to O 3 for 4 growing season (experiment II). Wood dry mass is the sum of branches and stem. Different letters above the se bars indicate significant differences among different groups. Data are mean values \u00b1 se (n = 7-8). Data were tested with two contrasts at \u03b1 = 0.05 high competition and stress. This study also provides evidence that EDU can be also used for active or passive O 3 biomonitoring of generating communities in Japanese larch forests, where O 3 is not measured by technological instruments. Hence, the results of this study are important for both protecting Japanese larch against O 3 damage and monitoring O 3 for potential risks to Japanese larch plantations.",

The results of the present study, via two independent experiments and multiple EDU concentrations, illustrate that EDU does not affect plant growth and biomass linearly at concentrations smaller than the typical toxicological threshold. Such nonlinear effects of EDU might be related to the mechanism of EDU protection against O 3 -induced damage, encouraging further studies where the effect of multiple EDU concentrations on growth and biomass would be linked to underpinning molecular mechanisms.",
