SCSIO-45730 was an excellent source of polysaccharides and \u03b2-glucans. However, the polysaccharides from the red unicellular alga Rhodosorus sp. SCSIO-45730 have barely been studied. In this work, hot water extraction of Rhodosorus sp. SCSIO-45730 polysaccharides (RSP) was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken design (BBD). The maximum RSP yield (9.29%) was achieved under the optimum extraction conditions: liquid-solid ratio of 50.00 mL g \u22121 ; extraction temperature of 84 \u00b0C; extraction time of 2 h; and extraction times of 5 times. The results of physicochemical characterization showed that RSP had high sulfate and uronic acid with content of 19.58% and 11.57%, respectively, rough layered structure, and mainly contained glucose, galactose, xylose, and galacturonic acid with mass percentages of 34.08%, 28.70%, 12.46%, and 12.10%. Furthermore, four kinds of antioxidant assays were carried out, and the results indicated that RSP had strong scavenging activities on ABTS and hydroxyl radical and moderate scavenging activities on DPPH and ferrous chelating ability. These results indicated that RSP showed potential as a promising source of antioxidants applied in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industry.",

Marine microalgae can produce easily modified, biocompatible, stable biodegradable, non-toxic, and highly safe biological-active compounds, such as polysaccharides, carotenoids, proteins, peptides, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and mineral oxides; hence, it has been identified as an expected supplement in the fields of biochemistry, biomass energy resources, and pharmacology (Raposo et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2019) . In particular, some unique polysaccharides exclusively present in rhodophytes and numerous bioactive properties such as anti-tumor, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiviral, anticoagulant, and immunomodulatory effects of polysaccharides have been reported (Raposo et al. 2014; Fleita et al. 2015) . Rhodosorus belongs to the division Rhodophyta or red algae and studies have mainly focused on the extraction and purification of phycoerythrin from the algal cells. The existing research shows that Rhodosorus sp. SCSIO-45730 is rich in polysaccharides and its content was maximized up to 242.6 mg L \u22121 day \u22121 (Dai et al. 2020) , which is much higher than the polysaccharide productivity of Porphyridium cruentum (Sun et al. 2008 ). In addition, Rhodosorus sp. SCSIO-45730 with high biomass was considered as an optimal feedstock for the production of bioethanol and \u03b2-glucans (Dai et al. 2020 ).",

There are various methods available for the extraction of polysaccharides, including hot water, dilute acid, dilute alkali, microwave, ultrasonic, and enzyme extractions (Ardiles et al. 2020) . Generally, hot water extraction is the most common method for extracting polysaccharides with the advantages of low cost, simple operation, no special equipment required, excellent quality of final product, and most suitable for preparation of neutral and acidic polysaccharides (Dong et al. 2016) . In addition, hot water extraction is an important technology from an industrial point of view. The yield of this method largely depends on a liquid-to-solid ratio, extraction time, extraction temperature, and extraction times (Li et al. 2019b ). Yu used response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the extraction process of Angelica sinensis polysaccharides (ASP), and the water-solid ratio and the extraction time were found to be the most important factors (Yu et al. 2013 ). The optimal procedure is shown as follows: water-solid ratio was 5 mL g \u22121 , extraction time was 130 min, and extraction number was 5. According to Ai et al. (2013) , the extraction process of ASP was optimized by an orthogonal experimental design, and the extraction yield of ASP was 5.6% under the optical extraction condition (water-solid ratio 6 mL g \u22121 , extraction time 180 min, extraction temperature 100 \u00b0C, and extraction times 4). Therefore, it is very important to optimize the extraction conditions of RSP for its future research, development and industrial application. RSM is a set of statistical and computational techniques that are composed of experiment designing, model building, evaluation of factors, and search for optimal conditional factors (Golbargi et al. 2021) . RSM is often used to determine the influence of each factor and its interaction on the extraction rate and identify the optimal conditions statistically. Furthermore, this modelbased approach not only reduces the number of experiments but also greatly reduces development time and overall cost.",

It has been proved that sulfated polysaccharides have shown promising inhibitory effects on preventing recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Hans et al. 2020; Pereira and Critchley 2020) . In addition, the antioxidant activity is one of the most studied aspects of polysaccharides. Natural polysaccharides isolated from Porphyra/Pyropia, Eucheuma, Kappaphycus, and Gracilaria have strong free radical scavenging activities and unique properties to prevent oxidative damage in living organisms (Aziz et al. 2020) . Based on the literature reports, biological activities of polysaccharides vary with their physical-chemical structural features such as physical appearance, the ratio of constituent monosaccharides, and degree of sulfation (Venkatesan et al. 2019) . For example, Chlorella pyrenoidosa polysaccharides (CPP) using 60%, 70%, and 85% final ethanol concentrations for precipitation were called CPP60, CPP70, and CPP85, respectively. All of them possessed antioxidant activity in vitro, but CPP70 exhibited stronger scavenging activity against superoxide, DPPH, and hydroxyl radicals compared with CPP60 and CPP85, which resulted from the differences of structural features and molecular size of polysaccharides . Similarly, Laminaria polysaccharide with higher uronic acid and sulfate content displayed stronger antioxidant activity (Bhadja et al. 2016) . Yuan and Macquarrie (2015) also reported that the scavenging capacity to DPPH radical of polysaccharides extracted from Ascophyllum nodosum is proportional to their -SO 3 H content, i.e., the component with 28.60% -SO 3 H content has the highest scavenging capacity of about 15%, whereas the component with 7.82% -SO 3 H content only has a scavenging capacity of about 2%.",

The whole design contains 27 experimental runs, which were represented by the coded and non-coded values of the experimental variables as shown in Table 1 . The experiment was carried out in random order. The mutual interaction among the variables and their corresponding optimum levels were expressed by a secondorder polynomial equation (Awatief et al. 2016) . Furthermore, three additional confirmation extraction experiments under the optimal conditions were carried out to verify the accuracy of the statistical experimental strategies (Shang et al. 2021 ).",

When extraction time and extraction times were fixed at the zero levels, the polysaccharide yield increased at the beginning but then decreased with increasing liquid-solid ratio and extraction temperature. The liquid-solid ratio and extraction temperature belonged to insignificant interactions (Figs. 1a and 2a). Figures 1b and 2b described the extraction yield was not changed significantly by increasing the extraction time, but it increased as the ratio of water-to-raw-material increased under the zero level of extraction temperature and extraction times.

In Fig. 1d and 2d , the results suggested that extraction temperature and extraction time exerted a notable impact on polysaccharide yield. On the contrary, Figs. 1e and 2e indicated that the influence of extraction temperature and extraction times was not significant when liquid-solid ratio and extraction time was fixed at zero levels. Similarly, the mutual interaction between extraction time and extraction times was not significant on polysaccharide yield when liquid-solid ratio and the extraction temperature was fixed to be level 0 ( Figs. 1f and 2f ).",

As shown in Figs. 3a and 3b, RSP is a relatively uniform sheet structure with a rough appearance. The 3D topography, surface roughness, and height of RSP were expounded by AFM (Fig. 3 c, d, and e) . Somewhat elongated particles with irregular shape and size pointing towards random coil conformation of RSP were displayed, wherein the vertical distance was 5.86 nm, the horizontal distance was 249 nm, and the variations in height yielded an average of 1.95 nm, with the shortest being 0.04 nm and the tallest 6.46 nm. Figure 4a shows the FTIR spectrum of RSP between 4000 and 500 cm \u22121 . Both the peaks at 3448 cm \u22121 and 2926 cm \u22121 were attributed to the stretching vibration of O-H and C-H, respectively, indicating the typical absorption peaks of polysaccharides. Both the signals at 1618 cm \u22121 and 1412 cm \u22121 were associated with the presence of carbonyl groups, indicating that GPOP-1 contained uronic acid (Cui et al. 2019) . The band at 1218 cm \u22121 was due to the stretching vibration of O = S = O, indicating the presence of sulfate in the sample (Sun et al. 2014 ). The strong absorption at 1010 cm \u22121 was dominated by the stretching vibration of the pyranose ring, confirming that the extracted RSP contained pyranose sugar ). Moreover, a medium peak at 930 cm \u22121 and a weak peak at 866 cm \u22121 belonged to the beta and alpha configuration. Hence, \u03b2-glycosidic bonds were the main type followed by few \u03b1-glycosidic bonds in RSP. Figure 4b shows that the XRD pattern revealed a strong diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 20.88, manifesting that RSP were semi-crystalline polymers. Consequently, it confirmed that RSP had both crystalline and amorphous portions in their structure. ",

            "text": "Based on the significance, reliability, and adequacy of the model, we concluded that the model can fully reflect the relationship between the efficiency of hot water extraction of RSP and the four factors including liquid-to solid ratio, extraction temperature, extraction time, and extraction times. With the increase of the liquid-to-solid ratio, extraction temperature, extraction time, and extraction times, the yield of RSP all showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. The higher liquid-solid ratio, extraction temperature, extraction time, and extraction times may cause softening of the algal tissue, increasing the solubility of the polysaccharides, which improves the rate of diffusion, thus giving a higher rate of extraction . In addition, the density and viscosity of the extract decreased with increasing extraction temperature, time, and times, which was beneficial to extracting buffer into the algal matrix. Nevertheless, the polysaccharide started to decompose when the extraction temperature, time, and times were too high. With the increase of liquid-solid ratio, the increased viscosity of the solvent caused an extension of diffusion distance for the microalgal cells leading to the slow increase of extraction of polysaccharides. Besides, excessive water would weaken the cavitation effect from the extraction process, thus reducing 12.10 \u00b1 0.45 Glucuronic acid 0.84 \u00b1 0.14 Mannuronic acid 0.14 \u00b1 0.02 Glucuronic acid ND the extraction of polysaccharides. Cho et al. (2019) reported that the polysaccharides yield from Giant African snail using pressurized hot water extraction increased with an increase in the temperature from 100 to 150 \u00b0C, while the yield dropped dramatically to 2.53% at 250 \u00b0C. The polysaccharides yield from Giant African snail also increased first and then decreased with the increase of solid-liquid ratio (Cho et al. 2019) . At present, there is no multi-factor optimization test for hot water extraction of RSP, and the response surface optimization method is used to achieve an extraction rate of 9.29%. It is worth mentioning here that the RSP yield in this study using the optimum extraction was markedly higher than that previously common hot water extraction with an extraction yield of 3.13% (Fig. S1 ). This result demonstrates the value of response surface optimization for the further development and improvement of RSP extraction technology. However, hot water extraction method is conventionally used, and it is not compared with any other methodology using modern extraction technology in this study. In the future, we plan to explore various advanced polysaccharide extraction techniques, such as microwave-assisted, ultrasonic-assisted, and enzyme-assisted extraction, promoting the large industrial preparation of RSP (Yuan et al. 2020a ).",

            "text": "In general, the chemical structure of polysaccharides determines their physical, chemical, and biochemical properties as well as their biological activities (Maria et al. 2015) . The total sugar content of RSP (49.62%) is appropriately consistent with the content that has been reported in Gracilaria chouae sulfated polysaccharides (Khan et al. 2019) . Conversely, the carbohydrate content of Nizamuddinia zanardinii was 45.87% by ultrasoundmicrowave extraction method and 62.04% by cellulase extraction (Alboofetileh et al. 2019b) . Research shows that the chemical composition of microalgal polysaccharides depends on algal species, population age, environmental conditions, geographic location, seaweed harvest season, the isolation, and purification methods used (Palanisamy et al. 2017) . The protein in RSP existed mostly because they are part of the structure of cell walls and closely associated with polysaccharides (Yaich et al. 2014) . The sulfate content of RSP (19.58%) is higher than that previously observed for the extracted polysaccharides from the red alga Porphyra haitanensis, which was almost 17.06% (Wang et al. 2013) . Sun et al. (2014) reported that the uronic acids content of extracellular polysaccharides from Microcystic aeruginosa was 10.7% that lower than our reported content. It is known that for polysaccharides from natural products, the existence of sulfate and uronic acid in the molecular structure is responsible for key metabolic activity in living systems. Moreover, higher sulfate and uronic acid content induced higher antioxidant capacity, antiviral, and anticancer properties (Yaich et al. 2014) . Wang et al. (2010) reported an increased antioxidant capacity of fucoidan with increasing sulfate and uronic acid content. It was also found that exopolysaccharides (EPS) extracts with a higher sulfate and uronic acid content revealed a strong activity against V. stomatitis virus (Raposo et al. 2014 ). In addition, Koyanagi et al (2003) for the structural characterization and bioactive studies of polysaccharides and also helpful for the quality control of functional polysaccharides . The kind of monosaccharide composition in Rhodosorus sp. SCSIO-45730 commonly appears in red algae polysaccharides, as described in the review of Cheong et al (2018) . The structural and morphological characterization of RSP not only is related to the function and applications of polysaccharides, but also favorable to understand the phylogeny of the species differences among various algae (Shimonaga et al. 2008) . Similar SEM observations of uniform sheet structure with a rough appearance have been reported by Liu et al. for polysaccharides extracted from Sargassum fusiforme . Research also shows that the smoothness of the microstructure surface of the extracted polysaccharides can safely be related to the feature of sulfated polysaccharides electron micrographs . From AFM, it can be seen that the size of polysaccharide molecules is much larger than the theoretical value of single chain diameter (0.1-1.0 nm), indicating that the polysaccharide unit could be branched and tangled with each other, which may be due to van der Waals force interaction between polysaccharide molecules and hydrogen bond association between sugar chains (Ji et al. 2021 ).",

In addition, the antioxidant analyses disclosed the RSP exhibited strong hydroxyl radical scavenging ability (IC 50 = 0.83 mg mL \u22121 ), followed by ABTS radical scavenging ability (IC 50 = 1.74 mg mL \u22121 ), ferrous chelating ability (IC 50 = 2.76 mg mL \u22121 ), and DPPH radical scavenging ability (IC 50 = 3.00 mg mL \u22121 ). The present work provides a theoretical basis for the application of RSP as natural nontoxic antioxidants, potential functional food ingredients, and nutraceutical agents of biomedical. However, investigation on the structure-activity relationships and mechanism of polysaccharides is still required.",

Other microalgae, like Neochloris oleobundans, Phormidium sp., and Wilmottia murravi, have been reported to possess somewhat similar total phenolic content(Almendinger et al. 2021). The phenolic compounds can act as antioxidants either through single electron or hydrogen atom transfer and thus prevent degenerative diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, and neurodegeneration.
