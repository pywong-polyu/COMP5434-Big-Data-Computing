            "text": "Hyperglycemia-caused podocyte injury plays a crucial role in the progress of diabetic kidney disease. Podoplanin, one of the podocyte-associated molecules, is closely related to the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. A number of studies demonstrate that berberine could ameliorate renal dysfunction in diabetic mice with nephropathy, but the molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the relationship between the renoprotective effect of berberine and podoplanin expression in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice as well as mouse podocytes (MPC5 cells) cultured in high glucose (HG, 30 mM) medium. We found that the expression levels of podoplanin were significantly decreased both in the renal glomerulus of STZ-induced diabetic mice and HG-cultured MPC5 cells. We also demonstrated that NF-\u03baB signaling pathway was activated in MPC5 cells under HG condition, which downregulated the expression level of podoplanin, thus leading to increased podocyte apoptosis. Administration of berberine (100, 200 mg/kg every day, ig, for 8 weeks) significantly improved hyperglycemia and the renal function of STZ-induced diabetic mice and restored the expression level of podoplanin in renal glomerulus. In high glucose-cultured MPC5 cells, treatment with berberine (30-120 \u03bcM) dose-dependently decreased the apoptosis rate, increased the expression of podoplanin, and inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. When podoplanin expression was silenced with shRNA, berberine treatment still inhibited the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, but its antiapoptotic effect on podocytes almost disappeared. Our results suggest that berberine inhibits the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, thus increasing the podoplanin expression to exert renoprotective effects.

            "text": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), one of the most serious microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus, is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [1] . Clinically, DKD is characterized by persistent abnormal urine albumin excretion and progressive decline of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [2] . At present, the specific pathogenesis of DKD has not been fully elucidated. Growing evidence has demonstrated that glomerular podocyte injury may play an important role in the pathogenesis of DKD [3] [4] [5] . Glomerular visceral epithelial cells, called podocytes, are highly specialized cells in the kidney that constitute the outermost layer of the glomerular filtration barrier. Further study of podocytes has shown that podocyte-associated molecules, such as nephrin [6, 7] , podocin [8] , and podocalyxin [9] , are closely related to the development of DKD. For podoplanin, another podocyte-associated molecule, its relationship with DKD remains unknown.",

They found that the expression of PDPN was selectively reduced by 70% in PAN, which is characterized by the extensive flattening of podocyte foot processes and severe proteinuria. Subsequent studies showed that a single injection of anti-PDPN IgG into rats could induce selective proteinuria, which is paralleled by flattening of foot processes [11] . Zhang et al. further proved that osteocyte E11/gp38, which shares the same gene as PDPN, had a causal relationship with the dendrite formation of osteocyte-like cells [12] . Therefore, it is speculated that PDPN plays an important role in maintaining the normal morphology and function of podocytes.",

After STZ injection, both groups were randomly divided into three groups each and received BBR treatment: the (1) control group (n = 10), (2) control group+100 mg/kg BBR (n = 10), (3) control group+200 mg/kg BBR (n = 10), (4) diabetic group (n = 10), (5) diabetic group+100 mg/kg BBR (n = 10), and (6) diabetic group+200 mg/kg BBR (n = 10). Mice in all groups received BBR treatment (intragastric administration) every day for 8 weeks. At the end of the experiment, 24-h urine, blood, and kidney samples were collected for examination. Set4: The mechanism by which podocyte apoptosis is ameliorated by BBR under HG conditions In this set of experiments, we first investigated the effects of different concentrations (0, 30, 60, 90, or 120 \u03bcM) of BBR on podocyte apoptosis under HG conditions. Based on the result that BBR relieved podocyte apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, we chose the concentration of 90 \u03bcM and the time point of 36 h to conduct the following study.",

Therefore, we used 60 mice treated with BBR from 8 weeks after the last STZ injection to observe the renoprotective effects of BBR. To ensure the therapeutic effect, the BBR treatment lasted for 8 weeks.

It has been reported that the inflammation mediated by NF-\u03baB plays a key role in the pathogenesis of DKD [22] . In diabetic animals, the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling is positively correlated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to renal dysfunction [23, 24] . In our current study, the effect of NF-\u03baB on PDPN expression and apoptosis of podocytes exposed to HG was investigated. The results showed upregulation of phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65, reduced PDPN levels, and increased podocyte apoptosis under HG conditions. However, after supplementing the medium with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor PDTC, the activation of NF-\u03baB was inhibited; meanwhile, podocyte apoptosis was reduced, and PDPN expression levels were increased. Taken together, these results indicate that HG inhibits the expression of PDPN by activating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and thus induces podocyte apoptosis.

            "text": "Next, we explored the relationship between PDPN and the renoprotective effects of BBR. BBR is an alkaloid extracted from C. chinensis and P. chinense. It has been reported that BBR ameliorates renal function in diabetic mouse models [25] . In this study, BBR reduced blood glucose, ACR values, and Scr levels, and it also ameliorated the ultrastructure of podocytes in diabetic mice, indicating that BBR has therapeutic effects on DKD. Furthermore, in HG-cultured podocytes, BBR could inhibit activation of the NF-\u03baB inflammatory pathway, increase PDPN levels, and reduce the apoptosis of podocytes exposed to HG. Interestingly, when the expression of PDPN was inhibited by shRNA, the antiapoptotic effect of BBR disappeared, although its inhibitory effect on NF-\u03baB remained. These results indicate that the NF-\u03baB pathway is located upstream of PDPN and that BBR promotes the PDPN expression via inhibition of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway to exert renoprotective effects. However, we also observed an unexpected result in the diabetic mouse model. Our results showed that the renoprotective effect of BBR at both doses was similar (100, 200 mg/kg), but the expression levels of PDPN were different. Considering the hypoglycemic effect of BBR, the renoprotective effect of BBR in mice may be due to its systemic effect by lowering blood glucose. However, the in vitro studies firmly proved the role of PDPN in BBR's renoprotective effect. In combination with the in vivo and in vitro studies, we propose that both the hypoglycemic effect and elevated PDPN expression level are involved in the mechanism of kidney protection by BBR.",

One of the mechanisms by which BBR ameliorates DKD is inhibiting activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, thus restoring the expression of PDPN to reduce podocyte apoptosis induced by HG stimulation. These findings confirm the protective effect of BBR on podocytes and provide evidence for the therapeutic use of BBR for DKD.",

To explore the relationship between PDPN expression and podocyte apoptosis under high glucose conditions, the PDPN shRNA sequences as well as overexpression sequence were transfected into MPC5 cells, and the PDPN protein levels of podocytes were successfully changed (a, b). The expression level of PDPN and the apoptosis rate of podocytes were examined by Western blot (a, b) and flow cytometry (c, d), respectively. The apoptosis rates of podocytes are shown in e, f.
