Symptoms were reported for 22% of children who were seronegative and 29% of children who were newly seropositive since the summer. Between July and November 2020, the ratio of children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection to those who were seropositive was 1 to 8. At least one child who was newly seropositive was detected in 47 of 55 schools and in 90 of 275 classes.

[3] [4] [5] [6] However, debate continues about the prevalence of infections in children with no symptoms or few symptoms, and the potential spread in schools. Many countries closed their schools during the first half of 2020 to curb the pandemic, which led to disrupted education for 1.5 billion learners in up to 172 countries as of April 2020 7 ; on 2 February 2021, more than 200 million learners were still affected by school closures. 7 The negative effects of school closures include an increase in social and economic inequality, and adverse long term educational, social, and health outcomes for children. [8] [9] [10] However, the epidemiological benefits of school closures for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are uncertain. Even during periods of moderate to high community transmission, in many countries few outbreaks have been observed among children in schools where infection control measures have been implemented. [11] [12] [13] Although some outbreaks have been reported in educational settings during early 2020 (eg, in Israel 14 and the United States 15 ), full or partial opening of schools in many countries in autumn 2020 has not resulted in increased outbreaks. 11 [16] [17] [18] Most studies in schools have focused on people with identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent contact tracing within schools. Therefore, children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have no symptoms or few symptoms are probably still being missed, and the extent to which they contribute to spread of infection within schools is not clear. Additionally, the total eligible population is often not defined in studies focusing on outbreaks and contact tracing of index children in schools; the relative frequencies of outbreaks and children with SARS-CoV-2 infection in these studies remain unclear. Longitudinal, population and school based studies are needed with random sampling at class and school level to determine the frequency of outbreaks in classes and schools.",

Schools were open in this most populous canton of Switzerland since 17 August 2020, with preventive measures in place. While the number of new infections stayed low until early October, Switzerland subsequently experienced one of the highest second waves of the pandemic in Europe in autumn 2020. By the time testing took place in October-November, children had been exposed to high levels of community transmission for 3-6 weeks. Ciao Corona is one of the few prospective, population, and school based studies of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. The study offers unique insights into changes in clustering of children who were seropositive within classes and schools, and the association with self-reported symptoms.",

In 2020, physical attendance of schools was interrupted between 16 March and 10 May, and then continued until the start of the summer holiday on 13 July. As in most of Europe, schools in Switzerland have been in continuous operation from the start of the school year on 17 August to the end of 2020. When schools reopened, preventive measures were introduced and gradually adjusted (eg, masks for school staff, masks for children in secondary schools, distancing rules in classrooms and teachers' rooms, no mixing of classes, reduction of large group activities, requirement for children to stay at home when ill). The measures varied, but all schools required children to stay at home if they were ill unless their symptoms were very mild (such as a runny nose or mild cough); they required adults to wear masks in school from 19 October, and secondary school children (older than 12 years) to wear masks from 2 November.",

A major exclusion criterion was suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on the testing day, which precluded the child attending school and therefore being tested at school. timeline of testing Venous blood samples were collected from participants at schools during two testing rounds. The first round of testing (T1) from 16 June to 9 July 2020 included 2585 participants (serology results available for 2484), and the results are reported elsewhere. 1 Additionally, 18 eligible children who could not participate in June-July were tested from late August to early September (serology results available for 12), and the results were merged with the T1 testing round, resulting in a total of 2603 children.

Cut-off values were established against prepandemic plasma that allowed a sensitivity of 94.3% and specificity of 99.0% (see test description 21 ; test parameters have been updated based on an expanded validation cohort). Samples were defined as seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 if at least two of the 12 parameters were above the cut-off value.

The second outcome was the seroprevalence in October-November among children who previously tested negative and those who were not tested in June-July (T2). Even though some of the children who were seropositive at T1 tested negative at T2, we excluded them from T2 results because of potentially persisting cellular immunity 22 and rare reports of reinfection in children, and thus a low likelihood of a repeated infection since the summer. The third outcome was the proportion of children who ever had a SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the serological test results by October-November. This outcome was defined by analysing the children tested at T2 (or seropositive at T1 and not retested at T2) and counting as positive those who tested positive at T1 (regardless of subsequent T2 results) or at T2. The seroprevalence at T1 and T2 does not add up to the proportion of T1+T2 seroprevalence because the populations included in the numerator and denominator of these three outcomes are not the same (see appendix 1 for explanation).",

Therefore, even if infections within classes are not associated, in a population with a class structure similar to this study and with the same number of children with seropositivity, we would expect to see four clusters of three or more children who are seropositive in a class.

Some, but not extensive preventive measures were implemented, such as masks for school staff and restriction of large group activities, in addition to contact tracing in schools. As the number of infections in the community increased, children in secondary schools (older than 12 years) were required to wear masks from November.

In the seven classes with observed clusters, children who were seropositive were probably not part of the same infection transmission chain in at least two classes. In six classes, at least some of the children who were seropositive had previously been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection or had been quarantined. The actual number of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the autumn (and therefore, the number of clusters) could be even smaller because we assumed that 22 children who were seropositive at T2 but with no serological results at T1 were all infected in the autumn, erring on potentially identifying more clusters. The results of the simulation showed that even if seropositive status was randomly assigned to children of the study population, clusters of three or more children (although not clusters of four or more children) could be observed. Therefore, even if children who were seropositive were not associated within classes (that is, infections were completely independent of each other), some clusters could be reasonably expected to be observed by chance. In comparison, in the canton of Ticino, Switzerland, where community transmission was even higher in November 2020, 1% (14/1410) of classes were affected by quarantine measures in August-November 2020 27 (no corresponding data were publicly available from the canton of Zurich at the time this article was submitted).",

            "text": "comparison with other studies, strengths and limitations This study offers unique insights into the transmission and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools on a randomly selected, representative, longitudinal, population based cohort. Most other studies of SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools have focused on contact tracing of index cases, 11 28 and so potentially missing unidentified cases. Other studies have relied on the prevalence of diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection to assess the frequency of outbreaks and the risk of infection in children while schools are open. 11 16 17 A few studies tried to estimate the overall effect of closing and opening schools on the development of reported SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths. [29] [30] [31] Such ecological, retrospective studies often have major limitations of uncontrolled confounding, high level of aggregation for intervention (eg, pooling school and university closures as one intervention) and outcome (eg, outcomes at country level), and potentially measure the outcome in a population not exposed to the intervention. Finally, a stochastic modelling study of infection spread in schools has shown that some, although minimal, clustering of infections is likely even when major prevention and screening strategies are implemented. 32 In contrast to these retrospective and modelling studies, our study offers a prospective population level view, which corresponds to school structure because of sampling at school and class levels. Additionally, having measured the baseline seroprevalence in June-July 2020, we were able to study the number of children who were newly seropositive and their clustering in classes in the autumn. The study had a high retention rate, with 89% of enrolled children retested in the autumn, and high overall participation rates, especially given the venous blood sampling in children, a process which often triggers anxiety. High participation rates within a large proportion of classes allowed the study of clustering at the class level, which has been lacking in other school based studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection. 33 34 The results of the first two testing rounds, presented in this paper, will be strengthened by subsequent testing in March-April 2021 (which will also include parents and school staff). This further round of testing will capture seroprevalence associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections between November 2020 and March 2021. Subsequent testing will also provide evidence of whether transmission in schools changes as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge and become more prevalent, and the community transmission level changes.",

Because several days are required for seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection, 35-38 recent infections could be missed. The incubation period of around five days (between 1 and 14 days) also means that clusters might develop in a class over an extended period of time. 39 Serological studies inherently reflect infections that happened at least one week before testing. Ideally, serological testing would take place immediately after rather than during a period of high community transmission. Because testing in the 55 schools had to be scheduled in advance, when the projected development of the pandemic was uncertain, we were not able to move our testing dates to capture a longer period of high community transmission. Additionally, although we could adjust for test accuracy parameters at the population level, some false negatives and positives are expected on an individual level. 40 Although the number of children who were seropositive at T1 and seronegative after four months at T2 (n=28, 40%) is compatible with the expected number of false positives at the low seroprevalence observed at T1, waning of antibodies in the asymptomatic population is also possible. Based on the estimated seroprevalence and test accuracy parameters, among the 131 children who tested positive in the autumn, 20 would be expected to be false positive; and among the 2330 who tested negative, 11 would be expected to be false negative.
