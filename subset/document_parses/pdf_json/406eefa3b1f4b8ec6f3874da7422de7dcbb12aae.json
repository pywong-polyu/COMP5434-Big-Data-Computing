Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is less frequent and less severe in children than in adults. This study analyzed the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection among all children aged <18 years in the Apulia region of southern Italy and the characteristics of the infected children. Clinical and demographic data were collected through the national platform for COVID-19 surveillance. Of the 166 infected children in the Apulia region, 104 (62.6%) were asymptomatic, 37 (22.3%) had mild infections, 22 (13.3%) had moderate infections, and 3 (1.8%) had severe infections. Only ten children (6.0%) were hospitalized, but none required intensive care support and none died. SARS-CoV-2 infection was transmitted mainly from parents or relatives to children. Because of school closure during the lockdown, infection was unlikely to have been transmitted among children. It is unclear whether school reopening would enhance virus spread, leading the Italian government to develop guidelines for safe school reopening. The actual role of children in virus transmission remains unclear. A sensitive surveillance system, prompt identification of cases, testing, and contact tracing will be key to reducing the further spread of infection.",

The COVID-19 surveillance system is coordinated by the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0. Each region of Italy has one or more local coordinators. In Apulia, surveillance activities were performed by the Regional Epidemiological Observatory and the Laboratory of Molecular Epidemiology and Public Health of the Hygiene Unit (A.O.U.C. Policlinico Bari), which is the coordinator of the Regional Laboratory Network for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. The network consists of 12 laboratories located throughout the entire region, which consists of six provinces. There are 203,302 children residing in the province of Bari, 60,570 in the province of Brindisi, 68,151 in the province of BAT, 106,120 in the province of Foggia, 121,391 in the province of Lecce, and 93,220 in the province of Taranto. Respiratory samples (nasal and pharyngeal swabs, endotracheal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) were collected from all suspected cases and their contacts, and analyzed by the Regional Network for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using various commercial real-time PCR (RT-PCR) kits approved by the Italian Ministry of Health [9] . The clinical and demographic information of all patients who tested positive was placed on the online surveillance platform (https://covid-19.iss.it/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f). Data were collected during the period from 1 March to 1 June, and analyzed with STATA 12.0 software (StataCorp LLC, Texas 77845-4512, USA). Clinical cases were classified according to the Italian COVID-19 surveillance system (https://covid-19.iss.it/) as asymptomatic in absence of symptoms, mild infection in presence of fever <38 \u2022 C, cough, malaise, gastrointestinal symptoms without fever, moderate infection in presence of fever \u226538 \u2022 C, upper respiratory symptoms, anosmia/ageusia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and severe infection in the presence of fever \u226538 \u2022 C with dyspnea and lower respiratory tract infection.",

At the time of diagnosis, 104 children (62.6%) were asymptomatic, 37 (22.3%) had a mild infection, and 22 (13.3%) had a moderate infection. Only ten children (6.0%) were hospitalized, for an average of 18.2 days (range, 2-63 days). One child (0.6%), aged 3 years and already hospitalized for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), showed a severe infection and required hospitalization for 63 days.

One example is the screening of the population of Vo', a small town in the Veneto region of Italy, by local health authorities [10] . Contact tracing of newly infected persons and reconstruction of the train of transmission revealed that most patients were infected before the lockdown or by an asymptomatic infected person living in the same household.

The most important finding was that 62% of the 166 Apulian children and adolescents positive for SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic; rates were higher than the 21% and 16% reported in other studies [11, 12] . Moreover, contact tracing in 99 of these children showed that 98 acquired the infection from a family member. These findings indicate that in Apulia, SARS-CoV-2 infection was transmitted from parents or relatives to children, with about two-thirds of the latter not developing symptoms. However, it should be taken into account that due to social lockdown, children were only in contact with their relatives, preventing contact with people outside their family circle.",

Moreover, because children and adolescents are unlikely to have been the primary source of infection, it is unclear whether school closure enhanced infection control significantly. In Italy, subjects aged <18-years are thought to account for <2% of all COVID-19 cases [13] . However, because of school closure during the lockdown, we cannot evaluate the actual role of children in the transmission of the infection. The Italian government is developing guidelines for school reopening, based on small classes, social distancing, daily monitoring of temperature, sanitization of environments, and ventilation of rooms [14] . Ideally, school reopening should not be further delayed for social and economic reasons, as well as the negative impact of school closing on children, especially those aged 2-10 years [14] . Social life at school helps in the development of personality and a sense of identity, whereas isolation could enhance the risks of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder [15] . A sensitive surveillance system, prompt identification of cases, testing, and contact tracing will be the keys to a safe reopening of schools.",

Household contacts were the most frequent source of infection, with little transmission between children and minimal clinical manifestations, with the large majority of cases remaining asymptomatic. Thus, based on current knowledge, adults, not children, should be the primary targets for strict social distancing. Rapid clearance of the virus in infected subjects is also associated with a favorable outcome and a limited impact on the surrounding community. Further studies are needed to better understand some accompanying phenomena, such as the excess of Kawasaki-like [16] or chilblain-like [17] vasculitis associated with the spread of COVID-19, although these conditions may not be associated with SARS-COV-2 infection itself. Further understanding of these phenomena will likely contribute to determining the as yet unknown mechanism of immune response during viral infections. ",
