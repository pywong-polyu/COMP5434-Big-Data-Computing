Using the historical position of Fox News Channel in the cable lineup as the source of exogenous variation, we show that increased exposure to Fox News led to a smaller reduction in distance traveled and a smaller increase in the probability of staying home after the national emergency declaration in the USA.

COVID-19 is a contagious disease of the respiratory system that caused a pandemic that began in early 2020. One of the measures deemed necessary to limit the spread of the disease is physical distancing (limiting travel and person-to-person interactions) because the virus spreads through droplets from infected persons (Hatchett et al. 2007; Anderson et al. 2020; Hsiang et al. 2020) . Fox News Channel (hereafter, Fox), the leading cable channel in the USA, has a well-documented conservative bias in its programming Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) . During the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Fox's commentators concentrated on delivering three messages: one that emphasized potential culpability of China and Chinese government in the pandemic, one that downplayed potential dangers of the virus and suggested untested medical procedures, and one that alleged that Democrats were using the pandemic to undermine President Trump before the election. These messages could potentially affect people's evaluation of the risk and thus their willingness to self-isolate during the crisis.",

Following Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) , we exploit the exogeneity of the historical position of Fox in the cable channel lineup. This variable has been shown to be unrelated to the socio-demographic and political condition prior to the introduction of Fox and strongly predictive of actual Fox viewership once the channel is introduced. Our effects can come from three channels. First, Fox viewership directly feeds people with the three aforementioned messages. Second, the build-up of the conservative ideology can make people less willing to adopt drastic changes in their behavior and living habits. Third, conservative populations may be more susceptible to Fox's messages.",

Our hypothesis is that after the declaration of a national emergency on March 13, people were likely to adopt social distancing practices, but less so for regions more exposed to Fox. Although states enacted different orders in terms of shelter-in-place practices and business operations at different times, the declaration of a national emergency is a salient landmark in governments' campaign against COVID-19 at the national level. We interact the time-invariant Fox News channel lineup position with a dummy for post-and pre-national emergency dates. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that before the national emergency, mobility was similar in the pre-COVID period across areas with different Fox News channel positions. After the national emergency was announced, a one-standard-deviation increase in Fox exposure led to a 0.5-percentage-point larger decline in the county-level average of distance traveled relative to the pre-COVID period and a 0.1-percentage-point larger decrease in the probability of staying at home.",

Our results are not driven by a particular set of states and are not explained by alternative explanations, most notably that high-Fox-exposed locations are less likely to have an employment composition favourable for work-from-home or are more rural locations. Controlling for CNN and MSNBC does not affect the Fox estimates, indicating that our effects are not through crowding out of alternative media. Our result are robust to using county-level and zip codelevel Facebook data for 14 states. We also provide an event-study specification that allows us to control for the time path of the effect and estimate weekly coefficients for weeks before and after the national emergency. We find that the effect of Fox News is constant in the weeks after the national emergency was pronounced and did not diminish in the 4 weeks of the post-emergency period. Finally, we replicate our results using state-specific shelter-in-place orders. While our results hold for periods after the orders were enacted, we find that people started to self-isolate even before that. Thus, overall we think that national emergency was the most salient starting point of social-distancing.",

Following (Martin and Yurukoglu 2017) , we add to the literature by showing how biased media can have public health consequences, a usually non-political outcome, through changing people's behavior. We demonstrate that in addition to shaping people's mindsets in the long run, the information conveyed by the biased media on the interpretation of scientific advice and policies can be costly to society, especially when collective action is needed in the time of public health crises.",

The first set of literature discusses the effectiveness of government policies in shaping the responses to the pandemic. Qiu et al. (2020) analyse the containment policies in China and concludes that lockdowns and quarantine were essential for slowing down the spread of the virus. Bonacini et al. (2021) propose a methodology based on structural breaks to measure the effectiveness of policy responses to COVID-19. Political cleavages have been shown to be consequential for the policy response to the pandemic. In particular, Adolph et al. (2020) demonstrate that Republican governors in the USA were slower to implement stay-at-home orders and other restrictions, and Besley and Dray (2020) show that the association between COVID-19 deaths and lockdowns is stronger in countries with free media. In our paper, we show that the policy change at the federal government level, specifically, the declaration of national emergency in the USA, combined with media consumption, had a large impact on people's mobility reduction.",

While those contributions are suggestive of a causal role of conservative media, they are also consistent with a proposition, developed in a recent theoretical contribution by Gitmez et al. (2020) , that people who are ex-ante less likely to comply would choose a media source that is more likely to downplay the risks of the crisis. We share the features of many of these papers by using cellphone location data to measure mobility; however, by using a plausibly exogenous variation in exposure to Fox, we causally identify the effect of media on social distancing practices. We emphasize that not only the pre-existing political views but also the flow of information through (politicized) media can shape people's view.",

            "text": "Contemporaneous papers by Simonov et al. (2020) and Ash et al. (2020) use the same idea of identifying variation that we exploit (the Fox News channel position) and the SafeGraph data for social-distancing measures (we use UNACAST and Facebook data instead). There are several notable differences between our approach and that of Simonov et al. (2020) and Ash et al. (2020) . First, we use the earliest available data on the Fox News Channel position (from 2005), while Simonov et al. (2020) use the data from 2015, and Ash et al. (2020) use channel positions from 2016. This difference between 2005 and 2015/2016 is important because cable networks are well aware of the influence that channel position has on the viewership and lobby providers to put their channels \"lower on the dial\" Snider and Hall (1998) . This is especially true for Fox: as early as 2007, the movement of the channel from position 46 to position 44 in one of the Time Warner Cable markets was seen as a major win that merited inclusion in a self-congratulatory announcement by Fox. 2 Thus, Fox News Channel position in the later years is more likely to be endogenous to the lobbying efforts of Fox leadership. 3 Second, we make an attempt to disentangle different mechanisms. The effect of Fox exposure on social-distancing can be potentially explained by the three channels, conservatism, COVID-19-related information transmission, and the interaction of the two. The conservatism can influence social-distancing directly by making people skeptical of governmental interventions and academic experts. Because we use the historical position of Fox and control for the built-up conservatism (by including controls for the 2016 election results), we can isolate the effect of COVID-19 messaging through Fox and shedding light on the mechanisms. 4 Another important difference between our paper and the ones by Simonov et al. (2020) and Ash et al. (2020) is that, for their measures of physical mobility, they rely on a single dataset, provided by SafeGraph company, while we rely on two independent datasets: by UNACAST and by Facebook. To be more specific, Simonov et al. (2020) use SafeGraph panel to construct Census Block-level aggregates of movement, while (Ash et al. 2020) aggregate Census Block Groups (CBG) to zipcode level and to county level. It is documented that the SafeGraph panel tends to oversample Census Block Groups with fewer people (SafeGraph itself calling the representativeness on this level \"complicated\"). 5 Thus, the aggregation procedures used in those papers might lead to biases. 6 Data that we use also have biases. Specifically, Facebook users are younger and more urban than US population. 7 The UNACAST data oversamples the high-income neighborhoods and certain states. 8 Given that all mobility data sources exhibit biases, it is critical not to rely on one data provider but analyze several data sources. We show that our two sources generate highly correlated measures of mobility reduction, and our empirical results are robust to using different measures. 9",

The first case was reported on December 31 in Wuhan, China, and the first death from the new virus was reported in China on January 7. The virus then rapidly spread to other countries (the first case outside China was reported on January 13, 2020). The WHO declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 10 The first confirmed case in the USA happened on January 21, 2020. As of April 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (hereafter, CDC) reported 981,246 total cases in the USA and 55,258 deaths related to the illness. 11 Due to its means of transmission, the CDC advised that \"limiting face-to-face contact with others\" was \"the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease.\" 12 National Emergency, State, and Local Stay-at-Home Orders President Trump declared National Emergency on March 13, 2020. 13 It was the first important signal to the whole nation that the threat is real: \"'Trump said he had ordered all states to set up emergency operation centers, and urged hospitals to engage emergency operation plans.\" 14 From a policy standpoint, the most important implication of the national emergency was a fiscal one: it became easier for Federal Emergency Management Agency to transfer money to the states. It has freed up as much as $50 billion in financial resources. The importance of this move can also be perceived from how the stock market has reacted. Stock markets had their largest single-day gain since October 2008. 15 The declaration itself did not imply state-at-home mandates or any other regulations as those decisions were left to the states. Among the states, the first stay-at-home order was issued by California on March 19. This move was later followed by 39 other states (see Fig. 1 ). The last order was issued by South Carolina on April 7th. Eleven states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming) did not issue shelterin-place orders during the period that we study. Those orders differed widely in content and in how strictly they were enforced. 10 WHO COVID-19 Timeline. URL: who.int/news-room/detail/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19. 11 CDC.

We think that during the March and April of 2020, what information was shared and how information was transmitted via different channels were especially important, and both the government's action (in our case, the declaration of national emergency) and media influence (in our case, Fox News contents) were powerful in shaping people's beliefs and affecting their actions. Later, many more people's life was directly affected by the pandemic, and their own experience may become more important than outside information sources. In addition, many other important events happened in May and later months in the USA (for example, the aftermath following George Floyd's death), which makes isolating the effect of each source more difficult.

Fox viewership is correlated with political preferences, which can potentially bias our estimate of the effect of Fox viewership on social distancing. For example, since many of the Fox hosts are conservative, its viewers might be inherently more likely to view government measures with suspicion, which might reduce their compliance. Also, given the well-documented urban/rural ideological divide in the USA, it is likely the people from rural counties watch Fox more and are more limited in how much travel they can avoid. Instead of using actual viewership, we use an exogenous variation in exposure to Fox: the position of Fox News in the cable lineup. Fox was launched in 1996 and quickly expanded its geographic coverage through bilateral negotiations with local cable providers. As a result of those negotiations, those providers started offering Fox as a part of their packages, usually replacing one of their channels with the goal to minimize the change in the existing lineup and not to disrupt the experience of the viewers. This process created quasi-experimental variation in Fox exposure. When Fox has a larger number in the cable lineup position, people are less likely to watch it because it takes more effort to move to this channel. See detailed discussions in Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) . 29 29 The first-stage relationship between channel lineup and Fox viewership on the zip-code level is in Table 2 of Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) . County-level relationship can be seen in Supplementary Materials Figure  1 of Ash and Poyker (2019) .",

Pre-COVID period is defined as the 45 days prior to March 10, 2020, and both measures are constructed for this baseline period.

Our main specification is the following county-date panel regression: (1) where SD i(s)t is a measure of social-distancing in a county i located in state s on date t, F NCP i(s) is the 2005 Fox position in channel lineup, and Before t (After t ) is a dummy equal to one for dates before (after) the national emergency. F NCP i(s) is normalized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, and a larger F NCP i(s) is associated with a smaller exposure to Fox News. We control for state (\u03bc s ) and date (\u03bb t ) fixed effects. Vector X i(s) includes a set of county-level demographic and economic controls such as population density and poverty rate. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. 38 The coefficient of interest \u03b2 2 captures the effect of Fox on social distancing after the National Emergency was announced. We expect it to be negative: counties with larger Fox lineup positions have a larger decrease in the daily distance traveled relative to their pre-COVID baseline. \u03b2 1 represents the effect of Fox on social distancing before the National Emergency was announced, and we expect it to be zero, indicating that counties with difference Fox exposure did not exhibit differential social distancing behaviors in the pre-period. 39 Since our Fox News Channel lineup is measured in 2005, which is earlier than our study period (2020), we are eventually studying the heterogeneous effect of built-up Fox exposure on people's behavioral choices, given that there is a national policy advocate. 40 In addition to the demographic and economic controls mentioned earlier, we take into account the potential confounding effect of the industrial composition on the relationship between Fox exposure and social distancing behaviors. Regions with more Fox exposure may have a particular employment mix, and as shown in Dingel and Neiman (2020) , industries and occupations differ in their workability-at-home.

Column 7 adds controls for the turnout in 2016 and Republican vote share in the 2012 and 2016 elections. We find that controlling for these conservatism proxies does not affect the coefficient estimate of Fox exposure. 44 It suggests that our results are not driven by the accumulated Fox effect but by its immediate reaction to COVID-19, and possible by the interaction of the two.",

            "text": "An alternative way to define the start of people's awareness of the policy recommendation of social distancing is using states' shelter-in-place orders rather than the national emergency. Suppose that states where voters had been more exposed to Fox also voted for the government that was later in issuing stay-at-home order. In addition, people follow these state-level shelter-in-place orders. Then our effect can be explained by people with more exposure to Fox decreasing their movement less because of the lagged timing of shelter-in-place policies. Ananyev et al. (2021) find similar results of Fox using the shelter-in-place order timings, suggesting that people are paying attention to both federal and state recommendations and that the state order timings are not endogenous with respect to Fox News Channel positions (Table A.3) . Ananyev et al. (2021) also consider heterogeneous effects in Table A .4. We find some evidence that exposure to Fox News had smaller effects in the locations with a higher share of the population with a high-school education and a higher share of the population employed in workable-from-home industries (columns IV and V). We find no differential effects in urban locations in column III or locations with a higher number of Christian churches in column VI (that we consider as a proxy to conservatism). 46 We also find some suggestive evidence in columns VII and VIII, that counties that already reported first COVID cases and deaths also experienced smaller effect from the exposure to Fox News, suggesting that first-hand experience alleviated Fox mislead messages. 45 It might seem puzzling why the positions of CNN and MSNBC yield non-significant coefficients given that their coverage differed from the Fox. It is important to point out, however, that only the initial location of the channels is plausibly exogenous. We are measuring the lineup in 2005, 25 years after the founding of CNN, thus it is not exogenous anymore. Thus, while controlling for CNN allows accounting for an outside option of viewing CNN, the coefficient on the endogenous control variable cannot be interpreted causally (Westreich and Greenland 2013) . MSNBC's channel position is arguably as plausibly exogenous as the Fox News one, and while the coefficient is of a correct sign, its non-significance is indeed surprising. One of the potential explanations is that the messages have asymmetric effects: messages designed to promote health-related precautions are less likely to be consequential than messages of skepticism and the ones the prime unrelated-to-health issues. As our focus in this paper is Fox News, we leave a more thorough exploration of the role of MSNBC for further research. 46 A natural extension would be to test the impact of Fox exposure on COVID cases and mortality rates. In Table A .5, Ananyev et al. (2021) document that locations more exposed to Fox experienced larger mortality rates from COVID-19, consistent with (Bursztyn et al. 2020) . This suggests that Fox exposure can have important public health consequences through behavioral responses.",

Week indices run from \u22124 to 4 and represent the position of weeks relative to week w = 0. D(w = l) is a dummy equal to one if week w = l. Here, \u03bb t (w) are date fixed effects and \u03bc s are state fixed effects. Coefficients \u03b3 l with l \u2265 0 capture the Fox exposure effect in the post national emergency period, and the ones with l < 0 capture pre-trends. Figure 4 plots the resulting coefficients of Eq. 2 for the specification without controls (panel A) and with the full set of controls (panel B). 48 The first noteworthy feature is that neither specification exhibits pre-trends. There is an increase in the coefficient for the week prior to March 13th; however, the point estimate is insignificant. We fail to reject the joint F -test that the pre-event \u03b3 l s are zero. This suggests that the exact timing of the national emergency is not related to trends in social distancing in more-Fox-exposed counties and that social distancing behaviour did not start to change before the national emergency was announced. 49 The second noteworthy feature is that while we do not observe any effect at the week zero (\u03b3 0 ), four point estimates for four weeks after March 13th have almost Table 2 without controls and with the full set of controls. The former corresponds to the specification in column 1 of Table 2 . The latter corresponds to the specification in column 7 of Table 2 . Point estimates are reported in Table A .6 of Ananyev et al. (2021) . p-values for the joint significance of the pre-trend's coefficients are equal to 0.403 for panel A and 0.448 for panel B. Following best practice, we bin the endpoints, so that the fourth to the fifth week before and after March 13th each share a coefficient (Borusyak and Jaravel 2016; Schmidheiny and Siegloch 2019) . This figure reports 90% confidence bands the same magnitude as the point estimate of \u03b2 2 from the baseline specification in Table 2 . Thus, the effect is constant across all weeks and our baseline specification (1) captures the full time path of the effect. Ananyev et al. (2021) also show that the results also hold if one adds county fixed effects ( Figure A .5, which is a similar specification to one in panel D of Table 2 ), using week t = \u22121 as the baseline. Ananyev et al. (2021) also replicate similar event-study graphs for the shelterat-home orders in Figure A .4. Here, each state had its own relative time as week 0 started at the date when the state issued the order. While we see negative effects of the Fox News Channel position in the post-period, there are evident (while insignificant) downward pre-trends. This suggests that people might have started to decrease their mobility after the national emergency was announced but before their state officially ordered them to stay home.",

This explains 2% and 33% of the increase in the probability of staying at home in DC and West Virginia, respectively, which had the biggest and smallest changes. Panel B reports results for the distance traveled. We, also find results consistent with our findings on the county-level: a one-standard-deviation increase in channel lineup explains 2.5% of differences in distance traveled between crisis and baseline measures.

In this paper, we estimate the effect of exposure to one popular media source (Fox)-that spread controversial partisan opinions and some unscientific medical advice during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic-on mobility reduction and social distancing. Using countylevel mobility data from smartphone locations and the historical position of Fox News Channel in the cable lineup, we show that increased exposure to Fox News led to a smaller reduction in distance traveled and a smaller increase in the probability to stay home after the national emergency declaration in the USA. We find that the results are not driven by the conservatism itself, measures as the Republican vote share, but come from the COVID-19-related information conveyed by Fox and its potential interaction with the built-up conservative ideology.",

Thus, to the extent that Fox News influence could have contributed to excess mortality, the channel could have impacted the election results. The effects size that we document are moderate in magnitude, but given the political races in the USA are often decided by razor-thin margins in pivotal places, those effects could be just enough to tip the scales in favor of the Democrats in the 2020 Presidential elections.",
