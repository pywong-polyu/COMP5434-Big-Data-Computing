            "text": "Background: The need to determine prognostic factors that can predict a particularly severe or, conversely, the benign course of COVID-19 is particularly perceived in the Emergency Department (ED), considering the scarcity of resources for a conspicuous mass of patients. The aim of our study was to identify some predictors for 30-day mortality among some clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound variables in a COVID-19 patients population. Methods: Prospective single-center pilot study conducted in an ED of an University Hospital. A consecutive sample of confirmed COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure was enrolled from March 8th, to April 15th, 2020. Results: 143 patients were enrolled. Deceased patients (n = 65) were older (81 vs. 61 years, p <0.001), and they had more frequently a history of heart disease, neurological disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p-values = 0.026, 0.025, and 0.034, respectively) than survived patients. Troponin I and presepsin had a significant correlation with a worse outcome. Troponin achieved a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 82% for a cut-off value of 27.6 ng/L. The presepsin achieved a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 92% for a cut-off value of 871 pg/mL. Conclusion: In a population of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure in an ED, presepsin and troponin I are accurate predictors of 30-day mortality. Presepsin is highly specific and could permit the early identification of patients who could benefit from more intensive care as soon as they enter the ED. Further validation studies are needed to confirm this result. (www.actabiomedica.it)",

Establishing which patients can be managed at home and which ones require hospitalization, especially in an intensive care unit, has a particularly relevant value in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. Many critically ill patients' simultaneities have dragged various countries' health system into crisis (2) (3) (4) . In this regard, the search for clinical, laboratory, or imaging predictors has proven very important. The need to identify prognostic factors that can predict a particularly severe or, conversely, the benign trend of COVID-19 patients is particularly perceived in the emergency department's context considering the scarcity of resources and beds for a conspicuous mass of patients (5) (6) (7) .",

This score consists of two easily measurable biomarkers in patient serum: troponin I and presepsin. Several studies in the literature have highlighted the prognostic value of cardiovascular injury biomarkers (13) (14) (15) . Troponin I has shown a discriminatory power to identify patients with a high risk of mortality at six months in an elderly population (16) . Furthermore, a prognostic index has also been shown in populations without direct cardiovascular pathologies, such as trauma or septic patients (17, 18) . In COVID-19 patient populations, troponin I has shown a good prognostic value. Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV2 epidemic, Wuhan's Chinese district's first population analysis found that patients with worse prognosis had higher levels of troponin I (19) . Patients with cardiac injury had a higher mortality rate in the log-rank test, both from symptom onset and admission (Hazard Ratio of 4.26 and 3.41, respectively). Accuracy analysis on a comparable population (Chinese from Wuhan district) showed an AUC for ultra-sensitive Troponin I of 0.86, with a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 89% (20) . A similar analysis of non-Chinese COVID-19 patient populations subsequently confirmed these observations. An Italian multicenter study found that patients with higher troponin I levels suffered from higher mortality (Hazard Ratio 1.71), regardless of whether they had previous cardiac comorbidity (10) . Similarly, the prognostic role of troponin I in the course of COVID-19 disease was also confirmed in a US patient population (21) . Our results confirm the literature produced so far: troponin I is a biomarker capable of predicting COVID-19 patients' mortality, regardless of their cardiovascular comorbidities. It turned out to be fairly accurate with good sensitivity and specificity. Compared to the first investigations, we found a fair sensitivity: 77% for a 27.6 ng/L cut-off. However, we must underline that compared to the early stages of the epidemic, the implications of the SARS-CoV2 on the coagulation cascade are now known, and therefore a more massive use of anticoagulants is made, i.e., low molecular weight heparin. Therefore, other biomarkers that have proved reliable predictors during the first epidemic phase, such as the d-dimer, are currently not accurate (22, 23) . Additionally, we should note that the most frequently deceased patients had a medical history of cardiovascular disease. In any case, the frequency of cardiovascular diseases in the general population and the fact that the predictive value of troponin I remains valid even outside this subpopulation do not diminish the prognostic role of this biomarker.",

In other words, the proportion of lung involved in the disease process established by SARS-CoV2 may not directly correlate with the severity of the disease.

Presepsin displayed low sensitivity (54%) but very high specificity (92%); therefore, it could help identify patients who could benefit from more intensive care as soon as they enter the ED. Further internal and external validation studies are needed to confirm this result.",
