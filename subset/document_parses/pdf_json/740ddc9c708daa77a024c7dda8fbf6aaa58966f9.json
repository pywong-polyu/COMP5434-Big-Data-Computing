Circular-economy practices in supply chains require, for example, integrated reverse logistics, design with product remanufacturing and reusability potential in mind, and the arrangement of reclamation routes. Other systemic responses include switching the business model from products to services, deploying the potentials of digitalization, and disconnecting material use from profit and growth. These practices can help reduce demand for virgin materials, reduce waste, and regenerate natural capital, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions along the supply chain. 14 Fifth, changing our consumption patterns can also help. Our current system of simply buying what we want when we want it because we can-as a result of oversupply-is ignoring the risk. Climate shocks will dramatically reduce our ability to consume in the same way; we cannot assume that additional capacity will exist elsewhere. COVID-19 might have sharpened the focus here; there is a palpable sense of reservation about whether it is necessary or desirable to return to ''normal.'' We see this hesitancy to return to ''normalcy'' among both policymakers and society at large. Policymakers are not simply talking about ''building back better'' but are implementing interventions to support a green recovery and tying organizational bailouts to sustainability targets.

In this Commentary, we call for thoughtful effort to redesign our supply chains to cope with increasingly detrimental climate shocks. Thoughtful actions are necessary to protect future generations. Regenerative, restorative, and resilient supply chains are possible. We can transition to a more equitable, just, and sustainable society. We can learn from previous crises and past mistakes.",
