However, patients on V-V ECMO support have historically been managed in supine position, because of the fear of life-threatening complications associated with prone positioning during extracorporeal support and lack of experience. Recently, numerous teams have reported feasibility of PP during V-V ECMO, which might be associated with an improvement of oxygenation [3] , CO 2 clearance and respiratory system compliance [3, 4] . Several European cohort studies [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] evaluated the association between PP during ECMO and outcome, with conflicting results.",

These studies gave conflicting results, since three of them [3, 4, 6] showed an independent association between the use of PP during extracorporeal support and reduced 90-day or hospital mortality, whereas the fourth one failed to show a beneficial effect of PP during ECMO on patient outcome. Another small cohort study [5] found an increased mortality of ECMO patients who underwent PP, which however was used only as rescue therapy for refractory hypoxia. Of note, this was the only study on patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS, in whom the efficacy of PP remains to be demonstrated [21] . COVID-19-related ARDS has a different pathophysiology than \"traditional\" ARDS, resulting in an ARDS phenotype with lower lung elastance and less recruitability [22] .

            "text": "Recently, the findings of the available studies on the use of PP during ECMO were pooled in in a systematic review and meta-analysis [23] that showed a non-significant trend towards decreased mortality in patients who underwent PP during ECMO. However, this meta-analysis by Poon et al. (which also included 4 out of 5 studies included in our analysis) was performed on aggregate data (i.e. the authors did not have access to patient data), and may be biased by an imbalance between the characteristics of patients treated with PP and controls. Our analysis, on the contrary, was performed on individual patient data, thus allowing to adjust for confounders. Individual patient data analysis may allow to homogenize and to minimize bias, while increasing the sample size and, consequently, the statistical power [12] . Due to the nature of the studies included in our analysis, our findings cannot support the routine use of PP. Nonetheless, the trend towards reduced mortality suggests that it is very unlikely that PP during V-V ECMO is associated with harm. Indeed, our study reports a low incidence of adverse events related to this procedure. However, it should be noted that PP during ECMO is a challenging procedure, and might be associated with more complications when performed in ECMO centers without a specific expertise. Moreover, PP is time-consuming and might be difficult to perform as requires four to six health care providers. This might be challenging especially in the COVID-era. For these reasons, we speculate that PP may be considered in experienced centers for the most severe ECMO patients, who present with a high degree of consolidation and lung collapse. Moreover, we might hypothesize that anticipating the commencement and increasing the number of PP procedures during ECMO (median of 2 (1-3) procedures in our study versus an average of 4 \u00b1 4 in the PROSEVA trial [1] ) might provide a greater benefit on survival.",

            "text": "In an exploratory analysis, we found a stronger association between PP and lower hospital mortality in patients who were younger (\u2264 50 years of age), more severe (SOFA > 12, PaO2 to FiO2 ratio \u2264 60 mmHg), in patients who were not proned PP before ECMO and in those with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO (less than \u2264 7 days). This might indicate a greater benefit of PP in the most acute and severe patients, who have higher mortality. In addition, BMI over 30 was not associated with beneficial effects of PP. We hypothesize that ECMO patients with BMI < 30 may have sicker lungs, and thus may benefit more from PP compared to obese patients, where severe hypoxia may be partly secondary to airway or lung collapse due to high pleural pressure. Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio of proning in this subgroup should be carefully evaluated.",

            "text": "This study presents several limitations. First, only baseline variables were used for statistical corrections. Multiple regression and propensity score analysis do not take into account several other unmeasured variables. Data were aggregated from five studies which were not randomized trials. Therefore, we cannot exclude that clinicians decided to use PP in specific subsets of patients (i.e. selection bias). However, we may expect that clinicians tend to use PP in patients who do not improve or even transiently worsen after ECMO connection, whereas a Fig.2 Post-hoc analysis on risk of hospital mortality of patients who underwent prone positioning (PP) during ECMO versus patients managed in supine position (control) in predefined clinically relevant subgroups. Risk of hospital mortality was expressed using OR (points) with 95% CI (error bars) adjusted by robust clustering taking into account the 5 original cohorts of ECMO patients (i.e. clusters). BMI, Body Mass Index; SOFA, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; MV, mechanical ventilation significant improvement in oxygenation after the ECMO start might suggest keeping the patient in the supine position. Hence, this potential bias might play \"against\" PP in our analysis. This might explain the longer ECMO support in the Prone group, even if we cannot exclude that a longer duration of ECMO might be due to a \"selection\" of patients for which clinicians want to struggle more. Second, the studies included in the analysis were not homogeneous: only one study [3] was multi-centric and gathered control patients from two large \"non-pronating\" ECMO centers in order to minimize selection bias. Third, our search cannot be considered systematic, as we did not include all the small studies and case series who reported the use of PP in ECMO patients without comparing outcomes to (matched or unmatched) controls. Fourth, date of hospital discharge (or date of death after ICU discharge) was not available. For this reason, we could not perform a time-to-event analysis on hospital survival. Fifth, when gathering data on complications, we did not collect information on pressure sores and other skin lesions attributable to PP. Last, we did not gather physiologic data before and after prone positioning. Therefore, we did not assess if variation of oxygenation, CO 2 clearance and respiratory system compliance are associated with patient outcome.",
