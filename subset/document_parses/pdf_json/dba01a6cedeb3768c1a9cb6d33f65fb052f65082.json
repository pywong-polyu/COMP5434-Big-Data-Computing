Two aspects in the development of the 15-day course emerged because of promoting the work of the team in the same direction of commitment and dedication: 1. Averaging the second week of dictation, any of the instructors or assistants could act as coordinators for the day. 2. Former trainees of previous classes could be appointed as instructors (especially at the Clinical Evaluation station).
