The Anemia Studies in chronic kidney disease (CKD): Erythropoiesis via a Novel prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor Daprodustat-Dialysis (ASCEND-D) trial will test the hypothesis that daprodustat is noninferior to comparator epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa for two co-primary endpoints: hemoglobin (Hb) efficacy and cardiovascular (CV) safety. Methods. We report the trial design, key demographic, clinical and laboratory findings, and baseline therapies of 2964 patients randomized in the open-label (sponsor-blinded) active-controlled, parallel-group, randomized ASCEND-D clinical trial. We also compare baseline characteristics of ASCEND-D patients with patients who are on dialysis (CKD G5D) enrolled in other large CV outcome trials (CVOTs) and in the most relevant registries.",

Baseline demographics were similar to patients with CKD G5D enrolled in other CVOTs and renal patient registries. Conclusions. ASCEND-D will evaluate the efficacy and safety of daprodustat compared with epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa in the treatment of patients with anemia with CKD G5D.",

            "text": "Anemia is ubiquitous among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on dialysis (CKD G5D) [1] . The introduction of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) treatment in 1989 was one of the most important advances in the treatment of patients on dialysis and other patients with CKD. In the past, severe anemia was common, diminishing patients' quality of life and resulting in the need for frequent blood transfusions [2] . Treatment with rhEPO and its analogs [erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)] to partially correct anemia has improved patients' lives and substantially reduced requirements for blood transfusion. However, several randomized trials have demonstrated either no benefit or even harm in relation to cardiovascular (CV) and other outcomes when treatment with rhEPO and its analogs were used to normalize hemoglobin (Hb) in patients with CKD [3] [4] [5] [6] . Indeed, post hoc analysis have suggested that exposure to high doses of exogenous rhEPO may present a possible increase in CV and mortality risk in these patients [7] [8] [9] . The emergence of newer compounds termed hypoxiainducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) to stimulate erythropoiesis through the inhibition of HIF-prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3 may represent an alternative treatment strategy [10] . Recently approved in China and Japan, these agents are currently in development for the rest of the world [11] [12] [13] . PHD inhibition leads to stabilization of HIF-a transcription factors and expression of HIF-responsive genes involved in adaptation to hypoxia, including EPO and genes that regulate iron uptake, mobilization and transport, as well as resulting in decreased hepcidin production [14, 15] . Given the safety concerns with rhEPO and its analogs and challenges associated with parenteral therapies in some CKD populations, HIF-PHIs such as daprodustat (previously GSK1278863) are being developed to treat anemia of CKD.",

This includes on-and off-treatment MACE in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. This event count provides $90% power to establish NI with a NI margin hazard ratio of 1.20 for daprodustat compared with rhEPO, assuming a true underlying 3% lower relative risk of MACE in favor of daprodustat (i.e. a true underlying hazard ratio of 0.97), and 80% power for NI under the assumption that the true underlying risk of MACE is the same in both groups (i.e. a true underlying hazard ratio of 1.00). The study completed randomization in August 2018. In August 2020, prior to study unblinding and after discussion with the regulatory authorities, as well as approval with the external steering committees (SCs) and the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), the MACE NI margin was changed to 1.25, reducing the event target to 664 while maintaining $90% power. The rationale for the NI margin change was to accelerate study closeout in consideration of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic and to align with the NI margin used in other HIF-PHI clinical studies [20] . There are no identified risks to subject safety or data integrity with these changes.",

The selection of rhEPO control was based on pragmatic clinical dialysis practice. In earlier daprodustat clinical trials, investigators were responsible for managing rhEPO dosing in the control group, which led to higher Hb values than targeted [27] . Therefore, a decision was made to apply the same dose adjustment algorithm for both treatment groups, as well as to provide the study rhEPO and develop a standard set of dose steps that were aligned with rhEPO labeling. Similarly, iron management criteria and an anemia rescue algorithm have been developed, and used for both treatment groups. For the latter, only IV iron and/or transfusions were allowed, in addition to randomized treatment, as an early intervention to improve Hb before considering a patient to have met the rescue endpoint and to permanently discontinue randomized treatment. Standardizing the doses of randomized treatment, along with utilizing the same dose adjustment algorithm, iron management criteria and anemia rescue algorithm allow for a more unbiased comparison between the groups. The baseline characteristics of dialysis patients recruited in ASCEND-D were similar to that of other large CVOTs of dialysis patients. The most relevant comparison is between ASCEND-D and the INNO 2 VATE prevalent trial, which are both investigating HIF-PHIs; trial design, demographic and clinical characteristics were similar. While INNO 2 VATE had a higher recruitment in the USA, ASCEND-D had a higher recruitment from EMEA. Comparisons with PIVOTAL [22] and other historical CVOTs in dialysis patients also indicate similar baseline characteristics [28] [29] [30] , with the exception of a lower prior ESA dose and higher rate of IV iron usage for ASCEND-D. Utilization of a lower ESA dose in ASCEND-D likely reflects differences in US recruitment (29% ASCEND-D versus 61% INNO 2 VATE). In contrast to INNO 2 VATE, where only 16% of patients had baseline IV iron use, 64% of ASCEND-D patients had baseline IV iron use, comparable with DOPPS data [24] .",

            "text": "Registry data provided an additional way to compare patient characteristics with ASCEND-D to determine generalizability. Because of its global nature, DOPPS is arguably a better comparator than country-based registries. ASCEND-D compares favorably with DOPPS with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics [26] , thus supporting the generalizability of this study population, with the exception of a higher Hb in DOPPS given the practice pattern outside of the USA to treat to higher Hb targets than the pre-specified target in ASCEND-D, which was developed in line with worldwide ESA labeling. Comparisons with US datasets from DOPPS [26] and USRDS [25] demonstrated that baseline characteristics were generally similar, with only a few accountable differences (e.g. race and Hb level). The main limitation of the ASCEND-D trial is the open-label design. Blinding dialysis patients to randomized treatment is challenging because the active comparator is either administered intravenously or subcutaneously, whereas daprodustat is an oral medication and would have introduced a number of complexities and potential limitations to the study, including limiting the generalizability of the study. Importantly, the adjudication of clinical outcomes is blinded to the treatment assignment minimizing the risk of ascertainment bias [31] . Likewise, the sponsor remained blind to treatment assignment throughout the trial. Although the study patient population is younger than the average age of dialysis patients, it is common for trials to recruit younger patients given that older patients are frailer and less likely to participate in trials. Additionally, the selection of rhEPO type, dose steps and frequency of administration were pre-specified in the comparator group and may differ from local ESA protocols. Likewise, a common dose adjustment algorithm across treatment groups was implemented, which may differ from local practice.",

Patients were recruited not only from academic centers but also from community practices. It is notable that the racial and ethnic composition of ASCEND-D, although similar to other large trials, is more diverse than often seen in trials enrolling dialysis patients. The standard of care for patients on dialysis (e.g. diabetes, BP control and dialysis adequacy) was consistent with Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines or local equivalent [32] . Overall, the study population, including patients on PD, and prevalence of CVD appears typical of global patients undergoing dialysis, ideal for determining the safety and efficacy of daprodustat.",
