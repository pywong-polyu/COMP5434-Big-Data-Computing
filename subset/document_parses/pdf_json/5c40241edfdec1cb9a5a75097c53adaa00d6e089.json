Here, we report the emergence of the B.1.621 lineage, considered a variant of interest (VOI) with the accumulation of several mutations affecting the Spike protein, including the amino acid changes I95I, Y144T, Y145S and the insertion 146N in the N-terminal domain, R346K, E484K and N501Y in the Receptor Binding Domain and P681H in the S1/S2 cleavage site of the Spike protein. The rapid increase in frequency and fixation in a relatively short time in some cities that were near the theoretical herd immunity suggests an epidemiologic impact. Further studies will be required to assess the biological and epidemiologic roles of the substitution pattern found in the B.1.621 lineage.",

Lineage B.1.621 emerged from the parental B.1 lineage circulating in Colombia The close phylogenetic relationship of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences belonging to the B.1.621 lineage with other sequences from representative lineages circulating worldwide and those circulating in Colombia suggested a recent origin from the parental lineage B.1 (Figure 2a), which was corroborated through the lineage designation (https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangodesignation/issues/57 ) (supplementary table 2). B.1.621 lineage has recently spread to fourteen departments, with a major representation in the Caribbean region of Colombia (Figure 2b) (https://microreact.org/project/5CAiK3qCMaEgE4vYkKVpZW/b7113efc). No recombination events were found throughout the whole genome (data not shown). At least 9 codons in the Spike protein displayed a signal suggestive of positive selection (supplementary table 3). Discussion All genomes belonging to the B.1.621 lineage available until the end of April 2021 were included in this study, with the earliest collection date on January 11th. 2021, corresponding to a sample collected in the department of Magdalena, Colombia (EPI_ISL_1220045). While a very high and unexplained genetic distance is found between every B.1.621 sequence and all closely related sequences of the parental B.1 lineage, the whole branching pattern and intra-lineage distance suggest low diversification that can be explained by its recent origin. The spread in the country early during the third peak of the pandemic could be explained by a combination of factors, including social exhaustion as well as the genetic background of the emerging lineage, leading to changes in transmission.",
