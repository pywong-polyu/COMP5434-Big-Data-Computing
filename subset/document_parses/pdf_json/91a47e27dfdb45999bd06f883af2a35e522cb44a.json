[6] [7] [8] This remarkable transmissibility, paired with its lower case fatality rate, has served as a double-edged sword given that milder illness affecting a majority of cases has hampered public compliance with masking and social distancing recommendations. 9,10 SARS-CoV-2 is spread through respiratory droplets and binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in nasal and bronchial epithelial cells and pneumocytes via viral Sprotein. 11, 12 The S-protein has two subunits, S1 and S2; S1 mediates binding to the host cell ACE2 receptor through the receptor binding domain (RBD) while S2 directs viral cell membrane fusion. By comparison, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with 5-10 times greater affinity than the RBD of SARS-CoV. 6, 7 The recognition of the S-protein's importance in cellular entry has made it a key target for the immune response, as well as vaccine mediated protection.",

A study of ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 infected turbinate tissue identified a broad and robust innate immune response in nasal tissue, with increased upregulation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and cytokine release, vital components in inhibiting viral infection of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f nucleated cells. 13, 14 Comparatively, this response to SARS-CoV-2 was larger than that initiated by the influenza virus, characterized by significant upregulation of genes that specifically enhanced antigen presentation and immune cell signaling, indicating a robust immune recognition and response to the virus in the nose. SARS-CoV-2 infected lung tissue, on the other hand, failed to upregulate INF types I, II, and III. Upregulation of ISGs in infected lung tissue was observed, but cellular immune pathways such as antigen presentation, immune cell maturation, TNF receptor signaling, and inflammasome pathways were not activated. 13 In effect, an early innate immune response is initiated in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, however, the downstream effect is blunted in the pulmonary tissue.",

            "text": "A possible explanation for this finding is the action of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) which inactivates the translational activity of the human 40S ribosomal subunit, a key link in the chain in the activation of immune response following antigen detection. 8, 15 Failure to translate upregulation of ISGs could potentially explain the restricted innate response observed in the lung tissue. How nasal, but not lung, epithelial tissue overcomes the translation inhibiting effects of NSP1 is not yet understood. Other studies support this finding, demonstrating that in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected primary human airway epithelial cultures are unable to produce type I or III IFN, yet addition of exogenous IFN was able to significantly reduce viral burden in the same cultures. 16 This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition of IFN production, not reduced susceptibility to INF's antiviral inducing mechanisms, may play an important role in the virus's ability to modulate and evade the immune response. patients who experienced a range of symptoms from mild to severe, both in the acute setting, as well as 4-7 months following recovery. 18 Patients with mild infection were well enough to convalesce at home and experienced minimal symptoms, while those with moderate disease were hospitalized, required oxygen, or had non-severe ARDS. Comparatively, severe infection was characterized by admission to the ICU, a P:F ratio of <200, or death from COVID-19. The researchers found that among patients with mild disease, the development of anti-S1 IgG antibodies was delayed nearly 2 weeks from symptom onset and that once formed, these antibodies demonstrated only modest neutralizing capacity. 18 Most patients in the moderate cohort also lacked detectable anti-S1 IgG for several weeks following symptom onset, however, once present, antibody levels were higher and consistent with robust neutralizing capacity.",

This pattern, with a vigorous early antibody response, demonstrating stronger neutralization capacity among patients with severe COVID-19, has been duplicated by others and clearly demonstrates an association between severity of illness and early humoral immune response to native infection. 19 Given this pattern, there has been an appropriate focus on IgG and IgM production over the course of COVID-19 infection, however, antibody levels may not tell the whole story. As noted, higher binding antibody levels have been found among patients suffering from severe, rather than mild, COVID-19 disease. 20 Over the course of one to six months, anti-RBD IgG and IgM levels decrease, with an associated 5-fold reduction in plasma neutralizing activity. Importantly, memory B-cells, capable of rapidly producing RBD-specific antibodies, remain unchanged six months after infection, indicating the potential for the body to rapidly increase antibody levels upon repeat antigen exposure. 21 neutralizing antibodies may play an important role in early response to infection. 22 Less is known about differential IgA response by disease severity, a knowledge gap that, once filled, may help us better understand variations in host response to infection.",

            "text": "The cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 also correlates with severity of COVID-19 illness, however, in an opposite direction than that of humoral immunity. Analysis of blood samples from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 found that those with mild disease had a robust SARS-CoV-2-specific INF-\uf067-producing T-cell response against S1, M, and N viral proteins within the first two weeks of symptom onset while patients with moderate disease developed cellular responses to these epitopes at a slower rate, reaching equivocal numbers only 3 weeks post symptom onset. Patients with severe disease had still not started developing high numbers of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells by the end of the acute infection follow-up. 18 Fortunately, among those who recover, including recovery from severe disease, 97% maintained detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T-cells out to at least 28 weeks, suggesting that even a delayed cellular response may produce longer lasting immunity across the spectrum of disease severity. 18 Interestingly, significant peripheral T-cell lymphopenia has been identified as a marker of severe COVID-19 infection. A recent systematic review of the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection found significantly lower CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cell counts in critically ill patients and those who ended up dying of COVID-19 as compared to survivors and moderately ill patients. 23 Further, in a multivariable adjusted analysis, CD8+ T-cell counts of <165 cells/\u00b5L were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f independently associated with COVID-19 related mortality. 24 Similarly, lower helper T-cell levels and higher CD4:CD8 ratios have also been identified as strong predictors of mortality. 25 Dysregulation of the T-regulatory cell (Treg)/Th17 balance has further been implicated in severity of infection, with increased Th17 and decreased Treg cells in patients with severe COVID-19. 26 Treg's play a critical role in dampening an overreactive immune response for the maintenance of immune homeostasis and self-tolerance during viral infections. Th17 cells produce IL-17 which can promote the production of downstream proinflammatory molecules, including IL-1, TNF, IL6 and neutrophil chemoattractants. In murine model of ARDS, IL-17 has previously been shown to augment lung parenchyma destruction by amplifying proinflammatory mediators and neutrophil recruitment. 27",

They report that, among 12-34 year-olds, unvaccinated individuals were 5-times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to their fully vaccinated age matched counterparts. For those over the age of 65, the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization is 7-fold higher among the unvaccinated, with a risk of death 13-times J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f greater than fully vaccinated individuals in the same age group. 38 Comparably, significant adverse events associated with vaccine were exceedingly rare (between 0.2%-0.3%). 39 Patients do report symptoms following vaccination, most frequently injection site pain and fatigue or malaise, however, these are overwhelmingly mild and short lasting, with >80% resolving within 2 days. 40 Dual antigen exposure from both vaccine and infection may also augment host immune response. Early work comparing serial IgG levels between previously infected and COVID-19 na\u00efve individuals found that IgG levels were similar after 1 mRNA vaccine dose in those with a history of COVID-19 to those following 2 doses in participants without prior infection. 41 Expanding on this work, researchers found that while COVID-19 na\u00efve individuals developed lower overall IgG levels, the two groups had comparable neutralizing antibodies and S-specific B-cell levels 8 months after vaccination. Interestingly, the COVID-19 na\u00efve subjects also exhibited higher SARS-CoV-2-specific cytokine production, CD4+ T-cell activation, and proliferation than those who recovered from COVID-19. 42 While the exact mechanism behind the elevated T-cell response following vaccination in COVID-19 individuals remains uncertain, this finding is reassuring, particularly in the setting of the previously noted association of a robust cellular response to infection and the development of only mild symptoms.",

Further, vaccine mediated antibodies among men in this older cohort were found to decrease 46% more J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f than similarly aged women. 44 Such declines in antibody levels have lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to recommend vaccine boosters and continued use of masks in high-risk areas to limit viral transmission.",

            "text": "However, given the high rate of ARDS noted, it is uncertain whether SARS-CoV-2 has a unique pathophysiologic immune response that may further predispose to lung injury. 49 Among the more feared complications of COVID-19 infection are the development of myocarditis and pericarditis. Importantly, while cardiac involvement from COVID-19 infection does occur, clinically significant myocarditis remains a rare complication, with cases typically mild and self-limited. 51 Multiple potential immunologic mechanisms have been proposed as drivers of infection and vaccine associated myocarditis. Specifically following infection, the two-leading hypothesis for the mechanism of myocarditis include direct viral infection of cardiac myocytes and a maladaptive immune response, as described above. Interestingly, histological analysis of biopsy tissue from SARS-CoV-2 infected myocarditis patients did not display the classic lymphocytic pattern associated with viral myocarditis. This has led many to believe that overactivation of the immune response, particularly in the setting of severe COVID-19, likely contributes to cardiac dysfunction through thromboinflammation and endothelial dysfunction. 57 Work has also specifically implicated CD68+ T-cells found in high numbers in the myocardium of COVID-19 hearts, in the development of myocarditis following infection. 58 Vaccine associated myocarditis is thought to result from parallel, though importantly different mechanisms. The previously noted nucleoside modifications to the mRNA vaccines are designed in part to reduce the innate immune system's response to foreign RNA molecules. At least some vaccine associated myocarditis cases may represent breakthrough of this innate immune response, a mechanism associated with certain genetic predispositions. 59 Another proposed mechanism evokes molecular mimicry of the S-protein transcribed from the delivered mRNA resulting in crossreactivity with alpha-myosin. 60 Eosinophilic hypersensitivity has further been implicated as a mechanism particularly given the predilection for second or third dose and been described with the smallpox vaccine, as well. 61 Finally, sex hormones may play a role in the noted male predominance of COVID-19 and vaccine associated myocarditis. Specifically, estrogen may work to mitigate proinflammatory T-cells, while testosterone may block the function of certain damage. 57",

Fortunately, all individuals with abnormal cardiac MRIs saw some degree of improvement on serial imaging, again indicating a largely self-limited disease course. 54 In comparison, vaccine associated myocarditis remains rare. Data from Israel found only 54 cases out of 2.5 million vaccinated individuals, with data from the European Medicines Agency identifying even lower rates of 1.6 per million Pfizer vaccines and 3.0 per million doses of Moderna. 55,56 Cases were predominantly among young or adolescent males, with 76% described as mild. In fact, only 14 individuals in the Israeli data were found to have reduced left ventricular systolic function, with most having recovery of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f function at follow-up. As opposed to myocarditis, pericarditis has been observed more commonly among older patients and at a later time point with median of 20 days after the most recent vaccine dose.51",
