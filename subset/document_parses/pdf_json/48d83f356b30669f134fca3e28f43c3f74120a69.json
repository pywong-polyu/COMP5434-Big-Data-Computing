A better health care quality may help a country to tackle the pandemic. Making clusters of countries with similar types of health care quality provides an insight into the quality of health care in different countries. In the area of machine learning and data science, the K-means clustering algorithm is typically used to create clusters based on similarity. In this paper, we propose an efficient K-means clustering method that determines the initial centroids of the clusters efficiently. Based on this proposed method, we have determined health care quality clusters of countries utilizing the COVID-19 datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method reduces the number of iterations and execution time to analyze COVID-19 while comparing with the traditional k-means clustering algorithm.",

It is done by calculating the distances from a centroid of a cluster. K-means algorithm is an NP-Hard problem [7] . Efficiently estimating the initial centroids is a difficult problem. At the initial state, we need to fix the coordinates of the initial centroid for finding the number of clusters. In the traditional K-Means clustering algorithm, initial centroids usually being selected randomly. Thus, determining the initial coordinate points of centroids can play a signifcant role in clustering, in which we are interested in. The key contributions of our work are as follows -\u2022 Our proposed method efficiently selects the k-means clustering algorithm's centroids that provides an optimum number of constant iteration as well as execution time. \u2022 We have clustered similar types of countries according to the health care quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2022 We have tested our model with a COVID-19 real-world dataset to show the efficiency of our model with the existing models.",

            "text": "Several approaches have been proposed to find the initial cluster centroids more efficiently. In this section, we bring some of these works. M. S. Rahman et al. [8] , provides a centroids selection method based on radial and angular coordinates. However, the number of iterations of his proposed idea is not constant for all the instances. Also, the execution time of that method increases drastically by the increase of the cluster number. A. Kumar et al. also proposed to find initial centroids based on the dissimilarity tree [9] . Although this method improves kmeans clustering, the execution time is not exalted significantly. Also, the smaller datasets that are used for experiment results can not provide insight into a large dataset. In [10] , M.S. Mahmud et al. proposed a novel approach to find the initial centroids by calculating the mean of each distance of the data points. It only describes 3 clusters of given three datasets with the execution time. Improvement of execution time is also trivial. The concept is based on the weighted average. In [11] , another approach is made to find the initial centroids efficiently. Here in M. Goyal et al. also tried to find the centroids by dividing the sorted distances with k, the number of equal partitions. No execution time was given for this proposed method. S. Na et al. [12] have proposed the use of two elementary data structures to store cluster labels and the distance of all data items with each iteration. On the next iteration, data of the previous iteration was used. But, execution time was trivial for the dataset experimented by authors. M. A. Lakshmi et al. [13] have proposed a method to find initial centroids by using the nearest neighbor method. They compared their idea by using SSE(Sum of the Squared Differences) with random and kmeans++ initial selection. Their SSE is roughly similar to random and kmeans++ initial selection. Moreover, They did not provide any comparison concerning execution time as well.",
