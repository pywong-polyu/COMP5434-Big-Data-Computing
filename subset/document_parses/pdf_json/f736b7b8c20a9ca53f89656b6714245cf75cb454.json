With the potential to lead individuals to harmful decisions for the society, this infodemic represents a severe threat to information security, public health and democracy. In this paper, we assess the interplay between the infodemic and specific aspects of the pandemic, such as the number of cases, the strictness of containment measures, and the news media coverage. We perform a comparative study on three countries that employed different managements of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-namely Italy, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. We first analyze the three countries from an epidemiological perspective to characterize the impact of the pandemic and the strictness of the restrictions adopted. Then, we collect a total of 6 million posts from Facebook to describe user news consumption behaviors with respect to the reliability of such posts. Finally, we quantify the relationship between the number of posts published in each of the three countries and the number of confirmed cases, the strictness of the restrictions adopted, and the online news media coverage about the pandemic. Our results show that posts referring to reliable sources are consistently predominant in the news circulation, and that users engage more with reliable posts rather than with posts referring to questionable sources. Furthermore, our modelling results suggest that factors related to the epidemiological and informational ecosystems can serve as proxies to assess the evolution of the infodemic.",

            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1] . To contrast its spreading, governments introduced a series of countermeasures known as Non-Pharmaceutical-Interventions (NPIs) [2, 3] : the adoption of facemasks, quarantines, social distancing, and mobility limitations [4] . The pandemic also sparked a high news volume on social media [5] , further increased by the start of the vaccination campaigns [6] , which highlighted the critical role played by information in health emergencies [7, 8] . The novel news circulation dynamic has been defined as \"infodemic\" by WHO, a term indicating \"an overabundance of information-some accurate and some not-that occurs during an epidemic\" [9] . The study on the effects related to infodemics has been carried on for more than a decade. Indeed, Prof. Gunther Eysenbach, in 2002 , coined the term infodemiology [10] to indicate \"the study of the determinants and distribution of health information and misinformation-which may be useful in guiding health professionals and patients to the quality health information on the Internet. Information epidemiology, or infodemiology, identifies areas where there is a knowledge translation gap between best evidence (what some experts know) and practice (what most people do), as well as markers for 'high-quality' information\". This study area offered the opportunity to develop a vast amount of applications [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] for surveillance, assessment, and investigation, whose aims are recognized with the term \"infoveillance\" [16] .",

This behavior promoted the emergence of homogeneous groups (that is, clusters in the social media networks) with similar news consumption dynamics, called echo chambers [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , and the creation of online environments sensitive to the diffusion of misinformation [24] . Further results pointed out that the formation and the segregation of such groups may be attributed to the role of platforms' feed algorithms that increase the distance among ideologically opposite groups of users [25, 26] . Further efforts aimed at quantifying the magnitude and the effects of infodemic on social media investigating a broader amount of platforms [5, 27, 28] . Authors from [29] [30] [31] focused on these effects by analyzing the topics, emotions, and concerns that emerged from such posts. Moreover, authors from [32] developed the Infodemic Risk Index (IRI) to quantify how users from each country can be susceptible to the spreading of unreliable news, demonstrating how the consumption of the latter decreases as the number of confirmed cases arose in the different countries.",

We analyse three countries-namely Italy, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand-that experienced a different time evolution of the pandemic and that implemented different containment strategies (see Section for further details). We first provide an epidemiological assessment of each country to characterize the impact of the pandemic and the strictness of the restrictions adopted. Then, we collect more than 6 million pieces of content talking about COVID-19 topics posted on Facebook in 2020 from public groups and pages. We categorize such posts into Questionable or Reliable, based on the trustworthiness of the referenced news outlets, to analyze the evolution and the engagement that both categories produced. Finally, we perform a regression on the number of posts by employing the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, the strictness of the restriction policies adopted and the online news media coverage about the pandemic. Our results show that reliable posts are prevalent in the news circulated in 2020, across the three countries, and that users engaged more with such posts than with questionable posts in Italy and New Zealand (but not in UK) throughout the analysis period. Moreover, regression results suggest that the number of cases, the Stringency Index and the online news media coverage can serve as proxies to assess the evolution of the infodemic.",

The choice of these countries relies on the different strategies they employed in the mitigation of the virus during 2020. Indeed, Italy formerly implemented a series of containment measures only for those municipalities which were identified as the central spreaders of the virus [33] . Then, such measures were extended to regions following the same rationale, introducing the closure of schools and universities. The severity of the epidemiological profile led the country to establish a first national lockdown from 09/03/2020 to 18/05/2020, followed by a second one from 24/12/2020 to 06/01/2021 [34] . New Zealand, instead, adopted a series of countermeasures with the precise goal of eradicating the virus, characterized by early, rapid, and decisive government actions at various levels such as strict lockdowns, border-control, community, and case-based control measures [35] . Moreover, the country also enforced a nationwide lockdown that lasted from 23/03/2020 to 13/05/2020 [34] , managing the spreading of the virus through a series of public health and social measures organized in a four-level COVID-19 Alert System [36] .",

To assess the trustworthiness of posts circulating on Facebook, we built a dataset of news outlets' domains from our original Facebook dataset where each domain is labeled either as Questionable or Reliable. The classification relied on a combination between Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) [41] , an independent fact-checking organization, and a list of news outlets labelled as described in [42] . On MBFC, each news outlet is associated with a label that refers to its political bias, namely: Right, Right-Center, Least-Biased, Left-Center, and Left. Similarly, the website also provides a second label that expresses its reliability, categorizing outlets as Conspiracy-Pseudoscience, Pro-Science or Questionable. Noticeably, the Questionable set includes a wide range of political biases, from Extreme Left to Extreme Right. For instance, the Right label is associated with Fox News, the Questionable label to Breitbart (a famous right extremist outlet), and the Pro-Science label to Science. MBFC also provides a classification based on a ranking bias score that depends on four categories: Biased Wording/Headlines, Factual/Sourcing, Story Choices, and Political Affiliation. Each category is rated on a 0-10 scale, with 0 indicating the absence of bias and 10 indicating the presence of maximum bias. The bias outlet score is computed as the average of the four score categories. A different characterization is provided for humor and platforms websites, not accounting for the categorization process.",

Then, we estimate the potential volume of the infodemic with the number of posts circulating, the user engagement that the posts sparked, and coverage of COVID-19 by the national news media. Finally, we study the correlation between the spread of information and several factors expressing different facets of the pandemic and infodemic. Our findings show that the infodemic evolution may increase with the volume of the online news coverage about COVID-19 in all the three countries. Moreover, the containment measures tightening are correlate with a potential increase in the volume of the infodemic in Italy and New Zealand, but its effect is not significant in UK. In terms of news diet composition, we observe a predominant circulation of reliable news.

Such decisions should consider that effective communication strategies must be developed and followed when publishing and circulating news, knowing that people, especially during a severe epidemic spreading, may be more susceptible to the content proposed. Furthermore, further actions are required to increase citizen awareness and understanding of the pandemic. A concrete approach may include the development of epidemic literacy programs, the introduction of interdisciplinary observatories that quantify the interconnection between the two ecosystems with the involvement of impacted communities. A major limitation to the analysis we conducted is the availability of social networks data. First, as CrowdTangle does not provide the content of the comments, we cannot investigate whether people are inclined to spam the comment section with misleading claims even if the original post only presents credible information. We are aware that this methodology reduces the study sample, which CrowdTangle already restricts since it provides only posts from public Facebook pages with more than 25K Page Likes or Followers, public Facebook groups with at least 95K members, all US-based public groups with at least 2K members and all verified profiles.

We observe that SI has a strong positive correlation with the number of posts in all three countries with values that range from 0.7 to 0.9, meaning that the tightening of the restriction goes together with an increase of the online debate volume. ONCI, instead, has a correlation with the number of posts of 0.3 in Italy and 0.8 and 0.9 in the other countries, showing the consistency between the volumetric trend of the online news coverage in a country and the volume of the debate on social media. Finally, the number of cases shows a lack of correlation with the evolution of posts in United Kingdom, expressed by a Pearson score of 0.1, suggesting how the social media debate in the country may be related to further factors. Italy and New Zealand instead provide a stronger positive relationship with a value of 0.6 and 0.7 respectively, describing how the public debate is influenced by the severity of the pandemic outbreak.

This suggests that the consumption of posts in social media is correlated to both the change in the epidemiological scenario and the pandemic media coverage. For Italy and New Zealand the N. of Posts published on Facebook is directly proportional to the three explanatory factors we employed in our model: in these countries, pages and groups are more likely to post when the epidemiological situation worsens, the pandemic news media coverage increases, and the mobility restriction measures becomes more strict. Instead, for the United Kingdom the correlation between the N. of Posts and the N. of Cases is negative (equal to \u22120.11 with a standard error of 0.02, significant at a level of 0.05).
