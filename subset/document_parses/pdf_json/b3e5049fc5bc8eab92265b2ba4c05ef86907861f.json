Multiple lines of evidence suggest that there is a varying yet considerable increase in mental health issues among the general population and vulnerable groups. 1 2 The aftermath is obscure and speculative from a social, economic, individual and public mental health perspective. Recently published studies support the existence of an emotional epidemic curve, describing a high probability of an increase in the burden of mental health issues in the postpandemic era. 3 4 Furthermore, previous major public health emergencies showed that more than half of the population developed mental health problems and required mental health intervention. 4 5 There is, therefore, an urgent need to reorganise existing mental health services to address the current unmet needs for mental health and to prepare for future challenges in the postpandemic era in terms of prevention and management.",
