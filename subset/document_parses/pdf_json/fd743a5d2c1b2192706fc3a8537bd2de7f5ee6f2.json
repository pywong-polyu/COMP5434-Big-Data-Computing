TyG index exhibited a moderate-to-high strength in predicting in-hospital death, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.821 (95% CI 0.712-0.929, P < 0.001).

SFTSV (New Bunyavirus) was isolated by Yu et al. and identified as a member of the genus phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family (1). SFTSV mainly infects humans through tick bites and may result in multiple organ dysfunction, particularly myocardial damage and kidney injury (2) . Since it was first reported in China in 2009, the number of SFTS cases has increased rapidly, and related cases have been detected in neighboring countries, such as South Korea and Japan (1, 3, 4) . Nowadays, SFTS has been involved in a wide range of regions throughout the world with a mortality rate of up to 30% (1), which makes it listed as an emerging infectious disease by the WHO in 2017 (5) . For patients with severe situations, it may rapidly progress to multiple organ failure, then further lead to death within 1-2 weeks. Therefore, early risk stratification is of great clinical significance in identifying individuals with a high risk of poor outcomes and customizing specific strategies in line with the risk levels.",

In China, SFTS has been reported mainly in rural regions in the Eastern and Central provinces. SFTSV, which causes SFTS, is a novel phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family. The genome of SFTSV consists of three minus-strand RNA segments: large, medium, and small segments (16) . SFTSV can invade multiple organs and propagate in the cytoplasm of host cells, such as the spleen, liver, and kidney (17) . For critically ill patients with SFTS patients, their clinical symptoms usually exacerbate during the acute phase of the disease and quickly proceed to multiple organ dysfunction syndromes, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and ending in death \u223c1-2 weeks after the onset of the disease (18) . No vaccines or effective drugs against SFTSV have yet been developed. Therefore, early identification of high-risk patients has important clinical significance for improving the prognosis of SFTS. In the early stages of SFTS, patients with severe conditions may have significantly increased markers compared with patients with mild conditions. Our study found that the TyG index in patients with in-hospital death was significantly higher than that of patients without, indicating that the TyG index may be an effective indicator for early identification of patients who are prone to poor outcomes. As a novel surrogate marker of insulin resistance, TyG index has been extensively used to predict the risk and severity of several diseases. It has been demonstrated that TyG index is a significant predictor for the risk of chronic non-communicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (7-10). As for infectious diseases, TyG index has been revealed to be closely associated with the severity of chronic hepatitis B and C, and directly correlated to the viral load of chronic hepatitis C (11, 12) . A recent study from China, which investigated the association between TyG index and COVID-19, showed that an increased level of TyG index is closely related to a higher incidence of severe COVID-19. In addition, TyG index could predict the mortality risk of patients with COVID-19 (13) . These studies suggest the great potential of TyG index to be served as a novel risk predictor for patients with infectious diseases. The present study, which first elucidated the predictive value of TyG index for in-hospital death in patients with SFTS, fills the gap of previous research in this field. The findings of this study provide a simple and accessible pathway for early identification of patients who are susceptible to develop adverse prognosis, which is of great clinical significance for customizing individualized intervention strategies that match the risk levels. Furthermore, a significant incremental effect on the prediction of in-hospital death emerged after introducing TyG index into a baseline model, such as risk factors identified by former authoritative study, indicating that TyG index may contribute more information to prognostic prediction on the basis of established risk factors.",

Since it has been extensively demonstrated that TyG index is a significant surrogate marker of insulin resistance, we hypothesized that the reason for the association may be attributed to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance plays a vital role in the development of dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia, which makes them the two most important hallmarks of insulin resistance. The formula of TyG index is composed of fasting FBG and TG, while recent evidence has proved that FBG and TG play important role in the progress of SFTS.",

Study has revealed that the plasma levels of glucagon, adrenaline, and glucocorticoid in patients with severe infections are significantly increased, which can further lead to disturbance of glucose metabolism characterized as significant decrease in insulin sensitivity and increase in blood glucose (21) . The increased level of blood glucose resulting from severe infections can activate inflammatory responses that cause deterioration of the disease. It has been demonstrated that the increased level of blood glucose promotes a sharp increase in the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and interleukin-18, and this effect was more pronounced in subjects with abnormal glucose tolerance (22) . Moreover, study has proved that the application of antioxidant glutathione can prevent the shortterm rise of inflammatory cytokines induced by hyperglycemia, suggesting that hyperglycemia might affect the concentration of cytokines through the oxidative mechanism. On the other hand, studies have confirmed that lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in viral lifecycle, such as replication, membrane homeostasis, endocytosis, and exocytosis (23, 24) . A recent study has proved that the synthesis pathway of cholesterol, fatty acids, and TG regulated by site-1 protease plays an important role in SFTSV replication and reproduction (25) , indicating that the excessive synthesis of lipid may be responsible for the increase in SFTSV replication. In vitro experiment confirmed that the replication of SFTSV in cells is significantly decreased after the treatment with lovastatin and fenofibrate, which inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol and TG, while distinctly increased after being introduced into an environment with a high level of TG, which may be an important explanation for the association of TG with adverse prognosis in patients with SFTS (25) .",

As the most significant pathogenesis of T2DM, it can be speculated that insulin resistance plays an important role in these processes. On the other hand, infection with a variety of viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (27) , hepatitis C virus (28), murine gamma herpesvirus 68 (29), may inversely cause or exacerbate insulin resistance, thus leading to a vicious cycle. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that insulin resistance is significantly associated with systemic inflammatory responses (30, 31) , which determine the severity and outcomes of infectious diseases. In general, since the current study is hypothesisgenerating, further research is required to explore the underlying pathophysiological process and mechanism mediating the association between TyG index and adverse prognosis of patients with SFTS.",
