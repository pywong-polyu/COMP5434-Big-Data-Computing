According to the World Health Organization (WHO), respiratory infectious diseases take first place in the ranking of the burden of disease measured by years lost through death or disability (disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)). Lower respiratory tract infections represent the third leading cause of death in the world, after cardiac and encephalic vascular illnesses; however, in countries of low economic status, they take first place. Many regional or global estimates have identified acute respiratory infections as a primary cause of ambulatory consultations, hospitalizations, and deaths. In Chile, they take second place and third place in the leading causes of death in children and adults, respectively. Furthermore, several studies point toward them as the main causes of ambulatory consultations and absentee-ism from both school and work. Their seasonal form of appearance and high infectivity place viruses as being responsible for the majority of acute respiratory infections. According to postneonatal mortality estimates, lower respiratory tract infections cause 20% of deaths, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus being most common (9.5%). Advances in viral diagnosis have confirmed the participation of viruses in respiratory pediatric pathology, with frequencies that go from more than 50% (if they compromise the lower respiratory tract) to 90% (if they affect the upper respiratory tract). In adults, the scenario of upper respiratory tract infections is similar, but in lower respiratory tract infections a predominance of bacterial etiologies has been described. However, application of molecular viral diagnosis shows significant participation of respiratory viruses in lower respiratory tract infections. This fact acquires more relevance when considering the aging of a population.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Respiratory Infections"}, {"text": "Several viruses are included in the group of \"respiratory viruses\" because they have the respiratory system as a target organ.

Some viruses tend to produce infections mainly in the upper respiratory tract (rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus), while others can similarly compromise the lower respiratory airways, with variable severity (adenovirus, RSV, metapneumovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza). In general, it is an accepted fact that any respiratory virus can compromise one or several levels of the respiratory system and cause clinical and subclinical infections, but there is a certain preference of viruses for compromising specific levels of the respiratory system (Table 28 .2). In this way, during an epidemic of a virus such as RSV or influenza, the major proportion of upper and lower respiratory tract infections will be caused by the prevalent virus. In addition, there will be an important incidence of subclinical infections, which act as efficient sources of transmission. As a result of herd immunity, important epidemics of multiple different viruses do not usually coexist in a community; instead, they alternate in terms of their presence in the community. For example, in Chile, the most commonly observed pattern involves parainfluenza outbreaks, followed by influenza outbreaks, and then RSV outbreaks;", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 696, "end": 705, "text": "(Table 28", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Viral Respiratory Infections"}, {"text": "later, during winter-spring, metapneumovirus appears.

The two kinds of respiratory virus that have the greatest impact on global health are RSV, which affects infants and elderly patients, and influenzas A and B, which compromise all of the population. Vaccines and Viral respiratory infections are a very good example of a model of acute viral infection, in which viruses affect the individual, with or without symptoms, and then they leave him or her within a period of days or weeks. The course of infection depends on the interaction of various factors depending on: (1) the human host: age, immune status (based on previous infections and vaccinations), activity, tobacco use, etc.; (2) the virus: infecting dose, type, serotype, and viral strain; and (3) the environment: season, weather, humidity, contamination, geographical location, rural/urban setting, hospital/community, etc. From the host standpoint, acute respiratory infections are more frequent in childhood, particularly in infants and children under 2 years old, who represent the group with the biggest serious risk.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 177, "text": "(Fig. 28.1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Viral Respiratory Infections"}, {"text": "Specific diagnosis of respiratory viruses is quite attainable nowadays because there are several immunodiagnostic techniques (immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunochromatography) available at public and private centers.

Use of antiallergics, antiinflammatories, steroids, bronchodilators, and prophylactic antibiotics is very controversial, and this is discussed in other chapters in this book.

RSV is the virus most responsible for this and usually coincides with influenza outbreaks. In addition, respiratory adenoviruses appear endemically, with unpredictable increases that can acquire relevance because of their clinical seriousness and propensity to cause inpatient infections at times of overload in hospitals. Despite prevention not being efficient and the fact that there is no specific treatment for respiratory viruses, health care (both public and private) can be organized for prevention of severe cases and deaths. RSV appears \"all winter\" and its outbreak lasts for 3-5 months. It has been estimated that 60% of children who are born are infected during the first year of life, and all children have had contact with it by their second year; 25-40% of primary infections evolve as acute lower respiratory tract infections, and 2% of them require hospitalization.
