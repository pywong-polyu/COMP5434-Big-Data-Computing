Therefore, spike protein plays a key role in virus entry and the beginning of the viral lifecycle. Accordingly, interruption in the interaction of these proteins with specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies can be a potential target for effective treatment against coronavirus infections. The neutralizing monoclonal antibodies either against ACE2 or receptor-binding domain (RBD) for SARS-CoV treatment can be helpful for SARS-CoV-2 [11] . With this in mind, Sui et al. in an in vitro study had reported 80 R scFv (single-chain variable fragment) is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds to S1 domain of S protein of SARS-CoV and prevents the interaction of the virus with host cells that was tested by microneutralization assay and in another study by Sui et al. had shown intraperitoneal (IP) of 80 R IgG1 injected to BALB/c mice 1 day before SARS-CoV intranasal challenge, and 80 R IgG1 inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV in lung tissue of mice and its And its prophylactic role was highlighted [12, 13] .",

Besides, Mulen J et al. reported the SARS-CoV can be neutralized via binding of CR3022 human IgG1 mAb to recombinant S1 fragment (amino acid residues 318-510) by in vitro study. Therefore, These mAbs inhibit the interaction of RBD with cellular receptor ACE2 through binding to the S1 subunit in SARS-CoV which indicated promising findings in vitro and in vivo studies which are probably going to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 [11, 15] . What's more, Wang et al. identified the human 47D11 IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by an in vitro study. 47D11 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 via blocking virus entry to host cells and protects of uninfected host cells as well as this mAb is useful for development serological assays for the detection of antigens which is related to SARS-CoV-2 [16] .",

Infected cells with SARS-CoV-2 release Interleukine-8 (IL-8) to infiltration of alveolar macrophages and mononuclear inflammatory cells to infected tissues, and then T and B lymphocytes responses are triggered. To that end, several signaling pathways play a key role to enhance inflammatory responses, such as Janus kinase transducers (JAK/STAT) that is led macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colonystimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). In COVID-19 patients, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with immune cell recruitment and then exaggerated inflammation, type II pnemocyte hyperplasia, hyaline membrane formation, and disease progression [18, 19] . Therefore, following lung tissue damage, increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines is seen in a majority of the COVID-19 patients. Elevated serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u0263, and CRP are detected in cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in patients with severe COVID-19 which in turn will cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure, the final result being death.

            "text": "At first Passive antibody therapy was developed in the 1890s and used for treating several infectious diseases until in the 1940s the antimicrobial therapy was generated. Convalescent plasma treatment is passive polyclonal antibody administration to supply immunity against viral infections and improves survival rate, which is called passive immunotherapy. Convalescent plasma therapy may provide an immunomodulatory effect via inhibition of macrophage activation and cytokine storm. Studies on sera of patients treated with COVID-19 have shown the presence of seropositive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum such as IgG, IgM, and IgA with varying sensitivities [25] . Furthermore, studies in monkeys showed that neutralizing antibodies are generated by the primary infection of SARS-CoV-2 that could protect monkeys from reinfection [26] . Similarly, recent studies showed that passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies from treated patients of SARS-COV to infected patients decreased viral load and mortality in patients [27] . Transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is suggested that use either as a therapy for patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or as prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19 disease in a high-risk population. However, most of the current clinical trial studies performed on adult patients with moderate COVID-19 disease who not required to hospitalization and severe COVID-19 disease who required mechanical ventilation [28] . Duan et al. had shown infusion of 200 ml of convalescent plasma containing viral neutralizing antibodies with titers more than 1:640 to 10 patients with COVID-19 improved their clinical symptoms and decreased CRP level in all patients [29] . Importantly, following the onset of COVID-19, antibodies appeared in sera with an average time of 12 and 14 days for IgM and IgG, respectively. The presence of antibodies in the first 7 days of the COVID-19 disease was less than 40%, then at day-15 following the onset of disease, titers of antibodies elevated to 79.8% and 94.3% for IgG and IgM, respectively. It should be mentioned that the third week after the onset of the disease is appropriate for collecting convalescent plasma with high titers containing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 [30] . This has been suggested that two units of 200-250 ml of ABOcompatible convalescent plasma be transferred to each patient weighing 50 and 80 kg at early-on, and up to day 10 after disease onset, and also infusion rate should be slow and under special care to identification adverse effects [27] . However, different doses, between 200-600 ml per adult patient, and times of COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion are under investigation in clinical trials. Likewise, most studies have suggested the use of 1-2 doses of 200 ml for severe COVID-19 patients, as well as the viremia peak, is observed at the first week of infection and is recommended the COVID-19 convalescent plasma has been better to use at early of disease before the innate immune cells migration and inflammatory cytokine storm starts. Several studies on using of convalescent plasma showed improving clinical symptoms such as reduced fever, reduced pulmonary lesions, improved lymphocyte count, decreased viral load and increased IgM, IgG and neutralizing antibody titers [28] .",
