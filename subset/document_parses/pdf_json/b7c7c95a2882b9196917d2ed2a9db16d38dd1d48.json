Here, we examined the extent to which being outdoors (vs. indoors), the experience of loneliness, and screen-time are associated with emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic using an experiencing sampling method. In April 2020, Austrian adults (N = 286, age M = 31.0 years) completed a 21-day experience sampling phase in which they reported their emotional well-being (i.e., happiness), whether they were indoors or outdoors, and loneliness at three random timepoints each day, as well as their daily screen-time. Results indicated that being outdoors was associated with higher emotional well-being, whereas greater loneliness and greater daily screen-time were associated with poorer well-being. Additionally, the impact of loneliness on well-being was weaker when participants were outdoors than indoors. These results have health policy implications for the promotion of population well-being during pandemics.",

In Austria, where the present study was conducted, 16,300 individuals had tested positive for COVID-19 and 630 had died as of 20th of May, 2020 (Ministry of Social Affairs 2020). To limit the spread of the coronavirus, the Austrian government announced a nationwide restriction on outdoor activities on March 16, with individuals only allowed to leave the home under specific conditions. While these prevention measures can be effective against disease transmission [e.g. (Tian et al. 2020) ], the impact of lockdowns-and the resulting changes in behaviour patterns and functioning-on emotional well-being is likely to be substantive (Fiorilo and Gorwood 2020; Galea et al. 2020; Swami et al. 2021; Torales et al. 2020) . Indeed, emerging evidence from other nations indicates that lockdown measures have led to increases in depressive symptoms, anxiety, and severe stress [e.g., (Gao et al. 2020; Newby et al. 2020; Qiu et al. 2020; Tull et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020) ; for a review, see (Brooks et al. 2020)] , which is consistent with the findings of earlier studies on the psychological consequences of other pandemics [e.g., (Hawryluck et al. 2004; Wheaton et al. 2012)] .",

One of the most important factors that is likely to have an impact on emotional well-being under conditions of lockdown is the ability to go outdoors. Under normal circumstances, there is a wealth of evidence showing that being outdoors is associated with wide-ranging positive outcomes in terms of emotional well-being [for reviews, see (Bowler et al. 2010; Collado et al. 2017; Frumkin et al. 2017; Hartig et al. 2014; Kondo et al. 2018; Bosch and Bird 2018) ]. Under conditions of social distancing, where outdoor recreation is severely reduced and restricted [(Rice et al. 2020) ; for Austrian data, see (Google 2020) ], the ability to spend time outdoors is likely to take on added importance vis-\u00e0-vis emotional wellbeing (Burtscher et al. 2020) . Indeed, there is some evidence from Europe that the public are more aware of the importance of spending time in natural environments during the COVID-19 pandemic (Rousseau and Deschacht 2020) and that being outdoors was associated with significantly higher positive affect and lower negative feelings (Lades et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "Another important consideration under conditions of physical and social distancing that may impact emotional well-being is the experience of loneliness (Banerjee and Rai 2020; Tull et al. 2020) , which can be defined as the negative emotional state that derives from a subjective perception of deficiencies in one's social relationships (Russell et al. 1984) . That is, under conditions of social distancing, individuals are likely to reduce the number of others with whom they have regular contact both physically (i.e., physical separation from others) and socially (i.e., limited social interaction with others), which heightens feelings of loneliness (2020). In turn, loneliness is a known risk factor for poorer emotional well-being [e.g., (Cuenya et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 2007) ], particularly when periods of isolation are prolonged (Stickley and Koyanagi 2016) . Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that greater loneliness was significantly associated with greater anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020; Losada-Baltar et al. 2020; Okruszek et al. 2020; Palgi et al. 2020) . However, the impact of physical and social distancing on loneliness is likely to be complicated by age: while older adults have been identified as being particularly at risk for loneliness under conditions of social distancing (Berg-Weger and Morley 2020; Patel and Clark-Ginsberg 2020), the evidence from Spain and the United States indicates that it was in fact younger respondents who reported greater loneliness (Losada-Baltar et al. 2020; Luchetti et al. 2020) .",

This is important because increased screen-time may interfere with face-to-face social interactions and thereby increase feelings of loneliness, with upstream negative impacts on emotional wellbeing [for a meta-analysis, see (Huang 2017)] . It is also possible that increased screentime interferes with outdoor recreation (Wen et al. 2009 ), which in turn limits opportunities for promoting well-being. However, outside conditions of social distancing, studies examining associations between screen-time and emotional well-being have been equivocal at best, with some studies reporting that increased screen-time is associated with poorer well-being, others reporting small, positive effects on mental health (particularly when used to facilitate direct social interactions with peers), and yet others reporting no significant associations [for a review, see (Odgers and Jensen 2020) ]. However, much of the evidence base is limited to adolescents and children and there is little research on the impact of screen-time on emotional well-being under conditions of lockdown (Hamilton et al. 2020) , particularly as patterns of screen usage may be more variable during this period (e.g., screen-time may also facilitate social interactions with others). Preliminary evidence suggests equivocal relationships between screen-time and emotional well-being: data from China suggests that screen-time was not significantly associated with positive or negative affect (Qin et al. 2020) , whereas data from Canada indicates that increased screen-time was associated with poorer self-rated mental health (Colley et al. 2020) . It is also possible that increased screen-time under conditions of social distancing will be associated with lower levels of loneliness (Pancani et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "While the review above suggests that there are likely to be several major factors influencing emotional well-being under conditions of social distancing, a number of limitations of existing research are noteworthy. First, previous studies have tended to examine the aforementioned factors in isolation, which precludes the possibility of considering and examining interactionist effects. Second, many previous studies-and especially studies on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic-have typically utilised cross-sectional data. This is important because cross-sectional research relies on retrospective assessments that may be subject to recall biases and because it is unable to provide moment-to-moment assessments of psychological well-being (Ellison et al. 2020) . In contrast, the experience sampling method (ESM; also referred to as ecological momentary assessment or ambulatory assessment) affords an ideal research tool for examining such effects as they occur in individuals' everyday lives (Bolger and Laurenceau 2013; Mehl and Conner 2012) . In ESM research, respondents are asked to complete brief surveys on multiple, semi-random occasions throughout the day over a period of time. As such, ESM is able to generate intensive longitudinal data in a manner not possible with traditional cross-sectional research (Bolger and Laurenceau 2013) , which in turn could provide a more complete accounting of changes to psychological well-being under conditions of lockdown. Indeed, researchers have called for ESM studies to better understand the impact of lockdown on mental health (Horesh and Brown 2020) . To our knowledge, however, only two studies have used ESM to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic so far: both studies reported that the pandemic had adverse effects on mental health (e.g., increased anxiety and symptoms of depression), but were limited to university students (Fried et al. 2020; Huckins et al. 2020 ).",

Here, we present the results of an ESM study conducted in April 2020 in Austria, during which time citizens were required to maintain social distancing and were only allowed to leave the home under specific conditions (i.e., essential professional activities, shopping for necessities, assisting other people, and outdoor activities either alone or in the company of others from the same household). More specifically, using an ESM study design, we examined the impact that being outdoors versus indoors, the experience of loneliness, and screen-time had on a facet of emotional well-being, namely subjective happiness. Based on the review above, we hypothesised that being outdoors would be associated with higher well-being, whereas experiencing greater loneliness and greater screen-time would be associated with lower well-being. For exploratory purposes-and given that existing research has thus far treated these factors in isolation-we also examined interactive effects of all three variables on psychological well-being, as well as interactive effects with age. Finally, given the uniqueness of these data, we also report on prospective changes in well-being, loneliness, and screen-time over the study period.",

            "text": "In the present study, we used an ESM design to examine the impact of theorised antecedents on emotional well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. In broad outline, our findings were consistent with our hypotheses: over the 21-day period of the study, being outdoors rather than indoors was associated with higher emotional well-being, whereas greater loneliness and greater screen-time were both associated with poor wellbeing, respectively. For exploratory purposes, we also examined interactive effects of being outdoors, loneliness, screen-time, and participant age on emotional well-being, but effects were generally null (with the exception of the interaction between loneliness and being outdoors). The novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic and attendant measures to reduce the transmission of the coronavirus, as well as specific study elements (e.g., conditions of restriction on outdoor activities in Austria, the time-frame of the present study) make it difficult to compare our findings with previous research and to generalise broadly. Nevertheless, based on our findings, we highlight a number of key implications. First, we found that being outdoors was associated with higher emotional well-being, which is consistent with pre-pandemic research on the benefits of being outdoors for mental health [for reviews, see (Bowler et al. 2010; Collado et al. 2017; Frumkin et al. 2017; Hartig et al. 2014; Kondo et al. 2018 ; van den Bosch and Bird 2018)]. As various authors have speculated, the ability and opportunity to spend time outdoors may be especially important under conditions of lockdown and social-distancing (Burtscher et al. 2020; Samuelsson et al. 2020 ). Our results provide empirical evidence for these claims [see also (Lades et al. 2020) ] and, although we were not able to examine whether specific outdoor environments were particularly crucial, it seems likely that being outdoors provides a myriad of opportunities for improvements to emotional well-being. These may include opportunities to physically and psychologically escape from the stressors of household confinement (e.g., lack of personal space, boredom), maintain some social relationships and improve social capital, engage in physical activity, develop a sense of connection with the world outside [for a review, see (Samuelsson et al. 2020) ]. Of course, being outdoors presents its own risks in terms of limiting the spread of viruses [e.g., due to overcrowding in high-traffic zones; (Public Health England 2014)], but these risks can be managed through effective risk-minimisation strategies [for a review in relation to COVID-19, see (Freeman and Eykelbosh 2020) ].",

This finding is consistent both with research conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic indicating that loneliness is a key risk factor for poorer emotional well-being [e.g., (Cuenya et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 2007 )], as well as cross-sectional data from other nations during the pandemic (2020; Losada-Baltar et al. 2020; Okruszek et al. 2020; Palgi et al. 2020) . It is also consistent with our finding that participants reported very few known and unknown others in the vicinity during the daily assessments; that is, under conditions of physical and social distancing, it is not surprising that participants were generally away from others (although it should be noted that we were not able to compare these descriptive data with pre-pandemic levels), which may heighten feelings of loneliness (2020) that, in turn, contribute to poorer well-being. Beyond this main effect, two further findings are worth highlighting vis-\u00e0-vis loneliness. First, in contrast to some recent commentary [emphasising the impact of older age on loneliness; (Berg-Weger and Morley 2020; Patel and Clark-Ginsberg 2020)] and cross-sectional findings [where younger participants reported feeling lonelier; (Losada-Baltar et al. 2020; Luchetti et al. 2020 )], we did not find that participant age interacted with loneliness to impact well-being. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the association between loneliness and well-being was stronger when indoors, which again highlights the benefits of being outdoors.",

Interestingly, the effect of screen-time on well-being was not indirectly influenced by loneliness or being outdoors in shaping well-being. Explaining this effect is difficult in the absence of additional data on screen usage, but it might be speculated that screen-time is a proxy for exposure to potentially stressful coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic [see (Huckins et al. 2020) ], which could heighten distress [for prepandemic findings, see (Pfefferbaum et al. 2014; Vance et al. 2018) ]. Another possibility is that our measure of screen-time captured both leisure and non-leisure (e.g., for work, studying) screen activities, and that a detrimental effect of the latter outweighs any positive effect of using screens for leisure (e.g., communicating with others, relaxation). It is also worth noting that, in our correlational analyses, greater screen-time was significantly associated with higher loneliness, which suggests that-under conditions of lockdownscreen-time per se may not necessarily be an effective means of buffering against feelings of isolation.",

Although these findings should be interpreted with caution (e.g., we do not have comparable pre-pandemic data), our analyses indicated that, over the course of the study, there was a small improvement in emotional well-being-with a peak on Easter Monday and a smaller peak following the relaxation of lockdown conditions. Our results also showed that there was a small decrease in feelings of loneliness over the course of the study, which is similar to the ESM findings of Fried and colleagues (2020) with Dutch university students. In explaining their findings, Fried and colleagues (2020) speculated that feeling part of a broader community may have improved over time, which contributed to decreased loneliness, and that their participants may have learned over time how to develop or maintain more meaningful social relationships while under lockdown. While certainly interesting, we would nevertheless caution against strong interpretations of our findings in this regard, particularly as variations in well-being and loneliness over time were small.",

However, because of our recruitment method (i.e., convenience sampling), our sample should not be considered representative of the Austrian population, which limits the generalisability of our findings. In a similar vein, caution should be exercised when comparing the results of the present study to other ESM studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (Fried et al. 2020; Huckins et al. 2020) , not least because of differences in the extent and practicalities of lockdown mandates across nations and differences in the time-course of the pandemic across nations. In terms of the latter, it should be noted that our study began about two weeks after the start of the nationwide lockdown in Austria. Because we do not have pre-lockdown data, it is difficult to know to extent the present findings truly reflect altered behavioural and affective patterns as a result of the lockdown. That is, although our descriptive data are in line with expectations (e.g., participants reported being around very few known and unknown others at the time of assessments), 3 we cannot be absolutely certain that similar effects would not have been found pre-pandemic.",

For example, because we measured being outdoors with a single item, we are unable to determine the specific types of outdoor environments that had the strongest effects on emotional well-being [for an example of how this might be achieved in future ESM research, see (Stieger et al. 2020)] or whether fine-grained environmental conditions affected well-being [e.g., weather, altitude; for an example, see (Stieger and Reips 2019) ]. Another limitation of our measure of being outdoors was that we did not measure the type of activity that was conducted when outdoors. This is important because it is possible that being outdoors is confounded with being physical active. Indeed, emerging research suggests that Austrians were less physically active during the lockdown (Schnitzer et al. 2020) and that being physically active during the pandemic is associated with more positive psychological well-being (P\u0142omecka et al. 2020) . In particular, we cannot rule out the possibility that participants were more physically active while outdoors and/or more sedentary while indoors, although we also have no reason to believe that merely being physically active should dramatically alter the nature of our findings.",

Different modalities of screen-time may also be related to different uses, such as relaxation, reading news (including COVID-19-related news), school or university lessons, and interacting with others. Although our method of assessing screen-time is similar to other research conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic [e.g., (Xiang et al. 2020) ], the use of a single-item measure of screen-time focused on duration of use limits the conclusions that can be drawn on the basis of our results.

The latter includes facets relating to psychological well-being [i.e., the challenges that individuals face as they strive to realise their unique talents; (Ryff 1989; Ryff and Keyes 1995) ] and social well-being [i.e., the degree to which individuals are functioning well in the social realm; (Keyes 1998) ]. As such, future research could build on the present work by incorporating assessing of emotional, psychological, and social facets of well-being [e.g., (Keyes et al. 2008) ]. Doing so is likely to provide a more holistic index of the degree to which an individual is flourishing in life (Keyes 2002) and would represent a fuller account of experiences of positive mental health during pandemics.",

Secondly, our data show that being outdoors was associated with higher emotional well-being and also mitigated some of the deleterious effects of loneliness. These findings, particularly the indication that being outdoors is important in terms of well-being, may have important practical and health policy implications. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to involve multiple waves that may require new social distancing mandates, public health policies that effectively utilise outdoor spaces as part of systemic decisionmaking may bring benefits in terms of population well-being. Of course, the effectiveness of outdoor spaces at promoting well-being will depend on how well they are integrated with other prevention policies, such as those aimed at reducing the experience of loneliness and minimising screen-time.",
