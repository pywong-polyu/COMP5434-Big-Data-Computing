Covid-19 Patients were included if they were older than 60 years or fulfilled at least one of the following conditions: pre-existing disease (cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunologic), obesity (BMI >35), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, active malignancy, or pregnancy. Findings 153 patients (median age 59 years, 77 female) were included. Patients were monitored for 9 days (median, IQR 6-13 days) with a daily monitoring time of 13.3 hours (median, IQR 9.4-17.0 hours). 20 patients were referred to the clinic by the Telecovid team. 3 of these required intensive care without invasive ventilation, 4 with invasive ventilation, 1 of the latter died.

Therefore, we sought a device that allows for robust recording of the PPG signal. We decided in favour of the in-ear device cosinuss\u02daOne, manufactured by Cosinuss GmbH, Munich, Germany. The necessary in ear devices were purchased; the company had no further involvement in our study. The advantage of the in-ear device is its position in the external ear canal which provides protection from disturbing stray light and a relatively stable position for the sensor (Fig 1) . Besides that, the body temperature can be reliably taken in the external ear canal. The handling of the device is simple, similar to that of a hearing aid and is therefore also well suited for older, technically inexperienced patients.",
