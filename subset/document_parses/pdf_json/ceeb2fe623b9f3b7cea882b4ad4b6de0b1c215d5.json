Clinical reports with longer follow-up are lacking. A retrospective search was performed for severe COVID-19 (hospital admission and/or mortality) one year after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in an IBD cohort from one of the most affected Dutch regions. Cohort characteristics were explored by value-based healthcare data, including immunotherapy. COVID-19 cases were detected by ICD-10 codes and further examined for IBD determinants (including medication) and COVID-19 characteristics (intensive care admission, respiratory support, treatment, mortality). The national mortality register was consulted, ensuring detection of patients that died without admission. Results were compared with regional and national general population registries. The IBD cohort consisted of 1453 patients (51% Crohn's disease, 54% women, 39.9% using immunotherapy), including children. Biologics use increased during the study. Eight cases (0.55%) had severe COVID-19: seven were hospitalized (0.48%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-1.04), and two died (0.14%, CI 0.002-0.55). Six patients had comorbidity, one used immunotherapy, and four had no medication. Both deceased patients were older than 80 years, had severe comorbidity, but used no immunotherapy. Hospitalization occurred significantly more in the IBD cohort than regionally (0.18%, CI 0.17-0.19, p = 0.015), but not significantly more than nationally (0.28%, CI 0.279-0.284). Mortality was equal in IBD patients, regionally (0.11%, CI 0.10-0.12) and nationally (0.13%, CI 0.125-0.128). Neither IBD nor immunosuppressants are associated with increased risks of severe COVID-19 in an observational study with one-year follow-up.",

            "text": "Several mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are important to understand the possible interaction with IBD. At first, SARS-CoV-2 binds to target cells via surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are extensively present on epithelial cells in the lungs, kidneys, vessels and in the terminal ileum and colon [8, 9] . SARS-CoV-2 down-regulates ACE2, increasing angiotensin II levels, which lead to organ injury, inflammation or oxidative stress and multi-organ failure [8] . Secondly, coronaviruses fuse with the host cell by spike protein activation, which is mediated by host cell proteases [10] . Also, natural killer cells (NK) are important in the hyperinflammatory cytokine response that is seen in severe COVID-19 presentations [10] . At last, the gut microbiota may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specific microbiome patterns have been associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity due to upregulation of ACE-receptors [8, 11] . Also, the virus itself affects the gut microbiota, which play an important role in general host immunology but also in susceptibility for respiratory infections via the gut-lung axis [11, 12] . Several clinical trials have been initiated to examine the therapeutic options of microbiota in COVID-19 [12] .",

Nevertheless, in March 2020 some reports mentioned that IBD patients were hardly seen in hospitals in outbreak regions, suggesting some protective effect of immunosuppressants [18, 19] . Gradually, more articles were published, either about theoretical mechanisms of action or clinical experiences, but only about small cohorts or a short follow-up of 4 months after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [10, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .

Undetermined colitis (IBD-U) has no specific financial code and is registered as 601 or 602. Two specific time intervals were chosen: one year prior to February 28, 2020, and one year before February 28, 2021, covering the first year after the first detected COVID-19 case in the Netherlands at February 27, 2020. The registration of this specific IBD financial declaration code indicates that an individual patient has undergone at least one IBD-related consultation in the last year before a specific time point. Therefore, possibly deceased patients were also detected by these searches covering two consecutive years. The cohort was examined for age, gender and IBD type, and a cross-sectional measurement of prescribed immunotherapy and mesalamine was performed at both time points using value-based healthcare data. Then, IBD patients with COVID-19-related admission were identified by combining the financial codes 601 and 602 with thesaurus code 0,000,093,409, 0,000,093,408 or 0,000,093,442, which define (suspicion on) acute respiratory illness by SARS-CoV-2 or gastro-enteritis due to COVID-19, referring to ICD-10 codes U07.1 and Z03.8. At last, a search for IBD patients that died in the same time period without hospital admission was performed in the national Basic Register of Persons (BRP) for deceased inhabitants [26] .",

For instance, in retirement and nursing homes COVID-19-associated mortality has been underestimated in the beginning of the pandemic, which is also reflected in the excess overall mortality in the Netherlands compared to other years.

Although our study was not designed to examine causality, some hypothetical answers may be given, based on the article by Neurath that was already published in May 2020 [12] . This describes SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms, including the important role of ACE2, ACE2 receptors and cytokines, the analogy of those with IBD and, finally, effects of several immunosuppressants on both in detail. It suggests that IBD itself could be protective because increased expression of soluble ACE2 in this disease may result in a competitive binding partner for SARS-CoV. Thereby virus particles are sequestrated, preventing their binding to the cellular fulllength ACE2 protein [6, 19] . Also its influence on ACE2 plays an important role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), regulating the balance between proinflammatory effects that lead to tissue damage and even multi-organ failure and on the other hand anti-inflammatory pathways controlling tissue protection [12] .",

At first, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which is an important target in biologic therapy in IBD, regulates the cleavage of membrane ACE2. Also, NK cells which are important in the hyperinflammatory cytokines response in severe COVID-19 presentations, are crucial in IBD [12, 14, 20, 22] . These cells and cytokines are suppressed by immunomodulators and biologics, tempering COVID-19 course with less auto-destruction of pulmonary cells. Potential therapeutic effects of dexamethasone and tocilizumab on COVID-19 underline this protective theory [32, 33] . These were also given to all six recovered patients from our cohort (dexamethasone), including the ICU-admitted case (tocilizumab). It is still unclear whether immunosuppressants have different effects at specific stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection: corticosteroids are considered a worse factor in infection, but seem helpful in decreasing the hyperinflammatory reaction in severe COVID-19 [32] .",

Thus, severe COVID-19 was only found in one of 580 patients (0.17%) using immunotherapy. Our findings contradict the conclusions of the SECURE-IBD registry that warned for worse outcomes of COVID-19-related to combined immunotherapy, thiopurines and even mesalamine [25] . This international digital registry, based on voluntary registration of COVID-19 cases, is, however, influenced by reporting, testing and selection bias as discussed recently [34] . This is illustrated by the high percentage of reported COVID-19 needing ICU admission (18%), the high overall mortality rate (3.4%) and large amount of TNF-antagonists (39%) in reported cases, suggesting that milder cases were under-reported. The registry also describes only 3 months in the spring of 2020 and does not provide information about cohort characteristics wherefrom these patients come, such as age distribution and immunotherapy. In our CHE-IBD cohort mesalamine was only used by two severe COVID-19 cases, out of 446 mesalamine users (0.45%).",

The first suggestions from the clinical field that neither IBD nor immunotherapy is risk factor for severe COVID-19 came from the early outbreak regions in China and Italy: no IBD patients were reported [1, 18, 20] . Consequently, larger cohort-studies showed that neither IBD nor immunosuppression is risk factor for severe COVID-19 [23, 24, 35, 36] . Derikx et al. described 0.18% hospitalization and 0.037% mortality in approximately 35.000 Dutch IBD patients, versus 0.085% and 0.045% in the general population [23] . Because of the short study interval of only four months, these findings are not comparable with our data. Also the percentage of this cohort that used immunosuppressive therapy was not described. Thiopurines and biologic agents were used in 24% and 17% of reported severely affected cases, respectively. A Danish study reported 0.10% admission and 0.022% mortality in approximately 18.000 IBD patients, versus 0.019% mortality in the general population in the first 4 months of the outbreak [24] . This study also included other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and factors such as mental well-being, which distract from the main message that neither IBD nor immunosuppressants are risk factors for severe COVID-19. A cross-sectional study from Spain showed no greater severity of COVID-19 in IBD patients, but not all (87%) patients from the rather small cohort of 923 individuals were included [35] . However, this study described only a few months of the beginning of the pandemic. In a North American study, the prevalence of COVID-19 was equal in IBD patients and the general population [36] . Immunosuppressives, which were used in 37% of patients, were no risk factor. This study also had a short follow-up, as it was already published in May 2020.",

Nevertheless, recent international and governmental advices still mention increased risks of IBD patients, especially when using immunotherapy, for example in guidelines about vaccination of IBD patients by BSG, Dutch RIVM and a review on immunology in COVID-19 and IBD [29, 39, 40] . These differences in advices and publications confuse patients and gastroenterologists. Our study demonstrates that IBD patients, even when using immunotherapy, should not be worried more than other people for SARS-CoV-2 infections and severe COVID-19.",

The characteristics of the CHE-IBD cohort are representative for common daily practice. Besides, the CHE-IBD cohort is situated in one of the most corona-affected regions in the Netherlands. Moreover, characteristics are well documented, including immunosuppressive therapy, by using value-based healthcare data. Determining the cohort by two measurements with a one-year interval is another strength, ensuring maximal inclusion. An extra search in the national mortality registry made sure no deaths were missed.",

Also, it is unclear how many CHE-IBD patients were SARS-CoV-2 infected: testing capacity was scarce in the beginning, and out-of-hospital PCR tests are not reported to the hospitals centrally; therefore, mild COVID-19 patients could not be examined. Our findings might suggest that patients have been extra careful, especially in the beginning of the outbreak: all severe cases were affected in the second outbreak. Also, patients may have been admitted to another hospital for COVID-19. This risk seems only small, because patients are well informed to contact us in case of fever or illness, especially when using immunotherapy. CHE admission capacity was limited in the first outbreak until June 2020, but during the whole period it was possible to admit severely ill patients. Also, IBD patients with immunosuppression are checked in the outpatient clinic every 3-6 months, and no other patients than the described eight cases have reported admission elsewhere, while several cases mentioned SARS-CoV-2 positivity with only mild complaints. Finally, regional and national mortality have been under-registered, especially for mortality outside the hospital. This strengthens the conclusion of our findings even more, whereas the CHE-IBD hospitalization and mortality rates are accurate.",
