Here we present SARSeq, saliva analysis by RNA sequencing, a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses on tens of thousands of samples in parallel. SARSeq relies on next generation sequencing of multiple amplicons generated in a multiplexed RT-PCR reaction. Two-dimensional, unique dual indexing, using four indices per sample, enables unambiguous and scalable assignment of reads to individual samples. We calibrate SARSeq on SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA, virions, and hundreds of human samples of various types. Robustness and sensitivity were virtually identical to quantitative RT-PCR. Double-blinded benchmarking to gold standard quantitative-RT-PCR performed by human diagnostics laboratories confirms this high sensitivity. SARSeq can be used to detect Influenza A and B viruses and human rhinovirus in parallel, and can be expanded for detection of other pathogens. Thus, SARSeq is ideally suited for differential diagnostic of infections during a pandemic.",

While the world awaits widespread vaccination and effective antiviral therapies, several measures can prevent spread of the virus. Social distancing and more strict \"lockdown\" strategies are effective in containment but have a major negative impact on human well-being 2, 3 . Therefore, the limited and directed application of such measures is desirable. Molecular testing for the presence of the virus by contact tracing and widespread surveillance of asymptomatic individuals, in particular for system relevant institutions and vulnerable person groups, can identify infection clusters and provide the information needed for directed quarantine or other containment measures [4] [5] [6] . Such massive testing has shown tremendous impact on containment of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Slovakia [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

            "text": "Several methods have been put forward for assessing infection status, which fall into two categories: the ones that detect viral proteins (so-called antigen tests) typically from swabs, and those that detect the presence of viral RNA from swabs, pharyngeal lavage (gargle), sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, or saliva samples [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Antigen tests facilitate some aspects of the logistics of mass testing and have recently proven useful in a country-wide effort in Slovakia 18 . However, their detection limit is typically hundreds of thousands of molecules per assay, which is borderline sensitivity to detect infectious individuals (1-10 million viral particles per swab) 19, 20 . Moreover, antigen test development is time consuming and therefore does not represent a first-line strategy for future epidemic or pandemic outbreaks. Tests for the viral RNA typically rely on the detection of characteristic fragments of the viral genome or transcripts by reverse transcription (RT) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and thereby offer higher sensitivity than antigen tests. They can also be rapidly adapted to new targets, SARS-CoV-2-specific qPCR assays for example were available already in January 2020 21 . Given that PCR reactions can amplify unspecific fragments despite the use of specific primer pairs (incorrect amplicons), widely used qPCR tests for COVID-19 use fluorescently labeled probes that signal the presence and abundance of sequencematching amplicons only. This typically means that one or a few (2) (3) amplicons can be detected per reaction, and that specific light cyclers are needed that can perform both PCR and fluorescence measurements. The scalability of such a method is limited by cost and equipment availability-primarily light cyclers.",

In addition to detecting multiple fragments in parallel, individual samples can be uniquely labeled with characteristic sequence-identifiers, i.e., indices, to allow for pooled sequencing and subsequent computational deconvolution, directly obtaining a sample-specific readout. The advantages of detecting multiple pathogen amplicons per sample and processing tens of thousands of samples in parallel mean that NGSbased protocols offer huge cost-saving potential and are thus highly attractive for large-scale testing.",

In this work, we describe SARSeq (saliva analysis by RNA sequencing), a robust high-throughput protocol that overcomes these challenges by optimization of the initial sample conditions, a two-step endpoint RT-PCR, NGS-compatible amplicons with mutually compatible sets of primers, and a barcoding strategy that achieves perfect sample-recall by redundant dual indexing while scaling to tens of thousands of samples by combinatorial indexing along two dimensions. We apply this protocol to samples with synthetic RNAs and various different patient samples and demonstrate that it extends to the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and human rhinoviruses (HRV) from the same sample in a single experiment. Overall, our pipeline can be efficiently combined with highthroughput sample collection in 96-well formats, robotics and NGS to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens in tens of thousands of samples per experiment with a turnaround time of about 1 day (Fig. 1A) .",

The first step toward establishing a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 test was to find sample preparation methods that would bypass the costly and time-consuming steps of swabbing by medical staff and RNA purification from patient samples, while being compatible with RT-PCR. A number of sample types have been effectively used to detect SARS-CoV-2, including swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM) or other buffers, saliva, and gargle with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) or saline solutions [13] [14] [15] 17 . Gargle samples are a less invasive collection type, do not require medical staff, and show similar sensitivity to swabs collected by medical staff 15 . They are preferred to pure saliva as samples become more uniform in viscosity and are thus easier to pipette, a prerequisite for automation (Fig. 1A) . Such samples, however, pose the challenge that exposure of viral or cellular RNA for RT must occur under strict inhibition of the high load of RNAses present in saliva 28 . A number of methods have been reported to expose and simultaneously stabilize RNA in these samples, including heat inactivating at 95\u00b0C 22 , treating with proteinase K 17 , and mixing with TCEP/EDTA 29, 30 or with QuickExtract solution 31 . To compare these methods, we obtained gargle samples (in HBSS) from one negative and two SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, and either purified RNA or treated the gargle according to the different protocols. We then assessed RNA exposure and stability by performing TaqMan RT-qPCR of a virus-specific amplicon (N1) (Fig. 1B) . All the methods generated stable RNA while maintaining similar sensitivity to purified RNA under our reaction conditions. We also tested QuickExtract and TCEP/ EDTA on swab samples in VTM, in experiments that are described below. In these tests, QuickExtract showed the least precipitation upon heating to 95\u00b0C and was thus used for most experiments unless otherwise stated. Our results are consistent with several other reports that RNA purification is not required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, enabling highthroughput downstream applications.",

However, we found that having primers with the required extensions during the RT step resulted in a large fraction of non-specific PCR products, presumably because the low temperature of the RT reaction allows substantial non-specific priming (Fig. 1D) . Given the large but limited sequence space on NGS flow cells, such lack of specificity means that many more reads would be needed per sample, limiting scalability to large sample numbers. We therefore chose a two-step reaction in which priming in the RT step is performed with random hexamers plus two gene-specific 12-mers that increase sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B) , while integration of the sample indices occurs during the PCR.

Diagnostic RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 reports differences in Ct values of up to 25 cycles, which translate into 2 25 = 33.5 million-fold differences in viral titers. Therefore, if samples with low virus titer are to be robustly identified as positive, e.g., with >100 virusderived amplicon reads, the samples with high virus titers would require 3.3 \u00d7 10 9 reads, which is prohibitive. For that reason, the dynamic range needs to be compressed to \"dampen\" the signals from highly positive samples while providing sufficient sensitivity to detect samples with lower titers. Of note, methods in which samples are indexed during RT (Fig. 1C ) followed by PCR on pooled cDNA samples would also maintain these quantitative differences, which is not desired for this application 26 . To achieve this compression, we ran the PCR reaction on individual samples for 45 cycles, until they reached saturation. This generated similar numbers of amplicons per well independent of initial viral titer (Fig. 1D , E and Supplementary Fig. 1C ). In summary, using crude respiratory specimens as input, a two-step endpoint RT-PCR generates high specificity and uniform representation of correct amplicons across samples and enables pooling of many samples for analysis by NGS.",

In addition to the very large dynamic range of viral titers between patients, non-specific PCR amplicons can impair the detection of viral amplicons by NGS, because the number of NGS reads is inherently limited (and directly proportional to the total costs). For example, the parallel analysis of~40,000 (96 \u00d7 384) samples means that each sample can receive a total of~500 reads on a MiSeq,~2000 reads on a HiSeq, and~10,000 reads on a NextSeq platform.

A Overview scheme to illustrate the envisioned analysis pipeline. B Comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 detection by TaqMan RT-qPCR on the N1 amplicon, following different sample preparation treatments. Gargle samples from two SARS-CoV-2-positive and one negative person were collected in HBSS. RNA was purified or crude lysates were produced using either heat inactivation for 30 min 22 , TCEP/EDTA (HUDSON buffer) 29, 30 , or QuickExtract 31 . Equivalent amounts of each treated samples were incubated overnight at room temperature or on ice to assess stability. Data are plotted as mean and SD of three replicates for each positive sample; n = 1 for each condition for the negative sample. C Illustration of amplicon indexing either during RT or PCR. Colored boxes symbolize different indices that label individual samples for identification by sequencing (by NGS). Arrows illustrate oligonucleotide hybridization to RNA during RT or DNA in PCR. D Comparison of amplicon levels measured by NGS after indexing either during RT or PCR. Amplicon-specific primers carrying extensions that contain the sample indices (\"long primers\") were either included as RT primers (indexing during RT) or used only in the PCR step (indexing during PCR); in the latter case, RT was performed with a mix of random hexamers and two N gene-specific primers (\"short primers\") ( Supplementary Fig. 1 would be severely impacted. It is thus pivotal to select amplicons and primer pairs that (i) show high sensitivity, (ii) generate amplicons of comparable short size, and (iii) generate few nonspecific amplicons alone or in combination with any other primer present in the same reaction, which is of particular importance when using primers with long extensions (here: up to 42 nucleotides as PCR primers contain sample-identifying index sequences, staggers of random nucleotides, and primer binding sites for a second PCR as discussed below). We thus tested several published SARS-CoV-2-specific primer pairs 21,34-36 after adding our index-containing extensions ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). We settled on the N gene-specific primer pairs N1 and N3 proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as they produce an ideal amplicon length of 70 bp, performed very well in qPCR with detection by fluorescent stain (which does not control for amplicon identity) and showed good specificity in sequencing runs ( Supplementary  Fig. 2 ). Of note, other primer pairs with good specificity and sensitivity might be useful for parallel or backup detection strategies. We then tested the N1 amplicon together with the widely used internal control primer pair targeting RPP30 (coding for RNAse P). While the N1 primers showed up to 50% of correct amplicons, in correlation with the amount of synthetically spiked in template, the fraction of specific amplicons for RPP30 was only 0.06-1.5% ( Supplementary Fig. 3A ). When analyzing all sequenced amplicons across all samples shown in Supplementary  Fig. 3A , we detected various short sequences that together made up >99% of all NGS reads. The vast majority was generated by the RPP30-specific primers ( Supplementary Fig. 3B ), suggesting that these primers are not compatible with our multiplexed PCR and NGS setup. We therefore set out to establish a new control primer pair that would produce fewer non-specific amplicons. We tested several primer pairs on gargle samples obtained from 16 individuals, yet only a single primer pair, specific for 18S ribosomal RNA, was detected in all samples and showed a strong dependency on the presence of reverse transcriptase (Supplementary Fig. 3C ). Ribosomal amplicons were detected at Ct values of 15-45, a range comparable to that of viral amplicons in infected individuals. Upon further optimization of RT-and PCRbuffers (see Methods), we tested ribosomal RNA as a host control in combination with N1 primers. Under these conditions, the ribosomal primers generated a high fraction of specific reads both in the presence and absence of N gene template ( Supplementary  Fig. 3D ).",

We thus designed an additional internal RNA control to assess successful RT in all samples independent of sample quality (RT control or reverse transcription control (RTC)); we produced an in vitro-transcribed RNA with identical primer binding sites as the ribosomal amplicon, yet an unrelated sequence in between ( Supplementary  Fig. 3E ). This RTC was spiked into the RT mix at a concentration of 1000 molecules/reaction. Combining three primer pairs (N1, N3, and rRNA) and in the presence of the RTC, SARSeq reached high amplicon specificity with 30-80% amplicons corresponding to expected amplification products (Supplementary Fig. 3F and Fig. 1D ). Moreover, the ratio between ribosomal amplicon and RTC reads provided a good assessment of sample quality: we observed that in the presence of good-quality gargle, the ratio is high and the RTC is lowly detected, but if the sample is low in nucleic acids the RTC takes over and the ratio is low. This strategy also monitors if samples contained RT and/or PCR inhibitors in which case neither amplicon is efficiently detected as we observed rarely in clinical samples ( Supplementary Fig. 4A ). The high specificity of amplicons achieved in our final setup (see Supplementary Data 1 for pipetting schemes), and the even representation of reads across samples set the stage to develop a high-throughput indexing strategy that allows analysis of tens of thousands of samples in parallel.",

To exploit the high-throughput nature of NGS, we would need a sample barcoding strategy that allows multiplexing of tens of thousands of samples in a single sequencing run while retaining strict sample specificity, i.e., suppressing misassignment of reads to incorrect samples, which can lead to false-positive diagnoses. Several strategies for sample indexing are possible. First, samples can be individually indexed by a sample-specific short DNA sequence (typically called index or barcode) in the RT primer or one of the two PCR primers ( Fig. 2A ). In such a setup, sample-specific primers incorporate sample-indices into all amplicons from each sample, and these indices are then sequenced as part of the respective amplicon; e.g., Salis et al. designed 19,000 RT indices 26 . This strategy, however, does not scale well as it requires distinct primers for each amplicon and sample (linear/additive scaling). More importantly, it cannot retain perfect sample identity due to template-switching PCR artifacts 37, 38 and index-hopping on flow cells 39, 40 , which can lead to incorrect associations between amplicon and index sequences. This problem is of particular relevance when high-titer samples are analyzed next to samples from healthy individuals as we demonstrated by spiking synthetic SARS-CoV-2 template into two wells of a 96-well plate (wells B8 and F2) in which all other wells are negative (Fig. 2B) . The scalability limitation can be overcome with a combinatorial indexing strategy, such as a column index on the forward primer and a row index on the reverse primer 41 (combinatorial/multiplicative scaling; Fig. 2C ). However, such a strategy suffers from the same inability to retain perfect sample identity, which in this case leads to a characteristic cross-shaped pattern along the rows and columns of the positive samples due to the misassignment of the row or column indices (Fig. 2D) .",

These two indices are introduced through forward and reverse primers and redundantly encode each sample with distinct indices at each end of the amplicon, thereby eliminating illegitimate index combinations. Such an approach requires two indices (=unique primers) per sample and therefore does not scale well when a single PCR is used (one dimension). We therefore use a two-dimensional indexing strategy, which we realized by two subsequent PCR steps: after the first PCR performed with unique dual indexing, we pool all samples within one plate into one well of a second plate and perform a second PCR that again uses unique dual indexing. This strategy of two-dimensional redundant dual indexing allows combinatorial indexing between dimension 1 and 2, and thus multiplicative scaling, while retaining perfect sample identity (Fig. 2G, H) . It requires an only modestly higher number of indexing primers for very many samples and allows the encoding of 96 \u00d7 96 or 96 \u00d7 384 samples with 2 \u00d7 96 amplicon-specific primers (2 per amplicon; first dimension) plus 2 \u00d7 96 or 2 \u00d7 384 global primers (irrespective of amplicon; second dimension), respectively.",

Third, we kept the cycle number for PCR2 at a minimum to avoid amplicon recombination during PCR and used a PCR protocol that prevents premature termination of an extension step 43 . Indeed, all three measures synergistically contributed to the robustness of read assignment ( Supplementary Fig. 5A ). In each dimension we used dual and redundant indices with a Hamming distance of at least three mismatches. The primers used for PCR2 (second dimension) are Nextera primer sets that are commercially available as 384 unique pairs and frequently used in many NGS sequencing facilities for multiplexing. This pipeline also suppressed read misassignment across plates, such that the highly positive positions displayed in Fig. 2A , C, E did not produce falsepositive signals in any of the other, negative control plates within the same experiment ( Supplementary Fig. 5B ).",

To illustrate scalability of the approach, a fourfold increase in one dimension for example by using 384-well indices in the first PCR would enable multiplexing of >145,000 samples. This degree of multiplexing renders the sequencing price per sample negligible and thus enables frequent population-wide testing because sequencing capacity is also not bottleneck with current NGS platforms.

We measured each dilution in 24 replicates using SARSeq as described above. Using H 2 O for dilution we detected the 1 copy solution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 5 and 6 of 24 tested cases for N1 and N3, respectively. At such dilution, assuming a Poisson distribution, 63% of wells are expected to contain one or more viral copies, pointing toward a detection efficiency of 30-40% per molecule.

We wondered if possible primer competition would thus decrease sensitivity of the assay. Satisfyingly, the presence of 100 copies of each the N1 and N3 spike-ins did not decrease sensitivity, at least in part because the viral amplicon outcompetes the longer spike-ins (Fig. 3B ). Due to the endpoint PCR we perform, SARSeq intentionally blunts quantitative differences in the returned reads (Fig. 1E ), yet a more quantitative readout can be desirable. Spike-ins have been used to improve the quantitative ability of other NGS approaches that rely on endpoint PCR (the ratio between viral amplicon and spike-in reads reflects the ratio of these two templates in the starting reaction 22 ), we therefore tested the effect of different spike-in levels on the quantitative behavior of SARSeq. We also tested the effect of modulating PCR cycle number on sensitivity and quantitativeness ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ). The number of spike in molecules was optimal at 1000/reaction (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Fig. 3C -E). We found the ratio of specific reads to spike-ins to serve as a good quantitative readout independent of the number of PCR cycles performed across the entire tested range of three orders of magnitude (Fig. 3D ). If desired, sensitivity can also be lowered by reducing the number of PCR cycles below 45, e.g., at 37 cycles only viral titers of >200/\u00b5L (10 3 / 5 \u00b5L reaction input) are robustly detected.",

We were therefore pleased to see that our indexing strategy and pipeline delivered typically zero and very rarely 1 read indicative of SARS-CoV-2 for gargle samples previously tested negative by qPCR as well as for all H 2 O controls, compared to hundreds or thousands of reads for positive samples. In total we performed four runs using gargle samples from our in-house testing pipeline, adding up to 4952 negative samples and 728 positive samples created by adding synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA or dilutions of a positive patient sample. We observed two unexpected N1-positive samples and five unexpected N3-positive samples, estimating a false-positive rate for our pipeline of 0.04-0.1%. This binary result showcased an unambiguous assessment of infection status by SARSeq. Due to the absence of false-positive reads we also did not need to further use the N1 and N3 spike-in \"denominator\" amplicons to set a threshold ratio for calling positive results 22 CoV-2 virus in patient samples collected in clinical diagnostic settings, we measured a set of 564 swab samples from independent patients collected at the Clinical Center of the University of Sarajevo (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina). These samples were obtained in VTM inactivated in QuickExtract and measured in duplicates. Both qPCR and SARSeq were performed from these crude lysates to compare sensitivities when using the same input material. While we did not detect N1 or N3 amplicons in H 2 O or RT conditions (Fig. 4A, B) , we frequently obtained SARS-CoV-2 reads across all plates with good correspondence between amplicons and replicates (Fig. 4C, D) . To assay correspondence to the standard test, we also measured the samples in a probe-based RT-qPCR assay in duplicates (also without prior RNA purification). As expected, we observed a robust correlation of both qPCR replicates until Ct \u2248 36 (Fig. 4E, red dots) and stochastic behavior beyond that detection limit (Fig. 4E , orange dots) with either one or two replicates scoring positive. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in an additional 354 samples. We analyzed the overlap between detection by qPCR and NGS and found that 157 (96.3%) of samples with a Ct value of <36 in at least one qPCR scored positive in all four assays, while six samples scored positive in one or two assays only (Fig. 4F) . Importantly, sensitivity of probebased RT-qPCR and NGS on these samples was therefore fully on par. We hypothesized that the stochastic behavior at the detection border is due to the presence or absence of a single reversetranscribed viral genome. If that was true, detecting that genome by both amplicons within one replicate should be more likely than detecting one of the two amplicons across both independent replicates. In contrast, different sensitivies toward the N1 and N3 amplicons would result in the opposite outcome. Indeed, of the samples detected with one to three of these assays, 48 and 43 patient samples showed detection of SARS-CoV-2 with both amplicons within one SARSeq replicate, while only 18 and 25 samples were detected twice independently with N1 or N3 amplicon, respectively. We thus conclude that SARSeq appears sensitive down to single reverse-transcribed viral genomes and that the sensitivity is on par with qPCR if the sample preparation is identical. We also assessed the reproducibility of SARSeq runs ( Supplementary Fig. 8A, B) . As anticipated, the absolute read numbers are not necessarily correlated, but there is very good correspondence regarding whether or not a sample is positive. We observed the expected upper end of N1/N3 read counts produced by the endpoint PCR strategy to distribute sequencing space evenly across samples (Fig. 1E ). In conclusion, SARSeq detected all samples that were reproducibly detected by qPCR. At the detection limit, both SARSeq and qPCR detected additional samples in a stochastic, non-reproducible manner as expected.",

Multiple infectious agents cause diseases with overlapping clinical symptoms to COVID-19, including influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinoviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. It is expected that, particularly in the winter season, various respiratory symptoms will cause concerns and thereby dramatically increase the demand for SARS-CoV-2 tests. For SARSeq, adding amplicons corresponding to other infectious agents comes at little extra cost as long as it does not increase the required sequencing depth. Therefore, we can further multiplex SARSeq to detect other common respiratory viruses (or other pathogens) found in the same sample used for SARS-CoV-2 testing.",

These multiple virus experiments did not produce any false negatives with the exception, as expected, of the 1/1mio dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 sample with Ct = 30. We also did not see any false positives. Generally, false positives in our assay can only arise from cross-contamination, so to avoid this all post-PCR steps were always performed in a different lab from the initial setup of the reaction, preventing contamination by DNA amplicons. In addition, we implemented incorporation of UTP and a UDG digestion step prior to PCR1 in our protocol, further reducing the risk of contamination with DNA amplicons (see Methods and Supplementary Table 1 ). Moreover, the amplicon sequence of influenza A virus allowed us to distinguish between two different substrains we had used, namely A/Wy and A/WSN (Fig. 5 ) the latter of which is anticipated to circulate in future flu seasons 49 . Similarly, with a single primer pair we were able to distinguish between the three rhinoviral strains, namely HRV A1a, A1b, and A2 by polymorphisms in the respective amplicons. Taken together, our pipeline in its current form differentially detects seven different viral respiratory agents in a single reaction, contains various internal controls, a sample quality control, and by design has particularly high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2. SARSeq thus represents a multiplexed, massively parallelized assay for saliva analysis by RNA sequencing to detect respiratory infections by means of RT-PCR and NGS.",

Compared to antigen tests, which have also been effectively used for mass testing, e.g., in Slovakia 18 , PCR-based assays are orders of magnitude more sensitive and this offers a number of advantages: infected individuals are detected with higher certainty, this makes it possible to pool samples, e.g., within families, and the increased robustness makes it compatible with self-sampling. Households or close groups will thus also be detectable as positive between peaks of viral titers of individual members. To further leverage these methods, the assays used for such large-scale testing must meet a number technical considerations: (i) the tests themselves must be highly specific to avoid false positives leading to the isolation of individuals based on erroneous results; (ii) the costs for mass testing must be as low as possible to reasonably enable scaling; (iii) the assay must be massively scalable and return results in a short timeframe 50 ; (iv) mass testing must not interfere with testing in medical/diagnostic facilities, it is thus preferable that it is neither carried out at the same facilities nor competes for supplies required to diagnose symptomatic patients.",

The current design enables analysis of up to 36,000 samples in parallel, and we demonstrated the analysis of >18,000 samples in a single sequencing run. SARSeq shows high specificity at two levels: at the amplicon level it has maximal specificity as it detects the precise sequence of two independent SARS-CoV-2 amplicons; at the sample identification level, SARSeq employs a number of measures to completely suppress misassignment between samples. Moreover, the cost per sample (~2 Euros in our in-house pipeline) analyzed by SARSeq is low compared to other available tests; it relies on common reagents and enzymes that can be purchased at scale or produced in-house with standard biochemical methods. The costs of sequencing per sample also become negligible considering that they are divided over thousands of samples. Finally, SARSeq, with the exception of NGS, relies exclusively on equipment available in most molecular biology facilities in academia and industry, and does not compete for resources with other diagnostic tests.",

For SARSeq, a potential limitation is the time requirement of the assay. Two PCR reactions must be performed followed by NGS and analysis, so the theoretical minimum time required is around 15 h. In practice, our tests took at least 24 h from sample preparation to results. Therefore, SARSeq is not suited for situations where immediate results are required. In such cases, antigen tests 51 or RT-LAMP 52,53 are superior methods. Rather, SARSeq with its high throughput, sensitivity, and specificity is ideally suited for regular (e.g., once or twice a week) surveillance of infections in large organizations or populations. SARSeq might also be suitable to test symptomatic persons if a turnaround of 24 h for the test itself is acceptable. In addition, SARSeq can be implemented in epidemiology studies to understand the spreading dynamics of infections 54 and to investigate interaction between different pathogens across large populations 55 . However, the main advantage of SARSeq is that the same turnaround time of 15-24 h can be used to simultaneously test tens of thousands of samples.

In one strategy, samples are indexed during the RT step and PCR is performed in pool 26 . This approach has the advantage that early sample pooling circumvents the need for large numbers of individual PCR reactions.

In addition, both methods use a dual indexing strategy to gain the required robustness in sample recall that is key for diagnostic assays. However, SwabSeq and SARSeq differ in several important aspects that directly impact scalability and the multiplexed detection of different amplicons: SwabSeq uses a one-step RT-PCR reaction, whereas SARSeq performs RT and PCR in two steps, which we found to significantly suppress unspecific amplicons and thus make efficient use of the read space, a prerequisite for sensitivity, scalability, and multiplexing of amplicons (a one-step RT-PCR reaction is also compatible with SARSeq, albeit with slightly lower amplicon specificity, Fig. 1D ). More importantly, due to a single indexing step, upscaling of SwabSeq is linear rather than combinatorial-every additional sample requires one additional primer pair per amplicon. In contrast, SARSeq uses a two-dimensional indexing strategy, which allows combinatorial (multiplicative) scaling of up to tens of thousands of samples with just a few hundred primer pairs and therefore leverages the sequencing capacities offered by NGS. By linear indexing, such dimensions would neither be cost-effective nor logistically feasible. Another important difference is that the amplicons generated by SwabSeq contain the flow cell adaptors but not the i5/i7 sequencing primer bindings sites and thus require a mix of custom sequencing primers, one for each amplicon. This limits the number of different amplicons that can be surveyed in parallel and also can cause heterogeneity in cluster signal intensity and thus impact sequencing quality. In contrast, all SARSeq amplicons contain standard i5/i7 sequencing primer bindings sites and are directly compatible with the regular sequencing protocols and reagents on all Illumina platforms. This facilitates the addition of further amplicons to the assay, since all are read out by the same standard i5/i7 binding sequencing primers. Therefore, the extra PCR reaction that SARSeq requires is a small technical burden, which however allows dramatic improvements in scalability of samples and amplicons and yields amplicons with homogenous sequencing properties.",

One PCR machine can process around 1500 samples per day, so the investment costs are negligible if sample throughput is high. To process 10,000 samples in 1 day about seven persons and ten PCR machines are needed. SARSeq thus solves the technical challenges downstream of sample acquisition, shifting the bottleneck toward truly high-scale testing from the actual assay to developing matching logistics for sample collection, maintaining supply chains, developing appropriate data management tools, and also often overcoming legal hurdles. However, we envision ways in which SARSeq can be implemented right away, to already significantly contribute to detecting infection events before they spread. In the first, samples can be collected and inactivated locally, potentially also first PCR might be performed using prepared and distributed primer arrays, followed by shipment to a centralized location for PCR2, sequencing, and analysis. Importantly, depending on the legal situation and aim, this pipeline does not necessarily need a human diagnostics lab and would thus not block important infrastructure. In the second, companies, universities, other types of institutions could implement a regular sample collection strategy among employees/students/other members and team up with a local academic or industry lab that can with relatively little effort implement this protocol.",

In the first four sequencing runs, standard quality control of the library, including Qubit measurement, a size analysis and qPCR, was performed. A correlation between the concentration measurement by Qubit and the qPCR was detected. In every case the molarity determined by qPCR was 10\u00d7 higher than the concentration measured by Qubit. Thus, we were able to omit the size analysis and the qPCR, which are both time consuming. The library concentration was determined by three independent Qubit measurements, the obtained value in ng/\u00b5L was multiplied by 10 and used as the molarity of the sample in nanomolar. This procedure enables us to start the sequencer within 15 min after receiving the sequencing library. Final preparation of the sequencing run happens according to Illumina's guidelines, including denaturation of the sample, neutralization and final dilution for sequencing.",

The NGS data (fastq.gz files) were mapped in a single pass to sets of expected amplicon sequences and to sets of expected well-and plate-indices using dedicated shell and awk scripts based on string-hashing that allows for 0 or 1 mismatch per amplicon and index. During method development, different parameters were tested and optimized, including single-versus paired-end sequencing, the sequencing platforms (MiSeq vs. NextSeq), and the exact positions of the indices in the primers (and thus in the reads) and the analysis was adjusted accordingly (the analysis script we make available is compatible with the final primer-and parameter set recommended for use). For redundant dual indexing, we required the correct redundant encoding of plate and well. The i5 and i7 index reads signify the plate-indices, and parts of the forward and reverse reads (in the case of paired-end sequencing) signify the well-indices. As the well-index in the forward read starts at random offsets, we first determine the amplicon identity and position, then infer the position of the well index, and finally compare the well index to the valid well index pairs; all reads with invalid plate-or well-index pairs were excluded. For the final set of primers, the offsets are made consistent for all amplicons of a given well, changing between 1 and 4 between wells such that the well-index starts between positions 2 and 5.",

These can be incorporated by forward or reverse primers. For the latter they can be incorporated during RT or PCR. Red circles highlight the positions into which synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA was added to test specificity of the indexing strategy. B N3 amplicon reads obtained by NGS and mapped to each well based on indices incorporated by reverse primers during PCR. Forward primer indices were present but disregarded in this analysis. Note the frequent misassignment to incorrect positions. C Scheme depicting combinatorial indexing. Each well is identified as a unique combination of a forward and a reverse index. D N3 amplicon reads mapped to wells based on combinatorial indexing as in C. To simulate combinatorial indexing the identical dataset as in B and F was used but for analysis, primers were treated in pools pointing to columns or rows. E Unique dual indexing is a redundant indexing method that encodes each well both by a unique forward and a unique reverse index. Thus, illegitimate recombination products between an amplicon and its associated indices can be bioinformatically rejected. F NGS result for the same dataset as in B and D analyzed with unique dual indices successfully filtered away all misassigned reads. G Two rounds of unique dual indexing (in two subsequent PCR reactions) can be used to index first wells and then plates, effectively achieving combinatorial (multiplicative) scaling. Colored boxes represent indices. H Illustration of the PCR workflow. RT and PCR1 are performed on all samples individually, adding well-specific indices.
