Our findings are vital in predicting whether voluntary vaccinations can be an effective mechanism to achieve the social optimum. From the social planner's perspective, it implies that voluntary vaccination can approximate elimination of any disease if the relative benefit of vaccination is large enough, i.e., when the individual benefit from vaccination is sufficiently larger than the individual's utility cost of vaccination. A mandatory vaccination program is not necessary to achieve the social optimum, especially when the network externality is strong in the society and the nature of externality is concave. The social planner's well-defined policy goal should be to increase the relative benefit. Several policy tools appears natural to achieve this goal, such as a subsidy to decrease the cash cost of vaccination, a nationwide public vaccination campaign to lower the psychological cost of vaccination, and financial aid to encourage R&D activities to minimize the side-effects of vaccines. Policy prescriptions, on the other hand, should also be interpreted with caution as in uncontrolled settings, many factors including framing, social norm and even emotion, can have salient effects on preventive behavior ( [3] ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1343, "end": 1346, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Our findings contribute to the emerging literature on strategic vaccination ( [14] , [15] , [16] ).

[16] considered how the prevalence elastic strategy in a two-player dynamic game of vaccination can yield inefficiently low vaccination uptake. A prevalence elastic strategy is an action plan that is contingent on how many people are infectious over the course of an epidemic. It is usually employed in models featuring flexible timing of vaccination, where feedback about the epidemic is available. As noted by [17] , the prevention externality, wherein the vaccination choice of an individual may reduce the likelihood that others are immunized, should be separated from the infection externality, as one's own infection can increase the likelihood that others are infected.

In fact, [26] classify the volunteer's dilemma as a special case of a threshold public good, where the critical level requires a fraction of the population. [27] further generalizes threshold public good games to a class of social dilemmas parametrized by the marginal return of cooperation, and studies an experimental setting where the benefit of cooperation increases linearly up to the threshold and then plateaus. While their focus is on group size effect, we instead fix the group size and vary the curvature and the threshold. Our experiment provides novel and complementary evidence that the convexity of the benefit function further improves contribution over its linear counterpart.
