            "text": "Spatial transcriptomics has been emerging as a powerful technique for resolving gene expression profiles while retaining tissue spatial information. These spatially resolved transcriptomics make it feasible to examine the complex multicellular systems of different microenvironments. To answer scientific questions with spatial transcriptomics and expand our understanding of how cell types and states are regulated by microenvironment, the first step is to identify cell clusters by integrating the available spatial information. Here, we introduce SC-MEB, an empirical Bayes approach for spatial clustering analysis using a hidden Markov random field. We have also derived an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm based on an iterative conditional mode for SC-MEB. In contrast to BayesSpace, a recently developed method, SC-MEB is not only computationally efficient and scalable to large sample sizes but is also capable of choosing the smoothness parameter and the number of clusters. We performed comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the superiority of SC-MEB over some existing methods. We applied SC-MEB to analyze the spatial transcriptome of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues and mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. Our analysis results showed that SC-MEB can achieve a similar or better clustering performance to BayesSpace, which uses the true number of clusters and a fixed smoothness parameter. Moreover, SC-MEB is scalable to large 'sample sizes'. We then employed SC-MEB to analyze a colon dataset from a patient with colorectal cancer (CRC) and COVID-19, and further performed differential expression analysis to identify signature genes related to the clustering results. The heatmap of identified signature genes showed that the clusters identified using SC-MEB were more separable than those obtained with BayesSpace. Using pathway analysis, we identified three immune-related clusters, and in a further comparison, found the mean expression of COVID-19 signature genes was greater in immune than non-immune regions of colon tissue. SC-MEB provides a valuable computational tool for investigating the structural organizations of tissues from spatial transcriptomic data.",

These spatially resolved transcriptomics have deepened our understanding of how cell types and states are regulated by tissues microenvironment, e.g., of the human brain [Maynard et al., 2021] , mouse brain [Shah et al., 2016 , Alon et al., 2021 , and mouse embryo [Lohoff et al., 2020] , among others. The technologies used for resolving spatial gene expression can largely be classified as either imaging-based or next-generation-sequencing-based methods [Waylen et al., 2020] . Imagingbased methods, which were developed to study spatial complexity, are based on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and include smFISH [Lyubimova et al., 2013] , seqFISH [Eng et al., 2017] , and MERFISH [Xia et al., 2019] . Although FISH-based methods are capable of capturing both RNA quantity and position, they are limited by their throughput scalability and accuracy in measuring gene expression levels. However, multiple next-generation-sequencingbased methods have been developed to facilitate high-throughput analysis, including Geoseq [Chen et al., 2017] , Slide-seq [Rodriques et al., 2019] and, more recently, the commercial 10x Genomics Visium system [St\u00e5hl et al., 2016] . Emerging ST technologies offer new opportunities to investigate the spatial patterns of gene expression for many applications, such as cell type identification, tissue exploration, and differential expression analysis. Among these applications, cell-type clustering is the first problem that needs to be addressed.",

Kim et al. [2020] suggested that clustering analysis should be performed before imputing or normalizing the data. To overcome the curse of dimensionality due to high-throughput spatial gene expression, clustering is often preceded by standard dimension reduction procedures, e.g., principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding [Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008] , and uniform manifold approximation and projection [McInnes et al., 2018] .",

To allow additional spatial information to be incorporated into ST datasets, several methods have been recently developed, including the hidden Markov random field model implemented in the Giotto package [Zhu et al., 2018 , Dries et al., 2019 and a fully Bayesian model with a Markov random field (MRF), BayesSpace [Zhao et al., 2021] . Given the spatial coordinates for each transcriptome-profiled spot, spatial clustering methods achieve better classification accuracy. For example, Zhao et al. [2021] showed that BayesSpace improved the resolution and achieved better classification accuracy for manually annotated human brain samples. However, these methods have certain limitations. First, BayesSpace is a fully Bayesian method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo; therefore, it is not computationally scalable for ST data with high resolution. Second, smoothness is an essential parameter of MRF-based methods and largely determines the proximity of the neighboring spots [Tolpekin and Stein, 2009 ]. BayesSpace takes this smoothness parameter as fixed and, thus, cannot choose the optimal value that best fits a given dataset. Third, without optimizing the smoothness parameter, one cannot apply any model selection methods to obtain the optimal number of clusters. In practice, the number of clusters in ST datasets is usually unknown before the follow-up analysis, and the preferred method would be to automatically choose the number of clusters.",

In contrast to existing methods [Dries et al., 2019 , Zhao et al., 2021 , SC-MEB is not only computationally efficient and scalable to larger sample sizes but also accommodates adjustments to the smoothness parameter and the number of clusters. We derived an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm based on an iterative conditional mode (ICM) and further selected the number of clusters for SC-MEB based on the modified Bayesian information criterion (MBIC) [Wang et al., 2009] . We demonstrated the effectiveness of SC-MEB over existing methods through comprehensive simulation studies. We then applied SC-MEB to the clustering analysis of three ST datasets. Using a 10x Genomics Visium dataset from human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues that were manually annotated, we showed that the performance of SC-MEB was comparable or better than that of BayesSpace, even though the latter uses the \"true\" number of clusters and a prespecified, fine-tuned smoothness parameter. Using a large MERFISH dataset from mouse hypothalamic preoptic region, we demonstrated the better clustering performance as well as the scalability of SC-MEB. We further applied SC-MEB and alternative methods to analyze ST data of a colon tissue from a patient with colorectal cancer (CRC) and COVID-19. We performed follow-up differential expressions analysis using the clustering results from SC-MEB and BayesSpace, and the heatmap of identified signature genes showed that SC-MEB clustering results were more reasonable and interpretable. Using pathway analysis, we identified three immune-related clusters, and the mean expression of COVID-19 signature genes were further compared between immune and non-immune regions of a colon sample.",

The second level of SC-MEB depicts the prior probability of the hidden labels, and an MRF prior is implemented to encourage smoothness among spots. In other words, spots of the same cluster can be in close proximity. As spots in Visium are primarily arranged on hexagonal lattices, the neighborhood of each spot is defined by applying a proximity threshold. To promote smoothness within spot neighborhoods, we use the Potts model [Potts, 1952] for the hidden labels. The Potts model is well known as a statistical model for use with complex systems with nearest neighbor interactions. Essentially, it views the total energies U (x) as a summation of pairwise interaction energies with neighbors, where a positive parameter \u03b2 represents the strength of interactions. Specifically, the Potts model promotes spatial smoothness by penalizing cases in which neighboring spots are assigned to different cluster labels. The hidden random field x is assumed to be",

When all labels on a neighborhood take the same value, meaning that the hidden x is locally smooth, it incurs no neighborhood cost; otherwise, if they are not all the same, a positive cost is incurred, and the amount of cost is controlled by parameter \u03b2. Thus, parameter \u03b2 controls the smoothness in latent labels; the larger the \u03b2, the spatially smoother the latent labels. When \u03b2 is zero, SC-MEB reverts to the method that does not consider spatial information, i.e., GMM. Combining two levels of SC-MEB, (1) and (2), we denote \u03c6 = (\u03b8, \u03b2) the parameter space. As the smoothing parameter \u03b2 does not have an explicit updated form, SC-MEB adaptively selects \u03b2 via a grid search strategy. That is, the SC-MEB model is trained with a prefixed \u03b2 using an efficient ICM-EM scheme [Cuadra et al., 2005 ] that incorporates a pseudo-likelihood maximization step, as in the ICM method of Besag [1974] . The optimal \u03b2 is the value that maximizes the marginal log-likelihood. In a similar way, the marginal log-likelihood can be evaluated for a sequence of K. Then, MBIC [Wang et al., 2009 ] is applied to choose the optimal number of clusters in a data-driven manner (Fig. 1D ).

The inferior performance of BayesSpace was due to its lack of adaptation to the smoothness parameter \u03b2. The other methods, Giotto, GMM, k-means, and Louvain, achieved lower ARIs. When PCs were from a mixture of Student's t-distributions, assumptions of BayesSpace were satisfied. As shown in Fig. 2B , using BayesSpace with the correct number of clusters showed the best performance. Even though SC-MEB was miss-specified in this setting, it still achieved a high ARI that was larger than that of BayesSpace with miss-specificed K and other methods. Note that most components in the mixture of Student's t-distributions simulated here are t(5) and t(6), which are reasonably close to Gaussian. This demonstrates the robust performance of SC-MEB when there is moderate miss-specification of distributions. We note that if the data are far from the Gaussian component, the performance of SC-MEB will degenerate. The results from other settings ( Supplementary Fig. S1 -S2) prompted similar conclusions. In Example II, the comparative results ( Fig. 2C and 2D) were largely consistent with the results obtained in Example I. Specifically, SC-MEB was more powerful than all the other methods.

Then we performed clustering analysis with all methods, except k-means.

Table 1 shows the ARI values for 12 DLPFC samples, where the manually annotated layers were taken as the \"ground truth\". SC-MEB clearly outperformed BayesSpace in the analysis of six samples, and vice versa for the other five samples. In the analysis, BayesSpace took both the \"true\" number of clusters (from the manual annotations) and the prefixed fine-tuned \u03b2 as input. In this case, the proposed SC-MEB achieved the similar performance without the prior information. Additionally, SC-MEB achieved the best clustering performance among the methods that can select (K) automatically. Table 2 compares the computational times required for all methods. The speed of SC-MEB was almost 200 times faster than that of BayesSpace, and comparable to GMM and Giotto. Louvain was the fastest method, but its clustering accuracy was inferior. The ARI and computation times of the five methods for MHPR dataset are provided in Table 3 and 4. Obviously, SC-MEB has the best clustering performance.

By checking PanglaoDB [Franz\u00e9n et al., 2019] for signature genes identified via differential expression (DE) analysis and with the help of the H&E staining shown in Fig. 4A , we were able to identify regions of muscle, stroma, epithelial, and immune cells. As shown in Fig. 4B -F, all methods except BayesSpace returned good partitions for the muscle region, which were visually verified with the H&E staining (Fig. 4A) . The epithelial regions identified by BayesSpace were much smaller than those identified by SC-MEB, in which a large proportion of the epithelial regions in Fig. 4B -C were classified as stromal regions (stroma 2) by BayesSpace. The immune regions identified by BayesSpace were larger at the 9 and 12 o'clock positions but smaller at the 6 o'clock position in Fig. 4C than those identified by SC-MEB (Fig. 4B) and GMM (Fig. 4F) . Strikingly, a large proportion of the regions identified as stroma 1 by both SC-MEB and GMM were classified as stroma 2 by BayesSpace. Even though stroma 1 and stroma 2 are both stromal regions, one can observe clear differences in the normalized expression of signature genes for these two clusters (Fig. 5 ).

For the clustering results of SC-MEB and BayesSpace, we further performed DE analysis comparing an identified cluster with all others using the BPSC package [Vu et al., 2016] for log-normalized expression. Using the partition results from SC-MEB, we identified 180, 158, 128, 94, 145, 95, 137, and 84 genes that were differentially expressed for stroma 1 and 2; muscle; epithelial 1 and 2; and immune 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with a false discovery rate of < 0.05. The details of all differentially expressed genes identified by SC-MEB and BayesSpace are provided in Supplementary Tables S7 and S8. We further restricted the number of signature genes by choosing those with log-fold changes larger than 0.5. Finally, we obtained a total of 62 and 57 signature genes for SC-MEB and BayesSpace, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the heatmap of normalized expression for the signature genes identified in the DE analysis by SC-MEB (Fig. 5A) and BayesSpace (Fig. 5B) , respectively. Clearly, with BayesSpace, the normalized expression of signature genes in stroma 2 could be further divided into two sub-clusters, and the expression pattern in the second sub-cluster was very similar to that of stroma 1. This misclassification is also apparent when comparing Fig. 4B and Fig. 4C , as a large proportion of the regions identified as stroma 1 by SC-MEB were identified as stroma 2 by BayesSpace. The findings obtained using SC-MEB demonstrated that stroma 1 and stroma 2 clusters, epithelial clusters, and immune clusters were arranged in layers that are morphologically supported by the anatomical architecture of colonic tissue [Mills, 2019] : (from lumen to serosa) mucosal epithelium; lamina propria (in which immune cells are abundant, and the isolated lymphoid nodules present in this tissue extend into the submucosal layer); submucosal layer, the stromal layer with abundant connective tissue; and lastly muscularis externa, which is represented by the muscle layer.",

For the three identified immune clusters, the most significant pathways included humoral immune response and antimicrobial humoral response. For stroma 2 clusters, extracellular structure organization, and external encapsulating structure organization were among the most significant pathways. We also found similar patterns in the heatmap for the normalized expression of signature genes (Fig. 5) between stroma 1 and 2 clusters, among the three immune clusters, and between epithelial clusters 1 and 2. There was high cosine similarity between the two stromal clusters (0.97), as well as among the immune clusters (see Supplementary Table S10 ). We ultimately compared the mean expression of COVID-19 signature genes [Lee et al., 2020] in the immune and non-immune regions identified by SC-MEB (Fig. 6) , and it was clear that COVID-19 signature genes were more highly expressed in the immune regions than the non-immune regions of the colorectal tumor sample.",

In the DLPFC dataset, the ARI values for SC-MEB and BayesSpace were comparable, but SC-MEB was 200 times faster at running the analysis than BayesSpace. More importantly, SC-MEB optimized the smoothness parameter \u03b2 and selected the number of clusters in a data-driven manner. SC-MEB could also be applied to perform spatial clustering in other types of ST datasets. Our analysis of the MHPR dataset from MERFISH showed that SC-MEB not only outperformed other methods but was also scalable to larger sample sizes. It took less than five hours to complete the analysis for all cells (> 1 million). By applying SC-MEB and other methods, we performed spatial clustering for a colon dataset from a patient with colorectal cancer (CRC) and COVID-19 and further performed differential expression analysis to identify signature genes related to the clustering results. We compared the heatmaps of signature genes identified using SC-MEB and BayesSpace and observed that the clusters identified using SC-MEB were more separable. Using pathway analysis, we identified three immune-related clusters and in a further comparison, we found the mean expression of COVID-19 signature genes was greater in immune than non-immune regions.",

Example 2, t: PCs were sampled from a Student's-t mixture model.In all simulations, SC-MEB toke approximately 8 minutes to complete the analysis for 10 combinatorial values in K, while BayesSpace required about 25 minutes for prefixed K and \u03b2 and up to 600 times more computation time than SC-MEB for fixed combinatorial values of K and \u03b2. To better demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of SC-MEB, we conducted additional simulations with an increasing sample size n. InFig. 3, we can see that the computation time of SC-MEB for a fixed number of iterations increased almost linearly with increasing sample size, taking about 0.5 hours to run 50 iterations for a dataset with 200K spots. Thus, SC-MEB can be used to perform clustering analysis for ST datasets with a higher resolution than other methods.",
