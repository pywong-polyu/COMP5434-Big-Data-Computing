Yet globally, 10% or fewer of adolescents can access violence prevention programmes. 4 14 Parenting for Lifelong Health is a positive parenting group intervention developed in South Africa for parents and adolescents that builds on social learning and parent management training principles seeking reduce all types of violence in families. 15 Other publications detail PLH-Teens' development, theory and effectiveness.

Together they reviewed both the superficial structures (language, role-plays) as well as cultural content and named the adapted intervention Parwarish (meaning 'nurturing' in Hindi).

Additionally, we examined acceptability and demand for Parwarish by asking participants whether they were comfortable with the group implementation processes and programme content. 20 Qualitative interviews and written documents were read and reread and analysed using thematic analysis developed by Braun and Clarke. 24 Four transcripts were inductively coded by PN and KM and these codes were reviewed to develop a coding framework, paying attention to implementation processes, feasibility and barriers and enablers of the intervention.

            "text": "Enrolment and attendance rates for fathers and mothers in Parwarish were significantly higher than in PLH-Teens implementations in South Africa, Philippines and Sudan. 12 25 26 Factors likely to have increased attendance include context-relevant adaptations by the community-based facilitators and the pre-existing strong relationships and community development work of implementing teams. The novelty of a first-ever research project with daily WhatsApp group reporting across sites perhaps added a competitive component that promoted greater activity among facilitators. 27 The results demonstrate Parwarish was feasibly implemented by lay community facilitators and coaches. This has positive implications for scaling across South Asia and beyond: implementation by local people receiving modest remuneration in meeting spaces provided by the community makes this a relatively low-cost intervention. 25 However, while the programme is likely to be feasible and acceptable in other disadvantaged settings in South Asia, the high level of commitment by facilitators (eg, being willing to conduct meetings at night in Jharkhand communities) may be harder to replicate. Implementers also underlined the value of structured, high-intensity programme buttressing to increase fidelity and quality of Parwarish, which was also identified as central in PLH-Teens implementation 14 22 23 and other community-based group interventions in South Asia. [28] [29] [30] Implementers and facilitators described the Indiaspecific adaptation of PLH-Teens as relevant and acceptable in two key ways: first, the curricular adaptations that were superficial (eg, names of characters in role-plays) were appropriate and felt recognisable, while deeper changes, such as implementation by married couples and Open access holding group meetings in the private homes/courtyards in Uttar Pradesh sites, made Parwarish feasible, culturally appropriate and easy to engage with in these settings. 25 26 Second, relevance and acceptability were increased by deployment of trained community members facilitating groups, using their in-depth knowledge of the daily lives, culture and language (ie, context) of participants. Parwarish facilitators used local dialects in facilitation and gave examples familiar to participants from shared common knowledge, adjusting logistics and role-plays in each setting to maximise participation. Implementers described the importance of trusting the innate contextual knowledge of facilitators 31 and the value of facilitators discussing their proposed adaptations to the programme with PLH-Teens coaches to ensure the core was followed but in locally acceptable ways. Facilitators described a range of continuous microadaptations, a feature key to successful interventions in other low-income and middleincome settings. 28 32 33 At the same time, some of the changes such as meeting at night perhaps reduced visual learning opportunities (eg, from role-plays) as there was no electricity at night.",

            "text": "While participation of fathers in Parwarish was greater than has occurred in other PLH-Teens settings, men's attendance was still significantly less than women's attendance. Men's participation in any family linked intervention is critical as they typically control financial decisions and dominate family decision-making in Indian households. 36 37 Strategies to increase participation of men include including men as facilitators, ensuring meetings are held at times when men can attend and developing momentum for men's participation by engaging with men who are 'positive deviants'. 36 India is among the world's bottom five countries in the health and survival category of the Global Gender Gap Index meaning there are large gender disparities that disadvantage women. 6 Parwarish held transforming gender relations as core to process, content and implementation with men and women seated together in a group which already confronted the predominant unisex socailising and gender relations, an approach endorsed elsewhere in north India. 36 Gender relations influenced participation, for example, decreasing attendance of fathers and sons, because of gender role expectations to generate income. 12 25 26 There were also proportionately more girls among participating adolescents, perhaps reflecting their lower priority for school attendance and employment. 6 Parwarish enabled new attitudes and transformations to gender relations. For example, the Agra and Robertsganj groups' decision to not observe purdah when in group meetings was key to the quality and quantity of dialogue in the group meetings and went on to lead to other outcomes where women described increased autonomy in decision-making and increased participation in family financial decisions. This early outcome generated a sense of entrenched behaviours linked to harsh parenting also being open to negotiation and change and encouraged facilitators, mothers and young women, which then increased their engagement and participation; this positive feedback loop has been identified as important in other gender transformative interventions. 36 Addressing deeply embedded gender relations of patriarchy prevalent across South Asia has no quick fix solution, and further work on gender transformative interventions is urgently needed in communities, schools and national policies across India to bring greater gender equality which can benefit both women and men. 36 Parwarish groups used face-to-face trainings and meetings, and facilitator manuals and monitoring formats that were paper based, yet implementation was strengthened through technological applications and mobile phones. In India there are over 1 billion users of mobile phones 38 and 400 million people using the application WhatsApp. 39 The benefits of WhatsApp, which are familiar (widely used by peers), free and synchronous and easy to use, to support problem-solving and quality of community health programme implementation in low-resources settings have been described by others 27 40 and further realised in the COVID-19 era. 41 42 Facilitators and coaches described three new ways by which technology enhanced their work: first, in WhatsApp group communications between coaches and facilitators allowing sharing of pictures and video calls which strengthened monitoring and programme quality. Second, for coordination with implementers in New Delhi, with audio and visual facets increasing the ability to communicate the challenges and opportunities in field settings, and third, in the use of Skype conversations for 'coach the coaches' sessions between field sites, New Delhi and South Africa.",

Second, Open access the evaluation did not include a control group and was evaluated immediately after implementation limiting knowledge about sustainability of changes. Third, while researchers visited implementation sites several times, no researchers resided in intervention communities which reduced their contextual understanding of the relevance and acceptability of the implementation process. There were important strengths in the study design: First, it reflected the 'real-world' allowing iterative microadaptations of the intervention to make it optimally relevant and acceptable in the community. Second, implementation by community members as facilitators, with groups housed in communities using local homes to host groups and a modest budget in three diverse sites, provides a model for implementation that can be generalised for implementation and scaling by others working among people from low-income communities across South Asia.",
