Under physiologically normal conditions, an inverse relationship is observed. The aim of this study was to verify whether the analysis of miR-320a and miR-127 expression in platelets could detect a decrease in their viability and function due to the presence of pathogens in the blood of patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit. We also investigated the expression of membrane antigens sensitive to platelet activation. Of the 200 patients analyzed, only those who developed sepsis (140) were found to have a higher relative quantity of miR-320a than that of miR-127. This characteristic and the increased expression of membrane antigens P2Y12, CD62P, CD41, and CD61 showed a significant association (p < 0.01) with all types of sepsis evaluated in this study. Additionally, 40% of patients hospitalized for sepsis had negative results for the first cultures. We conclude that analysis of miR-127 and miR-320a expression combined with membrane antigens evaluation, in association with the available clinical and diagnostic parameters, are important tools to detect the onset of sepsis.",
