Parenthood in industrialized societies is characterized by arguably irreversible delays in childbearing due to lifestyle changes such as increases in women's participation in the labor market and increased years of education [6] . The nexus between social and biological fertility remains an important debate as social norms play a powerful role in shaping expectations for parenthood and what is perceived as acceptable in various stages throughout the life course [7] [8] [9] . For example, in most industrialized countries, childbearing during adolescence is considered socially deviant regardless of biological fertility. Perceptions of the suitable time for parenthood are part of a certain culture of normalcy in terms of what is expected for adults [10, 11] and this culture influences fertility behaviors. It is expected that if a social deadline age for childbearing is lower than the upper limit of the biological age range (usually between [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] , actual reproduction is likely to be influenced by the social age.",

            "text": "Social childbearing deadline age is a social construct, and thus is susceptible to influence from social changes [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In recent years, assisted reproductive technologies (ART) has gained much attention in relation to childbearing postponement. The provision and use of fertility treatments have likely affected perceptions of childbearing ages [17] [18] [19] . However, arguably, not many studies have looked into ART and its association with social perception of childbearing ages [19] [20] [21] [22] . 2 of 17 While existing research on ART has focused on costs and difficulties associated with ART treatments, ART-related births to fertility, and effectiveness of ART, only a few studies have focused on social perception of childbearing age [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, these few studies are limited because they are based on single country and are qualitative literature reviews. Social norms and perceptions of childbearing age are important as they may set the limits on policies of healthcare provision and the societal climate regarding ART may vary between and within countries. Also, although men contribute to half of infertility causes, studies on ART have largely been focused on female infertility [26] . This gender imbalance and bias in reproductive health and reproductive health studies are likely to negatively reinforce people's perception of infertility as women's responsibilities. Hence, it is important to examine the association of ART and childbearing deadline ages of both genders.",

Also, by examining both maternal and paternal childbearing deadline ages, we hope our findings help facilitate women's empowerment and gender equality in reproductive health and fertility treatments. We hypothesize that individuals residing in countries with higher availability and prevalence of ART are more likely to be generous with childbearing deadline ages than individuals residing in countries with relatively lower availability and prevalence of ART.",

The ESS questionnaire asked interviewers to code the \"sex\" of the respondents as either \"female\" or \"male\" and the present study decided to follow the exact phrasing of the ESS questionnaire, instead of \"gender\". Also, the ESS measured educational attainment based on the International Standard Classification Education (ISCED), an international framework designed by the United Nations to facilitate comparisons of education systems across countries. The ISCED is divided into six levels (0 = pre-primary education, 1 = primary education, 2 = lower secondary education (or middle school), 3 = upper secondary education (or high school), 4 = post-secondary non-tertiary education, 5 = first stage tertiary education (i.e. Bachelor and Master degree equivalent), 6 = second stage tertiary education (i.e. Ph.D. degree equivalent) [34] . Here, we focused on four broad categories of educational attainment: \"Less than lower secondary (ISCED 0-1)\", \"Lower secondary completed (ISCED 2)\", \"Upper secondary completed (ISECD 3)\", and \"Higher than post-secondary completed (ISECD 4-6).\" All individual-level characteristic control variables were measured as categorical variables. The three country-level variables were GDP per capita (measured as 2010 constant US $1000), female labor force participation rate (aged 15-64), and family and child benefit spending per GDP (measured as a percentage). All country-level variables were measured as continuous variables and based on the year 2006 to correspond with the ESS data. The 2006 GDP per capita was reported in 2010 USD because the World Bank only provides the data either in 2010 or the latest current (as of now, 2021) USD. In the present study, we decided to use GDP per capita in constant 2010 USD because the latest current data is likely to change soon and may be confusing to readers when they read the article since the data is to be updated every year.

However, despite the advancement of such technology, reservations exist among clinical practitioners as evidence so far is based on case study reports and uncontrolled before-after studies with limited randomized control trial results or moderate to low quality of evidence [36, 37] . While the advancement of technology is promising to those who are trying to conceive, a cautionary approach must be taken due to the controversy surrounding add-ons in assisted reproduction [38] . To what extent these technologies have impacted the perception of social aging is yet to be known and future research is warranted to examine both the exposure and take-up of these novel approaches in medicine in our society.",

It also is the first study to empirically examine ART and social perceptions of childbearing age deadlines. Also, findings from our study may offer insight into understanding perceptions of childbearing ages in 2021 and future. For example, according to the European IVF Monitoring (EIM) consortium, the number of countries and clinics providing data to the EIM increased from 482 clinics (1997) to 1064 (2011) [42] . These clinics reported that the total number of cycles increased from 203,225 (1997) to 609,973 (2011) which indicates increased use of ART across Europe [42] . Furthermore, findings from our study can provide a foundation for future studies in ART and fertility age. For instance, a recent 2019 study by Fauser et al. [43] examined the public perception of IVF treatment in six Western European countries and found that that 54% of the respondents have considered or would consider having IVF treatments and 52% answered that the availability of IVF treatment would encourage them to delay conception. Fauser et al. [43] reported that this delay in conception response was especially pronounced in France and Germany, but the authors did not provide a concrete analysis of this outcome. The study was focused on descriptive findings and did not look at the relationship between the two variables. Although changes since 2006 would have to be taken into account, our study provides insights into understanding why respondents in France and Germany may have been more generous in later childbearing in Fauser et al.'s study [43] , possibly in response to the high availability and utilization of ART services in those countries based on our study. In addition, because our study examined ART in several dimensions, including the availability of ART clinics, ART usage, and ART births, it provides a relatively comprehensive overview that can support future studies of ART, age norms, and how the advancement of ART may influence fertility behaviors.",

However, no significant association was observed with regards to an individuals' perception of paternal childbearing deadline age and number of IVF clinics. A possible explanation for such an outcome may be due to lack of understanding of male infertility and use of ART treatments. Although studies show that men contribute to more than half of infertility causes [44] , people generally still think that childlessness is primarily a women's issue [25] , and even though ART is used to tackle both male and female infertility, it is often perceived to be used primarily for female reproductive needs [7, 27, 45] . While late maternal age has been a longstanding topic of research, late paternal age has been relatively studied less [46] . Of the few studies, results showed that late fatherhood also have a significant negative effect on hormone levels, fertility, and sperm quality [47, 48] , and significantly decrease IVF success rates. de La Rochebrochard et al. [49] examined male patients treated by IVF in France, 2005 and discovered that the treatment success rates of male patients decreased significantly after aged 40. Also, Throsby and Gill in 2004 interviewed UK husbands, who were diagnosed with infertility but discontinued using IVF treatments, and found that husbands stop IVF treatments because they felt that infertility and IVF treatments threatened their masculinity and their wives were being pitied [50] . As a result, the authors presume that social gender bias exists in the perception of the use of IVF clinics and ART in general.",

            "text": "Contrary to the authors' expectation, results indicated that individuals residing in countries with higher utilization of ART treatments (i.e., ART cycles) were likely to be stricter with maternal childbearing deadline ages than individuals residing in countries with lower ART use. Two explanations are possible. First, the small sample size may have contributed to such findings: whilst 21 countries were examined for IVF clinics, only 13 countries were examined for ART cycles. Hence, the results are more likely to be influenced by outliers. For example, despite a relatively high usage of ART cycles in Denmark, individuals residing there reported relatively low maternal childbearing deadline ages on average. Another potential explanation is that individuals from countries with high ART utilization rates are more likely to be aware of the physical and psychological burden of ART treatments and this may negatively influence perceptions of late pregnancy and postponement. ART treatments can often be physically, emotionally, and economically draining [51] . Studies show that ART treatment cycles induce significant stress, especially for women [52] . Gamerio et al.'s study reported the psychological burden and relational and personal problems associated with ART treatments [53] . As ART is emotionally and physically demanding, individuals and couples going through infertility cope with the challenges through social support (i.e., friends and families). Peterson et al. [54] surveyed men and women, diagnosed with infertility and referred to university-affiliated hospitals for IVF from 1995-2001, to examine infertility stress and found that whilst women sought more to social support (i.e., talking to friends and families about the infertility) to cope with infertility stress compared with men, men sought more to self-controlling (i.e., keeping feeling about the infertility to oneself and trying to keep these feelings from interfering with daily activities) and distancing (i.e., making light of the infertility). Based on such results, the authors assume that individuals residing in countries with higher ART usage may be more aware of the emotional and physical burdens of ART treatments, especially for women, as described to them by friends or family members who have experienced ART treatments. Hence, social sentiments and perceptions against late maternal childbearing may also be more negative. On the other hand, with regard to ART cycles and paternal childbearing deadline ages, our multivariate results showed that there was no statistically significant association, which may be because men are less likely to talk about their fertility issues and treatment experiences than women. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

This may be because the rate of ART infants per national births is relatively low (i.e., 1.3-4.1%), perhaps too low to significantly affect public perceptions. The association between ART infants and individuals' perception of childbearing deadline ages disappeared once other factors were considered. Our multivariate analyses showed that individual demographic factors such as age, marital status, education, health, and number of children had a more significant effect in determining people's perception of childbearing deadline ages than a country's number of ART infants.",

            "text": "Lastly, interestingly, our multivariate results indicated an especially strong association between respondents' ages and their perceptions of childbearing deadline ages. Results showed that younger respondents were significantly more generous with maternal childbearing deadline age but stricter with paternal childbearing deadline age. These results indicate differences in the perception of childbearing and gender roles across generations. First, younger generations are more likely to be understanding of late marriage and more knowledgeable about ART than older generations and hence, they are more likely to be generous about late motherhood than older generations. In the EU, for instance, the share of births to mothers aged 40 or over has increased from 1.6% in the late 1980s to 3.0% in 2006 [55] . Also, some studies denote that older mothers tend to be in more stable relationships, are more highly educated, and are more economically sound than younger mothers, and hence, tend to provide a more stable and positive environment for children than younger mothers [56, 57] . Second, on the contrary, younger generations were stricter with late fatherhood than older generations. The authors assume that this is because younger generations perceive fatherhood more in relation to childrearing capability than biological capability. In fact, according to Finley's study adolescents born to fathers who were aged 40 or over evaluated their fathers' parental quality lower than those whose fathers were aged 30-39 [58] . Whilst older generations considered paternal childbearing age primarily based on biological capabilities, younger generations view childbearing age in relation to whether one can adequately raise a child [59] [60] [61] .",

            "text": "The present study is the first to empirically examine the association between the availability and prevalence of countries' ART and people's perception of childbearing deadline ages. The authors understand that the data is relatively old, however, until now, it is the only quantitative data that examines people's changing perception of childbearing ages, especially across multiple countries. However, findings from the study provide important insights into understanding people's perception of childbearing deadline ages and reproductive technology. First, in this study, we discovered that younger generations were more generous with maternal childbearing ages but stricter with paternal childbearing ages. Second, we discovered that respondents residing in countries with higher number of IVF clinics were significantly more generous maternal childbearing ages but the association was not significant with regard to paternal childbearing ages, which indicate that although ART is used to tackle both male and female infertility, social perceptions think it is primarily for female infertility. Third, we discovered, contrary to our expectations, respondents residing in countries with higher utilization of ART treatments were stricter with late maternal childbearing ages, which, we assume maybe because they are more likely to be aware of the physiological and financial difficulties of ART treatments. Further studies are needed to explore this matter. As the first study to explore social perceptions of childbearing deadline age in relation to ART availability and prevalence, this study has laid the foundation for further research in this area. Overall, the present study discovered that gender bias exists in the perception of the use of IVF clinics and ART. As only a limited number of studies have explored ART and gender norms [62, 63] , it will be interesting to see if this gender bias persists in the future as male use of ART increases and efforts to improve gender equality continue. Although in our study, the advancement of ART and increased IVF clinics have shown to relax public perception of late motherhood, this result may be a reflection of the gender bias in people's perception that infertility treamtments are primarily for women and the advancement of ART may possibly also act as a reinforcer to gender bias. We hope our study raise awareness on this issue and contribute to enhancing women's autonomy and empowerment in reproductive health. We call for future updated studies to explore that cover a more diverse set of countries and examine how the relationships change over time. ",
