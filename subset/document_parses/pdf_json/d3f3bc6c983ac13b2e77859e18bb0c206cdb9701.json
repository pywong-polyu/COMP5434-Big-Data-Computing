Mobile robots using two independent driving wheels have mobility restrictions to one direction and are not able to perform transversal displacements. Alternatively, omnidirectional mobile robots usually have four mecanum wheels [15] or three or four synchro-drive wheels [16] with individual control of the orientation and rotation speed. These omnidirectional configurations can perform transversal displacements but have limitations when performing combined or fast displacements [17] . These motion limitations do not exist when using three or four optimal omnidirectional wheels [18] , but then the kinematic control becomes more complex, the wheel assembly requires the use of expensive machinery, and the motion system is prone to the generation of vibrations due to wheel discontinuities [19] [20] [21] .",

[22] , which uses a three-wheel omnidirectional motion system based on the implementation of an optimal omnidirectional wheel [18] . The basic idea of the optimal omnidirectional wheel is the minimization of the gap between the free rollers that proved the omnidirectional capabilities. The advantage of this configuration is the implementation of the omnidirectional capabilities with only three omnidirectional wheels and three motors. However, this optimal configuration has the drawbacks of the high force applied to the thinnest part of the pieces that support of the free rollers, the large number of parts required to assemble a wheel, the high complexity and cost of the manufacturing of these pieces in durable aluminum using computer numerical control (CNC), and the generation of vibrations due to the rotation of the omnidirectional wheel. In the case of the APR, the tall frame of the mobile robot amplified the vibrations generated by the rotation of the omnidirectional wheels, causing the robot head to vibrate ostensibly and limiting the practical application of this mobile robot.",

This non-optimal or suboptimal design and implementation is proposed to take advance of standard mass-produced pieces and cheap 3D printing in order to reduce the expensive manufacturing cost required by the optimal omnidirectional wheels used currently in APR mobile robots. However, it must be expected that the use of a suboptimal omnidirectional wheel will generate higher vibrations during the rotations, so the question that arises is whether the existing passive suspension system will be able to also reduce the higher vibrations generated by a suboptimal omnidirectional wheel. If the answer to this question is no, then the use of suboptimal omnidirectional wheels in APR mobile robots will require further improvements such as the implementation of active control strategies focused on the problem originated by the impact of the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel with the floor, as is done, for example, in hexapod wheel-legged robots [9] . However, this paper proves that the answer to this question is yes, the existing passive suspension system is able to reduce the transmission of vibrations from the wheel to the head of a tall APR mobile robot. Therefore, the mobile robot will benefit from using much cheaper omnidirectional wheels and even get outdoor capabilities thanks to the additional grip provided by the gap between the free rollers of the omnidirectional wheels.",

The brushed DC motors are controlled with the VNH5019A-E H-bridge motor driver designed for harsh automotive environments. This H-bridge is an updated version of the VNH2SP30-E originally used in APR robots. This H-bridge motor provides motor direction control, brake condition, PWM control up to 20 kHz, current monitoring, and an operation range of up to 41 V and 30 A. The low-cost brushed DC motors of APR robots have a magnetic rotary encoder based on a six-pole magnet and two Hall-effect sensors (U18 sensor from Unisonic Technologies CO.LTD) located 90 \u2022 out of phase to each other, generating three pulses per motor turn. The rotation speed of the motor is deduced by measuring the elapsed time between two pulses. This measurement is performed with timer 2 configured as an input capture. This timer is a 32\u2212bit clock configured to operate with an internal clock of 84 MHz. These configurations automatically provide a clock counter value when detecting a rising edge transition in the input signal. Then a routine computes the difference between two consecutive counter values and provides an updated estimate of the rotating speed of the motor three times per motor turn. The vibrations are measured with an onboard LIS3DSH accelerometer, an ultra-low-power high-performance three-axis linear accelerometer with a serial port interface (SPI) communication already used as onboard sensor on APR robots. This accelerometer has a dynamic measurement range selectable between \u00b12 and \u00b116 g, a sensitivity between 0.06 and 0.73 mg/digit, and a sampling rate of up to 1.6 kHz. The standard deviation of the acceleration measured in the X-, Y-, and Z-axes at zero speed were 8.04 mm/s 2 , 10.04 mm/s 2 , and 11.94 mm/s 2 , respectively. The configuration selected for the development of the experiments was a dynamic range of \u00b12 g, a sensitivity of 0.06 mg/digit, and a sampling rate of 1 kHz.",

This plotting method is based on drawing a box from the first quartile (Q1) to the third quartile (Q3), a central mark indicating the median, and extending lines indicating variability outside the interquartile range (IQR), computed as the distance between the third and first quartile (IQR = Q3 \u2212 Q1), a value that represents 50% of the distributed data.

In both cases the combined roof profile of the rollers is designed to coincide with the expected profile of a round wheel. This design enables the reduction in the gap that is only limited by the mechanical precision of the CNC machines used to create the rollers and the intricate inner support piece and the precision of the machines used to create the cover of the free rollers. In the omnidirectional wheels of APR-01 and APR-02 the value of this gap was only 2.5 mm but the manufacturing cost of these three wheels represented approximately 25% of the final cost of the complete mobile robot.

The advantages of using a rim based on 3D printing are the simplification of the manufacturing procedure and the reduction of the manufacturing cost. However, the most important advantage of 3D printing is the capability to create mechanical pieces with intricate internal and external shapes and holes that, in most cases, are very difficult to reproduce with CNC or plastic injection. Figure 5b shows a partial CAD image covering the main parts of the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel proposed in this paper. The omnidirectional performances of the wheel are provided by 23 skate wheels used as transversal passive rollers. We selected the most common, easy to achieve, and cheap skate wheels: diameter 63 mm, hardness 82A. All the skate wheels have a hollow inner shaft that simplifies the support of the wheel to a fixed structure. Figure 6a shows a detail of the shape of the clamps proposed to support This optimal implementation also had other drawbacks: (1) the aluminum implementation of a complete omnidirectional wheel was very heavy, around 2.667 kg per wheel and thus 8.001 kg per mobile robot, and (2) the plain sliding profile of the covers of the rollers provided a poor grip. This plain cover profile is typically used in omnidirectional wheels because the use of friction bands may contribute to increasing the vibrations generated by the omnidirectional wheel. This typical plain profile may seem adequate for a flat and clean indoor floor but has strong practical limitations when the omnidirectional wheel has to pass over very small objects placed on the floor, such as wires that usually stop the motion or alter the direction of the motion of the omnidirectional wheel. In practice, this strong limitation to passing over small objects can have unexpected operational limitations because a mobile robot using this omnidirectional wheel can be easily blocked when trying to enter or exit the elevator in case of misalignment between the floor of the elevator and the floor or even when trying to pass over the expansion joint of a large building.",

The advantages of using a rim based on 3D printing are the simplification of the manufacturing procedure and the reduction of the manufacturing cost. However, the most important advantage of 3D printing is the capability to create mechanical pieces with intricate internal and external shapes and holes that, in most cases, are very difficult to reproduce with CNC or plastic injection. Figure 5b shows a partial CAD image covering the main parts of the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel proposed in this paper. The omnidirectional performances of the wheel are provided by 23 skate wheels used as transversal passive rollers. We selected the most common, easy to achieve, and cheap skate wheels: diameter 63 mm, hardness 82A. All the skate wheels have a hollow inner shaft that simplifies the support of the wheel to a fixed structure. Figure 6a shows a detail of the shape of the clamps proposed to support the skate wheels. Figure 6b shows the inner part of the clamps that have a circular slot to fit in and retain the axes of the rollers; one of the clamps is thinner and has an additional clearance in order to facilitate the entry of the last skate wheel attached to the rim. The shape of the clamps has free space to allow the rotation of the skate wheels without getting blocked by small objects. The axis of the DC motor of the mobile robot is also fitted in the center of the rim and locked with a screw. ",

The specific 3D printing configuration of this soft rim was the use of a honeycomb internal structure with an infill density of only 10%. This soft rim was printed in 6 h 58 min and using 121.34 g of PLA. This printing configuration produces almost empty pieces with very low density and printing material usage. The combination of this low infill and the honeycomb internal support structure has the advantage of increasing the flexibility of large pieces. The final weight of the complete suboptimal omnidirectional wheel based on a soft rim was 1.773 kg, which represented a reduction of 33% in the weight relative to the optimal wheel implemented in aluminum. Moreover, the total number of pieces included in one complete omnidirectional wheel was reduced by 56%: 23 commercial low-cost skate wheels, one rim, and one screw, and the manufacturing cost was reduced one order of magnitude. In this case, the insertion of the skate wheels in this soft rim was simple thanks to the flexibility of the clamps. The suboptimal omnidirectional wheel obtained with this soft rim had a solid appearance because the skate wheels provided additional transversal resistance to the clamps.

This experimental configuration simplifies the experimentation with only one omnidirectional wheel but does not summarize all the effects generated during a motion. In this case the acceleration patterns were measured by placing the measurement module over the DC motor of the omnidirectional wheel and in the location of point A of the mobile robot. In this comparative experiment the measurement module was configured to apply power only to the omnidirectional wheel being tested. Then the measurement module applied power to one DC motor, measured the rotational speed of the motor, and measured the accelerations generated during the experiment. The application of different PWM simulated different operation conditions of the omnidirectional wheel. Figure 8 shows the optimal and suboptimal wheel and the evolution of the rotational speed directly measured by the encoder of the DC motor attached to the wheel in the case of very low rotation speed (20% PWM) and no control loop applied to the DC motor. The evolution of the rotational speed revealed the main differences of the optimal and the suboptimal wheels and the effect that generated the vibrations transferred to the structure of the mobile robot. However, this difference in the evolution of the rotational speed was not easy measurable at higher rotation speeds because of the inertia of the wheel and the low resolution of the encoder. Figure 8a shows a detail of the optimal omnidirectional wheel in contact with the floor and Figure 8c the evolution of the rotational speed of the DC motor using this optimal omnidirectional wheel. In this case, the minimum gap of the optimal omnidirectional slightly affected the rotation of the DC motor. Alternatively, Figure 8b shows a detail of the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel in contact with the floor and Figure 8d shows that the huge gap between the skate wheels had a strong influence on the rotation of the DC motor that drives the wheel. This periodic reduction of the rotational speed was alternative evidence that confirmed that the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel generated more vibrations than the optimal implementation due to the effect of the impact of the free rollers with the floor. Figures 9-11 summarize the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis acceleration measured directly on the motor that drives the omnidirectional wheel. These figures show that (1) the IQR of the acceleration patterns increased as the PWM and the rotational speed of the DC motor increased, and (2) the IQR of the acceleration patters obtained using the suboptimal omnidirectional wheels in a range of a PWM of up to 60% were similar or slightly higher when using the optimal omnidirectional wheel. Figure 9 shows that the IQR ratio between the two wheels in the X-axis increased up to 100% for a PWM of 90%.

Results show that the flexibility of the soft rim did not contribute to reduce the transmission of vibrations from the wheel to the structure of the mobile robot, especially in the Z-axis ( Figure 14) . A closer inspection of the rotation of the soft suboptimal omnidirectional wheel revealed an asymmetric deformation of the wheel that contributed to a worse transmission of vibrations to the structure of the mobile robot. We repeated these experiments with different wheels in order to discard the coincidence of having had printing problems or having used a corrupted PLA but the results were the same in all experiments. After discarding many hypotheses we found the motivation for this asymmetric deformation during a rotation in the image of Figure 7a . This image shows that the internal honeycomb structure had no radial symmetry, meaning that the different clamps of the rim had a different internal honeycomb support structure. Therefore, the resistance to deformation of the clamps was not constant and produced an asymmetric deformation of the soft rim during a rotation. This problem cannot be solved easily by changing the infill pattern or the slicer program because none of the standard infill patterns provide radial symmetry. At this moment, the solution to this problem requires the redesign of the soft rim as an empty piece and the incorporation of a custom radial infill pattern, but we discarded this alternative as it may require additional experimental validation of the improvement. Therefore, as an alternative to the optimal omnidirectional wheel used in the APR mobile robots [7, 22] , we propose the use of a suboptimal omnidirectional wheel based on the use of a hard rim created by combining a honeycomb infill patter with a 100% infill density in the inner and outer radial parts of the rim and a honeycomb infill pattern with a 10% infill density in the middle part of the rim.",

            "text": "This section shows the final comparative implementation of the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel design proposed in this paper. This final experiment consisted of the measurement of the amplitude of the accelerations at locations A (base) and B (head) of APR-02 using the proposed suboptimal omnidirectional wheel and a forward velocity equivalent to the application of a PWM of 60% in two of the DC motors. Figure 15a repeats the information in Figure 4 with the inclusion of the new results obtained in this experiment. The largest acceleration was obtained again on the X-axis, longitudinal to the forward displacement of the mobile robot. Figure 15a shows that the IQR of the acceleration measured in the APR-02 mobile robots at location A was almost the same when using the optimal and the suboptimal wheel. The IQR of the acceleration measured in point B of the APR02 with the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel was 54% lower than APR-01 and 43% higher than the APR-02 using the original optimal omnidirectional wheel. These acceleration levels were not visually perceived as a problem and did not compromise the practical operation of the mobile robot using the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel. Figure 15b shows an image of mobile robot APR-03 (a clone of APR-02) used to additionally validate the results obtained with the suboptimal omnidirectional wheels proposed in this paper. Finally, Figure 16 details the IQR of the amplitude of the acceleration measured at point B (head) of the APR\u221203 using the suboptimal omnidirectional wheels and different PWM. In this case the PWM value represents the PWM level applied to the two frontal DC motors of the APR\u221203 mobile robot, and the third motor was electrically braked in order to generate a forward displacement. These final results obtained with this alternative APR\u221203 mobile robot prototype confirmed the results obtained with the APR\u221202. Figure 16 shows that the IQR of the acceleration obtained with the APR\u221203 robot prototype for a PWM of 60% was almost the same as that obtained with the APR\u221202 prototype. These results also show that the IQR linearly decreased if the PWM applied was lower than this 60% nominal reference value. Finally, Figure 16 details the IQR of the amplitude of the acceleration measured at point B (head) of the APR-03 using the suboptimal omnidirectional wheels and different PWM.

The optimal omnidirectional wheels were originally manufactured in aluminum and CNC and the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel proposed is based on the combined use of commercial low-cost skate wheels designed for heavy usage and 3D printing, which allows for the creation of complex shapes and geometries with hollow parts and different infill patterns and densities.",

On the other hand, the main disadvantage of a suboptimal omnidirectional wheel is that a larger gap between rollers produces a greater impact force with the floor, generating more vibrations as a consequence of the rotation of the wheels. However, the main comparative advantages of the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel proposed in this paper are its low manufacturing cost and the possibility of taking advantage of the gap to pass over small objects or wires that usually stop a mobile robot using optimal omnidirectional wheels. Additionally, the toothed shape of the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel opens the possibility of providing traction outdoors and even on unpaved surfaces.",

Additionally, an APR-03 prototype, which is a clone of APR-02, was used to validate the results obtained with APR-02. The experimental results obtained with mobile robots APR-01 without a suspension system and APR-02 with a passive suspension system validated the results of Moreno et al. [21] and confirmed that the use of a passive suspension system largely reduces the transmission of vibrations from the wheels to the head of this heavy-weighted and tall omnidirectional mobile robot.",

In the same case, the acceleration measured in the head of APR-02 (measurement point B) was 43% higher because of the use of the suboptimal omnidirectional wheels, although this vibration levels were not visually perceived and did not compromise the practical application of the mobile robot using the suboptimal omnidirectional wheel. Comparatively, the APR-02 mobile robot with suboptimal omnidirectional wheels had better performance than the APR-01 mobile robot prototype presented by Clotet et al. [22] . In this case the APR-02 mobile robot moving forward at its nominal velocity reduced the acceleration levels measured in the APR-01 by 54%, and the cost of manufacturing the omnidirectional wheels was reduced one order of magnitude. These improvements were additionally validated using a third mobile robot prototype with the same passive suspension and obtaining similar results.",
