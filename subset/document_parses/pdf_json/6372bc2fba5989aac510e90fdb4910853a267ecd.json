One of the most typical interventions is the social distancing such as lockdown that would contribute to reduce the number of contacts among undiagnosed individuals. However, prolongation of the period of such a restrictive intervention could hugely affect the social and economic systems, and the outbreak will come back if the strong social distancing policy will end earlier due to the economic damage. Therefore, the social distancing policy should be followed by massive testing accompanied with quarantine to eradicate the infection. Methods: In this paper, we construct a mathematical model and discuss the effect of massive testing with quarantine, which would be less likely to affect the social and economic systems, and its efficacy has been proved in South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and Hong Kong. Results: By numerical calculation, we show that the control reproduction number is monotone decreasing and convex downward with respect to the testing rate, which implies that the improvement of the testing rate would highly contribute to reduce the epidemic size if the original testing rate is small. Moreover, we show that the recurrence of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan could be possible after the lifting of the state of emergency if there is no massive testing and quarantine. Conclusions: If we have entered into an explosive phase of the epidemic, the massive testing could be a strong tool to prevent the disease as long as the positively reacted individuals will be effectively quarantined, no matter whether the positive reaction is pseudo or not. Since total population could be seen as a superposition of smaller communities, we could understand how testing and quarantine policy might be powerful to control the disease.",

Since COVID-19 has high infectivity before symptom onset [10] , testing would be one of the most effective ways to reduce the number of contacts among individuals with no symptoms.

The dependence on r of the control state-reproduction number T r and the critical reduction ratio q r (which are given by (10) and (11), respectively). Figure 6 suggests us that if the social distancing leads to about 60% reduction of the contact rates (r = 0.6), then the disease can be eradicated without extra quarantine measure for symptomatic individuals. Moreover, it also suggests that even if the social distancing leads to relatively mild reduction of the contact rates, the disease can be eradicated with sufficient quarantine of symptomatic individuals. For instance, if r = 0.3 (30% reduction of the contact rates by social distancing), then q r = 0.80 (95%CI, 0.73 \u2212 0.87), which implies that 80% reduction of the symptomatic individuals' contact rate by massive testing and quarantine could result in the eradication of the disease. Note that detection and quarantine of symptomatic individuals would be much easier than that of asymptomatic individuals. Thus, q r = 0.80 might not be an unrealistic goal.",

This fact has been used to support the early control strategy such that instead of widespread testing, symptomatic individuals and asymptomatic individuals linked to infected local groups should be mainly targeted for testing, because their prior probability of positive is high and the positive predictive value is also high, so we can avoid quarantine of pseudo-positive individuals. However, as confirmed case numbers are rising, contact tracing is more difficult, many transmission routes that don't involve observed infection clusters appear, and so community spread in the big cities will be missed.

In the asymptomatic transmission model (1), we implicitly assume that all exposed individuals will finally become symptomatic, so they are becoming observable. On the other hand, it is reported that for covid-19 virus, there are many infecteds without symptom, who are unobservable infecteds as long as they are not tested. It is our future challenge to extend the basic model to examine the effect of existence of never symptomatic individuals.",
