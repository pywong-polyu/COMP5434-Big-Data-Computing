The most recent evidence from the Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change finds declining trends in yield potential of major crops, rising heatwave exposures, and increasing climate suitability for the transmission of infectious diseases, putting at risk the health and wellbeing of children around the world. However, if children are considered at the core of planning and implementation, the policy responses to climate change could yield enormous benefits for the health and wellbeing of children throughout their lives. Child health professionals have a role to play in ensuring this, with the beneficiaries of their involvement ranging from the individual child to the global community. The newly established Children in All Policies 2030 initiative will work with the Lancet Countdown to provide the evidence on the climate change responses necessary to protect and promote the health of children.",

Unless the global response rapidly accelerates towards decarbonisation, it is set to warm to 3 C or more by the end of the century. 3 A new study shows the planet is trapping roughly double the amount of heat in the atmosphere than it did nearly 15 years ago, far more rapidly than expected. 4 Children are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. 5 Harmful exposures during childhood can irreversibly define physical and mental health and wellbeing, and children's reliance on adults for their physical safety and emotional development limits their capacity to control their environment. Through increased exposure to extreme weather events, increased environmental suitability for infectious disease transmission and threats to food and water security, climate change will directly impact on children's health and add extra pressure on already overwhelmed health systems, further undermining the rights of the child to good health and access to health care, to an adequate standard of living and to social security. 6 The impacts of climate change and subsequent inequalities will be felt most by the world's poorest children. Children born today will inherit a warming world, facing increasing impacts of climate change throughout their lifetimes.",

However, further work is needed to quantify how these are impacting on children's health specifically, and to capture other climate change-related impacts of particular importance to them, such as those on mental health and migration. This task is complicated by the lack of standardised data at a global scale: while large amounts of data on child health and wellbeing are collected around the world, these are often not comparable between different locations. 8 Moreover, even in cases where child health and development indicators exist, attributing observed changes in health to climate change risks still remains a challenge.

The importance of this was recognised in the 1992 Rio Declaration. 21 Yet, 30 years on, children and young people are still frustrated that not enough has been done to act on climate change, and that their voices and their futures are not being adequately consideredand they are calling for action. Millions of children and young people were mobilised through the School Strikes for Climate movement of 2019, demanding adults to protect their futures. Greta Thunberg is renowned for raising these demands, and for highlighting the urgency of the climate crisis from a young person's perspective. Many other young persons have emerged over the past few years as influential activists, including the First Nation Canadian teenager, Autumn Peltier (who campaigns for clean water for Indigenous communities) and Lesein Mutunkei (a Kenyan high school student who has creatively raised awareness about deforestation).

They can also raise the voice of children and young people, working with and supporting advocacy efforts in relevant fora, and ensuring that they are meaningfully involved in policy processes. Moreover, as authoritative voices on the subject, child health professionals can contribute to educating and building awareness on climate change and health, and through data collection and research, they can help bridge the gaps in data and evidence. Importantly, all health professionals also have a role to play in climate change mitigation itself: the health-care sector is responsible for around 5% of total global emissions (Indicator 3.6: Healthcare Sector Emissions). 7 To keep their oath of 'doing no harm', they must promote decarbonisation of their own practice.",
