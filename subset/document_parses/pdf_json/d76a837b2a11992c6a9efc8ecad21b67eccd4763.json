Correlation analysis between COVID-19 death numbers and different demographic and socioeconomic factors for all world countries (n=210) as of June 1, 2020, reveals that COVID-19 deaths per million population in a country signi cantly correlates with the country's median age (r=0.48, p=4.8e-4) and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) (r=0.55, p=4.14e-5), and inversely correlates with the country's Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination rate (r=-0.63, p=9.9e-7). COVID-19 death is found not signi cantly associated, however, with a country's policy stringency index, population density, extreme poverty rate, hospital beds availability per thousand people, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) immunization. Old age is likely a confounding factor for the correlation between COVID-19 and per capita GDP (r=0.66, p=2.3e-7). To control for possible confounding effects of age, countries with similar median age were grouped and analyzed. The inverse correlation between BCG vaccination rates and COVID-19 case (r=-0.338, p=0.0082) and death (r=-0.411, p=0.0011) remained signi cant among the top 61 countries with highest median age.

Some of the observations were made in the early stages of the disease transmission when COVID-19 data are still accumulating, hindering the ability to draw meaningful conclusions. Now more than six months have passed since COVID-19 started and all countries have been affected, it is time to examine its transmission again and to identify factors that are most important for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

So most densely populated counties (or special regions), such as Monaco, Singapore, and Hong Kong, do have the highest number of COVI-19 cases or deaths, even based on per million population.

The stringency data are incomplete (119 countries are missing data) and do not necessarily re ect the real timely responses and control in the complex situations of countries. Furthermore, contrary to a perception that low living standard and poverty may incur high number of COVID-19 casualty, it is found that the high numbers of per million COIVD-19 cases and deaths are associated with high per capita gross domestic product (GDP), a general measure of a country's wealth.
