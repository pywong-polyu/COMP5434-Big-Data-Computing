Methods: We analysed clinical features in a cohort of 173 children with between January 22, 2020 and March 15, 2020. We systematically examined the expression and distribution of ACE2 in different developmental stages of children by using a combination of children's lung biopsies, pluripotent stem cell-derived lung cells, RNA-sequencing profiles, and ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infections. Results: It revealed that infants (< 1yrs.-old), with a weaker potency of immune response, are more vulnerable to develop pneumonia whereas older children (> 1 yrs.-old) are more resistant to lung injury. The expression levels of ACE2 however do not vary by age in children's lung. ACE2 is notably expressed Ivyspring International Publisher pluripotent stem cell derivatives and infants' lungs. The ACE2 + SOX9 + cells are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and the numbers of the double positive cells are significantly decreased in older children.",

ACE2 expression in multiple types of lung cells including SOX9 positive progenitor cells, in cooperation with an unestablished immune system, could be risk factors contributing to vulnerability of infants with COVID-19. There is a need to continue monitoring lung development in young children who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 has resulted in a global health crisis, the like of which hasn't been seen in over a century. By 29 th October, the number of confirmed cases had surpassed 45 million globally with more than 1,180,000 deaths (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu) [1] . Compared with the adult population, children with COVID-19 generally display milder symptoms and lower mortality [2, 3] . Our recent report indicates a high frequency of oral-rectal transmission and generally mild clinical features among infected children [4] . Nevertheless, with the rapid spread of COVID-19 globally, an increasing number of severe or even fatal infections is being reported in children [5] [6] [7] . Although the mortality of COVID-19 in children is low, the health of children is concerned widely because COVID-19 is a novel disease, lacking evidence-base for formulating clinical decisions [8] . Moreover, there is very little information about the underlying risk factors and spectrum of vulnerability to COVID-19 in children. The lung is the primary target of COVID-19 and ACE2 is known to be the cell-entry receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [9] [10] [11] . However, the risk factors for the COVID-19 in children remain elusive. One possibility is that the milder disease in paediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection might be associated with the different patterns of ACE2 expression and immune responses [12] . Recent reports indicate that the expression of ACE2 in the lungs increases with age and is particularly high in adults who smoke [13] . We sought to understand the clinical characteristics of paediatric patients with COVID-19 and whether expression of ACE2 in lungs was associated with the disease prognosis in children. We systematically analyzed the clinical features of 173 children with COVID-19 including laboratory parameters of the immune system. The respiratory system is the most vulnerable target of SARS-CoV-2. Lung development begins at an early embryonic stage and continues after birth until adolescence [14] [15] [16] . Lung progenitor cells are essentially involved in lung branching morphogenesis, cell growth, maturation, injury, and repair [17] . Therefore, we also examined the profiles of ACE2 expression in lung progenitor cells at embryonic-like stage by using hESC-derived lung cells, at infants and older children stages by using lung biopsy tissues respectively. Finally, we employed SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infection in living lung tissues, to study the correlation of ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection in children at different ages.",

The single cell suspension was achieved through sorting the dissociated cells in flow cytometry singlets. Cell count was adjusted to 1000-2000 cells per \u03bcL to target an estimated capture of 8000 cells. We filtered cells with less than 200 or more than 4000 genes detected as well as cells with mitochondria gene content greater than 20%, remaining 10238 and 11058 cells in 2 biological replicates, respectively. We normalized the UMI counts per cell by the size factors and took a logarithm transform using the Normalize function. We identified highly variable genes and selected the top 2000 variable genes for downstream analysis. We scaled the normalized counts and performed PCA on the highly variable genes using the ScaleData and RunPCA functions in the R Seurat package. We selected the top 40 PCs for downstream visualization and clustering analysis. We ran UMAP dimensional reduction using the RunUMAP function and then grouping cells of similar transcriptome profiles using the FindNeighbors function and FindClusters function (resolution = 0.15) in the R Seurat package. We identified marker genes using the FindMarkers function in the R Seurat package for further analysis. We re-identified marker genes for the merged 8 clusters and selected top TF and surface marker genes per cluster for heatmap plot using the DoHeatmap function in the R Seurat package.

            "text": "At first, we examined the distribution of ACE2 positive (ACE2 + ) cells in the lungs of age-matched children's biopsies. To minimize interference from individual variants, at least nine biological replicates of lung samples were used in each age group. Twenty views in each lung sections were counted, and averaged cell numbers per 0.025 mm 2 were used to define the distributions of ACE2 + cells in the lung tissues as described [28] . ACE2 expression in the lungs of infants, and children up to 15 years of age was evaluated. It revealed that the protein levels of ACE2 in the lung did not significantly vary by age in children's lungs (Figure 2A ), indicating all children in different ages could be similarly susceptible of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, our results showed that ACE2 + cells were widely distributed throughout the whole lung including the bronchus and alveolus regions ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that these two regions are the high-risk zones targeted by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mRNA expression level of bronchus progenitor marker genes, SOX9 and SOX2, sharply decreased ( Figure 2C vi and vii) ; in contrast, the ratio of SFTPC/SFTPB, the hallmark of maturation of AT II cells in the lungs, gradually increased with age ( Figure 2C viii-x, p < 0.05). Importantly, ACE2 expression was detected in some of SOX9 positive (SOX9 + ) lung progenitor cells in infants' lungs ( Figure 2C iii) but not SOX2 positive cells (Data not shown). In addition, ACE2 was also expressed in SFTPC positive (SFTPC + ) cells ( Figure 2C iv), the AT II cells, but not SFTPB positive cells (Data not shown). SFTPC + ATII cells were reported as a progenitor cells with a potential to differentiate into AT I cells during lung injury-repair or disease [31] [32] [33] . However, ACE2 was rarely detected in SCGB1A1-expressed epithelial cells and KRT5 positive airway basal progenitor cells. These results indicated that ACE2 was specifically expressed in certain types of lung progenitor cells in infants, raising concerns that SARS-CoV-2 may also attack lung progenitor cells of them.",

The lung progenitor cells were further differentiated to the major types of cells found in human lung epithelium by Day 50-55 ( Figure S2A ) [24, 25, 34] . We further characterized the hESC-derived lung cells at day 50 by single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing. Two major distinct populations, stromal cells, and epithelial cells, were identified ( Figure S3A -H) and 8 sub-clusters were annotated by their signature genes ( Figure 3A and 3C). scRNA analysis showed that expression of ACE2, SOX2, SOX9, SFTPB, and ABCA3 was distributed in the populations of lung epithelial cells ( Figure 3B, Figure S3H ). Main marker genes of stromal cells, such as COL1A1, PDGFRA, APOE, and DCN were mainly enriched in cluster 1, 4, and 6 ( Figure 3B-D) . AT II cell-related markers such as SFTPB, SFTPC, MUC1, and ABCA3 were mainly expressed in cluster 5 ( Figure 3B-D) . One-way ANOVA was used to examine the tendency of changes with increased ages, The levels of SOX9, SOX2, SFTPB, SFTPC, and SFTPB/SFTPC were significantly changed (all p < 0.05) except ACE2 not changed (p > 0.05); following Newman-Keuls test was used for pairwise comparison, *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001, vs. infants (0-1yr). Further clustering of scRNA profiles by UMAP revealed that the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were mainly enriched in the clusters representing distal (SOX9 + ) lung progenitor cells and AT II cells, but not in SOX9 + SOX2 + , SOX2 + , SFTPC + HOPX + , SOX9 + HOPX + , or SFTPC + SOX9 + progenitor cells. (Figure 3D -G and Figure S3I-L) . Immunostaining results further validated the expression of ACE2 in SOX9 + cells and SFTPC + cells ( Figure 3H ). In consistence with the results from in vivo studies (Figure 2) , the in vitro lung differentiation model confirmed the expression of ACE2 in lung SOX9 + progenitor and AT II cells, suggesting the high risk that SARS-CoV-2 can attack lung progenitor cells in infants.",

Robust luciferase activity was readily detected in the human ESC-derived lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2-entry virus. The co-localization of ACE2, LUC (Luciferase), and SOX9 indicated the successful infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2 + /SOX9 + progenitor of lung ( Figure 4A ). To determine whether native infant or children lung cells that express ACE2 are the target of SARS-CoV-2 virus, we next infected ex vivo live lung tissues with SARS-CoV-2-GFP pseudovirus (nCov-GFP-pseudovirus). Lung tissues were obtained from biopsies of infants or children who were undergoing surgeries for lung abscess. After 48 hours of nCov-GFP-pseudovirus infection at a concentration of 1\u00d710 5 TU, lung tissues were washed, fixed, and cryo-sectioned for immunostaining. ACE2 was detected in lung tissues ( Figure 4B i and v) . These lung tissues were used for control ( Figure 4B i and v) or for nCov-GFP-pseudovirus infection. After lung tissues were exposed to nCov-GFP-pseudovirus, it reveals that ACE2 expressed cells (red) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (green) as evidenced by the co-location of ACE2 and nCov ( Figure 4A ii-iv and vi-viii). This suggests that infants and children, like adults, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also indicates that in children, infection causes milder lung damage and lower mortality, possibly due to their immune response to SARS-CoV-2 invasion and ability of progenitor cells to rapidly regenerate and repair, rather than their resistance to cell-entry by the virus.",

No remarkable difference of ACE2 expression was found in lung tissues between infants and older children in mRNA and protein levels. The ACE2 + cells were similarly distributed in bronchus and alveolus between infants and older children as well but infants are more vulnerable to develop into severe condition. These findings indicate it is insufficient to prognose disease severity simply by the profiles of ACE2 expression and distribution in patients with COVID-19.",

Since lung development continues after birth, particularly during the first year of life, it is essential to maintain sufficient lung progenitor cells for rapid lung development and repair [14, 15, 37] . We therefore examined if the ACE2 expression in lung progenitor cells may contribute to the different severity of disease between infants and older children with COVID-19. Lung tissue from an infant and an older child were exposed to supernatants without nCoV-pseudovirus as control (i-iii). Lung tissue (iv-vi) from an infant and an older child were infected by nCov-GFP-pseudovirus supernatant (iv-xii). Immunostaining against ACE2 (red) and GFP to detect nCOV in all lung biopsies. The co-localization of GFP and ACE2 (arrow heads) indicated infection with nCoV-pseudovirus (viii, x, and, xii) in lung cells with ACE2 expression (vii, ix, and, xi). Scale bar = 50 \u00b5m.",

SOX9 + lung progenitor cells were highly enriched in foetal stage during lung morphogenesis and branching, and lasted in neonate and infant stage, then disappeared quickly, which was further evidenced by qPCR results (Figure 2C vi) [38, 39] . ACE2-expressed SOX9 + lung progenitor cells were presented in neonates and infants, but rare in older children, (Figure 2C i-iv). Reactivation of SOX9 is also relative to regulate injury repair in alveolar homeostasis and regeneration [40, 41] . To further verify the ACE2 expression in SOX9 + progenitor cells and other lung cells in developing lungs, we used human pluripotent stem cell-derived lung cells as research resources. We differentiated hESC into lung lineage cells and harvested most types of lung cells ( Figure 3 , Figure S2 , and Figure S3 ). scRNA-seq reveals ACE2/TRMPRSS2 is abundantly expressed in SOX9 + lung progenitor cells ( Figure 3H ). Immunostaining results further confirm that ACE2 is expressed in SOX9 + cells and AT II (SFTPC + ) cells. SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection was evident in all lung tissues and hESC-derived cells expressing ACE2 (Figure 4 ). Of note, the first years of life are a critical period for lung development and SOX9 plays a critical role for continuing development of lung. Compared with older children, the infant lung is underdeveloped, and a significant amount of lung progenitor cells are maintained for normal lung development. Although the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown, it is likely that these ACE2 + lung cells including SOX9 + progenitor cells, will be attacked and damaged in the subsequent inflammatory response of SARS-CoV-2 infections [42] .",

Whether the ACE2 expression is influenced under this condition needs further investigations. Second, our study demonstrated ACE2 is expressed and distributed in pluripotent stem cells-derived lung cells. It is a first step toward understanding impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ex vivo model of lung development, but is clearly simplified compared to fully functioning human lung systems in human. Third, bias exists between the investigation in SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infection models and real clinical case. In addition, besides of the pulmonary progenitor cells with ACE2 expression, other progenitor or stem cells were rich in infant lungs. It is unclear in current study if other progenitor or stem cells will play a role to repair the injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
