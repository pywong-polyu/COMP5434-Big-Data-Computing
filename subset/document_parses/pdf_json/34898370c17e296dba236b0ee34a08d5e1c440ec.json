US gastroenterology societies issued guidance to delay elective procedures for reasons including minimizing risk of transmission of infection within hospitals and to vital health care workers. 3 Concern regarding acquiring COVID-19 infection in the workplace and transmitting this to family is a source of significant stress for endoscopy unit personnel across the US. 4 Recognizing these issues, our institution initiated a program for preprocedure COVID-19 testing for all patients undergoing endoscopy starting April 1, 2020. Preprocedure testing was subsequently supported by joint American Gastroenterology Association/Digestive Health Physicians Association guidance on April 27, 2020. 5 We assessed the outcomes and impact of our first 8 weeks of preprocedural screening and testing for COVID-19.",

However, this approach remains varied across US endoscopy centers, with our recent survey indicating that only 52% of responding centers performed testing on all patients before endoscopy. 4 Our institutional data from a low-prevalence region suggests that positivity for COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients undergoing endoscopy is a rare event, detected in only 2 of 999 tests. Thus, in low-prevalence regions, preprocedure symptom screening of patients may arguably be an adequate measure for minimizing risk of infection transmission. Our triple-screening process (gastroenterology clinic, scheduling office, and anesthesia preoperative evaluation clinic) appears to be very effective. Pursuit of testing may therefore potentially be dictated by local prevalence rates, but the additional less tangible benefits of testing merit contemplation.",

Our assumption was that positive testing for COVID-19 within 2 weeks of endoscopy might imply the possibility of a causal relationship with the procedure, whereas community acquisition of infection would be more likely in patients testing positive beyond 2 weeks of their procedure.",
