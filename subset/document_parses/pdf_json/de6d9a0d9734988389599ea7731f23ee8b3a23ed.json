The RT-LAMP assay is a novel method of gene amplification that amplifies nucleic acid with high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity under isothermal conditions with a set of four specially designed primers that recognize six distinct sequences of the target. The whole procedure is very simple and rapid, and reaction time and temperatures were optimized for 60 min at 65 \u2022 C, respectively. Detection of gene amplification could be accomplished by agarose gel electrophoresis. The standardized RT-LAMP procedure was used to detect YHV in the heart and gill from infected shrimp. Thus, the RT-LAMP assay is extremely rapid, cost-effective, sensitive and specific and has potential usefulness for rapid diagnosis for YHV detection in shrimp.",

The LAMP assay is a novel approach to nucleic acid amplification that amplifies DNA with high specificity, selectivity and rapidity under isothermal conditions. Therefore, a thermal cycler is not needed. The LAMP assay originally described by Notomi et al. (2000) is based on the principle of the reaction performed by a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and a set of two specially designed inner primers and two outer primers. LAMP is highly specific for the target sequence because of the recognition of the target sequence by six independent sequences in the initial stage and by four independent sequences in the later stages of the LAMP reaction. The amplification efficiency of the LAMP method is extremely high because of its no time loss for thermal change, based on its isothermal reaction. Therefore, the LAMP assay has the advantage in specificity, selectivity and rapidity over other nucleic acid amplification methods (Mori et al., 2001) .",

A set of four primers composed of two outer and two inner primers was designed. The two outer primers are known as the forward outer primer (F3) and the backward outer primer (B3), which helps in strand displacement. The inner primers are known as the forward inner primer (FIP) and the backward inner primer (BIP). Each primer has two distinct sequences corresponding to the sense and anti-sense sequences of the target, one for priming in the first stage and the other for self-priming in later stages. FIP contains F1c region (complementary to F1), a TTTT spacer and the F2 region. BIP contains the B1c region (complementary to B1), a TTTT spacer and the B2 region. FIP and BIP were HPLC-purified.

Ten-fold serial dilutions (10 \u22121 to 10 \u22128 ) of template RNA were used to determine the sensitivity of the detection. The amplification regime was 30 min at 42 \u2022 C, 2 min at 94 \u2022 C followed by 15 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 20 s, 62 \u2022 C for 20 s and 72 \u2022 C for 30 s, then final elongation for 30 s at 72 \u2022 C and 30 s at 20 \u2022 C. After RT-PCR reaction was completed, 14.0 l of nested PCR PreMix and 1.0 l of IQzyme DNA polymerase were added.

This suggests RT-LAMP is a more rapid method for the detection of shrimp virus, compared to the RT-PCR method which takes 30-60 min for RT reaction and at least 2-3 h for conventional PCR method.
