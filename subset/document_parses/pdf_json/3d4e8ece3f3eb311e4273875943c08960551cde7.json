            "text": "Background: COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading virus infection that has quickly caused extensive burden to individual, families, countries, and the globe. No intervention has yet been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Some randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of different drugs have been published, and more are currently underway. There is an urgent need for a living, dynamic systematic review that continuously evaluates the beneficial and harmful effects of all available interventions for COVID-19. Methods/design: We will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials. We will update the literature search once a week to continuously assess if new evidence is available. Two review authors will independently extract data and perform risk of bias assessment. We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any intervention for the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g., pharmacological interventions, fluid therapy, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or similar interventions) with any comparator (e.g., an \"active\" comparator, standard care, placebo, no intervention, or \"active placebo\") for participants in all age groups with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Risk of bias will be assessed with domains, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). Discussion: COVID-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality. A living systematic review evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of pharmacological and other interventions is urgently needed. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of this highly prevalent disease. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42020178787",

Since the initial outbreak in China, SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally, and COVID-19 has now been labeled a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization [2] . The full spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from subclinical infection over mild, self-limiting respiratory tract illness to severe progressive pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death [3] . Severe disease onset might result in death due to massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure [4] [5] [6] . Currently, COVID-19 is spreading rapidly through Europe and North America [7] . As of April 17, 2020, there were 2,074,529 confirmed patients, 139,378 confirmed deaths, and 213 countries, areas, or territories with COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization [8] .",

It is currently not possible to assess the methodological quality of all these projects because most of these are only summaries of methodologies and not detailed published protocols. Furthermore, multiple new projects are launched every day. We identified three important reviews that are comparable to our present project. The first is a literature review published in JAMA using PubMed to identify relevant English-language articles published through March 25, 2020, on pharmacological interventions for COVID-19. The search resulted in 1315 total articles. Due to the lack of randomized clinical trials, the authors also included case reports, case series, and review articles.

There are four fundamental differences between conventional systematic reviews and living systematic reviews: publication format, work processes, author team management, and statistical methods [19] . In this living systematic review, two independent investigators will receive an updated literature search file and include relevant newly published or unpublished trials once a week. The relevant meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, and network meta-analysis will continuously be updated, and if new evidence is available (judged by the steering committee), the results will be published. Every month, the steering committee will discuss whether searching once a week is necessary. The living systematic review process will be initiated April 27, 2020.

A more detailed description of trial sequential analysis can be found in the trial sequential analysis manual [23] and at http://www.ctu.dk/tsa/. For dichotomous outcomes, we will estimate the required information size based on the observed proportion of patients with an outcome in the control group (the cumulative proportion of patients with an event in the control groups relative to all patients in the control groups), a relative risk reduction or a relative risk increase of 20% or 10%, an alpha of 2% for all our outcomes, a beta of 10%, and the observed diversity as suggested by the trials in the meta-analysis. For continuous outcomes, we will in the Trial Sequential Analysis use the observed standard deviation (SD), a mean difference equal to the observed SD/2, an alpha of 2% for all outcomes, a beta of 10%, and the observed diversity as suggested by the trials in the meta-analysis.",

The network meta-analysis synthesizes evidence for the comparative effectiveness of more than two alternative interventions for the same condition [44] . We will only perform network metaanalysis if a connected network of trials can be conducted. If network meta-analysis is performed, we will, before conducting the network meta-analysis, assess two major assumptions; transitivity and consistency. We will then perform the statistical analysis in five steps. First step is to draw a network geometry in order to overview the network relationship. Second step is to assess for the transitivity assumption across treatment comparisons in the network using boxplots, as well as evaluate the assumption of consistency using the design-by-treatment interaction model as a global test [44, 45] . Third step is to make the network forest plot or interval plot in order to illustrate the summary effect size of the comparative effectiveness among interventions. Fourth step is to calculate cumulative rankings for identifying a superiority among interventions. Last step is to evaluate publication bias or effect modifiers for a valid inference from results. Potential effect modifiers will be the same as the subgroup analyses, i.e., for-profit bias, type of comparator, age, and sex. We will also explore these through network subgroup meta-analyses (see section below). The synthesized evidence through five steps would be useful to evidence-based decision-making in healthcare.

We will justify all decisions to downgrade the quality of evidence using footnotes, and we will make comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary.

The predefined methodology is based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [14] , the eightstep assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. [13] , Trial Sequential Analysis [22] , and GRADE assessment [52] . Hence, this protocol considers both risks of random errors and risks of systematic errors. Another strength of this protocol is that we plan to do a living systematic review, which allows us to continuously surveil the literature and update the evidence-base of existing interventions for treatment of COVID-19 resulting in a decreased timespan from evidence to clinical practice. This is particularly important in this international health care crisis. Furthermore, we plan to contact all trial authors to receive individual patient data. Often aggregate data metaanalyses and individual patient data meta-analyses tend to show similar overall results. However, an advantage of us including individual patient data meta-analyses is that it may allow us to study intervention effects in subgroups of participants.",
