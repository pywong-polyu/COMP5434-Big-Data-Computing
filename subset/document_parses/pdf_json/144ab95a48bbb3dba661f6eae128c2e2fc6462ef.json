Accordingly, we developed a rapid health impact assessment (HIA) to evaluate positive and negative health effects of telework on these groups and recommended easily implementable countermeasures. Methods: Immediately after an emergency was declared in Japan, we implemented a rapid, five-step HIA. We screened and categorized health effects of telework for the three above-mentioned groups, extracting their content, directionality, and likelihood. Following a scoping exercise to determine the HIA's overall implementation, five experienced occupational health physicians appraised and prioritized the screened items and added new items. We outlined specific countermeasures and disseminated the results on our website. A short-term evaluation was conducted by three external occupational health physicians and three nurses. Results: Following screening and appraisal, 59, 29, and 27 items were listed for teleworkers, non-teleworkers, and family members of teleworkers, respectively, covering work, lifestyle, disease and medical care, and home and community. Targeted countermeasures focused on the work environment, business management, communications, and lifestyles for teleworkers; safety and medical guidelines, work prioritization, and regular communication for non-teleworkers; and shared responsibilities within families and communication outside families for family members of teleworkers. Conclusion: The HIA's validity and the countermeasures' practical applicability were confirmed by the external evaluators. They can be easily applied and adapted across diverse industries to mitigate the wider negative effects of telework and enhance its positive effects.",

To minimize the increasing impacts of COVID-19 on economic activities, social life, and medical care, and to prevent the collapse of medical services, the Japanese government officially declared an emergency situation in seven prefectures on April 8, 2020. 2 Subsequently, on April 16, 2020, 3 this state of emergency was extended to all remaining prefectures. Accordingly, members of the public were requested to refrain from leaving their homes, and businesses were asked to restrict the use of their facilities.",

            "text": "Prior to the declaration of the emergency, some businesses had already initiated a switch to telework for some of their activities. Regardless of company size, many business employees began to telework after the emergency was declared. In Japan, telework has mainly been discussed as a method of reducing working hours and preventing overwork. However, its spread within most industries has been limited, with the exception of a few industries such as information technology. The reason is that a number of business operators have introduced telework without adequately attending to technical issues such as the information technology environment and security. In addition, Japan's labor contracts are based on working hours in principle, and many operators have not yet made comprehensive arrangements relating to their personnel and labor systems for implementing telework.",

They include musculoskeletal disorders as well as psychological impacts relating to isolation and stress as well as long working hours. 4, 5 The findings of a survey conducted in Japan revealed that whereas there are merits associated with telework, such as improved productivity and a better family life-work balance; managing working hours and occupational health and safety pose challenges. 6 The introduction of telework in response to the recent emergency declaration encompasses enormous numbers of industries and diverse occupations. There was almost no time for preparation before its introduction, which was not dependent on employees' deliberate choices of a work style. There is concern that telework may induce health effects far in excess of the anticipated occupational health and safety issues. While the introduction of telework by business operators in response to the spread of COVID-19 is necessary, many issues need to be simultaneously addressed. Several responses to address health issues have been initiated, including measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and handling employees working overseas. In the current situation, because many issues have to be addressed immediately, using limited available resources, a policy tailored to the actual existing situation is urgently required. However, given the rapid introduction of telework in the absence of adequate preparation and insufficient scientific evidence, health issues associated with telework also require prioritization, and countermeasures to be implemented in the very short term need to be formulated.",

Such assessments can be conducted in situations where a wide range of health impacts are anticipated, even in the absence of sufficient information, because of the nature of the process for evaluating new measures. They allow scope for the modification or addition of measures based on the results of the HIA. Therefore, we conducted a HIA focusing on the introduction of telework associated with COVID-19 to assess its effectiveness for estimating and prioritizing health effects and deciding on countermeasures. For this study, we performed a rapid HIA of limited duration in the immediate and urgent context of the introduction of telework and developed recommendations for addressing its short-and medium-term health effects.",

Two | 3 of 15 NAGATA eT Al points required consideration: (a) the specific group whose health is impacted and (b) expected health effects. We used a screening tool 11, 12 to assess expected health effects divided into categories that included individual lifestyle, illness, social/regional effects, living environment, work performance, and service accessibility/quality based on a socio-environmental model of health. 13, 14 We extracted the content, direction (positive/negative), and the possibility of health effects (definite, probable, speculative, and unknown). Because negative health effects generally tend to increase during an HIA, researchers should actively emphasize positive health effects. Health outcomes may be positive or negative for individuals in the same situation. For example, some smokers will smoke more, whereas others will smoke less during telework. In this case, health effects in both directions were listed.",

(b) Have workers actually consulted them regarding any of the listed health effects, or have they heard indirectly that they are anxious? (c) Could they prioritize each health effect according to three levels (high, moderate, and low) to facilitate companies in considering how to respond? The lists of health effects developed by the steering group were shared with five occupational health physicians and their responses were elicited on (a) additional health effects for inclusion, (b) whether the workers had consulted an occupational physician or nurse about their particular health problems, and (c) their prioritization of health effects. All five physicians had a supervisory role relating to the occupational health team in each company and constantly communicated with the human resource managers and employers. We requested the five occupational health physicians to answer the above questions with inputs from human resource managers and employers. Workers' views were elicited via the second question. We believed that the application of this methodology would enable rapid completion of the HIA and incorporation of the views of key stakeholders, namely, employers, employees, and human resource managers.",

Measures for assessing health effects covering a wide range of subjects were developed for the HIA and were reflected in the corresponding recommendations. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the HIA using a rapid development strategy that entailed formulating a number of useful recommendations within a month of initiating the process and receiving positive feedback on the resulting report from occupational health professionals. Notably, the targeted health effects were partly itemized in the interviews conducted during the appraisal step, and they were mainly based on what was covered in the screening phase, which was an important step in the rapid implementation of an HIA in urgent circumstances. Studies have shown that telework has many positive health impacts, such as increased work freedom 18 and more time spent with family members. 19 One study showed that workers who partially teleworked scored better for obesity and certain lifestyle habits than did non-teleworkers. 20 However, telework is also associated with negative effects, such as musculoskeletal disorders, the psychological impacts of isolation and stress, and long working hours. 4, 5 According to one study, health effects relating to musculoskeletal disorders can be reduced through appropriately designed home office environments and targeted ergonomic training. 21 Isolation and lack of information can lead to overwork and role ambiguity, 22 and increased social support is an important factor determining successful telework. 23 Overall, previous studies have indicated that the health effects of telework are essentially positive, [18] [19] [20] and that negative health effects, 21,23 while they do occur, can be mitigated by countermeasures. However, these findings are based on the assumption that telework is an effective work choice and that adequate preparation has preceded its initiation. The negative health aspects are likely to come to the fore when telework is embarked on without any prior preparation. For example, the home office is isolated from the private home environment in the case of telework involving prior preparations, whereas in the current context, entailing inadequate preparation, many workers have been forced to work in their living rooms or at the dining room table. In a context of closures of nursery schools and schools, work-family conflict rather than the normally positive effect of improved relationships of employees with their family members has been apparent. Thus, when new measures such as telework are introduced, they are often initiated after employees have received training in advance and a suitable work environment has been established. 3 .

The HIA was conducted after the commencement of the newly proposed project. In principle, an HIA should be conducted before remedial measures are initiated. The disadvantage of doing so, however, is that if the implementation of the proposed measures is expected to take time, they may not be implemented immediately, and the effects of the improvements may not be apparent. One advantage of our approach was that we were able to identify the health impacts already being experienced by stakeholders during the implementation of the HIA. In addition, during a period of rapid change, many individuals tend to deal only with immediate health effects. The HIA provides a broader perspective on the health effects pertaining to an existing situation and will enable the persons in charge to respond in a more relaxed manner.",

Previous studies have only considered the health effects of teleworkers on telework. Although a company can provide family members of teleworkers just with a limited response, a wider response to the issue as a whole is needed based on the recommendations provided and encompassing non-teleworkers. During the appraisal process, individuals with special needs were also identified. For example, some occupational physicians noted that workers with mental health issues were particularly affected by mental stress and that individuals with dementia could experience worsening symptoms, which could increase the burden on their families as care providers. Thus, it is also important to consider vulnerable groups who are especially susceptible to negative health impacts.",

Accordingly, the recommendations can be directly considered and applied in policy revisions. However, our HIA did not target a specific business; rather it was intended to be applicable to diverse companies. The impact of telework will depend on the characteristics of a business, such as the industry and the worker's occupation, and these factors may affect the applicability of the recommendations. In addition, some of the recommendations entail a certain amount of expenditure for acquiring an appropriate desk, chair, and other components of a suitable working environment at home. Small-and medium-sized businesses experiencing hardship may find it difficult to invest in improving their work environments. In Japan, several ministries and agencies have established subsidies to improve the teleworking environment. Sharing the results of this HIA with government agencies or having government agencies conduct HIAs would provide useful inputs for policy making. Revisions in the rules for personnel would be required for developing a reporting system used at the beginning and end of each workday and for introducing labor management tools. It is also expected that decisions on implementation will vary depending on the degree of continuity of telework after the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose to use our recommendations in consideration of the priorities and feasibility of implementing the measures. The application of the HIA measures in a crisis, such as the current one, makes it difficult to consider the HIA process comprehensively because the situation and environment are continually and rapidly changing. The last step of the HIA, namely monitoring/evaluation should be ongoing, entailing reviews of the HIA process, as required, and adding or modifying recommendations.",

They are sharing their knowledge and experience with other professionals. However, workplaces that lack an occupational health professional may not be able to respond effectively to achieve the expected health effects. In addition, the situation is expected to be prolonged, and the negative effects of telework may become more apparent in the future. Our aim is to promote telework, while implementing additional measures that can contribute to reducing its negative impacts and strengthening its positive ones. Widespread dissemination and utilization of the results of this HIA, conducted at a time of crisis, and continual reviews of the results, combined with the monitoring of the situation within each business unit and the collection of information on the measures that they have been taken, will enhance the positive impacts of telework.",
