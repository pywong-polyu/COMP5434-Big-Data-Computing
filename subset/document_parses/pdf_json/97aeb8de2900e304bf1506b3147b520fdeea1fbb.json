The purpose of this study was to develop a simple and robust eye model for effective and objective assessment of ophthalmoscopic competency. METHODS: A series of eye models were assembled using commonly available materials, including 26-mm-diameter doublehemispherical brown plastic balls and convex lenses. A 6-mm circular opening was drilled on one hemisphere as a pupil behind which the lens was glued to provide the refractive component. Ten pieces of letters were placed on the inner surface of the other hemisphere. Ophthalmoscopic skills of ophthalmologist residents were first subjectively assessed using a checklist by two tutors and then objectively by using the eye models. The discrimination index was calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of assessment. Finally, a feedback questionnaire was completed. RESULTS: Totally 76 residents were recruited. The checklist score was 9.25 \u00b1 0.47, with a discrimination index of 0.11. The modelassessment score was 4.24 \u00b1 3.10, with a discrimination index of 0.79. There was no correlation between the checklist score and model scores (r = 0.133, P = 0.251). Two-thirds of the participants agreed or strongly agreed that model-assessment could reflect the ability to visualize the fundus. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed simple eye models to assess the competency of ophthalmoscopy with excellent discriminatory power to differentiate competence levels of ophthalmology residents.",

            "text": "In conventional training programs of tertiary eye centers, trainers assess the ophthalmoscopic skills of trainees, mostly residents, by using a checklist on the operations, such as manipulating the light beam and adjusting the diopter [6] . However, this checklist-based assessment is subjective and may not reliably reflect the competency of ophthalmoscopic skills since it is essentially based on memorization of the operational procedure rather than ability of visualization of the fundus [1] . An alternative assessment is to use model eyes with built-in fundus images, such as head mannequins [2, 3, 7, 8] . During the assessment, the resident trainees used a direct ophthalmoscope to examine the eye model and gave a diagnosis at a teaching hospital. The score was based on the accuracy of the diagnosis. However, such eye models set-up can be expensive. Furthermore, such assessment requires not only competency in visualizing the fundus but also knowledge in the diagnosis of retinal diseases. The trainees can be competent in ophthalmoscopic skills but inadequate in knowledge of pathologic features of the retina in relation to retinal diseases [5] . Visualization of the fundus is important in detecting fundus diseases [9] , but there have been few methods to assess the skill of visualization.",

It was an appealing design but there was no attempt to replicate the refractive error of a typical eyeball, and reading text allowed some guesswork or filling in, as opposed to reading isolated letters. Its discriminatory power as an assessment tool has to be improved in order to enhance its practical usefulness. This paper described development of a simple eye model modified from Bradley's that enabled the convenient and objective assessment of ophthalmoscopic competency, and evaluated its effectiveness of assessment in comparison with the traditional checklist that currently used.",

For the anterior hemisphere, we drilled a 6-mm circular opening to provide the pupil. A thin Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) convex lens with a focal length of 26 mm, also from Taobao, China (https://item.taobao.com/item. htm? spm=a230r.1.14.40.5f9e3b035jqp1L&id=562289788402&ns=1&abbucket=4#detail), was glued to the inner surface behind the pupil to provide the refractive component. For the posterior hemisphere, we painted internally an optic disk and four sets of vessels radiating from the disc to the four quadrants. Subsequently, 10 pieces of paper with randomized capital letters (black color, 4-point Calibri), one letter printed on one piece, were placed on the inner surface, marking the macula, disc, superior, superonasal, nasal, inferonasal, inferior, inferotemporal, temporary and superotemporal mid-peripheral area. Finally, the two hemispheres were buckled together, and an \"S\" symbol was drawn externally to mark the 12 o'clock of the model.",

            "text": "Some reasons may attribute to the difference in difficulty. First, there was no time limit in Bradley's assessment. In contrast, the residents in our study were required to finish direct ophthalmoscopy within 5 min, which increased the degree of difficulty. Second, we used the plastic ball in brown color to form a black box, simulating the structural feature of the choroid. However, Bradley's report did not mention how to avoid light into the pale table tennis ball from the wall, which might reduce the difficulty in manipulating the light beam. Finally, assessment by reading text was much easier than reading randomized letters, even in the same size, since the text message could be guessed by association. Fourth, the eye model in our study was 26-mm in diameter, which was closer to the diameter of a human eyeball and smaller than Bradley's model based on a table tennis ball (40mm approximately). Fifth, unlike Bradley's model without a refractive component, we added a convex lens with a certain focal length to simulate an emmetropic eye, and the residents could not visualize the fundus without an ophthalmoscope. In addition, we measured the difficulty index and discrimination index, which were frequently used in evaluating the quality of a test [12] . The higher the difficulty index, the lower is the difficulty. Tests with a difficulty index above 0.90 should be very easy and probably not worth testing. On the other hand, tests with a very low difficulty index are difficult and inappropriate for students or residents. Discrimination index describes how effectively the test differentiates between high ability and low ability students. Notably, a high discrimination index is desirable in skill assessment. The relationship between these two indexes has been recognized. Si-Mui Sim et al. found that the maximum discrimination index occurred with a difficulty index between 40 and 74% [12] . Either a very large or very small difficulty index would lead to a decrease in discrimination index. Thus, it fails to differentiate between weak and competent students. Therefore, the modelassessment in our study was moderate in difficulty (difficulty index = 0.42) and acceptable for the residents. Moreover, using our eye model to assess the ophthalmoscopic competency could well differentiate between poor and competent performers (discrimination index = 0.79), compared with Bradley's model based on CV as a reference for discrimination index and the checklist (discrimination index = 0.11).",
