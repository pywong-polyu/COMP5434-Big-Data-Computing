The rapidly spreading Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) appeared to be a highly transmissible pathogen in healthcare environments and had resulted in a significant number of patients with respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, an aerosol-generating procedure that places healthcare workers at high risk of contracting the infection. Instead of deferring or delaying the procedure, we developed and implemented a novel percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) protocol aimed at minimizing the risk of transmission while maintaining favorable procedural outcome. Patients and Methods. All patients who underwent PDT per novel protocol were included in the study. The key element of the protocol was the use of apnea during the critical part of the insertion and upon any opening of the ventilator circuit. This was coupled with the use of enhanced personnel protection equipment (PPE) with a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). The operators underwent antibody serology testing and were evaluated for COVID-19 symptoms two weeks from the last procedure included in the study. Results. Between March 12th and June 30th, 2020, a total of 32 patients underwent PDT per novel protocol. The majority (80%) were positive for COVID-19 at the time of the procedure. The success rate was 94%. Only one patient developed minor self-limited bleeding. None of the proceduralists developed positive serology or any symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection. Conclusion. A novel protocol that uses periods of apnea during opening of the ventilator circuit along with PAPR-enhanced PPE for PDT on COVID-19 patients appears to be effective and safe for patients and healthcare providers.",

While the majority of infected patients do not develop severe disease, around 15% may develop significant dyspnea and hypoxemia and 5% may evolve to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and/or multiorgan failure that require invasive ventilatory support for an extended period of time [2, 3] . Tracheostomy is a common procedure for those critically ill patients, but it is an aerosol-generating procedure that places healthcare workers (HCW) at risk of infection during insertion and subsequent care. Similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003, COVID-19 appeared to be a highly transmissible pathogen in healthcare environments [4] .",

The American Academy of Otolaryngology and the Ears, Nose, and Throat Surgery in the United Kingdom, have stated that providers should \"avoid tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients\" due to the risks to healthcare providers. They recommended that tracheostomies should not be performed before 2-3 weeks after intubation, preferably after negative COVID-19 testing, and favored open tracheostomy placement in these circumstances as opposed to percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) [5, 6] . Earlier tracheostomy, however, would assist in resource preservation by facilitating weaning from mechanical ventilation as well as throughput to a lower level of care [7] . PDT is routinely performed in our medical ICU by the interventional pulmonary service. This emerging situation presented us with a new challenge of maintaining a balance between providing medical care to those in need while limiting disease spread and exposure to patients and staff. The decision was made at our institution to not delay tracheostomy based on the presence of COVID-19 but instead to establish a protocol that would facilitate safe PDT. We developed and implemented a novel protocol that introduced several modifications to the standard technique designed to minimize the risk of aerosolization of the virus while maintaining a low risk of complications. We report in this study the feasibility of this novel protocol and its safety for the patients and the providers.",

The team participants were limited to only essential personnel-this included one of the two hospital interventional pulmonologist, one of the two interventional pulmonary fellows in training, a registered nurse, and a respiratory therapist. A technician and nearby nurses were available outside the room to obtain equipment or medications as needed. All equipment and medications were checked prior to entering the room and then were taken into the room, including an extra supply of medication that potentially may be used. Backup equipment was left immediately outside the room with a technologist to be readily available if needed. A powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) with standard donning (per CDC guidelines) was utilized by all four members of the team along with an N95 mask under the PAPR hood as a backup in case of an unexpected malfunction [8] .

A 60-second apnea test on 100% FIO 2 was performed to assess the patient's ability to tolerate apnea during the critical part of the procedure. The ventilator was placed on standby while the patient's oxygen saturations and hemodynamics were monitored for 60 seconds. If at any point during the apnea the patient experienced oxygen desaturation below 90% and or hemodynamic instability, the apnea test was aborted, and the procedure deferred. After passing the apnea test, the patient was fully draped in sterile fashion to avoid any contamination of equipment and bed.

The cuff of the ETT remained inflated to minimize any aerosolization. Then, the main operator proceeded with incision and needle insertion between the first and second tracheal ring under direct visualization via bronchoscope. Of note, the syringe attached to the needle was not removed immediately. Ventilation was then paused, at which point the rest of the procedure was performed under the standard PDT technique. Once tracheostomy was inserted and visualized with the bronchoscope from above through the ETT, the cuff was inflated, the inner cannula was immediately inserted, the ventilator was attached via flexible tubing, and ventilation was resumed.

It was designed to minimize the risk of healthcare workers' aerosol exposure while maintaining optimal procedural safety and outcome. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report on operator's safe outcome for COVID-19 contraction during tracheostomy. We have demonstrated the protocol to be safe and effective with no negative impact on patients or staff. Tracheostomy is a major aerosol-generating procedure that was identified as a leading cause of viral transmission and superspreading events during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [5] . A systematic review of 10 studies from the 2003 SARS outbreak suggests that tracheostomy has an OR of 4.2 for risk of transmission to healthcare workers (HCWs) [9] . While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with lower mortality than the related viruses that cause severe acute SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), it appears to have a higher infectivity and rates of transmission [10] . An early report of infections related to aerosol-generating procedures has already emerged in the current pandemic [11] .",

The protocol required patient qualification characteristics of a PEEP lower than 12 cm H 2 O and an FIO 2 lower than 60%. A negative apnea test (absence of desaturations or hemodynamic instability while ventilator is placed on standby for one minute) was also required in order to consider if the patient is able to tolerate the apnea during the procedure. The cut-offs for PEEP and FIO 2 are similar to those that we use for non-COVID patients in our practice. The duration of the apnea test was arbitrary. Based on our experience, it does not take more than 60 seconds for an experienced operator to insert the tracheostomy from the time of successful needle insertion between the tracheal rings. The combination of PEEP/FIO 2 cut-off of 12 cm H 2 O/60% and a negative apnea test appears to be a good predictor of apnea tolerance.",

Our standard ICU general criteria based on days of mechanical ventilation is 14 days with the caveat that the patient is not improving as to weaning capability. Given that published reports from China and Italy demonstrated that COVID-19 has a high ICU mortality [19] , it seemed prudent to wait until the course of disease is declared before committing patients to earlier tracheostomy and leading to procedures in patients who may not need it altogether during the course of their illness. Two weeks seemed an appropriate timing in that light.",
