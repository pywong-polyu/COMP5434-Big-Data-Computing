Many attempts have been made to devise an automated method of testing that could detect the virus. Various researchers around the globe have proposed deep learning based methodologies to detect the COVID-19 using Chest X-Rays. However, questions have been raised on the presence of bias in the publicly available Chest X-Ray datasets which have been used by the majority of the researchers. In this paper, we propose a 2 staged methodology to address this topical issue. Two experiments have been conducted as a part of stage 1 of the methodology to exhibit the presence of bias in the datasets. Subsequently, an image segmentation, super-resolution and CNN based pipeline along with different image augmentation techniques have been proposed in stage 2 of the methodology to reduce the effect of bias. InceptionResNetV2 trained on Chest X-Ray images that were augmented with Histogram Equalization followed by Gamma Correction when passed through the pipeline proposed in stage 2, yielded a top accuracy of 90.47% for 3-class (Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19) classification task.",

The contagion was identified to be of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) species and formally termed as SARS-CoV-2, exposure to which engenders multiple respiratory illnesses in humans. It is a highly contagious respiratory disease that is spread by direct or indirect contact from infected bodies, and this is reasoned to be the prime driver of its high transmissibility. This high transmissibility of the virus is corroborated by the fact that the R0 value of the ancestral strain was estimated to be between 2-3, whereas the current sweeping Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is estimated to have an R0 of 5-9 [1] . The virion has infected over 209 million individuals and is responsible for the deaths of over 4 million individuals, forcing countless others to isolate themselves in fear of their safety [2] . In the absence of quintessential treatment procedures, the contagious SARS-CoV-2 has caused a surge in infection rates around the world ( Figure 1 ) and has ruptured the concept of normal life.",

            "text": "A notion of vaccine hesitancy among certain sects of society may also lead to an influx of variants of concern (VOCs) that may be the product of convergent evolution, thus gaining traits like higher transmissibility and resistance to antibody action [3] . In vitro experiments have shown that the currently rampant Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is 8 folds less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies when compared to the wild type (Wuhan 1) [4] , thus inflicting multiple \"waves\" of COVID cases across the globe. 19 cases through the pandemic [2] As evident with the \"spikes\" of cases of COVID-19, rapid deployment of on-ground personnel and rapid testing is crucial in containing these unpredictable surges. Accurate predictions of these surges and swift upscaling of the healthcare framework are critical towards ensuring the availability of appropriate facilities during these unfortunate conditions of a pandemic [5] . Some countries may exhibit the need to divert their manpower into the assembly of physical infrastructure, whereas others may be in the need of securing the capital for further investment in the aforementioned infrastructure. In such cases, automated methods of diagnosis would be necessary for reducing the load on the healthcare infrastructure and increasing the efficiency of the detection of COVID-19 in individuals [6] . While there have been efforts in devising an automated approach for such a case, they usually employ the use of the publicly available datasets, which are prone to the introduction of unintended biases when left unchecked, and in such a case, we propose a new methodology that is aimed at eliminating such biases. The rest of this paper is organized as follows; section 2 describes the literature review of similar works, section 3 provides insights about the raw data that was used in this study, with section 4 describing the methodology used. section 5 has details pertaining to the performance metrics used to evaluate the models and section 6 and 7 contain the results and the conclusions of this study respectively.",

            "text": "Many studies which have combined multiple open-source datasets to develop a deep learning based architecture for the classification of COVID-19 have been published. However, M.G and N.L's work [9] was one of the first studies to point out a shortcoming of these approaches. In their work, they augmented 4 publicly available datasets by using different operations and subsequently placed a black mask over the images to block the center of the image, obscuring the lung from the images. The images were trained on AlexNet to classify COVID and non-COVID CXR images. Their methodology was able to achieve a minimum AUC-ROC score of 0.92 and scoring as high as 0.999 with obscured lung regions. This corroborated that there was indeed a bias in the datasets and that the model was in fact learning distinguishing features between the datasets instead of distinguishing the presence of COVID-19. Further research in the field proved this point. Robert et al. [10] published a review work, in which the risk of bias was assessed for 62 papers using the PROBAST tool defined in the study. The findings of this review work proved that the majority of the papers had shortcomings such as bias in the datasets, and poor reproducibility. Santa Cruz et al in their work [11] , used PROBAST and CHARMS tools to assess the high risk of bias in medical imaging due to the absence of information which is vital to assess selection bias, and lack of clarity of the procedures of image augmentation. Therefore, it is crucial that we select our datasets carefully and apply data augmentation & preprocessing methods to reduce the bias in the datasets. Chowdhury et al. [12] conducted 2 and 3 class classification with models trained on images with and without augmentation. DenseNet201 outperformed the others with training being done on images with augmentation. R. Kushol et al. in their work [13] have proposed an image enhancement technique that consists of applying combined Top-hat and Bottom-hat transform and finding Optimal Structuring Element (SE) size and subsequently comparing their method to established image enhancement methods such as CLAHE. Their proposed method generates comparatively clear and visually improved output. Hence, in this study, we've established the presence of bias in the publicly available datasets, and subsequently proposed a transfer learning based pipeline with image processing and augmentation techniques to diminish the bias.",

Figure 6 is an illustration depicting the same, where we can notice that the superimposed heatmap of the 36x36 image has a greater concentration of neuron activations along the corner when compared with the relative absence of neuron activations in the lung region. It is evident that the model is making predictions with a greater weight to the corner, suggesting the presence of certain information that can be used to differentiate between datasets i.e., a certain type of bias.",

The results for each model on isolated augmentation techniques are tabulated below in Tables 4 and 5 . As evident from the aforementioned tables, it is clear that InceptionResNetV2 performs significantly better than DenseNet-201 when tasked at differentiating images that possess the traces of COVID-19 in the lung region. Even though certain confounding regions of the images were eliminated, the models are still able to classify the images with a high degree of accuracy, this insinuates that even though bias elimination was performed in a destructive fashion, there lies certain information in the lung region that can act as the centre of attention for the models.",

Lately, numerous methodologies that make use of multiple publicly available datasets have emerged. However, most of these studies have failed to address the presence of bias present in the available datasets, or the bias that arises due to intermixing of datasets for the classification task. Hence, in our study, we proposed a 2-staged methodology; in stage 1, two experiments were carried out on different datasets to establish the bias present in the datasets, and thereafter, in stage 2, an image segmentation, super-resolution and CNN based pipeline along with various image augmentation techniques were proposed in order to reduce the effect of bias. Paul Mooney, Shenzhen Chest X-Ray and Montgomery County Chest X-Ray datasets were ruled out as a result of the experiments conducted in stage 1. Subsequently, following the proposed pipeline in stage 2, Chest X-Ray images augmented with Histogram Equalization followed by Gamma Correction yielded a top accuracy of 90.47% when fed into InceptionResNetV2.",
