The first part (AACR I) was conducted from April 27 to 28, 2020, and the number of registrants for it (61,000 from 140 countries) was far greater than those typically attending the comparable face-to-face meeting [2] . The ability to reach a truly global audience that includes viewers from resource-limited countries is one benefit of virtual conferences [3] .",
