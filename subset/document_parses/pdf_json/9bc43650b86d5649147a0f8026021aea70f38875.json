Multiple modeling studies of the spread of COVID-19 support the importance of wearing masks and maintaining a physical distance from others [1] [2] [3] [4] . One modeling study suggested that 80% compliance with mask wearing would reduce mortality from COVID-19 by up to 45% [2] , and it has been suggested that masks may reduce the size of the inoculum, leading to milder infections [5] . The science demonstrating the effectiveness of masking is very strong [6] , yet this protective behavior has become politicized. Some consider mandates to wear masks a violation of individual freedom. In spite of the persistent spread of the infection and an increasing death tally in countries like Brazil and the United States, many do not wear masks in public settings. In countries like South Korea, Japan and China, where adherence to masking mandates were high, the case rates were considerably lower than in the US and Brazil [7] .",

Direct observation has repeatedly been demonstrated to be a reliable method of measuring a variety of individual characteristics and behaviors, including the intensity of physical activity and human interactions [12] [13] [14] . The technique entails data collectors recording a limited number of visible characteristics of the individuals they observe.

Correct mask use was defined as having the mask covering both mouth and nose. Incorrect use was defined as either mouth or nose exposed. We also collected information simultaneously on each person's physical activity level (sedentary, moderate, and vigorous), mode of transport (on wheels or not), group size (alone, 2, 3-5, 6-9, 10+), and physical distancing (>6 feet from others or not). At each location observers noted whether there was crowding, defined as having more people than would make it possible to stay at least 6 feet apart from others.

The rise in correct mask use after the President's COVID-19 infection suggests that the behavior of our leaders has a significant impact on population adherence to public health guidelines.

Even though outdoor settings provide better ventilation when one is not distanced or protected by masks, an increasing amount of time spent in close proximity to others also increases the risk of transmission, even in an outdoor setting [15] . Because the risk of transmission is a function of both dosage and duration of exposure, settings where people spend time, like in parks or playgrounds are places where masks should be worn. Yet people were less likely to wear them in parks than on commercial streets, possibly because they may have more control over distancing in these settings.",
