            "text": "Background and Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic results in an intense flow of patients to hospitals especially to the intensive care units (ICUs) to be treated. The ICUs will therefore be confronted with a massive influx of patients (e.g. Spain and Italy). However, if the number of patients is higher than the resources available in ICUs, rationing decisions such as determining and evaluating the criteria for ICU admission becomes essential. In this case, the decision of which patients will be admitted to the ICUs may put significant pressure on healthcare personnel. The goal of this paper is to determine the criteria to be used in the decision of admission of COVID-19 patients to the ICUs. Methods: A three-step methodology is applied. In the first step, the evaluation criteria are determined, and then the criteria are prioritized using a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in an uncertain and multiple-criteria environment choice. Finally, COVID-19 patients are ranked using the Multi-Objective Optimization Method by Ratio Analysis to find out which patient is more urgent. Results: According to experts' evaluation of ICU admission criteria, \"increment of > 2 in SOFA score\" seems the most dominant factor among others. The proposed methodology is tested on 10 anonymous COVID-19 positive patients being treated in a public hospital and the ICU admission results are discussed. Conclusions: Obtained priorities and ranking is in line with the hospitals' behavior that potentially depicts the usefulness and validity of the proposed approach. (E. \u00d6zceylan). and mortal in people with advanced age and comorbid disease. More fatality rates have been shown in men. Fatality rate varies around 2-3% worldwide [5] . As the age increases, the rate of fatality increases. In the event that there are diseases requiring urgent or elective treatments in these individuals or in cases of high suspicion, there has been no consensus, despite various reports from various health authorities, about the treatment at home or in the hospital or what treatment methods should be applied.",

In the first week of March 2020, more than 40 0,0 0 0 cases have been confirmed globally, in 130 countries, and by January 29, 2021, the confirmed cases had risen a little above 100,819,363 million in 250 countries/regions, with over 2,176,159 deaths of the world [59] . It is also known that the infection is not severe for all patients and may even progress without symptoms for someone who has come into contact with COVID-19. While nearly half of the people infected with COVID-19 develop symptoms that are not serious or may be overlooked, the main symptoms in the other half of patients are fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia (muscle pain) and dyspnea [61] . The disease can be severe tancing, as well as testing and contact tracing. To mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak, Carli et al. [13] proposed an optimal control approach that supports governments in defining the most effective strategies to be adopted during post-lockdown mitigation phases in a multi-region scenario. Then, Pare et al. [43] presented a variety of mathematical models that have been proposed to capture the dynamic behavior of epidemic processes and to estimate the spreading parameters of the virus. For an excellent review of COVID-19 forecasting and SIR models, the reader is referred to Rahimi et al. [47] .",

The number of cases is increasing rapidly in many countries. One of the most important needs in this period in which the severity of the epidemic increased is the number of beds and ventilators (respirators) in ICUs. However, many countries are worried about the lack of health infrastructure in the face of the rapidly increasing number of cases [58] . While governments apply various protection measures in the process, health units are working to prevent the tsunami caused by a large number of infected individuals to be treated [46] . For instance, Spain and Italy have been hit very hard with tremendous documented cases and deaths [50] . Especially in Italy, critical resources such as protective equipment, ventilators, and even medical staff are becoming deficient. Doctors are being forced to make a choice of whom to priorities caring for [51] . According to the paper of Emanuel et al. [20] , the regular approach of treating people on a \"first-come, first-served\" basis should not apply during these times. They suggest that prioritizing some indicators related with age, respiratory and cardiac system should be a better approach to consider the patients.",

In addition the uncertainty and vagueness of the experts' (doctors, health staff and etc.) opinion is the prominent characteristic of the problem [18] . Therefore, a proper solution methodology must be used considering the uncertain environment. To overcome the aforementioned issues, the applied methodology in this paper includes three main parts. In the first part, the necessary criteria that are considered for ICU admission are determined. Then the criteria are grouped according to their relations such as respiratory-related or cardiovascular-related criteria. It is an expected situation that all the criteria do not have the same priority. For instance, vasopressor need may be more important or urgent than arrhythmia problem of a patient for an ICU admission. For this reason, the criteria weights are determined using F-AHP in the second part. Lastly, the next question is which COVID-19 positive patient will use ICU first in the emergency or limited resource situation. To answer that question, MOORA approach considering the criteria weights is applied to rank the patients who need ICU treatment in the last part.",

The method has been applied to a variety of problems, including healthcare service quality [12] , renewal of healthcare technologies [17] , development of hospital beds [48] , and classification of diabetes drugs [42] .",

The MOORA method is one of the most frequently used multi-objective optimization methods in decision making problems. The method which is based on the grouping of different predictions is frequently preferred due to its easy operation steps and applicability at the solution of decisionmaking problems. The most important advantage of the MOORA method is that although the data used in the evaluation of alternatives according to the criteria are in different units, it effectively normalizes these units by using non-subjective non-directional values instead of subjective weighted normalization. The MOORA method is basically a method that is formed by using two different methods: MOORA-Ratio and MOORA-Reference Point methods together. The criteria must have equal weights for these methods which are explained in summarily below. In cases which the criteria do not have equal weights, the methods use the Eqs. (8) and (11) instead of Eqs. (7) and (9) , respectively. In 2010, the full Multiplicative Form method is developed by Brauers and Zavadskas [7] . The MULTIMOORA method which is introduced to the literature by Brauers and Zavadskas in 2010 is not a new one. The method combines the results obtained from the MOORA method and the full Multiplicative Form method into a single ranking using the Rank Dominance method. The flow chart of these methods is shown in Fig. 1 . The methods are explained shortly below and the readers can easily find details in different papers ( [7, 8, 10, 24] ).",

In the first stage, alternative COVID-19 patients who may need ICU treatment and the criteria which will be used in their evaluation are determined and the decision hierarchy is formed. This stage is supported by a group of doctors (including fourth author) from Gazi University Hospital and related literature to determine the criteria pool and the problem hierarchy. After the approval of decision hierarchy by the group, the first stage is terminated. In the second stage, criteria used in COVID-19 patients' evaluation are weighted using F-AHP. In this phase, pairwise comparison matrices are formed to determine the criteria weights. The experts from decision making team make individual evaluations using the scale, provided in Section 3.1 , to determine the values of the elements of pairwise comparison matrices to reflect the uncertainty in experts' options. Computing the geometric mean of the values obtained from individual evaluations, a final pairwise comparison matrix on which there is a consensus is found. The weights of the criteria are calculated based on this final comparison matrix regarding to the consistency ratio. In the last step of this phase, calculated weights of the criteria are approved by decision making team. Patients' priorities are found by using MOORA computations in the last stage. In the last step of this phase, the most suitable patients for ICU treatment are selected according to the ranking. Details of each stage are explained during the implementation section (next section). Schematic representation of the proposed integrated approach is presented in Fig. 2 . ",

As mentioned, one of them is the fourth co-author of this study. The second expert is a doctor at Anesthesiology and Reanimation department in Gazi University Hospital, and the last expert is a doctor working at Ankara City Hospital. Due to similarities of the criteria, 16 criteria are classified under four main criteria, namely respiratory system based criteria, cardiovascular system based criteria, blood based criteria and organ based criteria. For instance, vasopressor needs and arrhythmia situations are related with cardiovascular system of the patients. On the other hand, there is only one criterion (the SOFA score) that is related with organ. It must be noted that the considered 16 criteria are not only the criteria that evaluate the ICU admission for COVID-19 patients. Based on the literature and consulting to the doctors, the evaluation part is limited with 16 criteria. With a more accurate description of the COVID-19 in near future, the criteria may change. For instance, the age or the chance of being improved should be also considered. The hierarchy and brief explanations of the criteria are illustrated in Fig. 3 .",

For this analysis, the Table 4 are used. In order not to spoil the whole of the paper and to ensure its readability, the calculations of EDAS and TOPSIS are not given. However, calculation steps of the methods are available upon request. TOPSIS and EDAS provide analytical solutions to decision makers to determine the best alternative in complex decision problems or to rank the alternatives. Although TOPSIS and EDAS methods are among the distance-based methods [19] , there are differences in the determination of alternatives. While TOPSIS method determines the best alternative by calculating the distance from ideal and rare solutions; in the EDAS method, the alternative is determined by calculating the distance from the mean solution [35] . The priority order of the patients according to the TOPSIS calculations [33] and EDAS calculations [35] are given in Table 12 . While C i value represents the TOPSIS output for each alternative, S i value shows the performance of EDAS method. According to the Table 12 , the highest values of C i and S i identifies the tenth patient (P10) as non-emergency patient. On the other hand, fourth patient' (P4) condition is most critical among other. This means that the first person to receive the ICU service is that patient. Except two patients (P6 and P8), EDAS and TOP-SIS approaches provide the same result. Due to different working principle of the methods, there is a 50% difference in the ranking with the MULTIMOORA approach. The doctors mentioned in the acknowledgment section stated that the result of the MULTI-MOORA method is more reasonable.",
