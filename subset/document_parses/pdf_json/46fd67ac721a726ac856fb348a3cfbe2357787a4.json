Even more alarming is the fact that some researchers have shown that Black individuals are at a higher risk than their White counterparts of having severe illness from COVID-19 that requires hospitalization [3, 5] . In the United States (US), this is not surprising because Blacks/African American people were already disproportionately affected by underlying medical conditions such asthma, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension or high blood pressure (HBP), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), obesity, and sickle cell disease before COVID-19 [6] . What is less clear to date, however, are the factors that may be associated with these racial disparities in adverse health outcomes from COVID-19 [7] .",

Our results indicate that as the percent of Black county residents increases, so too do COVID-19 cases and deaths. We hypothesize that explicit and implicit racial attitudes uniquely explain COVID-19 cases and deaths, and serve to moderate the relationship between the percent of Black county residents and COVID-19 outcomes.",

This form of bias is consistent with the notion that prejudice represents negative attitudes held toward a group of people or those presumed to be in that group (e.g., [12] ). Explicit racial bias might take the form of racial slurs or holding negative attitudes toward racial minorities. In much of the US, publicly espousing explicit racial prejudice is contrary to social norms [13] ; nevertheless, people still do harbor such attitudes and, in some cases, openly express them. Implicit racial attitudes take a different form than do explicit attitudes. They reflect automatic responses that manifest when an external stimulus corresponds with an individual's association set that link the stimulus and particular characteristics [14] . Though implicit attitudes represent automatic associations, people are aware of their own implicit biases and are able to predict their occurrence with some accuracy [15] . Several scholars have argued that implicit racial attitudes are more prevalent in society than are explicit attitudes [16] and might be a better predictor of less controllable behaviors [17] , especially among those who are not motivated to avoid bias.",

To date, most of the research focusing on explicit and implicit racial attitudes has occurred at the individual level of analysis; however, the relationship with individual-level behaviors is tenuous [18] . On the other hand, Payne and colleagues [19, 20] have shown that prejudice can take on a shared property at the community level. Members of a community-whether a city, metropolitan area, county, or even stategenerally have similar social interactions, exposures to media, and collective experiences, all of which can shape their explicit and implicit attitudes. The collective experiences can influence how any one individual reacts to a particular situation, and therefore, contextual factors likely attenuate the relationship between bias and outcomes at the individual levels. However, when taken as a whole, aggregate responses should converge such that people within a given community respond in similar ways. In this way, prejudice represents a bias of the crowd [19, 20] .",

Finally, it is possible that explicit racial and implicit attitudes moderate the relationship between the percent of Black county residents and subsequent health outcomes. In this case, the aforementioned relationship might be stronger when explicit and implicit attitudes are high, relative to when they are low. This reasoning is consistent with other scholarship showing that racial attitudes and biases can interact with community demographics to predict health outcomes [30] . Given these possibilities, we hypothesized that explicit racial attitudes would moderate the relationship between the percent of Black county residents and COVID-19 cases (Hypothesis 5) and deaths (Hypothesis 6), such that the associations would be stronger when explicit racial attitudes are high. Turning to the next hypotheses, we predicted that implicit racial attitudes would moderate the relationship between the percent of Black county residents and COVID-19 cases (Hypothesis 7) and deaths (Hypothesis 8), such that the relationships will be stronger when implicit racial bias is high.",

Thus, we accounted for the percent of the county who are Uninsured, with data coming from the Small Area Health Insurance Estimates. Given the influence of economic stability on health [41] and COVID-19 risk [42], we included the percent of residents who were Unemployed, with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Further, income is predictive of COVID-19 outcomes, as people in poor communities are countries bear a larger burden than do their wealthier counterparts [43] . As such, we controlled for the log of the median family income among county residents.

In determining the most appropriate cutoff point, we ran preliminary analyses for a minimum of 20, 50, 100, and 150 respondents per county. To examine precision, we computed the coefficient of variation for the Explicit Racial Attitudes and Implicit Racial Attitudes at each cutoff point and then compared the percent increase in precision. The coefficient of variation scores were substantially smaller in counties with at least 50 respondents, relative to those with 20. The increased precision was only marginally better when to 100 and then to150. We then compared representativeness of the sample. When 20 respondents served as the cutoff point, multiple counties in each state were represented in the dataset. This was also the case when moving to a minimum of 50 respondent per county. When we moved to 100 cases, there were no counties from one state, and only a single county from other states. This also occurred when using 150 cases as the cutoff. Given these patterns, we chose 50 as the minimum number of respondents per county. As a result, the data were reduced from 875,209 individual responses to the aggregate responses representing 817 US counties.",

Results demonstrate that the relationship between Percent Black and Cases was stronger when Explicit Racial Attitudes were high (B = 994.56, SE = 93.06, p < .001) relative to when they were low (B = 630.14, SE = 42.25, p < .001). Thus, Hypothesis 5 was supported. We observed similar support for Hypothesis 6 (see Model 5 of Table 1 ). The relationship between Percent Black and Cases was stronger when Implicit Racial Attitudes were high (B = 994.56, SE = 93.06, p < .001) relative to when they were low (B = 630.14, SE = 42.25, p < .001). The relationship is illustrated in Fig 1B. Table 3 provides the results for Deaths. The controls accounted for 33% of the variance. The main effects of Explicit Racial Attitudes were not significant (see Model 2) , nor were the Percent Black \u00d7 Explicit Racial Attitudes (see Model 4) . Thus, Hypotheses 2 and 6 were rejected. On the other hand, Hypothesis 4 was supported, as Implicit Racial Attitudes held a positive, significant association with Deaths (see Model 3) . Finally, the Percent Black \u00d7 Implicit Racial Attitudes interaction term was not significant (see Model 5), so Hypothesis 8 was rejected.",

To determine whether these choices impacted the variance explained or interpretation of the results, we conducted additional analyses with different county participation cutoffs with the weights applied (n \ufffd 100, and n \ufffd 150), as well as analyses at the n \ufffd 50 without the weights applied. Though there were slight variations, the overall pattern of results and variance explained was consistent across the cutoff points for participants per county. Further, unweighted regression analyses-that is, those not taking into account the differences in participants per county-resulted in less explanatory power. Table 1 also shows considerable variability in the number Cases. A Boxplot in SPSS showed four extreme outliers, or values more than three times the interquartile range. There were no such cases for Deaths. We computed a separate analysis for Cases excluding the extreme outliers, and the interpretation of the results remained the same.",

Whereas others have identified direct effects [24] [25] [26] , our results suggest county-level racial attitudes and biases can play important moderating roles.

They also help rule out some potential explanations, including demographics, the health of the residents, the levels to which they are insured, have access to food, employed, and have financial resources. After taking into account these possibilities, it is possible that county-level racial attitudes are reflective of systemic forms of racism [49] . From this perspective, racial attitudes captured at the aggregate level represent the bias of crowds [20] and are emblematic of deeper biases that are embedded into systems within society. From this perspective, collective racial attitudes might give rise to racially biased societal arrangements, including those in the area of religion, business, education, criminal justice, and of particular importance to this study, healthcare. Payne et al. further argued that \"In addition to functioning as a marker of systemic prejudice, implicit bias can also serve as a mechanism that translates systemic prejudice into individual discrimination\" (p. 239). These dynamics would explain why, for example, implicit racial attitudes at the aggregate level are linked with racial differences in police shootings [27], punishments of Black school children [28], and various health-related outcomes [24] [25] [26] . The biases are learned and maintained over time such that the inequalities perpetuate. One apt illustration comes in the area of machine learning, where racial inequalities in healthcare over time have resulted in racially biased algorithms used to manage population health [50] .",

The results could, therefore, vary if the additional cases were considered.",

First, the scholarship related to and understanding of COVID-19 continues to advance [34], but there is still much to learn. Our county-level approach proved to be efficacious, as we identified factors that contributed to more cases and deaths. The alternative approach is also needed, where researchers identify county-and community-level factors that help mitigate the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. From a general public health standpoint, we echo Blair and Brondolo's [23] sentiments, encouraging continued research related to the community-level effects of explicit racial attitudes and implicit racial biases.
