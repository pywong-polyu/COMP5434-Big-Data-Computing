Adopt the Stoic Philosophy principles [1] and change your viewpoint, keeping control of your judgment and assign responsibilities only in cases where you can do so. An attitude of blame is not at all helpful. Trying to exorcise the past is futile. It is worthwhile to transform this difficulty into a valuable training experience, and to explore the benefits of staying healthy and becoming wise and knowledgeable from this unbelievable crisis. 2. Appreciate simple daily moments. Take a few minutes to recognize the value of many simple everyday moments that are now put \"on hold.\" It is now time to do so, making a simple list and prioritizing the value of these moments and events. 3. Take advantage of learning opportunities. Becoming more familiar with \"distance communication\" tools.",

Digital content and Industry 4.0 tools are available to be utilized and serve us. As a researcher, it is the right time to think, plan, and design carefully future research. There are also opportunities to write, review, and edit technical papers, assisting those who are working to get published, and continuing the scientific activities of the community. 4. Have a period of self-assessment. This period can be used constructively to re-discover ourselves, to make a \"pause\" and see our weaknesses and our strengths, more quietly and diligently. Re-assess, review, revise, and reload, in order to be prepared and begin again strongly and consistently. For many of us, it could be a \"fresh start.\"",
