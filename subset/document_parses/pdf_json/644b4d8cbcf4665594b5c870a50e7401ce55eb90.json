However, only a few cases were reported so far. Infections appear associated with increased disease severity and higher mortality in infected critically ill patients. Possible factors contributing to infection are underlying psychiatric disease resulting in institutionalization of respective patients, and polytoxicomania. Controlled data on the therapy of severe adenovirus infections are lacking and remains experimental. In conclusion, data on HAdV-B21 infections causing severe pneumonia or ARDS are scarce. Controlled clinical trials on the therapy of adenovirus pneumonia are non existent and thus there is no established therapy so far. ICU physicians should be aware of this potentially devastating disease and further studies are needed. (C.A. Pfortmueller), mariateresa.barbani@ifik.unibe.ch (M.T.

Adenovirus infections are mostly self-limiting in immune-competent patients with treatment mainly relying on supportive measures [10, 11] . Life threatening adenovirus infections, e.g. viral pneumonia and ARDS were reported and associated with a few adenovirus types, but appear to be rare [8, 11] .

Differentiated catecholamine and volume therapy was started. Bilateral pleural effusions were drained.

No quantitative PCR was performed in case 2 but the cycle threshold (CT) values by qualitative real-time PCR were very low in BAL (15.2) and in plasma (19.7) , which corresponds to a high virus load in both specimen types, with the virus load in BAL higher than in plasma, similar to case 1. In both cases adenovirus was isolated by viral culture on A549 cells and initial typing by partial sequencing of the hexon gene [12] resulted in HAdV-B21. Complete genomic sequencing confirmed these results and identified this virus as subtype 21a (see Fig. 2 ). In case 1, adenovirus DNA was also quantified in autoptic tissue specimens. The adenovirus DNA concentration was high in specimens of the left and right lung (74 and 312 copies of adenovirus DNA/cell, respectively) and low (b0.1 copies/cell) in all other organs and tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, stomach, jejunum, colon, pancreas, thyroid, lymph node) tested, with exception of the pancreas, which had a virus load of 4 copies/cell. These results indicate that adenovirus replication in this case was almost completely limited to the lung tissue. Therefore, the high virus loads detected in plasma probably originated from the lungs. By contrast, disseminated adenovirus infections of immunosuppressed patients, which result also in high virus loads in peripheral blood, are caused by virus replication in multiple internal organs [13] . However, in the immunosuppressed patient, these infections are often associated with other types of adenoviruses than in healthy hosts and may therefore have that other replication rates in the different organs than HAdV-B21 infections.",

The high virulence of the currently circulating HAdV-B21 may contribute to rapid disease progression. Lack of awareness of treating ICU physicians for the severity of adenoviral lower respiratory tract infection may result in delayed treatment. However, if early treatment of viral ARDS and particularly of HAdV-B21 related disease would make a difference in terms of outcome, remains unclear. The effectiveness of antiviral treatment in patients with viral ARDS, the choice of drug, its dosage and treatment duration, remain an area of debate and research, even in case of the more prevalent influenza virus infections [26] [27] [28] . In 2014, a metaanalysis of 29,234 patients by Muthuri and co-authors found a significant reduction of mortality in adult patients with influenza A treated early with neuraminidase inhibitors [29] . The effect on mortality was lower when treatment was delayed and not significant in children [29] . Two recently published studies do not support high-dose treatment with oseltamivir [26, 27] . On the other hand, a Cochrane review on prevention and treatment of influenza with neuraminidase inhibitors found no effect on serious influenza complications such as ARDS [30] . There is little evidence to guide treatment of adenovirus-related ARDS. No prospective randomized clinical trials have been performed to date to support the use of any antiviral agent for adenovirus infection [31, 32] . Cidofovir and brincidofovir appear to be effective treatments for severe adenovirus infections and are frequently used in immunocompromised patients [31] [32] [33] , but none of these substances is approved for this indication [34] . Therefore, further research is certainly warranted.",

It was suggested that a psychiatric disorder may make patients more vulnerable to adenovirus infections because of close contacts with fellow in-patients [35] . Facilitated spread of infection and reduced standards of hygiene may be important with regard to children in day-care facilities [36] . Last but not least patients with psychiatric disorders may be at increased risk for malnourishment [37] . [19] Third, respiratory adenovirus infections are frequently transmitted by droplets and thus start as upper respiratory tract infections. An adequate response of the patient (e.g. bed rest) may limit or delay spread of the infection to the lower respiratory tract. Pneumotropic adenovirus types may effectively disseminate through the respiratory tract because apical infection of ciliated airway cells is more efficient and subsequently more virus is shed into the airways [38] . Tissue injury may be promoted by proinflammatory cytokines such as IP-10 and I-Tac induced by pneumotropic adenovirus types [38] . Host factors impacting on the occurrence of HAdV-B21 are currently unclear and should be studied in future analyses.",
