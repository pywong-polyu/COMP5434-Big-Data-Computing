            "text": "Pandemic transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) due to severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel \u03b2-coronavirus, has caused an unprecedented public health threat in the 21st century. As of May 25, 2020 , the global number of COVID-19 cases was >5.3 million, with 342,029 deaths. 1 The rapid dissemination of disease may be attributed to the presence of asymptomatic patients with active shedding of virus, [2] [3] [4] [5] which may lead to direct transmission by the droplet route and indirect transmission via contact with a contaminated environment. Superspreading events associated with explosive increase in number of cases may further complicate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. 6, 7 The basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 of (~2.7) is similar to that of SARS-CoV, 8 both of which are markedly lower than that of airborne measles (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , 9 suggesting that airborne transmission is not a major route of infection. However, clinical and experimental investigations have suggested possible airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 10, 11 In the experimental setting with artificial generation of aerosol, SARS-CoV-2 remained detectable in aerosols up to 3 hours. 11 In the clinical setting, the collection of air samples in patients' rooms is the most direct approach to determining the presence of airborne virus, but the findings have been inconsistent. 10, 12 In a study from Singapore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the air samples collected adjacent to patients' heads. 12 A subsequent study demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 44% of air samples in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan, China, although the average viral load in the air samples was low. 10 Here, we performed air sampling from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high to low viral loads in their respiratory samples to resolve this controversy. In addition, we also conducted environmental sampling to correlate the viral load of patients' clinical samples with the positivity rate of environmental samples. Our findings have implications for the understanding of hospital COVID-19 transmission and the formulation of infection control policy.",

To increase the proportion of exhaled air sampled and to reduce the proportion of environmental air from the air conditioning system with 12 air changes per hour, an umbrella fitted with transparent plastic curtain was used as an air shelter to cover patients during sample collection ( Supplementary Fig. 1a-d online) . Air samples of patients inside this air shelter were collected using the Sartorius MD8 airscan sampling device (Sartorius AG, Germany) with sterile gelatin filters (80 mm in diameter and 3 \u03bcm pore size (type 17528-80-ACD) (Sartorius AG). Briefly, the air sampler was perpendicularly positioned 10 cm away from the patient's chin. At a rate of 50 L per minute, 1,000 L of air was collected by each gelatin filter for 20 minutes while patients were with or without a surgical mask that complies with the ASTM F2100 level 1 standard. Patients 1-6 were chosen as cases to detect whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in the air. As positive controls, COVID-19 patients were instructed to sneeze directly onto the gelatin filter used for the air sampler and to spit saliva droplets onto the gelatin filter. Patients 7-10 were chosen as positive controls, and patient 6 served as both a case and his own control. After air sampling or collecting the positive controls, each gelatin filter was soaked into 5 mL viral transport medium (VTM) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 minutes. After dissolution of the gelatin filter, 1 mL VTM was collected for nucleic acid extraction, as we described previously. 13 ",

Our finding is consistent with the initial observation reported in Singapore where all air samples had no detectable SARS-CoV-2 inside the isolation room, including air samples collected when the sampler was placed next to patients' heads. 12 Although SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 2 of 3 air outlet fan next to patients' heads, the level of these fans, whether at the roof or ground level, was not specified. An air outlet fan located at ground level may be easily contaminated by respiratory droplets instead of airborne aerosols. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the air samples collected in the patients' area in the ICU in Wuhan, China. 10 To interpret these apparently discordant findings, we must note that there is no standardized method for collecting air samples for virological investigation. 15 Different models of air samplers and protocols were used in our study and the other 2 previous studies. More importantly, the rates of collection and the total volumes of air collected were also different. In our study, we collected a total of 1,000 L of air at a rate of 50 L per minute for 20 minutes per sample ( Table 3 ). The study from Singapore was conducted in a single room with negative pressure setting similar ours, and 1,200 L of air at a rate of 5 L per minute was collected, which required 4 hours per air sample collection. In the study from Wuhan, China, a total of 9,000 L of air at a rate of 300 L per minute was collected for 30 minutes per air sample within the ICU housing 15 patients, and also in a general ward housing 24 patients. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in their air samples may be attributed to a larger volume of 9,000 L of air being collected in both the ICU and the general ward. The higher rates of positive air samples in ICUs than that in general wards may be related to the performance of aerosol-generating procedures in ICUs, especially in an ICU with an open-cubicle design. This situation is similar to the occurrence of opportunistic airborne transmission leading to the SARS outbreak in ICU in 2003. 16 We have no doubt that the air around COVID-19 patients may contain SARS-CoV-2, as extrapolated from a study on respiratory viruses including common cold-related human coronaviruses from the exhaled breath directly from the infected patients. 17 In this study using a G-II bioaerosol collecting device, exhaled breath particles were directly captured and differentiated into 2 size fractions including respiratory droplets of particles with aerodynamic diameter >5 \u03bcm and aerosols of particles \u22645 \u03bcm. Among the exhaled air samples collected without a face mask, 6 of 10 participants (60%) with common cold coronavirus infection did not shed detectable virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols. Only 4 patients had detectable virus at low median viral load (0.3 log 10 virus copies per sample). Assuming that the tidal volume of a young adult is 500 mL and that the average respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute, the total volume of exhaled air is 8 L per minute, which totals 240 L per 30 minutes. Given the median viral load of coronavirus of 0.3 log 10 virus copies per each exhaled breath sample collected for 30 minutes, the concentration of viral RNA per liter of exhaled air becomes negligible (0.00125 copies per liter of air). 17 In 2 studies (including our study) of air sampling from COVID-19 patients, the air samples were not completely composed of exhaled breath but of a mixture of both room air and exhaled air from patients. 10, 12 Therefore, negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA findings might be expected in volumes of 1,000-1,200 L of air samples in AIIRs. Even though we used an umbrella with curtain to reduce the dilution effect of air inside the AIIRs, it was not sufficient to improve the yield of SARS-CoV-2 detection.",

In a murine model, the infectious dose of 2003 SARS-CoV was estimated to be 43-280 plaque-forming units. 18 Based on our experiment, 1 plaque-forming unit is equivalent to a mean of 1.67 \u00d7 10 4 virus genome copies/mL. Assuming that the infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV or common cold coronaviruses, the susceptible individual may need to stay with a COVID-19 case for 19.5 years to obtain enough virus inoculum as extrapolated from the exhaled breath virus concentration detected by G-II bioaerosol collecting device. Similarly, a susceptible patient needs to stay in a Wuhan ICU for 44.5 days to become infected, theoretically (Supplementary Table 2 online), provided that the other routes of transmission are absent. In fact, prolonged exposure in the same confined environment was also required for animal-to-animal transmission, as illustrated in our caged hamster experiment. 19 We only collected air samples from 6 patients with a total collection time of~2 hours when they were not wearing a surgical mask; thus, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of a single erratic event of high virus inoculum being shed by the COVID-19 patients when a longer period of sampling is performed. Our previous study showed that wearing of a surgical mask by either patients or healthcare workers prevented nosocomial transmission of influenza during the pandemic of influenza A H1N1 virus in 2009. 20 Recently, we also demonstrated that community-wide wearing of face masks could minimize the transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. 21 Our present findings may also support the usefulness of wearing surgical masks by patients in minimizing environmental contamination by their own respiratory droplets and saliva.",

However, the use of a face mask to prevent dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 was challenged by a recent study on 4 patients who were instructed to cough directly onto a petri dish containing VTM, which was placed at~20 cm from the patient's mouth, with or without surgical or cotton mask. 22 In this study, the shedding of virus was sporadic. In 1 patient who coughed without wearing face mask, only 1 of 2 coughing episodes yielded detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Notably, the viral load in the VTM exposed to coughing from patients was highest when patient was coughing without mask (2.56 log copies/mL), followed by coughing with surgical mask (2.42 log copies/mL) and coughing with cotton mask (1.85 log copies/mL). These findings suggest that cotton masks may offer better or similar protection as surgical masks. Surprisingly, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 3 of 4 surface swabs collected from inner sides of a surgical mask and a cotton mask, even though 3 of 4 patients produced detectable viral RNA in the petri dish placed 20 cm from patient's mouth. Whether such apparently discrepant findings can be explained by complicated aerodynamics deserves further investigation.",

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is one of the very few areas where community-wide wearing of face mask was practiced from the beginning of this COVID-19 epidemic. 21 We promoted proactive infection control measures in the hospitals with enforcement of hand hygiene practice and environmental cleaning, 14, 23 and all hospitalized patients were provided with surgical masks as source control to reduce the amount of environmental contamination. 14 However, the mandatory use of surgical masks by hospitalized patients in studies from Singapore and China was not mentioned. 10, 12 In addition, we have been promoting hand hygiene among our hospitalized patients. [24] [25] [26] Therefore, our single-room environment with confirmed cases of COVID-19 was significantly less contaminated than that in Singapore and Wuhan, China. Of our 377 environmental samples collected before daily cleaning and disinfection, only 5% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, compared with 10%-85% in hospitals in Singapore and Wuhan, China. 10, 12 Moreover, we showed that the higher viral load of patients' clinical samples correlated with the likelihood of environmental contamination. When the viral load of clinical samples was \u22653 log copies/ mL, environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 could be detected. Among all sampled items and locations, patients' mobile phones were the most frequently contaminated item. This personal electronic device is not routinely disinfected by the hospital cleaning team. This finding has implications for the disinfection policy of commonly shared electronic devices for patient care in the hospital. Ultraviolet C light-emitting disinfecting device specifically designed for electronic mobile device was advocated during this pandemic. 27, 28 The bed rail was another item highly contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 that is frequently touched by both patients and healthcare workers, as illustrated previously. 29 Therefore, enforcement of hand hygiene in healthcare workers and patients remains the cornerstone of infection control, [24] [25] [26] especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. 30 Correct wearing of a surgical mask, diligent practice of hand hygiene, and thorough environmental disinfection should be sufficient for the prevention of COVID-19 in the hospital setting, except during aerosol-generating procedures or when high numbers of COVID-19 patients are concentrated in a cohort ward. This study has several limitations. First, the patient number was low. The total process of air sampling including the preparation and instructions to patient took at least 2 hours per patient. Thus, some patients refused to join the study. Second, the temporal fluctuations of a patient's viral load, the performance of aerosolgenerating procedures, and the immunity of susceptible person were not included in the calculation of the infectious virus dose. Further investigations of the complicated aerodynamics of the SARS-CoV-2-laden aerosols, especially in the cohort ward setting or during aerosol-generating procedures, should be performed.",

The inoculum resulted in cycle-threshold values between 20 and 22, similar to those observed in samples obtained from the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans. e Aerosols were maintained in the Goldberg drum and samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min after aerosolization on a 47-mm gelatin filter (Sartorius). Filters were dissolved in 10 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS, and 3 replicate experiments were performed. f The virus titer was greatly reduced from 10 3.7 to 10 0.6 TCID 50 per milliliter after 72 hours on plastic and from 10 3.7 to 10 0.6 TCID 50 per milliliter after 48 hours on stainless steel. h Not including identification of SARS-CoV-2. i A bioaerosol collecting device, the Gesundheit-II (G-II) to capture exhaled breath particles and differentiated them into 2 size fractions, where exhaled breath coarse particles >5 \u03bcm (respiratory droplets) were collected by impaction with a 5-\u03bcm slit inertial Teflon impactor and the remaining fine particles \u22645 \u03bcm (aerosols) were collected by condensation in buffer.",
