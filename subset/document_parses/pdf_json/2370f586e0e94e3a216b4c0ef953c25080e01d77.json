We investigated perceived stressors, prevalence of psychological distress and suicidal ideation, and predictors of psychological distress among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Eswatini. This study was a cross-sectional, population-based household telephone survey of 993 conveniently sampled adults (18+ years) from all the four administrative regions of Eswatini. Data were collected between 9 June and 18 July 2020 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the country was under a partial lockdown. COVID-19-related psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale (K6). We performed weighted modified Poisson regression analyses to identify significant predictors of moderate/severe psychological distress (K6 scores: \u22655). The weighted prevalences of moderate (K6 scores: 5-12) and severe psychological distress (K6 scores: \u226513) were 41.7% and 5.4%, respectively. Participants reported several perceived COVID-19-related stressors, including worries and fears of the contagion-specific death, serious need for food and money, and concerns about loss of income or business. The weighted prevalence of suicidal ideation was 1.5%. Statistically significant predictors of increased risk for moderate/severe psychological distress included living in the Hhohho and Manzini regions; feeling not well informed about COVID-19; feeling lonely; having received COVID-19 food or financial relief from the government; feeling burdened by the lockdown; being married; and being youth (18-24 years). The results call for the government to urgently augment the provision of mental health services during the pandemic. Mental health practitioners and programs may use several stressors and risk factors identified in this study to inform interventions and government policies aimed at reducing psychological distress induced by the pandemic.",

Recent pre-pandemic data to enable direct comparison during the same period are not readily available. However, a 2017 nationally representative survey found that 5.2% and 0.2% of adult women reported physical and sexual violence in the 12 months prior to the survey, respectively [27] . To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the mental health of the Eswatini population during the pandemic. It is against this backdrop that we conducted this study due to the following reasons: (1) to determine the perceived stressors (i.e., fears, concerns, and critical or serious needs) related to COVID-19 and the lockdown, (2) to describe the prevalence of psychological distress and suicidal ideation during the pandemic, and (3) to determine the predictors of moderate/severe psychological distress among the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic in Eswatini.",

We used a single-stage stratified random sampling strategy to select households from a list of all residential landline telephone numbers abstracted from the hard copy of the 2020 EPTC Telecommunications Directory. The regional codes were used to stratify the telephone numbers by region, which were reconfirmed by participants during the interviews. To create our sampling frame, we first entered all residential telephone numbers manually into four Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and random numbers were generated for sampling until the required sample size was reached per region. Households with faulty lines or no response after two separate attempts were replaced with the next telephone number on the random list. Within each household, we used convenience sampling to select one adult family member (\u226518 years), irrespective of their gender, who was available for an interview, but first preference was given to household heads and all participants had to be Swati. We excluded those with hearing problems.",

The English language version of the questionnaire was forward-translated into Siswati by a native bilingual Swati and thereafter submitted to another bilingual native to cross-check if the translated version reflected the original scale, of which it was found to be the case. In addition, two native experts independently reviewed the translated version and concurred that it reflected the original English version of the scale. Prior to the main data collection, the questionnaire was pretested among 10 participants, and there were no modifications that ensued from the pretest as the instrument was found to work well. On average, each interview lasted for about 15 min, including time for informed consent procedures.

We used the sub-threshold (K6 scores: \u22655) for two reasons: first, we considered a score of \u22655 as clinically significant [39, 41, 42] . Prochaska et al. [39] noted that, when used at the conventional cut-off points of \u226513, the K6 fails to capture individuals struggling with more moderate mental distress that nonetheless warrants mental health intervention, because mental illness manifests in different symptoms in different cultural groups while some ethnic groups may be less forthcoming in reporting psychological symptoms, such as in Southern Africa [39, 45] . Second, using the cut-off points of \u22655 was a statistical consideration [42] , after noting that there were few participants classified as severely distressed in this study (see Section 2.3).",

As a result, all weighted analyses were post-stratified by age, sex, residence, and region based on population totals (controls) from the 2017 Eswatini Population and Housing Census [2] . Thus, weighted frequencies, proportions, and means were computed to describe sample characteristics and main study variables. We performed weighted modified Poisson regression [53, 54] (i.e., with a robust error variance obtainable automatically through the svy command) to directly estimate prevalence ratios for moderate/severe psychological distress (K6 scores: \u22655), which were equivalent to risk ratios (RRs), similar to the analytic methods used by Scheim, et al. [55] . However, since some studies use the cut-off points of \u226513, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using ordinal logistic regression with the three-category measure of psychological distress (none/low distress (K6 scores: 0-4): 0; moderate distress (K6 scores: 5-12): 1; and severe distress (K6 score: \u226513): 2) to illustrate the consistency of our results at K6 scores of \u22655 and \u226513.

Differences in the prevalence in the different studies could be due to different measurements; for example, some used the K10 version of the scale [17, 24] , and some have either used the K6 as a continuous variable [48] or used the cut-off point of \u226513 to indicate serious mental illness [8, 58] . At the K6 cut-off point of \u226513, the 5.4% prevalence is comparable to the 3.4-8% prevalence reported from studies conducted in the U.S. [38] [39] [40] , including during the ongoing pandemic [11] . In addition, our reference period for the symptoms of psychological distress in our study was not \"the past 30 days\" used in the original K6 which measures point prevalence [37] . Instead, we modified this period to be specific to the pandemic, so that we measured the prevalence of psychological distress during the pandemic (period prevalence), thus trying to exclude pre-pandemic psychological distress symptoms. Kessler et al. [40] provided guidance on the recall periods for the K6 as used in the WHO World Mental Health survey initiative, stating: \" . . . the decision about which recall period was used hinged on whether the investigators were interested in calibrating SMI point prevalence (most useful for screening in clinical settings), 12-month prevalence (most useful for estimating prevalence in surveys used for health-policy planning purposes, as the year is the usual health-policy planning period), or both\". Thus, since our study was population-based, the period prevalence reference period was more appropriate.",

The potential reasons for the lower reliability in our study could be that the instrument was originally developed and validated in native English speakers, whereas for our sample, English was their second language. The K6 website (https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/k6_scales.php (accessed on 2 May 2020)) also does not yet have a SiSwati version of the instrument, which we could have otherwise used. Even though the reported Cronbach's alpha of the K6 was acceptable, this statistic is not an adequate measure of instrument reliability [61] , and therefore, it does not substitute the need for specific validation studies of the K6 in the studied population. Third, as already mentioned, we measured period prevalence (since the pandemic started), whereas the original version assesses point prevalence (last 30 days), which could have also impacted the performance of the scale in our study. However, despite the aforementioned discrepancies and limitations of using the K6 in our study, we do not believe that our results were adversely affected by its lower reliability than previously reported ones, since it still demonstrated good internal consistency in this study.",

[39] argued that due to the low sensitivity of the K6 when used at the K6 cut-off points of \u226513, especially at the population level, it results in some respondents with significant mental distress going undetected. Lee, et al. [62] and Sakurai et al. [63] suggested that different \"optimal\" cut-offs may be used with the K6, depending on the prevalence in the target population, cost-effectiveness, and purpose of the screening, e.g., screening individuals vs. generating prevalence estimates in an epidemiological survey where the cut-off can be selected at a level that can also capture subthreshold cases. Prochaska et al. [39] found that 27.9% of respondents in their study identified themselves as experiencing moderate mental distress (5 \u2264 K6 scores < 13) that impacted functioning across multiple impairment domains (work, household, social, family/friends, and disability) and was associated with increased utilization of mental health treatment. Using the Youden index and the \"shortest distance to upper left corner\" methods-the most suitable methods to determine an optimal cut-off point, because they are least dependent on population prevalence. In a community and hospital-based Japanese sample, Sakurai et al. [63] found an optimal cut-off point of 4/5 for the K6. Thus, the authors [63] recommended that a cut-off point of 4/5 for the K6 may be used in the screening of mood/anxiety disorders in the general population as well as in epidemiological studies on depression or psychological distress, whereas the 12/13 cut-off point may be used if a screening program targets severe mental illness, has limited resources for secondary screening (e.g., manpower of health care professionals), and thus expects a high post probability of the disorders in the positives. Kessler et al. [37] also pointed out that dimensional measures of nonspecific psychological distress like the K6 distinguish community cases based on severity rather than purely on diagnosis. For that reason, in this study, the K6 was used to assess the frequency and severity of psychological distress symptoms for policy-planning purposes rather than for clinical diagnostic purposes. In any case, performing weighted statistical multivariate modelling at the K6 cut-off point of \u226513 would not have been appropriate in our case due to the few observations in this category.",

For example, traditional burial rituals, e.g., washing corpses, prolonged mourning (known as kufukama), were banned during the lockdown to reduce the risk of transmission. As the country's mortuaries became full, the government instructed families to bury relatives within three days compared to the one-to-four weeks mourning periods before the pandemic; night vigils were also banned, and all burials were held within two hours, giving people less time to mourn. Therefore, coupled with school closures, banning of any social or religious gatherings, loss of jobs, and income for a large sector may have potentially induced the observed moderate/severe psychological distress among the populace.",

First, before COVID-19, Eswatini had never experienced an acute and rapidly spreading infectious disease, unlike some countries in West Africa (e.g., with Ebola); hence, there was no prior in-country experience to draw from. Second, the COVID-19 mitigation in Eswatini was not placed under existing infectious disease programs. Instead, it was placed under the country's Natural Disaster Management Agency (NDMA). Unfortunately, this resulted in poor coordination between the already existing health programs that had experience in handling chronic infectious pandemics like HIV and TB. Third, the country's NMDA had never handled any health-related disaster before, and they were not only ill-equipped with regards to financial and physical resources to deal with a pandemic of this nature, but also lacked the technical expertise to do so. Therefore, experience gained from existing infectious disease programs was not fully harnessed.",

A study conducted in 2014 in Eswatini found a 9.3% prevalence of suicidal ideation over 12 months among a nationally representative sample of adults (15-69 years) [29] . Differences in the prevalence from the two studies could be that our assessment was in reference to the first three months of the pandemic, and our question on suicidal ideation was specific to the pandemic. Hence, our estimate was lower than reported from the study conducted in 2014. However, considering the short coverage period for our study, the 1.5% prevalence can be considered to be high, and it is anticipated that it rose during the pandemic, as observed in other contexts. For example, in the U.S., a collection of three-month cross-sectional data during the beginning of the pandemic revealed that the percentage of suicidal ideation was increased each month for those under the lockdown [64] . In the Czech Republic, the prevalence of suicide risk tripled from 3.9% in 2017 to 11.9% in 2020 [60] . However, a recent systematic review on suicidal outcomes during major international respiratory outbreaks, including COVID-19, found weak support for an association between pandemics, suicide, and suicide-related outcomes [65] , underscoring the need for longitudinal studies.",

            "text": "The findings of fear of contracting contagion, loneliness, disturbed sleep, food insecurity, and financial worries are not unexpected based on results from other studies [13, 21, 66] . In Australia, Newby et al. [59] found that 25.9% of their participants were very or extremely worried about contracting COVID-19, 52.7% were worried about their family and friends contracting COVID-19, and 50% were concerned about uncertainty, loneliness, and financial worries. In the Czech Republic, Winkler et al. [60] found that strong worries about the health and/or economic consequences of COVID-19 were associated with increased odds of having a mental disorder. The finding on disturbed sleep due to worries was not surprising judged from the new realities that came with the pandemic, including perceived and real threats posed by the uncertainty of the situation, e.g., uncertainties regarding a cure, fear of the unknown, and fear of contracting and dying from the disease, especially at the time of data collection for this study. These findings may be explained by the fact that in a pandemic fear is common due to reactions of individuals' adaptive defense mechanisms for survival via several biological processes in preparation for a response to the potentially threatening event, which however increases anxiety and stress levels in healthy individuals, especially when it is chronic or disproportionate [67] . Financial worries and food insecurities are also expected during a lockdown, as people lose jobs or means of business, shops close and movements are restricted. A recent qualitative study found that people living in informal settlements in South Africa were affected by lack of savings, loss of income, shortage of food and hunger, anxiety, and depression during the pandemic [68] .",

These regions, being home to the country's two major cities and with Manzini housing the largest industrial town, were the most affected by lockdowns, since most of the businesses are located there and most of the employed population resides. Hence, participants from those areas might be at an increased risk of moderate/severe psychological distress. That could also explain the finding that those who felt burdened by the lockdown had an increased risk of moderate/severe psychological distress since the lockdowns were mainly enforced in these areas more than anywhere else, e.g., through police patrols and roadblocks.",

            "text": "This study also revealed that participants whose households received COVID-19 food or financial relief from the government had an increased risk of moderate/severe psychological distress. Although not overtly intuitive, this finding is not unexpected since for households to receive such relief in the first place. They must be of a low socioeconomic status, e.g., having no stable income or no breadwinner, and low socioeconomic status was linked to psychological distress [23] . In the U.S., unemployed men and women receiving means-tested or welfare benefits were found to be more likely to report depression, in both the short and long term [70] . In another U.S. study, depression and anxiety symptoms increased among households who reported receiving unemployment insurance benefits, relative to a period when an unemployment insurance benefit was in effect [71] . Therefore, the direction of the association for this finding may not necessarily mean that receiving the COVID-19 relief materials induced moderate/severe psychological distress among recipients, but rather that recipients may have already been moderately/severely psychologically distressed (reverse causation) due to their difficult financial or social conditions. Thus, longitudinal studies are warranted to establish the temporality between these variables which may, in turn, serve as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the COVID-19 relief program in reducing the psychological burden induced by the pandemic among the recipients.",

In our case, the purpose of the ordinal logistic regression analysis was to assess if the predictors were the same at the K6 cut-off points of \u22655 and \u226513. We could have fitted a multinomial regression model, similar to previous studies [39] ; however, in our sample, the group aged at \u226513 was not adequate to fit a multivariable multinomial logistic model. Since the K6 cut-off points have some order or ranking, the alternative was to fit an ordinal logistic regression model, a case in which the odds ratio represents the odds of the higher category as compared to all lower categories combined. Our results showed that the predictors of psychological distress were similar at different levels or categorizations of the K6 scores.",

Therefore, our methodology will inform future researchers of the feasibility of telephone-based research in Eswatini. These baseline findings will inform ongoing and future national mitigation efforts aimed at reducing psychological problems induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as by future outbreaks. With COVID-19 being a novel disease, this study adds to the growing body of empirical evidence regarding the impact of the pandemic on mental health. We used an instrument with a well-established cross-cultural validity to measure our main outcome variable [40, 45] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published study that used the K6 in Eswatini, which on its own contributes to the literature regarding the internal consistency of the K6 and will, therefore, inform future studies conducted in this population. However, we did not assess the validity of the original K6 and the translated version used in this study; thus, studies assessing its validity in this population are warranted. Ali et al. [45] noted that cross-cultural application of a screening tool requires that its validity is assessed against gold-standard diagnostic interviews, e.g., fully structured research diagnostic interviews administered by lay interviewers [40] .",

First, in the absence of comparable studies on the psychological distress status of the population before the pandemic in Eswatini, we cannot be certain that all the prevalence values of psychological distress observed in our sample were due to the pandemic, especially because other events and changes occurred before and continued to occur during the pandemic. It should also be noted that the data were collected in the early stages of the pandemic and therefore may not reflect the situation during the entire pandemic. Second, coverage survey bias (which was high in our case since the landline service covers approximately 4.5% of the country's population) and selection bias are inherent in telephone-based surveys, as they exclude those members of the population who do not have telephone lines, of which unweighted findings are not generalizable to the entire Eswatini adult population.",

In addition, we collected the data at a time when the measures of the partial lockdown were strictly enforced by the government and many emplooyees were working from home, whom we would have not enrolled had the data been collected at another time e.g. when the lockdown had been lifted or was not in place.",

Fifth, using only one item to measure suicidal ideation does not fully capture the concept, which may result in a low level of ideation reporting in our study, hence creating the aforementioned statistical issues related to this outcome. Lastly, self-reporting of behaviors may not be the same as actual behaviors, of which some reporting bias may be present; however, this is assumed to occur at random.",

Psychological interventions should be implemented urgently, especially for those subgroups that were found to have an increased risk of moderate/severe psychological distress in this study. These include decentralizing mental health services to communities through the existing community outreach program to provide counseling to affected individuals as well as referring those who require material support to the relevant existing structures to reduce their stressors. Mental health service providers should also engage communities to ascertain the kind of material support they need to ensure that initiatives respond directly to needs of disadvantaged groups during the ongoing pandemic.",
