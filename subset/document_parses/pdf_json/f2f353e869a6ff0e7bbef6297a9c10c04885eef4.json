            "text": "Animal models recapitulating human COVID-19 disease, especially severe disease, are urgently needed to understand pathogenesis and to evaluate candidate vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we develop novel severe-disease animal models for COVID-19 involving disruption of adaptive immunity in Syrian hamsters. Cyclophosphamide (CyP) immunosuppressed or RAG2 knockout (KO) hamsters were exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the respiratory route. Both the CyP-treated and RAG2 KO hamsters developed clinical signs of disease that were more severe than those in immunocompetent hamsters, notably weight loss, viral loads, and fatality (RAG2 KO only). Disease was prolonged in transiently immunosuppressed hamsters and was uniformly lethal in RAG2 KO hamsters. We evaluated the protective efficacy of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody and found that pretreatment, even in immunosuppressed animals, limited infection. Our results suggest that functional B and/or T cells are not only important for the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 but also play an early role in protection from acute disease. IMPORTANCE Syrian hamsters are in use as a model of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Pathology is pronounced in the upper and lower respiratory tract, and disease signs and endpoints include weight loss and viral RNA and/or infectious virus in swabs and organs (e.g., lungs). However, a high dose of virus is needed to produce disease, and the disease resolves rapidly. Here, we demonstrate that immunosuppressed hamsters are susceptible to low doses of virus and develop more severe and prolonged disease. We demonstrate the efficacy of a novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody using the cyclophosphamide transient suppression model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RAG2 knockout hamsters develop severe/fatal disease when exposed to SARS-CoV-2. These immunosuppressed hamster models provide researchers with new tools for evaluating therapies and vaccines and understanding COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

We reasoned that a similar approach might allow the development of a severe-disease model for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, clinical findings of lymphopenia associated with COVID-19 (5) and its prominence in severe cases (6, 7) suggested that an immunosuppressed animal model of COVID-19 might more accurately model some aspects of severe human disease. Here, we used CyP-treated and RAG2 knockout (KO) hamsters to investigate how transient disruption, or ablation, of the adaptive immune response affects SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we used the immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hamster models to evaluate whether preexposure to virus through previous infection or exposure to neutralizing antibodies was sufficient to limit or prevent disease.",

In our first experiment manipulating the adaptive immune response, we immunosuppressed hamsters using CyP (CyP-Tx) beginning at \u03ea3 days postinfection (dpi). Suppression of lymphocytes was confirmed by hematology analysis just prior to challenge (Fig. 1A) . On day 0, groups of 10 hamsters were exposed to 100, 1,000, or 10,000 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal route. Disease progression was monitored by weight loss (Fig. 1B) and detection of viral RNA in pharyngeal swabs using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (Fig. 1C ). Weight loss was remarkably similar between all SARS-CoV-2-exposed groups regardless of dose, with drastic weight loss beginning 6 dpi. Weight loss remained significant relative to starting weight through 35 dpi. In contrast, mock (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] )-challenged hamsters treated with CyP steadily gained weight, with a few exceptions. Specifically, one cage of four mock-challenged hamsters showed evidence of weight loss 9 to 12 dpi. These same animals were the only mock-challenged hamsters that were positive starting at 9 dpi in the SARS-CoV-2 pharyngeal swab RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1C) .",

After the last CyP treatment at 21 dpi, most of the hamsters continued to lose weight, and several hamsters began to exhibit signs of a wasting disease, i.e., cachexia and extreme weight loss, requiring euthanasia ( Fig. 1B  and D) . Then, approximately 7 days after cessation of CyP, the remaining hamsters started gaining weight, and viral RNA levels in pharyngeal swabs dropped below 10 3 molecules of N2 per 100 ng RNA (Fig. 1C ). Viral RNA and infectious virus were detected in lung tissue from a subset of hamsters collected 13 dpi, on the day of euthanasia of moribund animals (14 to 34 dpi), or after euthanasia at 35 dpi (end of study) ( Fig. 1E and F). There was a statistically significant reduction in lung viral burden comparing lung homogenates from 35 dpi to those from 13 dpi. Serum collected from surviving hamsters at 35 dpi was assayed for neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 1G) . Six of the 10 infected hamsters that survived in the CyP immunosuppression experiment never developed detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, the four hamsters that did develop neutralizing antibodies after CyP treatment cessation rebounded more rapidly as measured by weight gain (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that CyP treatment allowed a persistent infection that was reversed in most animals when CyP treatment was stopped and the adaptive immune response was allowed to recover.",

RAG2 KO hamsters were exposed to 10,000 PFU SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal route. The RAG2 KO hamsters showed significant weight loss starting at 3 dpi ( Fig. 2A) , and the infection was uniformly lethal, with a median day-to-death of 6 days (P \u03ed 0.0025; log rank test) (Fig. 2B ). Viral RNA amounts detected from pharyngeal swabs trended to be higher than in those from the CyP-treated hamsters, but this was not statistically significant (Fig. 2C ). The 10,000 PFU and PBS mock groups from the CyP experiment shown in Fig. 1 were included in Fig. 2A to C for comparison. Organs from the RAG2 KO animals that succumbed or met euthanasia criteria were homogenized and evaluated for viral RNA by RT-PCR. Viral RNA was present at the highest levels in the lung and trachea.

These tracheas also exhibit 4B and C, respectively). Very few ciliated cells were seen in the animals with the heaviest viral load (10 8 molecules of N2 per 100 ng RNA), and there is an absence of cytoplasmic content that is marked by the lack of electron-dense cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 4F ). Protective efficacy of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nine previously infected immunocompetent hamsters from two separate experiments were retained for a rechallenge with SARS-CoV-2. Our goal was to determine if prior infection elicited protective immunity. To ensure that these hamsters had cleared infectious virus after the initial challenge, hamsters were treated with 3 doses of CyP and weights were monitored for 14 days (Fig. 5A ). If the animals were persistently infected, we predicted that hamsters would experience onset of disease following CyP administration, as measured by rapid weight loss and positive pharyngeal swab RT-PCR. No significant weight loss was detected, and swabs were negative for viral RNA (Fig. 5A ). All nine animals were positive for neutralizing antibodies prior to the rechallenge (Fig. 5B) . The nine previously exposed hamsters and seven naive hamsters were challenged with 100,000 PFU SARS-CoV-2. Weights were monitored daily, and pharyngeal swabs were collected every other day for viral RNA RT-PCR. Control animals lost weight as predicted, whereas the previously exposed animals were protected from significant weight loss. Pharyngeal swab RT-PCR indicated a statistically significant reduction in viral RNA detected in rechallenged animals compared to that in naive animals (Fig. 5C ). In addition, the viral load in lung homogenates from animals euthanized at the end of the study indicated a statistically significant (P \u03ed 0.0164; unpaired t test) reduction in viral RNA level in the rechallenged animals Fig. 5D ). There was no infectious virus in the lungs of the rechallenged hamster 7 days after exposure. However, only two of the naive hamsters had infectious virus after challenge (Fig. 5E) . The likely reason for the disappearance of infectious virus in the lungs of the naive group is that those animals had already mounted an immune response and infectious virus was cleared by the time the lung samples were collected. Together, these data indicate that immunocompetent hamsters that had recovered from prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 were not persistently infected, but instead were protected (i.e., protective immunity).",

In this immunosuppressed model, we observe more drastic weight loss, high levels of virus in the lung, and viral persistence that did not begin to resolve until CyP treatment was stopped (Fig. 1) . Histopathologic findings in the lungs of CyP-treated hamsters also demonstrate prolonged pathology and ongoing repair through hyperplastic changes of the bronchial epithelium and type II pneumocytes that were not observed in the sampled RAG2 KO hamsters.

Thus far, STAT2 KO hamsters have been used to demonstrate that type I interferon plays a role in restricting viral dissemination and promoting lung pathology in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals (15) . Here, we found unexpectedly that SARS-CoV-2 challenge resulted in a uniform lethality in the RAG2 KO hamsters. It is interesting that onset of disease, as measured by weight loss, was more rapid (by 3 days) in the RAG2 KO animals than that in immunocompetent, or even transiently immunosuppressed, hamsters receiving the same challenge dose. This indicates that the absence of functional B cells and/or T cells exacerbates pathogenesis at a very early stage (within a day or two) after exposure to virus. The importance of T cells in viral clearance has been noted for other coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV (16) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (17) . In fact, depletion of CD3 \u03e9 T cells correlates with severity and adverse outcomes (18) .",

Here, we show that the immune response from an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, including a robust neutralizing antibody response, is protective against rechallenge. We detected reduced levels of viral RNA in pharyngeal swabs and lungs; however, despite circulating neutralizing antibody available at the time of challenge, viral RNA was still detected 7 days after rechallenge. Viral RNA in pharyngeal swabs on day 5 following rechallenge and in lung tissue on day 7 could indicate that asymptomatic reinfection is possible. Prolonged viral shedding has been observed in human COVID-19 cases, with detectable neutralizing antibody titers (20) . Alternatively, the RNA detected in the swabs could be input virus that is slowly being cleared from the respiratory system.",

Transient and reversible immunosuppression using CyP can be used to increase the severity and duration of the disease state. The advantages of the CyP model are that the wild-type hamsters are readily available and would produce a normal immune response to vaccination. One disadvantage is that disruption of lymphocytes could confound the evaluation of therapeutics that target components of the immune response or of vaccines that require rapid mobilization of the adaptive response. For evaluation of those types of medical countermeasures, the wild-type hamster would be preferred. This is the first report that SARS-CoV-2 is lethal in RAG2 KO hamsters. For practical purposes, uniformly lethal models allow fewer numbers of animals be used to detect significant levels of protection, facilitating rapid screening of candidate therapeutics. RAG2 KO hamsters would not be suitable for the use in active vaccine studies but could be used for antibody passive transfer studies. For example, passive transfer of immune serum from nonhuman primate or human vaccine studies could be an approach to investigate mechanisms of protection. Overall, our hamster SARS-CoV-2 models with severe diseases clinically relevant to those of COVID-19 patients provide a platform for evaluating candidate medical countermeasures to combat the pandemic.",

To detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA in FFPE tissues, in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed using the RNAscope 2.5 high-definition (HD) Red kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA) as described previously (25) . Briefly, 40 ZZ ISH probes targeting SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA fragment 21571-25392 (GenBank accession number LC528233.1) were designed and synthesized by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (catalog no. 854841). Tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene, underwent a series of ethanol washes and peroxidase blocking, and were then heated in kit-provided antigen retrieval buffer and digested by kit-provided proteinase. Sections were exposed to ISH target probe pairs and incubated at 40\u00b0C in a hybridization oven for 2 h. After rinsing, ISH signal was amplified using a kit-provided preamplifier and amplifier conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and incubated with a fast red substrate solution for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were then stained with hematoxylin, air dried, and cover slipped.",

Samples were submerged in Microchem prior to removal from containment suites. Tissue was trimmed and then rinsed with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer before postfixing with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate. After osmium fixation, the samples were rinsed with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, followed by a water wash, and then subjected to uranyl acetate en bloc. Samples were washed with water, then dehydrated through a graded ethanol series that included 3 exchanges with 100% ethanol. Samples were further dehydrated with equal volumes of 100% ethanol and propylene oxide followed by two changes of propylene oxide. Samples were initially infiltrated with equal volumes of propylene oxide and resin (Embed-812; EMS, Hatfield, PA), then incubated overnight in propylene oxide and resin. The next day, the samples were infiltrated with 100% resin, embedded and oriented in 100% resin, and then allowed to polymerize for 48 h at 60 0 C. Sections (1 m thick) were cut from each tissue block, a region of interest for thin sectioning was chosen, and 80-nm thin sections were cut and collected on 200-mesh copper grids.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections (A, B) of lung tissue from CyP-treated hamsters euthanized at 13 dpi show extensive areas of consolidation with dense aggregates of inflammatory cells. (A) Bronchial lumina are lined by hyperplastic folds of respiratory epithelium (asterisk) and the pleural surface is multifocally thickened and expanded by fibrous connective tissue and inflammatory cells (arrows). (B) The bronchial lumina are lined by hyperplastic folds of respiratory epithelium (arrow). Areas of alveolar septa lined rows of type 2 pneumocytes (asterisks). (C) SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was frequently detected by in situ hybridization (ISH) in alveolar pneumocytes, alveolar infiltrates, and bronchiolar respiratory epithelial cells from CyP-treated hamsters. H&E sections (D, E) of lung tissue from RAG2 KO hamsters collected at the time of death. (D) Areas of hemorrhage (asterisk) and inflammation (arrowheads) expanding the interstitium and connective tissue surrounding the bronchi and arteries (arrows). (E) Necrotic bronchial epithelium (arrows) overlaid by hemorrhagic exudate.Peribronchial connective tissue is expanded by lymphocytes, heterophils (asterisks), and fewer macrophages that often contain hemosiderin (arrowheads). There is marked consolidation in surrounding alveoli with marked septal congestion and expansion by previously mentioned inflammatory cells. (F) SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was frequently detected by ISH in alveolar pneumocytes, alveolar infiltrates, and bronchiolar epithelial cells from RAG2 KO hamsters. (G to I) Immunofluorescence assays demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S or NP, green) were detected in bronchiolar epithelium-labeled anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red) (G) club (Clara) cells labeled by anti-CC10 antibody (red) (H) and alveolar epithelial cells labeled by anti-E-cadherin antibody (red) (I) in RAG2 KO hamsters. (J to L) Transmission electron microscopy of hamster the epithelial layer. Trachea from the animal with the lowest lung viral load (10 6 molecules of N2 per 100 ng RNA) showed mostly intact ciliated cells on the surface(Fig. 4A). These cells show several cytoplasmic vacuoles with potential immature virus particles (Fig. 4D and E). As the lung viral load increases, the presence of ciliated cells and epithelial cells lining the tracheal lumen decreases(Fig.",
