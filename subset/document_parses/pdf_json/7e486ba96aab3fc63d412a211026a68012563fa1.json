The H9N2 strain of avian influenza virus (AIV) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are common poultry pathogens that limit the development of the poultry industry. This study aimed to clarify the interaction between these two pathogens and their pathogenic mechanism using a mouse model. Coinfection with H9N2 AIV and E. coli significantly increased the mortality rate of mice compared to single viral or bacterial infections. It also led to the development of more severe lung lesions compared to single viral or bacterial infections. Co-infection further causes a storm of cytokines, which aggravates the host's disease by dysregulating the JAK/STAT/SOCS and ERK1/2 pathways. Moreover, co-infection mutually benefited the virus and the bacteria by increasing their pathogen loads. Importantly, nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expression was also significantly enhanced by the co-infection. It played a key role in the rapid proliferation of E. coli in the presence of the co-infecting H9N2 virus. Therefore, our study underscores the role of NOS2 as a determinant for bacteria growth and illustrates its importance as an additional mechanism that enhances influenza virus-bacteria synergy. It further provides a scientific basis for investigating the synergistic infection mechanism between viruses and bacteria.",

They are divided into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) based on their pathogenicity in chickens. HPAIV is restricted to subset of H5 or H7 subtypes that carry a multi-basic cleavage site in their hemagglutinin (HA) protein, whereas LPAIV covers all the remaining subtypes (Bodewes and Kuiken, 2018; Gischke et al., 2020) . Currently, the H9N2 subtype is the most widely circulating and destructive LPAIV (Sun and Liu, 2015; Gu et al., 2017) . Although its case fatality rate is much lower than HPAIV, it greatly affects the performance of chickens, such as reduced egg production and retarded growth rate, thus causing a significant economic loss to the poultry industry globally.",

This plays a vital role in the emergence of pandemic strains and increases risk of zoonotic transmission of AIVs from birds to humans. Several zoonotic AIVs such as H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H10N8 are all obtained some or all of the \"internal\" genes from H9N2 AIV (Sun and Liu, 2015; Suttie et al., 2019; Song and Qin, 2020) .",

            "text": "H9N2 also has a synergistic effect with multiple pathogens, which further complicates epidemic prevention and control (Umar et al., 2017) . Chickens experimentally infected with H9N2 alone show mild clinical signs and no deaths. However, mixed infections often exacerbate H9N2 infection, which results in severe clinical disease with high mortality. Huang et al. (2017) showed that the co-infection of H9N2 AIV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in chickens resulted in more severe lesions than the AIV-infected group and the IBV-infected group. Moreover, co-infection also significantly alleviated the expression level of chicken surfactant protein A (cSP-A), which plays an essential role in antiviral immunity (Huang et al., 2017) . There are also many reports of mixed H9N2 AIV and bacterial infections. For example, co-infection of H9N2 AIV with either Staphylococcus aureus or Haemophilus paragallinarum enhances viral replication in chickens, causing chickens to exhibit more severe clinical signs than those infected with the virus or bacteria alone (Kishida et al., 2004) . Similarly, minks coinfected with H9N2 IAV and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have exacerbated histopathological lesions in the lung tissue. They also have higher viral loads and delayed bacterial clearance compared to those with single infections (Bo-Shun et al., 2020) . Co-infection of H9N2 AIV with Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most common combination in the respiratory diseases of poultry, which often complicates the treatment of respiratory diseases, causing significant clinical signs or deaths. Previous studies have demonstrated that infection of chickens with H9N2 AIV increases their susceptibility to secondary E. coli infection. Moreover, adhesion of E. coli to host cells significantly increases after H9N2 AIV infection (Ma et al., 2018) . E. coli also increases the virulence of H9N2 AIV and the mortality of infected birds (Barbour et al., 2009; Jaleel et al., 2017; Mosleh et al., 2017) .",

Despite this, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of H9N2 AIV and E. coli co-infection remain poorly understood. Herein, we used a mouse model attempting to explore how these two pathogens work together to exacerbate the disease. Although there are limitations regarding the translation of results from mice to chickens, and a chicken model may be more logical for our experiments, but its obvious limits, such as difficulties in obtaining appropriate antibodies against chicken, and high cost of producing transgenic, gene-knockout or knockin animal model to verify the results drove us to select the mouse model. Additionally, human cases infected by H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry occasionally occur and show flu-like symptoms, implying that this subtype influenza virus has a greater opportunity to adapt to humans and acquire the ability of human-to-human transmission. Therefore, investigating pathogenic mechanisms of H9N2 AIV and E. coli infection in a mammalian model can also provide helpful insights into the pathogenic potential of novel H9N2 viruses and bacteria infection in humans in the future.",

Co-infection of H9N2 AIV and E. coli led to the production of excessive amounts of cytokines, such as inflammatory factors, chemokines, and interferons in the host's lungs. This caused severe pulmonary disease after viral-bacterial co-infection. Moreover, co-infection promoted bacterial growth by increasing nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expression.

            "text": "Lung pathological lesions caused by pathogenic infections are often accompanied by overexpression of various cytokines (Teijaro et al., 2011; Tay et al., 2020) . These cytokines play vital roles in the host's antiviral innate immunity when produced moderately. However, the accumulation of abundant immune cells in the lungs often results in excessive cytokine expression, which leads to severe lung damage and high mortality rates. Herein, co-infection of H9N2 AIV and E. coli led to an aberrant expression of cytokines, including inflammatory factors, chemokines, and interferons. Inflammatory factors and interferons are indispensable in the host's antibacterial and antiviral process. Nonetheless, their aberrant expression is linked to the severity of pneumonia from pathogen infection. Chemokines, which are classified into C, CC, CXC, and CX3C subfamilies according to the NH2-terminal motif of conserved cysteine residues, can mediate leukocyte migration and positioning to the sites for viral or bacterial infection (Baggiolini, 1998; Zargari et al., 2020) . In this study, it is revealed that an aberrant chemokine production including CC and CXC subfamily members mediates the recruitment of more leukocytes (G-I) Levels of p-ERK1/2 (G), p-JNK (H) and p-p38 (I) in (F) were quantitated by densitometry, and normalized to their total protein and \u03b2-actin levels. Plotted are the average levels from three independent experiments. The error bars represent the SE. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. to the lungs, thus contributing to the induction and progression of lung pathology. This mechanism might be the primary cause of elevated morbidity and mortality.",

            "text": "To understand the underlying mechanism of aberrant cytokine production, some critical transcription factors that were involved in cytokine expression were detected. Different cytokines have the propensity to activate specific STATs. Inflammatory factors such as IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 are closely related to STAT3 activation, while interferons induce activation of STAT1 (Villarino et al., 2017) . The phosphorylation level of STAT1 and STAT3 was significantly increased after H9N2 and E. coli co-infection. This was particularly the case for STAT3. SOCS1 and SOCS3 are negative feedback regulators of STAT1 and STAT3. They initiate a negative feedback loop to keep the balance of host secreted cytokines. Nevertheless, excessive expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 can significantly increase the production of interferons and inflammatory factors by modulating the function of NF-\u03baB, causing increased disease severity because of overstimulation of the immune system Liu et al., 2019) . Herein, the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in the lungs of co-infected mice was much higher than that in individual infection groups and the mock group. The expression level of I\u03baB\u03b1 was then further determined as an indirect indicator of NF-\u03baB activation. However, there was no significant difference in the expression level of I\u03baB\u03b1 between the co-infection group and single infection groups (Data not shown). This finding suggested that the excessive expression of cytokines did not result from NF-\u03baB activation. This may be explained by the high expression of Nfkbiz, which can encode a protein negatively regulating NF-\u03baB activity (Totzke et al., 2006) , in co-infection group showed in RNA sequence results.",

            "text": "Expression of SOCS proteins is also associated with activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, which plays a vital role in host inflammation response (Luo et al., 2020) . Herein, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but not JNK and p38, was significantly increased in the co-infection group compared to the single infection groups and mock group. It could have mediated the overproduction of cytokines. However, the regulation mechanism between JAK/STAT/SOCS and ERK1/2 needs further in-depth studies. Similar types of viruses or bacteria often pose a competitive relationship when they intrude the same host cell (Baumler and Sperandio, 2016) . However, virus-bacteria co-infections usually exhibit a synergetic effect (Bo-Shun et al., 2020; Gonzalez-Juarbe et al., 2020; Karwelat et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . In this study, the viral load in the lungs of co-infected mice was significantly higher than that in the H9N2 single infection FIGURE 7 | Increased NOS2 expression promotes E. coli proliferation. (A) RNA sequencing was used to determine the differentially expressed genes in mouse lungs infected for 48 h between individual infection and co-infection groups. All the genes whose expressions were upregulated and changed by at least 2-fold were displayed. The red arrow highlight the upregulated NOS2 genes. (B) The mRNA expression level of NOS2 in mouse lungs was examined by quantitative real-time PCR. (C) MLE12 cells were infected with or without H9N2 (MOI = 1) for 12 h, followed by E. coli (MOI = 10) infection with or without S-Methylisothiourea Sulfate (SMT) treatment. NO production in culture supernatants at the indicated time point was measured by NO assay kit. (D) MLE12 cells were infected with or without H9N2 as described in (C). OD 600 of E. coli in cell culture supernatants at the indicated time point was measured by spectrophotometer. (E) MLE12 cells were infected with or without H9N2 (MOI = 1) for 12 h, followed by E. coli (MOI = 10) infection with or without SMT treatment. After 6 h, the number of E. coli in cell culture supernatants was counted. (F) E. coli cultured in antibiotic-free DMEM was treated with SMT or vehicle control. OD 600 of E. coli in the supernatants at the indicated time point was measured by spectrophotometer. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001. group. Similarly, the bacterial load in the lung, spleen, and liver of the co-infected mice was significantly higher than that in E. coli single infection group. These results confirmed that the influenza virus and E. coli worked synergistically during the co-infection process. RNA sequencing further revealed that the expression of NOS2 was significantly elevated after virusbacteria co-infection. Its expression was positively correlated with the multiplication of E. coli. Previous studies demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 induces NOS2 expression, which in turn triggers the formation of nitrate that's used by bacteria for growth through nitrate respiration (Winter et al., 2013; Baumler and Sperandio, 2016) . The report was consistent with the findings of this study. It further explained why the number of E. coli remarkably increased during H9N2 AIV and E. coli co-infection. Moreover, previous studies postulated that Staphylococcus aureus promotes the replication of influenza viruses by secreting a protease to cleave precursor HA into HA1 and HA2 fragments (Tashiro et al., 1987) . Exploration of whether H9N2 and E. coli exploited a similar mechanism to achieve synergistic effect revealed that this may be the case, because supplementing the filtered E. coli culture medium into H9N2 infected cells promoted the replication of H9N2 AIV (data not shown). Complete genome sequence of E. coli O78 showed that it can produce three trypsin-like serine proteases (Mangiamele et al., 2013) , which may play the part of influenza virus HA activation like Staphylococcus aureus protease does. Construction of serine protease-deletion mutants of E. coli will help to demonstrate whether the trypsin-like serine proteases were responsible for the elevated viral load in the co-infected mice. This is our ongoing task.",

Four groups of BALB/c mice were mock infected, or intranasally infected with single H9N2 AIV (1 \u00d7 10 4 PFU) and E. coli (1.5 \u00d7 10 7 CFU), or co-infected with H9N2 and E. coli for 48 h. Then the mice were euthanized, and the lungs were ground for the preparation of protein and RNA samples.(A) Protein samples were analyzed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Shown are representative data of three independent experiments with similar results. (B,C) Levels of p-STAT1 (B) and p-STAT3 (C) in (A) were quantitated by densitometry, and normalized to their total protein and \u03b2-actin levels. Plotted are the average levels from three independent experiments. The error bars represent the SE. (D,E) Quantitative real-time PCR was used for detecting the expression of SOCS1 (D) and SOCS3 (E) in mice lungs. (F) Western blotting was used to determine the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 in mice lungs. The results are representative of three independent experiments.",
