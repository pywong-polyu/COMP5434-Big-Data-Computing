Patients with CLL are at increased risk of infections [2] and up to one-half of patients with CLL experience an infectious complication during their disease course, with up to 17% to 50% of these being fatal [3] . Infections are typically bacterial in nature and most commonly affect the sino-pulmonary tract. Hypogammaglobinemia is the primary cause of increased susceptibility to infections in CLL and is present in up to 85% of CLL patients. Hypogammaglobinemia is due to both disease progression and the use of anti-neoplastic agents [4] . CLL decreases the ability of B lymphocytes to produce immunoglobulins due to defective functioning of non-clonal CD5-negative B cells, and also increases apoptosis of normal immunoglobulin (Ig)-producing plasma cells [5] . Mutations in the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region may also contribute to abnormal Ig levels, although there is conflicting data on the clinical consequences of these mutations. Additionally, abnormal function of B lymphocytes can also adversely affect cross-talk with T-helper cells, thus further decreasing an adequate immune response.",

Although no clinical studies have rigorously evaluate the use of prophylactic antibiotics, this strategy is commonly implemented and recommended for prophylaxis against infections for patients with CLL [6] . IgR has been studied for infection prophylaxis in CLL, and its use is universally supported in patients with CLL with hypogammaglobinemia and associated infections [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . As demonstrated by the international survey by Na et al., roughly 30% of patients with CLL are treated with IgR at some point during their disease management, and this proportion is similar to other hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [14] . Nevertheless, there remains heterogeneity in practice of when clinicians initiate IgR therapy in CLL, and guidelines vary from country to country [15] . Although IgR has been shown to decrease rates of bacterial infection in some studies, the optimal application of this practice remains unclear. A Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that the use of intravenous IgR may be considered in patients with CLL and other lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) who have hypogammaglobinemia and recurrent infection, but acknowledged that the studies are heterogeneous [16] .",

Patients with primary immunodeficiency are routinely evaluated for their humoral antibody response before IgR is considered. However, the practice of checking vaccine responses prior to starting immunoglobulin replacement has been advocated, but not extensively studied in patients with CLL [4, [17] [18] [19] . Data has shown that low titers to pneumococcal vaccination had a better association with risk of infection compared to serum IgG [20] . Thus, an immune evaluation including vaccine titers may help to identify CLL patients most at risk for life threatening infection as compared to patients with hypogammaglobinemia but preserved humoral immunity, or patients with clinical infections despite preserved immunoglobulin levels and function. Patients with impaired humoral immunity, regardless of Ig level, may benefit most from IgR.",

Although the risk of infection in CLL is felt to generally increase with lower IgG levels [28] , not all patients with hypogammaglobinemia will experience infectious complications https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258529.g003 [29] . In contrast, there is a subset of individuals with CLL who experience increased infectious episodes despite having normal or near-normal IgG levels, due to B lymphocytes producing non-functional, monoclonal Ig [30] [31] [32] . Significant B cell dysfunction likely also arises from aberrant signaling from the B cell receptor (BCR), which is characterized by variable response to antigenic stimulation, thus affecting other immune functions, including T cell and cellular immunity. Due to the possibility of abnormal functional status despite relatively normal IgG levels, and based on our study results, we encourage the evaluation of vaccine responses to peptide and polysaccharide antigens to help determine the function of Ig in CLL patients. Our cohort of CLL patients all with serum IgG > 400 mg/dL, and a median serum IgG of 782 mg/ dl [IQR: 570 to 827] showed only 1/15 patients (6.7%) mounted an adequate immune response to vaccination with Td and PPV23. Our findings are in line with previous research showing similarly poor vaccine responses in this population [33] [34] [35] [36] , and highlight the importance of evaluating vaccine responses for a thorough immune evaluation in patients with CLL. Early identification and treatment of secondary immune deficiency may improve morbidity and possibly mortality in these patients. Additionally, three patients (16.7%) who underwent an immune evaluation demonstrated IgG < 400 mg/dl, with one patient having an IgG = 93 mg/ dL. We therefore believe risk stratification based on this immune evaluation should be routinely considered in all patients with CLL regardless of previous infection history, since this may reveal severe immune dysfunction, even early in disease.",

We are among the first to show the potential utility of SCIG in CLL patients with secondary immune deficiency, as the majority of CLL patients treated with IgR receive intravenous infusions. Similar to Compagno et al [26] , 90% of patients in our cohort reported no adverse effects related to SCIG infusions. Nine of ten patients also did not require pre-medication, and the majority completed infusions independent of medical professionals in one hour while at home. Self-administered at home administration is particularly valuable during the current global pandemic with COVID-19 infection since it allows for minimizing unnecessary interaction with health care facilities. We encourage all clinicians prescribing IgR to engage in shared decision making with their patients regarding the most suited route of IgR. This discussion is also a unique opportunity for collaboration between hematology/oncology and allergy/ immunology colleagues, since the latter utilize routinely utilize SCIG in the management of primary immunodeficiency.",

In addition to an increase in serum IgG, our study is the first to show a significant improvement in specific IgG for peptide antigens such as tetanus and diphtheria, and polysaccharide antigens such as Streptococcus pneumonia. This is likely to be particularly meaningful, since Streptococcus pneumoniae is felt to be one of the most common etiologies of recurrent sino-pulmonary infections in patients with CLL [37] . Most importantly, for our cohort of patients with CLL, these improvement in laboratory findings while on SCIG correlated with a decreased reliance on antibiotics for the treatment of NNI.

We suspect a larger cohort with a greater history of NNIs requiring frequent antibiotic therapy would benefit even more from our diagnostic and treatment strategy. Due to our small sample size, we were not able to formally evaluate for improvement in NNIs. Importantly, although patients served as their own control, our study also did not have a control arm, which makes it more difficult to assess the clinical impact of IgR in this patient population. Future, larger studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of risk stratification with vaccine response, followed by treatment with SCIG in patients with an abnormal evaluation. We also did not evaluate the potential role of conjugate pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13) as a strategy to improve Streptococcus pneumoniae titers in patients not responding to polysaccharide vaccination (PPV23), as this may serve as adequate protection in a subset of individuals and may avoid the need for IgR. Despite these limitations, we believe our study is novel in its use of vaccine responses to evaluate for humoral immunodeficiency, and provides foundational data for the use of SCIG in the setting of CLL despite adequate IgG levels.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study suggests that patients with CLL demonstrate significant humoral immunodeficiency as defined by abnormal vaccine responses even in the setting of relatively normal IgG levels (> 400 mg/dL). For these patients, SCIG is likely to be well tolerated and efficacious in improving serum IgG, specific IgG to streptococcus pneumoniae, and may decrease reliance on antibiotics for the treatment of NNIs. Larger studies using vaccine responses as risk stratification for infectious complications are needed, as are randomized controlled trials of subq IgR in patients with CLL. ",
