Different versions of the RBD protein have been developed and utilized in assays, with higher sensitivity attributed to particular forms of the protein. To improve the yield of these high-sensitivity forms of RBD and support the increased demand for this antigen in serology assays, we investigated several protein expression variables including DNA elements such as promoters and signal peptides, cell culture expression parameters, and purification processes. Through this investigation, we developed a simplified and robust purification strategy that consistently resulted in high levels of the high-sensitivity form of RBD and demonstrated that a carboxyterminal tag is responsible for the increased sensitivity in the ELISA. These improved reagents and processes produce high-quality proteins which are functional in serology assays and can be used to investigate seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Serology assays are critical tools in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic [1] . Such assays can measure the presence and extent of an immune response and help to identify the number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population. Until an effective vaccine is developed, these are critical tools in identifying and controlling the spread of the infection. A number of serology assays have been published to date, with many employing subdomains of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (hereafter referred to as spike) in ELISA-based assays. The specificity of the spike protein [1, 2] makes it a clear target for therapeutic interventions such as vaccines or monoclonal antibodies, and also for use in serology studies to assess the prevalence of immune responses to the virus and therapeutics. In addition to soluble spike trimer, receptor binding domain (RBD) is also frequently utilized in these assays [3, 4] . RBD, which interacts with the extracellular ACE2 receptor and permits entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, is considerably smaller and more readily generated in recombinant form than the full-length spike. While modified production methods have improved the production of soluble full-length spike protein [5] , RBD production optimization has lagged. Recently, during development of assays to support an NIH-led serosurvey, it was shown that certain forms of RBD resulted in higher sensitivity ELISA results [6] , presumably due to higher antibody affinity. To explore this further, and to optimize production of various RBD reagents, we investigated multiple protein constructs for protein production yield and their impact on the sensitivity of serology assays. This work allowed us to improve the production yield of the most sensitive form of RBD by modifying DNA sequence of the expression vectors, cell culture temperature and harvest time, and purification methodology. The final proteins produced were highly pure and functioned as 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.",

Taken together, these improvements allowed the production of sufficient RBD antigen for more than 6,000 ELISA plates per liter of culture.",

Final expression clones were validated by restriction analysis. The similarities and differences in these constructs are outlined in Table 1 and shown schematically in Fig. 1 .

This data is consistent with our expectations based on the promoters used in the original vectors and our experience with pDest-303. Notably, the yields of the non-SBP containing M69 protein was similar to that of the M67 Sinai construct-all of these proteins are nearly identical in size and amino acid sequence and would be expected, under optimal conditions, to produce similar levels of protein.

Thus, we used magnetic IMAC beads to capture RBD in batch mode from filtered lysates. A typical purification for M68 is shown in Fig. 3A where the majority of the protein was bound to the MagBeads and was eluted in the first two imidazole-containing fractions. The final proteins purified with this approach were similar in terms of quantity and final purity ( Table 3 and Fig. 3B ) to proteins purified by the TFF/IMAC/SEC column process. This batch process has several distinct advantages over the more complex protocol including the elimination of the labor-intensive TFF process, which for large-scale transient cultures can take many hours, and reduced time and cost for column chromatography. The IMAC beads are also readily scaled across large volumes, making this a more consistent approach when culture conditions are varied. It is interesting to note that the original Sinai construct (X22) gives nearly double the protein yield using the MagBead process than expected from the standard purification. Since protein quality appears similar, this may suggest that a significant portion of the Sinai protein is being lost in the standard purification during the concentration or SEC steps which are not present in the MagBead production. Yields of the Ragon protein appear to be generally similar in the two processes. Table 3 . Protein yields of various RBD constructs using the MagBead process. Numbers represent yields from independent experiments. RBDs represents the same RBD amino acid sequence as the Sinai construct, while RBDr represents the same RBD amino acid sequence as the Ragon construct. n/a: not applicable as only one purification was performed. 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.",

To identify what components of our newly produced RBD proteins might lead to this higher ELISA sensitivity, we compared all of the proteins in the serology assay. Fig. 4 confirms that the Ragon proteins (X24, open squares; M68, filled squares) were more sensitive than the Sinai (X22) protein (open triangles)-in this case a 5-fold increase in antibody concentrations which give equivalent signals. It appears that the C-terminal SBP tag is entirely responsible for this higher sensitivity, as the cleaved Ragon X24 protein (open circles) and the Ragon M69 protein lacking the SBP tag (filled circles) both display similar low sensitivity as the Sinai RBD.

We propose that the SBP tag interacts with the ELISA plate to uniquely position the RBD domain to afford greater accessibility of antibodies to the RBD. It would be interesting to see if tags other than SBP might provide the same enhancement, or if there is a specific feature of this tag which uniquely results in greater sensitivity. In any case, we demonstrate here that the presence of the SBP tag on these constructs significantly improves sensitivity of the assay, making it the optimal choice for use in SARS-CoV-2 serology efforts.

The flow rate for all steps of the IMAC was 5 ml/min. The column was washed in Buffer A + 25 mM imidazole for 4 column volumes (CV) with the final 3 CV collected separately as the column wash. The protein was eluted from the column by applying a 20 CV linear gradient of 25 mM -500 mM imidazole in Buffer A followed by a 3 CV step elution of Buffer A + 500 mM imidazole. Fractions (5 ml) were collected for all elution steps. Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie-staining and appropriate fractions were pooled. Typical pool volume for a purification from one liter of culture supernatant was ~80 ml.",
