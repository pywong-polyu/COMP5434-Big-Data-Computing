Then the residual errors of actual and predicted values are calculated. In the next step, the MC model is used to classify the errors and predict the values of the indicators according to the probabilities related to the error states and improve the performance of the MLP model in forecasting. Finally, the prediction accuracy of MLP and MLP-MC models are compared using three evaluation metrics: MAD, MSE and RMSE. This comparison showed that the MLP-MC model has slightly higher prediction accuracy than the MLP model.",

Given the far-reaching implications of this pandemic, there is an urgent need for the scientific community to come together and present new and better methods, strategies, models and techniques, to understand and reduce the consequences of this and future pandemics [2] . Due to the unknown nature of the Covid-19 disease and its vast consequences, the continuous prediction of related indicators in different regions, time periods, and conditions are of great importance, especially for decision-makers. So far, much research has been done on using appropriate methods to predict time series associated with Covid-19. These methods have had a wide range according to factors including but not limited to purpose and subject, studied indicators, and different prevailing conditions in the region. For example, in [3] , time-series modelling has been used to predict confirmed and recovered cases of Covid-19 in the world. An evolutionary data analytics method called Genetic programming (GP) has been used in [4] to mathematically model the potential effect of coronavirus in the 15 most-affected countries of the world. In [5] , the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model has been used to predict the irregularly patterned Covid-19 outbreaks in South Korea and Japan. In [6] , a hybrid approach combining the fractal dimension and fuzzy logic has been proposed to predict the Covid-19 time series for countries in the world.",

Then, its accuracy in forecasting is compared with the MLP model using three metrics. The MLP and MC models have previously been used separately to predict various Covid-19 related indicators, e.g., in [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] , and [23] , the MLP model have been used. Besides, in [10] , [11] , [24] , and [12] , the MC model has been used for this purpose. Combining these models simultaneously to predict Covid-19 related indicators is the main contribution of this paper. Therefore, our proposed model fills the current gap in the existing research, which is the lack of use of the combined MLP model and the Markov chain in predicting the time series associated with Covid-19. The reason for combining the Markov chain with the MLP model is to reduce prediction errors. The Markov chain is a way to reduce MLP prediction errors by addressing the errors transfer behavior using the Markov transition matrices. In summary, the main contribution of this paper is to present the hybrid model of MLP-MC to obtain an improved prediction of indicators related to Covid-19.",

The more accurately the disease prognosis is predicted, the greater the applicability, It should be noted that these predictions have been made in the current situation (no widespread vaccination in the country), and the results of these predictions are valid until the mass vaccination, which is considered as a strong intervener factor. Therefore, it is suggested that if mass vaccination begins in the coming months, according to the new data collected, new predictions be made. In the case that the mass vaccination process is prolonged, It is also suggested that different scenarios be designed regarding its impact on the Covid-19 related indicators, and a re-prediction be made under these scenarios.",

For example, [37] combined these models to predict very short-term wind speed, [38] to predict land-use change, and [39] to predict city expansion and land surface temperature. The findings of these studies showed that the MLP-MC hybrid model is suitable for predicting data with nonlinear and irregular patterns. Since the time series used in this study are also nonlinear and irregular, so it can be said that the results of this study are consistent with previous studies. ",

Discussion and ConclusionMore than a year after the onset of the Covid-19 disease, the pandemic conditions still exist in Iran and other countries. During this period, not only has the prevalence of the disease not diminished, but in some countries, such as Iran, mutated forms of the virus have created new waves of the disease. However, Iran has not yet begun widespread vaccination. For reasons such as",

Therefore, in this paper, the MLP-MC hybrid model was used to increase the accuracy of predicting the trend of Covid-19 related indicators. In other words, the main contribution of this paper was the proposed hybrid approach that combinedMLP and Markov chain models to predict the Covid-19 time series efficiently. This hybrid model simultaneously utilizes the high and fast predictive power of the MLP model and the predictive power of the Markov chain model based on the sequence of residual errors of the MLP model. To show the application of this model, data related to Covid-19 indicators in Bushehr province, Iran, were used. Two indicators of the number of discharged and death cases (as the model outputs) were predicted based on the number of hospitalized cases (as the model input) for test data and the next 40 days. Comparing the accuracy of the MLP-MC hybrid model showed that this model has less error than MLP alone and, therefore, higher prediction accuracy, which shows the advantage of the proposed model. However, there is a slight difference in their accuracy. This hybrid model can be seen as a general forecast model, as it can be applied to other time periods, other places, and other indicators related to Covid-19 or other areas.",
