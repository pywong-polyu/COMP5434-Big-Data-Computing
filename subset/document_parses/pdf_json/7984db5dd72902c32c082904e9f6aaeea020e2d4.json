Preference for online social media communication was correlated with lower general health concurrently and retrospectively as well as with low self-esteem concurrently. They posit two explanations for the observed association, one problematic usage of the internet having an impact on mental health of medical residents and the other considering online usage as a coping strategy against depression and low self-esteem. In a similar vein, another original crosssectional investigation looked that the burn out effects that social media overuse can have on vocational settings: Han et al. found a significant positive correlation between social media addiction and job burnout that is either moderated or mediated by social comparison depending on whether the milieu is low or high on social comparison, respectively. While social comparison alone did not correlate with job burnout, social media users who often compare themselves to peers who are worse off in life and feel positive emotions were found to be more prone to job burnout. A study by Yu and Luo found that social media addiction in university students was associated with longer sleeping latency, more sleep disturbance, poorer academic performance, lower levels of life satisfaction, and higher levels of depression with parental reactive restriction and limiting online behaviors showing little effect.",
