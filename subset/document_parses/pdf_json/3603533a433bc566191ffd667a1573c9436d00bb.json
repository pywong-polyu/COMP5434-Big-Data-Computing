We find that this is a commonly held belief and that it is negatively associated with risk assessments. Public distrust in scientists could complicate efforts to combat COVID-19, given that risk assessments are strongly associated with one's propensity to adopt preventative health measures.",

Scientists and public health experts have repeatedly informed the public of the dangers posed by COVID-19 and advocated for the adoption of evidence-based practices (e.g., social distancing, facemasks, etc.) designed to reduce transmission rates. Despite these efforts, many Americans assert that the risks associated with COVID-19 have been largely exaggerated--a sentiment associated with resistance to adopting preventative health measures [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In this article, we examine how one specific factor impacts COVID-19 risk assessments: the belief that political motives drive the manner in which scientists conduct their research. Using survey data collected from a nationally representative sample of US residents, we find that i) a large portion of the population believes that politics drive the manner in which scientific studies are conducted, and ii) holding such a belief has a strong, negative association with COVID-19 risk assessments.",

            "text": "A fundamental role of scientific research is to provide objective evidence that can be used to inform policy debates [7] . Despite this standard, scholarship shows that the American public is increasingly concerned about the objectivity of scientific research, reflecting and reinforcing growing anti-science sentiment [8, 9] . Public perceptions that scientific research is politically motivated emanates from several sources. Most notably, politicians and media can fuel these perceptions by i) presenting partial or misleading accounts of scientific methods and findings to legitimize political agendas and ii) discrediting scientists with accusations of collusion with political interests (e.g., \"Big Pharma\") [7, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . For instance, President Trump claimed that the Food and Drug Administration was intentionally delaying COVID-19 drug trials to hurt his reelection: \"The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics\" [20] . Similarly, during the pandemic, a number of news personalities consistently questioned the character of the \"so called experts\" who developed the Imperial College's influential COVID-19 mortality rate and healthcare demand models [21] . Sowing doubt over the impartiality and validity of scientific research and/or disparaging scientists' intentions and credibility may induce public skepticism about purported COVID-19 risks and science-based policy responses [10, 11, [17] [18] [19] [22] [23] [24] . Accusations that science is \"biased\" or \"rigged\" may trigger an emotive audience response, stimulating a status quo bias whereby individuals repudiate risk and reject the adoption of new preventative measures advocated by scientists [22, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . This has significant implications because those holding lower risk assessments are more likely to eschew measures (e.g., facemasks, social distancing, vaccines) designed to safeguard communities [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Our empirical approach, described below, uses survey data to discern i) the extent to which the American public believes that politics drive scientific research, and ii) the impact that such beliefs have on COVID-19 risk assessments.",

We estimate a multilevel regression model with random intercepts at the state level to examine how increased beliefs that science is apolitical affect the level of risk one perceives performing daily tasks. Inclusion of random intercepts accounts for unmodeled, state-specific factors (infection rates, culture, government response, etc.) that could impact estimates [46] . We include a quadratic term of our independent variable as the effect proved to be non-linear.

The results from the alternate model are presented in the S2 Table in S1 File, column 2. Table 1 . As shown in Fig 1, respondents, on average, are not confident that scientific research is apolitical: 31.21% believe that science is politically motivated (values 0-3), 20.81% believe that it is not (values 7-10), and 27.19% are fairly ambivalent (values [4] [5] [6] .",

As such, our independent variable represents an independent construct: one that is strongly associated with risk assessments. Science Trust-Betterment and Science Trust-Community are highly correlated (r = .61). In the S2 Table in S1 File, column 3, we present regression estimates with Science Trust-Community dropped from the model. As shown, the coefficient estimates of the remaining Science Trust variables are entirely consistent with those in Table 1, confirming that Science Trust-Apolitical has a larger substantive impact on risk assessments. While speculative, we contend that this disparity may be due to highly visible and politically polarizing allegations by media and politicians that science has been politicized during the pandemic.",

However, research suggests that scientists tend toward a deficit model when communicating with the public, believing that closing the public's knowledge gap will improve support for new science policy [8] . Our results show that this is insufficient, and that scientists and public health leaders must strategize to directly counteract politicization accusations [1, 18, 50] . Counteraction measures such as warning people that they may be exposed to inaccurate information that goes against the scientific consensus and correcting such information when it is disseminated may temper the effects of perceptions of politicization [22, 48] . The belief that scientific research is politically motivated drastically reduces the public's COVID-19 risk assessments. When it comes to public health, public trust in and cooperation with scientific advice is critical. As suffering wrought by COVID-19 intensifies, addressing perceptions of science politicization is more urgent than ever. While our results are compelling, limitations remain. First, our data is restricted to the United States and therefore, we cannot examine potential international differences. Such comparisons would be especially insightful given the somewhat unique historical moment the United States is embroiled in, at the intersection of a pandemic, civil unrest, and a polarizing political leader. Second, while our results are strongly suggestive and robust to different model specifications, our reliance on cross-sectional observational data precludes us from making causal claims due to the potential for omitted variable bias and simultaneity bias. Although we theorize on the origins of beliefs that science is politically motivated, future work should seek to more explicitly examine the causes underlying politicization perceptions. ",
