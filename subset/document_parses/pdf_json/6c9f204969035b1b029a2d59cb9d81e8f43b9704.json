The Maternal Health Clinic in Ontario, Canada, was introduced in 2011 and is the first postpartum intervention for women with a recent history of complicated pregnancies, inviting eligible women to attend lifestyle education at 6 months postpartum (14) . This model has been adopted across a number of sites worldwide in the last decade, and in recent years, a number of research-based postpartum interventions have also been developed. However, these research-based interventions are often opt-in research studies rather than routine outpatient care, tend to focus on specific complications of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia (15) (16) (17) (18) , and the effectiveness of these interventions at reducing cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk has not been rigorously assessed in a real-world clinic setting. The first nurse-led postpartum clinic in Australia was introduced in 2018 at the Lyell McEwin Hospital and aims to provide structured lifestyle and risk education (19) . To our knowledge, this is the only published and freely available nurse-led model of care in Australia of standardized, routine, ongoing outpatient care for all eligible women who have experienced a serious complication of pregnancy. In most areas of Australia and the world, there remains little to no attention paid to women in this cohort, despite the recommendations for follow-up in national and international guidelines.",

The currently available cardiovascular risk scores have been developed using acute coronary syndrome thresholds found in predominantly male populations, reducing their reliability for use in women (20) . The vast majority also fail to consider early changes in cardiovascular measures as well as the young age of the study population, which conceals the high-risk, long-term impact of a complication of pregnancy (21) . The Absolute Cardiovascular Disease Risk Calculator, for example, is commonly used by general practitioners in Australia for calculating cardiovascular risk in adults, and is recommended by the Australian Heart Foundation. However, there is minimal evidence supporting its use in people aged less than 30 years old, and limited strong evidence for people aged 30-45 years (22) . Current cardiovascular risk calculators are therefore not appropriate tools for detecting subclinical disease in and communicating risk to young women. A lack of a clear and effective way to explain risk to women may reduce the impact of preventative strategies.",

Metabolic syndrome is associated with a 4-fold higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in women and 2-fold higher risk in men (25) . Considering the lack of availability of appropriate cardiovascular risk scores for younger women, metabolic syndrome may be an appropriate alternative for assessing and communicating the high long-term risk to women who are at low short-term risk of CVD. However, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in young women is not well-documented, especially in socioeconomically disadvantaged cohorts where it may be higher (26) . Therefore, investigating the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is the first step in understanding the risk of future cardiovascular disease in these populations.",

The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this study was more than twice that found in a Canadian study by Cusimano and colleagues, which reported that 17.4% of women had metabolic syndrome at 6 months postpartum following a complicated pregnancy (34) . Their cohort included women of any gravidity with the same complications of pregnancy who were included in our study, and therefore their results are directly comparable to those presented in this analysis. The disparity in prevalence of metabolic syndrome between cohorts demonstrate how risk and health status may vary greatly between populations, emphasizing the need for analyzing and understanding the risk profile of local cohorts when introducing preventative strategies. There are some previous studies exploring metabolic syndrome both in pregnancy and after pregnancy complications. A study of the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) cohort found that 29.4% of nulliparous women recruited from the Adelaide, South Australia, site had metabolic syndrome at 15 weeks' gestation (35) . These participants were recruited in 2005-2008 from the same hospital as the cohort in the present study. Although the study included healthy nulliparous women without pre-existing hypertension and/or diabetes, most of whom went on to have an uncomplicated pregnancy, the lower percentage of metabolic syndrome reported in a very similar population could suggest that rates may have increased over the last 15 years. The higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in our cohort also suggests that we are referring the right individuals for further follow up and education.",

It is possible that, especially without intervention, we would see an increase in the rate of metabolic syndrome in our cohort over time. However, Smith and colleagues followed women with a history of preeclampsia and found that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome did not change from 1 to 3 years postpartum (37) . Further research should explore the progression of metabolic syndrome over time, especially in women with a history of the complications not characterized by hypertension. Although the current study was not able to address progression of metabolic syndrome without intervention, the results indicate that due to a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome at 6 months postpartum, commencing follow-up and education strategies within 1 year postpartum is appropriate.",

In the literature, it is evident that many women remain unaware of the risk posed to them after having a complicated pregnancy. Follow up for cardiovascular risk screening after hypertensive disorders of pregnancy remains minimal (46) , with most women reporting low personal awareness of cardiovascular disease risk (11) . Even after being informed of their increased risk, most women attending the Maternal Health Clinic in Canada continued to underestimate their risk (10) . Furthermore, women with gestational diabetes also underestimate their risk of developing type 2 diabetes (47), generally tend to not adopt healthy lifestyles postpartum (48) , and report a number of barriers to making healthy lifestyle changes (49) . It is therefore vital to provide structured follow up care for these patients to encourage positive lifestyle modifications as soon as possible.",

Although not explored in this analysis, previous research from the Maternal Health Clinic in Canada found that women choosing not to attend had more adverse metabolic and social risk profiles than those who did attend (50) . This could indicate that the women in our population most in need of intervention are not engaging with preventative health services. Future research into how to improve engagement is required. Introduction of positive health messages during pregnancy and ideally prior to conception may be of additional benefit. A previous systematic review found that dietary and lifestyle interventions introduced during pregnancy have the potential for reducing the risk of developing preeclampsia (51) .",

COVID-19 lockdowns resulted in the postpartum intervention clinic closing for two separate periods during the study. Although women were re-offered appointments upon reopening, we expect that attendance was at least in part influenced by general concerns about attending healthcare facilities during the pandemic, when the general population were strongly encouraged to avoid leaving their homes unless absolutely necessary. Since 2022, online consultations have been offered by the postpartum clinic due to ongoing pandemic restrictions on outpatient services, however online or telehealth consults introduce further difficulties as measurements and physical assessments cannot be performed. Remote consults are also impractical for non-English speaking patients who require an interpreter.",

The postpartum clinic's eligibility criteria are currently limited to the most severe examples of complications of pregnancy and do not include women with unmedicated hypertensive disorders of pregnancy or gestational diabetes. If unmedicated participants were also included, the overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome may have been reduced. Furthermore, there are no data available on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in women with healthy pregnancies or in the wider population of young women from which our cohort was recruited, and so the prevalence reported in this study may be reflective of the broader profile of our population. Only prospective data were recorded at the time of the postpartum appointment, so no historical socioeconomic information (for example, the socioeconomic status the women were raised in) were available. Finally, the data in this study were collected from a unique outpatient service in a highly disadvantaged community, and therefore the prevalence of metabolic syndrome may not reflect that of other settings.",
