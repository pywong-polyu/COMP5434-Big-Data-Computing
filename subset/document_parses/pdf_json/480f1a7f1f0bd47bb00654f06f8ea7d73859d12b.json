            "text": "These authors contributed equally to this work Purpose: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk of ischemic stroke and poor prognosis. This study aimed to identify molecular mechanisms that are dysregulated in T2DM-associated ischemic stroke and candidate genes that might serve as biomarkers. Methods: The top 25% variance genes in the GSE21321 and GSE22255 datasets were analyzed for coexpression. The differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRs) between patients with T2DM or ischemic stroke and controls were analyzed. Then, the union of overlapping coexpressed genes and overlapping DEmRs was analyzed. The miRNAs differentially expressed in T2DM-associated ischemic stroke were also analyzed. CIBERSORT was used to evaluate the levels of infiltration by immune cells in T2DM-associated stroke. Results: Thirteen coexpression modules were identified in T2DM and 10 in ischemic stroke, and 594 module genes were shared between the two conditions. A total of 4452 mRNAs differentially expressed between T2DM patients and controls were identified, as were 2390 mRNAs differentially expressed between ischemic stroke and controls. The 771 union genes were enriched mainly in immune-related biological functions and signaling pathways. UBE2N, TGFB3, EXOSC1, and VIM were identified as candidate markers. In addition, we identified miR-576-3p as having the most regulatory roles in both T2DM and ischemic stroke. Mast cell activation was significantly down-regulated in T2DM but up-regulated in ischemic stroke. Conclusion: These findings provide numerous testable hypotheses about the pathways underlying T2DM-associated ischemic stroke, which may help identify therapeutic targets.",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus, the most common form of which is type 2 diabetes (T2DM), is a major public health problem. It is estimated that the number of people in the world with the condition will reach 642 million by 2040. 1, 2 The rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus means rising prevalence of numerous health complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cognitive impairment and ischemic stroke. 3 Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, affecting about 30 million people. 4 It is the second most frequent cause of death in the world, after heart disease. 5 T2DM increases the risk of ischemic stroke by nearly 2 to 3 times, thereby increasing the risk of associated mortality. [6] [7] [8] Ischemic stroke can cause more serious micro-and macrovascular damage when it occurs in a diabetes background, profoundly impacting multiple organs and aggravating pathological cascades after stroke. 9 Diabetes can aggravate the acute inflammatory response after ischemic stroke and increase levels of inflammatory factors in the brain. 10 Ischemic stroke can induce or aggravate cerebrovascular damage, especially in diabetic patients under 65 years old. 11 Antihypertensive, antiplatelet, and hypolipidemic agents can reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in diabetic patients, 12 but even with treatment, individuals with diabetes are at higher risk of cerebrovascular accidents than individuals without diabetes. 13 In fact, up to 80% of individuals with diabetes eventually die of macrovascular complications. 14 The clinical symptoms of ischemic stroke appear late in the course of the disease, and given the limited therapeutic options, effective preventive treatments and early diagnostic markers are urgently needed. 15 In addition, more effective risk stratification may lead to better management and even prevention of ischemic stroke. 16 Identifying molecular pathways involved in ischemic stroke means examining gene expression, reflected in levels of mRNAs, but also levels of microRNAs (miRNAs). These regulatory molecules interact with the 3\u02b9 untranslated region (3\u02b9UTR) of the target mRNA to inhibit translation. 17 Various stages of cerebral ischemic injury and various types of brain injury involve miRNAs. 18, 19 In fact, ischemic stroke has been linked to dysregulation of miRNAs, which have been proposed as potential therapeutic strategies. 10, 20 The present study aimed to explore molecular mechanisms and potential markers of ischemic stroke in patients with T2DM, based on analysis of differential mRNA and miRNA expression profiles in patients and controls.",

Weak immune activation is a risk factor for T2DM onset and for T2DM-associated ischemic stroke. 28 In ischemic stroke patients, an excessive number of neutrophils infiltrate ischemic brain tissue, which can lead to systemic inflammation and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. 29 Acute ischemic stroke patients show an elevated ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes and worse prognosis. 30 T cells are involved in the late phase of cerebral ischemia, and different T cell subtypes play different roles in ischemic stroke. 31 Several studies have suggested that in T2DM and ischemic stroke, miRNAs regulate the expression of target genes that mediate inflammatory responses, cell proliferation and apoptosis. [35] [36] [37] We identified four miRNAs that may be associated with the occurrence of ischemic stroke among T2DM patients: hsa-miR-299-3p, hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-576-3p, and hsa-miR-665. The miR-299-3p target is associated with N-terminal pro brain natural peptide, levels of which can predict in-hospital mortality of patients with acute ischemic stroke. 38, 39 Levels of miR-320 can discriminate between diabetic and non-diabetic patients and are significantly reduced in stroke patients, especially those with good prognosis. 40, 41 The miR-576-3p has been reported to induce interferon production, and gene therapy to restore interferon production may improve prognosis after ischemic stroke. 42, 43 The miR-665 is down- 44, 45 This suggests that the four miRNAs that we identified -especially miR-576-3p, with the most target genes -may be risk factors and markers for the development of ischemic stroke in T2DM patients.",

In particular, the differential expression of UBE2N, TGFB3, EXOSC1, and VIM was similar in T2DM and ischemic stroke, so we consider them candidate markers. UBE2N, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is a key enzyme in Parkin-dependent mitophagy. 46 It plays a key role in synaptosomal accumulation of mutant huntingtin and is involved in multiple neurodegenerative disease processes. 47 Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is a multifunctional inflammatory cytokine that is produced by a variety of inflammatory cells, including leukocytes and macrophages. 48 TGF-\u03b2 and interleukin-10 (IL-10) drive damage to the bloodbrain barrier in ischemic stroke and may have neuroinflammatory effects. 49 Expression of the IL10RB gene has been associated with the risk of ischemic stroke. 50 EXOSC1 has been associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, 51 though it appears never to have been linked to risk of ischemic stroke. CXCL3 is up-regulated in ischemic brain tissue and can predict stroke. 52 Up- DovePress regulation of VIM, which encodes vimentin, can drive injury after ischemic stroke by triggering reactive gliosis and scar formation. 53 The findings from our study require validation in additional, larger samples and in experimental studies.
