In the Netherlands, a registry and model-based approach (MBA) are used for the selection of patients that are eligible for proton therapy. We collected baseline characteristics including demographic, clinical, tumour and treatment information. These data were transformed into a machine readable format using the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles and resulted in a knowledge graph with baseline characteristics of proton therapy patients. With this approach, we enable the possibility of linking external data sources and optimal flexibility to easily adapt the data structure of the existing knowledge graph to the needs of the clinic.",

The importance of ontologies specific to the radiotherapy domain has been highlighted by Phillips et al. 9 . The use of ontologies enhances the data interoperability and reusability with a clear definition of the different data classes including knowledge representation. Figure 1 shows the baseline characteristics in our knowledge graph with all the nodes and edges designed by domain experts. The different data classes can be grouped in three different categories; (I) baseline characteristics and demographic information, (II) baseline tumour, and (III) radiotherapy planning information. In this visualisation of the graph, we present the relation between variables connected to a patient that all together make up our generic list.

Hence, the data model and structure must be designed with flexibility and a transient practical application in mind: as proton therapy gains salience in The Netherlands, new clinical applications will appear and there will be a shift in the threshold of which patients can undergo treatment because of the limited treatment capacity. New models are developed to tackle this shift and for this reason, our architecture must be able to easily adapt to new data elements and model transformations. The semantic data model is flexible because we can define and add ontology classes and their definitions are shared and accessible to others in line with the FAIR principles, which gained traction in the radiotherapy world 12 , while still keeping them backward compatible. The semantic data model was developed with machine readability and thus exchange and interoperability in mind. The flexibility further shows in adding new variables to the data model and the cardinality limitations that relational databases have. There is no need to create new tables to tackle {one/many}-to-many relations; for instance, additional treatments can exist in the same graph as additional instances of the treatment class. Finally, the ease to which multiple datasets/data sources can be queried (eg. third parties datasets) in a single unified query is an additional point that makes the knowledge graph an advantageous data format over a relational database 6 .",

In the analysis there is the potential to allow algorithms to infer indirect knowledge from the graph, which is not possible in a flat relational database. In other words, the clinical expertise in the creation of the ontology and knowledge graph means that the metadata is enhancing the instance data, and that inferencing could potentially improve AI/ML analysis of the data.
