            "text": "Background and Objective: COVID-19 severity spans an entire clinical spectrum from asymptomatic to fatal. Most patients who require in-hospital care are admitted to non-intensive wards, but their clinical conditions can deteriorate suddenly and some eventually die. Clinical data from patients' case series have identified pre-hospital and in-hospital risk factors for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. However, most prior studies used static variables or dynamic changes of a few selected variables of interest. In this study, we aimed at integrating the analysis of time-varying multidimensional clinical-laboratory data to describe the pathways leading to COVID-19 outcomes among patients initially hospitalised in a non-intensive care setting. Methods: We collected the longitudinal retrospective data of 394 patients admitted to non-intensive care units at the University Hospital of Padova (Padova, Italy) due to COVID-19. We trained a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to encode the conditional probability relationships over time between death and all available demographics, pre-existing conditions, and clinical laboratory variables. We applied resampling, dynamic time warping, and prototyping to describe the typical trajectories of patients who died vs. those who survived. Results: The DBN revealed that the trajectory linking demographics and pre-existing clinical conditions to death passed directly through kidney dysfunction or, more indirectly, through cardiac damage. As expected, admittance to the intensive care unit was linked to markers of respiratory function. Notably, death was linked to elevation in procalcitonin and D-dimer levels. Death was associated with persistently high levels of procalcitonin from admission and throughout the hospital stay, likely reflecting bacterial superinfection. A sudden raise in D-dimer levels 3-6 days after admission was also associated with subsequent death, possibly reflecting a worsening thrombotic microangiopathy. Conclusions: This innovative application of DBNs and prototyping to integrated data analysis enables visualising the patient's trajectories to COVID-19 outcomes and may instruct timely and appropriate clinical decisions.",

Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 can require intensive care support and mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate respiratory gas exchange. The overall mortality is 2.2%, but it increases substantially in those hospitalised (14%) and further so in those admitted to the intensive care unit (37%) [1] . The most common causes of death in COVID-19 patients are multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, secondary infections, refractory hypoxemia, and ischemic events [ 2 , 3 ] . Pulmonary artery thrombosis and thrombotic microangiopathy are typically associhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.106873 0169-2607/\u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Although a few treatments have been approved for COVID-19, the exact timing of their use is debated [6] . Studying the trajectories of patients with COVID-19 from hospitalisation to recovery/death can unravel valuable information for monitoring the disease course and choosing the appropriate treatment at each stage.",

They can, however, be extended to encode conditional dependency relationships over time, defining a graphical model known as a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) [10] , whose fundamental structural unit is the two-timeslice BN (2TBN). Briefly, a 2TBN is a constrained DAG between a set of variables at a certain point in time (the t slice) and a subset of those that were also measured at the immediately preceding time point (the t -1 slice). Following a first-order Markovianity assumption, edges can only exist between variables in the t slice, or they can follow an ideal arrow of time and go from the t -1 slice to the t slice; edges among variables in the t -1 slice are forbidden, and so are those from the t slice to the t -1 slice. Furthermore, it is also assumed that network topology and CPTs do not change over time, i.e., between sets of t / t -1 slices. In practice, this means that static or quasi-static variables (i.e., variables that are expected to change or be updated on a much larger time scale than the inter-slice period, if at all) belong to the t slice, while dynamic variables are replicated in both slices.",

This process is known as layering. Specifically, we treated all variables with repeated measurements as dynamic, except brain natriuretic peptide, total cholesterol, amylase, and creatine phosphokinase, which did not exhibit sufficient variability after quantisation. We also considered death as a quasi-static variable, because, by definition, it was always equal to 0 except, possibly, once at the end of follow-up. All other variables were inherently static. Additionally, we forbade age and sex from having parent nodes to avoid unrealistic edge directions (i.e., age or sex being determined by other variables). The final layering was as follows: age and sex could influence all other static/quasi-static variables and dynamic variables at time t , static/quasi-static variables could influence each other and dynamic variables at time t, dynamic variables at times t -1 and t could only influence dynamic variables at time t .",

However, this approach is inadequate for the purposes of the present work (or, indeed, many others based on routinely acquired data), because it is very sensitive to the relatively low sample size, and ill-equipped to deal with the high missingness of the variables involved. Hence, to partly overcome these limitations, we developed an alternative framework to highlight the differences, encoded by the DBN, between patients who died and those who did not. Specifically, we proceeded in three steps by mirroring the three points outlined above. First, we sampled from the trained DBN, obtaining 10,0 0 0 sets of 31 signals (connected component including the death variable), corresponding to 30 (or fewer, in case of simulated death) days of hospitalisation of 10,0 0 0 synthetic patients. At the same time, we rescaled the 10,0 0 0 sets of signals by substituting the sampled quantised values with the sample means in the corresponding quantisation bin estimated in the original dataset (e.g., as per Table S2 , we substituted a simulated, quantised value of \"1\" for age with the average value 67.8). Conceptually, this was an amplification step of sorts, whereby we took the information encoded by the DBN and decoded it into a sufficiently large sample to obtain discernible summary statistics. Second, after excluding the 123 simulated patients who immediately died, we stratified the 1055 dead and 8822 survived patients and calculated the barycenters of their trajectories via dynamic time warping (DTW) [13] , and, specifically, using the softDTW distance [14] . Thus, we obtained two sets of signals corresponding to the prototype evolution of all encoded covariates in survivors and non-survivors. These prototypes were the summaries to be compared. Note that, since DTW privileges the shape of a signal over its exact coordinates, the shown prototypes may be stretched across the horizontal (slice) axis and are, thus, mainly illustrative. Third, to make sure that the comparison was valid, we also verified, via the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC), that the soft-DTW distance between each simulated subject and the prototype of dead patients' evolution was a good discriminator between simulated dead vs. survived patients. The idea was that a good summary of dead vs. survived simulated patients implies that a subject who died should be closer to the dead subjects' prototype in the softDTW sense.",

Although causation cannot be inferred from direction of the edges in the trained DBN, these findings are in line with prior knowledge on the clinical variables associated with progression from mild/moderate to severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care and eventually leading to patient's death. Indeed, worsening respiratory function is the most common cause of admittance to the ICU, which is the appropriate setting for invasive ventilation.

Notably, an early separation was observed for the trend in procalcitonin (at admission) and D-dimer (at 3-6 days) values, which remained markedly higher in prototyped patients who died vs. those who survived during a simulated 30-day disease course. On the other side, CRP was only mildly higher in patients who subsequently died, whereas it slowly decreased in patients who recovered. Interestingly, procalcitonin, more than CRP, can differentiate inflammation due to secondary bacterial infection from the hyperinflammatory state occurring in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection [18] . Therefore, an elevated procalcitonin level at admission, more than any elevation of CRP, should spotlight patients at higher risk of death and drive prompt therapeutic choices, including, e.g., use of antibiotics [19] .",

It appears that death is associated with elevated procalcitonin levels upon admission, such that further check may not change the expected patient's trajectory. On the contrary, re-checking D-dimer at 3-6 days may identify patients who are likely to develop more severe COVID-19 and die. Outstanding is the observation that the probabilistic trajectories from static variables (such as comorbidities) to outcomes (ICU or death) inevitably proceeded through markers of kidney function (urea and creatinine). In the network, the link between ICU and death is only made possible through kidney function. Closely looking at the trained DBN, the only alternative pathway linking ICU admittance to static variables involves markers of cardiac damage (BNP and TnI), which is another established feature of multi-organ failure occurring during severe COVID-19 [21] . This pathway is, however, much less linear, spanning more nodes, and is not linked to death independently from kidney function. Figure S4 shows a simplified view of the DBN where these paths are highlighted.",

Several studies have reported that a history of chronic kidney disease at admission or the development of acute kidney injury during hospital stay predict poor COVID-19 outcomes [ 23 , 24 ] . However, no prior study had examined the dynamic rela- tionships between changes in kidney function and mortality with the simultaneous changes of other relevant variables in a single model. This is particularly evident in the dynamic representation shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 where, at means of covariates, mild in-hospital elevations in serum creatinine drove changes in inflammatory markers and projected a 2.6 higher mortality rate. Of note, such trajectory is unrelated to changes in markers of respiratory function (oxygen saturation and CO 2 levels) BNs, in general, have been scarcely utilised to model COVID-19. The most prolific subfield of application appears to be that of population-level dynamics, investigating topics such as outbreak evolution [25] , infection-fatality rates [26] , or even the impact of economic disruptions [27] . Other applications involve the usage of DBNs as an explainability tool that is part of a larger experimental pipeline [28] . On the contrary, here, we have presented an approach that is fully based on DBNs and focused on hospitalised patients and their clinical parameters specifically, rather than the population as a whole.",

First, both the analysis of the DBN and that of the prototype signals are descriptive, rather than predictive. In fact, although we have trained the former using state-of-the-art methods and the latter passed a verification step regarding the separability of dead and survived simulated patients, the development of a prognostic model was out of scope for the present work. Moreover, although continuous variable quantisation and substitution with the statistical description of each quantile (here, the mean) is a relatively standard approach (e.g., for quantile normalisation), it inevitably leads to a loss in resolution with respect to biomarker values. Finally, since DWT is a warping technique rather than an instant-byinstant transformation, there was an implicit overweighting of the shape of each signal vs. the exact timing of shape changes, which, however, may be informative in their own right to describe the inhospital evolution of COVID-19.",

This highlights the importance of choosing tools able to depict clinical trajectories in a way that is intelligible and useful to clinicians. DBN enabled us to describe the different dynamics of variables associated with COVID-19 mortality, especially procalcitonin, D-dimer and CRP. Such findings entail potential implications for clinical decision-making, including the timing of testing and the choice among therapeutic options. Finally, the DBN clearly identified kidney function as the fulcrum of pathways leading to poor COVID-19 outcomes, providing a strong contribution to our understanding of multi-organ dysfunction during COVID-19.
