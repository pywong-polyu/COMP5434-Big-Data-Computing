Our assembly is divided into two groups, those of acute critical care and of noninvasive ventilatory support. Currently, our assembly is headed by Leo Heunks, Jo\u00e3o Winck has the role of secretary and Maxime Patout is our Early Career Representative. The acute critical care subgroup is chaired by Christian Karagiannidis, with Ignacio Martin-Loeches as secretary. The noninvasive ventilatory support group is chaired by Marieke Duiverman, and Claudia Crimi is secretary. At the time of publication, we have 1553 Assembly 2 members, 36% of whom are early career members. A recent highlight of Assembly 2 was our organisation of the inaugural Respiratory Failure and Mechanical Ventilation conference, which was held in Berlin in March 2020. This was a great success, with attendees arriving from around the world to enjoy engaging and educational seminars delivered by expert panels, workshops and lectures within the streams of adult acute respiratory failure, chronic respiratory failure and paediatric respiratory failure [1] . Early career members had the opportunity to present cases and posters and to chair sessions. We look forward to the second meeting, which will be held in Berlin between 9 and 11 June 2022. In this review, we present highlights from the ERS International Congress 2021 of interest to Assembly 2 members and those interested in critical care and mechanical ventilation. The sessions we have reported on include the symposia on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) phenotypes, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in hypoxic respiratory failure, and new developments in mechanical ventilation and weaning, and the guidelines session on high-flow therapy (HFT) in adults with acute respiratory failure.",

In the 1970s, ARDS pathophysiology was driven by oxygen toxicity. Since then, ventilator management and supportive care have changed. Epithelial cell death is characteristic but endothelial damage is more subtle [2] . However, lung autopsy studies from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showed endothelial damage, microthrombi and endothelial disruption. Classic cells driving ARDS are predominantly neutrophils and macrophages [3] . Neutrophil-derived chlorolipids, neutrophil extracellular traps, are excellent biomarkers for ARDS [4] . Moreover, new cell death mechanisms and pathways may represent novel therapeutic targets in ARDS [5] .",

He reported that the mortality was lower in the focal ARDS group than in the non-focal groups, despite similar ratio of arterial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (P aO 2 /F IO 2 ), with different responses to lung recruitment [6] . In the non-focal group, the lungs can be ventilated homogeneously with higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), whereas higher pressure can cause overinflation in normal areas in the focal group. Therefore, the LIVE study was designed by CONSTANTIN et al. [7] . In the intervention arm of this study, the focal group was ventilated with low PEEP and high tidal volume (8 mL\u00b7kg \u22121 ) and the non-focal group with low tidal volume and high PEEP. 90-day mortality was similar between groups. However, mortality was higher in those who had been misclassified. In conclusion, dynamic parameters like ultrasound, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and computed tomography (CT) scan can help in choosing the correct ventilator settings.",

Data from the UK Critical Care Genomics, the Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit and the MOSAIC Influenza Consortium were integrated to develop disease subtypes.

The gas exchange reflects two separate phenomena: the alveolar integrity and the functional abnormalities such as dysregulated pulmonary perfusion. The COVID-19 pandemic was used throughout the presentation as a model for the different assessment methods, both invasive and noninvasive. L. Camporota reflected on a commonly used tool, the P aO 2 /F IO 2 , and its limitation being dependent on the F IO 2 , making it difficult to assess its evolution in case of change in the denominator. In a recent study, the ROX index (ratio of oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry/F IO 2 to respiratory rate) has greater predictive validity than NEWS2 for deterioration in COVID-19 [12] .",

On the one hand, studies showed that HFT, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and NIV had similar adjusted mortality rate. Helmet NIV and CPAP had a significantly reduced intubation rate compared to HFT [13] . S. Nava challenged the audience with a provocative question: did we kill HFT? The answer is probably not. HFT must be used in specific situations for its already known indications. On the other hand, NRS depends on the severity of hypoxaemia. P aO 2 /F IO 2 is dependent on work of breathing. Therefore, it does not predict alone lung recruitment and mechanics. Patient effort is important and can contribute to ventilator-induced lung injury. A last consideration is staff contamination due to aerosol generation by NRS (figure 2).",

A limitation within this area is that most studies include small patient numbers and short-term end-points. A 2015 systematic review concluded that opioids improved breathlessness in patients with severe COPD [14] , although the benefit was lower than the later described minimal clinically important difference [15] . Another systematic review demonstrated a slight benefit of NIV in relieving dyspnoea in COPD stable patients [16] , but whether it is clinically relevant remains uncertain. In the acute setting, it is essential to define the goals of life support versus symptom relief, and the side-effects patients (and physicians) tolerate depend on these goals. A randomised crossover study showed that HFT was superior to conventional oxygen therapy in reducing the severity of dyspnoea in the first hour of treatment in patients with do-not-intubate status and hypoxaemic respiratory failure [17] .",

            "text": "Personalised mechanical ventilation and weaning in patients with COPD Lise Piquilloud (Lausanne, Switzerland) emphasised that the goal of mechanical ventilation in COPD patients is to reduce hyperinflation. Regarding controlled ventilation, the usual approach is controlled hypoventilation with permissive hypercapnia. During assisted ventilation, the presence of intrinsic PEEP (PEEPi) leads to increased work of breathing and asynchronies, which may be mitigated by carefully titrating PEEP. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) ventilates the patient based on the electrical activity of the diaphragm and reduces asynchrony compared with PSV [22, 23] . Moreover, NAVA has been associated with reduced duration of mechanical ventilation compared with PSV in patients at risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation [24] . L. Piquilloud stressed the importance of daily screening for weaning readiness and early extubation. In COPD patients at risk for extubation failure, we must consider the early use of NIV or HFT. When high PEEPi persists despite appropriate ventilation, we may use extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2 R), which allows us to further decrease minute ventilation with beneficial effects on hyperinflation and mitigation of the deleterious consequences of hypercapnia and acidosis [25] . Moreover, ECCO 2 R may be used to facilitate weaning, since it may improve work of breathing [26] . Nevertheless, more studies are needed to prove its efficacy and safety before it can be used as a general treatment strategy in routine clinical practice.",

The measurement of transpulmonary end-expiratory pressure by an oesophageal catheter and EIT may aid in PEEP titration. Global tidal lung stress may be monitored by measuring airway driving pressure. However, regional lung stress can be more accurately estimated by the transpulmonary driving pressure. High tidal stress may be mitigated by improving lung homogeneity, avoiding high V T and decreasing ventilatory demands [27, 28] . Passive ventilation as well as assisted ventilation can induce diaphragm disuse atrophy. Protective ventilation involves avoiding prolonged diaphragmatic rest, over-or under-assistance and dysynchrony. Titration of inspiratory effort can be achieved with measurement of the pressure time product of oesophageal pressure (PTP oes ), while simpler bedside methods include measurement of airway occlusion pressure (P 0.1 ) and oesophageal pressure swing. Modulating the respiratory drive can help in manipulating the patient's effort [27] [28] [29] .",

Nonetheless, the vast majority of studies involve model prototyping and development, while there is a paucity of data regarding their implementation into clinical practice [31] . An application of the use of machine learning is described in the study by FLEUREN et al. [32] . They used the Dutch Data Warehouse, a multicentre electronic health record database, to determine the most important predictors for extubation failure. L.

Regarding the applicability of HFT for COVID-19 patients, it has been widely used throughout the pandemic, with observational data indicating favourable results [46, 47] , which also apply in the prone position [48] , and might be more useful than other noninvasive strategies in the early stages of the disease [49] . Given that it is possible that HFT failure could delay intubation and increase mortality [50] , it is mandatory for these patients to be monitored in specifically designed physical spaces such as Respiratory Intermediate Care Units or the ICU, where healthcare personnel safety can also be optimised. A practical tool is the ROX index, which has been validated in patients with ARDS on HFT, with an index >4.88 after initiation consistently associated with a lower risk for intubation [51] . This index may be useful for COVID-19 patients as well [52] .",

Appropriate precautions must be taken by healthcare workers to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission. A range of face masks are available for use in the healthcare environment and should be selected based on the type and level of exposure to aerosol-generating procedures. The mask shown in the image is an example of a filtering facepiece 3 (FFP3). This type of mask provides a high level of particle filtering with little leak and is commonly donned in the critical care setting. Surgical face masks are made of non-woven fabric, worn loosely over the nose and mouth. They provide a lower level of protection from airborne disease and should therefore be used in environments where no aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
