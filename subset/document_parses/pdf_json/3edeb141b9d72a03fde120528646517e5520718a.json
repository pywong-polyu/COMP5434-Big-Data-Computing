Currently, there are more than 54,000 free WordPress plug-ins available in the official directory of plug-ins and the total number of downloads to various websites is estimated to exceed 1 billion. WordPress runs Sweden's official website, Microsoft's news.microsoft.com website, as well as online stores such as that of Bata, a shoe company. Systems like WordPress manage and store valuable information, from banking to electronic prescriptions on medical websites, as well as an enormous amount of personal data, all of which are of interest to cybercriminals and cyber-attackers. Even websites that do not hold valuable data or sensitive information are often attacked by hackers or competitors to cause a reduction in sales or to prevent websites from spreading their messages. For this reason, knowing and being aware of web vulnerability has an important value and is a critical task.",

            "text": "The WordPress WCMS is very popular among internet users, but web servers and the associated applications were found [6] to be more vulnerable than those that do not use any form of CMS. There are two major types of web-vulnerability scanners. The first type consists of automatic scanning tools that inspect the security features of the ports within the IPv4 site and share the results publicly (Shodan and Censys). The best-known tools from this group are Mmap, Zmap and Masscan [10] [11] [12] . The port information collected with such tools does not provide details of the web-page content and the vulnerability of its plug-ins, as they do not inspect the content of the web pages. The second type is composed of personal, interaction-based scanning tools operated by the user, and their results are returned directly and only to the user. The main examples of such solutions are Nessus, skipfish, Acunetix, IVRE, Vulners, and Vega. The findings are not shared publicly and to obtain the results the user operator must be contacted for a presentation of the results. Several similar search engines [6] [7] [8] [9] were created in the past by different researchers, who intended to provide an analysis of vulnerable WCMS websites. The major drawback of these applications is the time needed to inspect the large number of sites. The average scanner of this type needs a few days to explore a small data set, e.g., a group of 50,000 websites. So, success in identifying the vulnerability of a large internet web space depends on the speed of the crawling. Another drawback is the fact that they do not provide a complete image of a particular website, as some search features are not provided. An additional problem with some of the scanners is the approach used for inspecting the web servers, which is based on a simulated type of attack. In the case of success, the vulnerability is discovered. However, this is not a legal action. The use of this technique, known as the exploit technique, is forbidden in the case that the owner of the site does not allow the site to be inspected in this way. Another drawback of the existing scanners is that they access the websites using the IPv4 address and inspect only one website, thus neglecting the presence of many websites that are hosted on the same web server. The tool presented below overcomes these drawbacks and offers a more accurate vulnerability identification as well as a score for the insecurity level of the WCMS [4] .",

By identifying the status and the main characteristics of the vulnerable websites, the basic enablers that influence the level of insecurity in a particular European country can be identified and actions to improve the overall web security can be introduced.

The URLs that were not significant for our research were removed from the search (shortened URL providers, and large social sites), 2) accessing the website and asking for responses to the sent queries, 3) obtaining responses (metadata), 4) posting search queries for the application patterns, e.g., plug-ins, and collecting information from the CVE about the detected plug-ins, and 5) ad-hoc validating and storing of the results with the tool's in-built scoring mechanism. The scoring mechanism starts by identifying the vulnerability of the WCMS core in the predefined database identification of the vulnerabilities within the core WCMS pages and the plug-ins. A more detailed description of the search and scoring methodology, including a comparison of our search methodology with that of other researchers and tools, is presented in our published article [4] .",

Since we found that the internet-based indicators presented above correlate very highly among themselves, we decided to use only the DS index data, as it is considered to be the most indicative parameter in terms of web security for a general user. We hypothesized that the indicator of the DS index can show a statistically significant negative relationship with the degree of insecure sites, since better digital skills among the population implies better knowledge and an awareness regarding the use of cyber-security technology. Summary statistics of the detected vulnerabilities are shown in Table 1 . On average, we could not determine the vulnerability status for a third of the sites in a domain, due to unknown core or plug-in versions. The percentages of secure sites are between 21% and 40%, with an average of 28%. The percentage of insecure sites is in the range of 30% and 47%, with a mean of 38%, a median of 40%, and a standard deviation of 4.4%. There are no univariate outliers in either variable. In five cases, see Fig. 1 , there is a higher percentage of secure sites than insecure: Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Norway. The first two are middle ranked in terms of digital skills, while the latter three show a very high DS index. The sites with very high insecurity scores are a subset of the all sites classified as insecure sites; therefore, the correlation between the variables score and insecure is very high (r = .93). There is also a high negative correlation (r = \u2212.6) between the percentages of secure and insecure sites present in the whole set. For the validation of the hypothesis we used the percentage of insecure sites. The categorization of the DS index value was made in three groups, where we classified values below 50 as low skill, above 75 as high skill, and middle skill for the index values between 50 and 75.

This finding holds for almost all the studied European countries. The other finding that resulted from the study is related to the source of the vulnerabilities. It was found that the major contributors to the website's high insecurity score are from installed plug-ins. Figure 2 presents the comparison between the percentages of insecure plug-ins and the core versions of Word Press against the percentage of all the insecure sites. It is clear that the plug-ins are those software applications that mostly influence the overall site insecurity of the website. ",

This finding implies that the used plug-ins should be the major concern of the website owners when they decide to use them for improving the functionality and services offered by the website. However, an information service for providing awareness about the security health of the website for these types of website is still missing on the internet. Our investigation also found that there is a statistically significant relationship between a country's digital-skills index and the percentage of insecure web-content management systems: the higher the digital index of a country's population, the lower is the percentage of insecure sites in that country.",
