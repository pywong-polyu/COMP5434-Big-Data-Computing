            "text": "Computer simulations of individual-based models are frequently used to compare strategies for the control of epidemics spreading through spatially distributed populations. However, computer simulations can be slow to implement for newly emerging epidemics, delaying rapid exploration of different intervention scenarios, and do not immediately give general insights, for example, to identify the control strategy with a minimal socio-economic cost. Here, we resolve this problem by applying an analytical approximation to a general epidemiological, stochastic, spatially explicit SIR(S) model where the infection is dispersed according to a finite-ranged dispersal kernel. We derive analytical conditions for a pathogen to invade a spatially explicit host population and to become endemic. To derive general insights about the likely impact of optimal control strategies on invasion and persistence: first, we distinguish between 'spatial' and 'non-spatial' control measures, based on their impact on the dispersal kernel; second, we quantify the relative impact of control interventions on the epidemic; third, we consider the relative socio-economic cost of control interventions. Overall, our study shows a trade-off between the two types of control interventions and a vaccination strategy. We identify the optimal strategy to control invading and endemic diseases with minimal socio-economic cost across all possible parameter combinations. We also demonstrate the necessary characteristics of exit strategies from control interventions. The modelling framework presented here can be applied to a wide class of diseases in populations of humans, animals and plants.",

Given limited resources, it is crucially important to have a good understanding of what combination of control measures would constitute an optimal control strategy [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , and to be able to identify such an optimal strategy quickly.

            "text": "Rapid and reliable identification of an optimal control strategy for an emerging epidemic is still a major challenge mainly due to theoretical and computational difficulties in describing the spatial stochastic spread and persistence of diseases. Simulations of individual-based models [15, [25] [26] [27] [28] and network models [3, [29] [30] [31] often are highly detailed and may provide reliable predictions, but can take a long time to provide results. Complex simulation models do not allow quick exploration of different epidemic and control scenarios. Analytical models, in contrast, can provide insights about epidemic principles, e.g. regarding the invasion threshold for a pathogen [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] , or the level of vaccination needed to stop the spread of the pathogen in a population [40, 41] . However, most analytical insights are based on classical, non-spatial epidemiological models [32] that do not account for spatial dynamics. Analytical approximations in the form of 'moment closure' [42] [43] [44] for individual-based models and 'pair-approximation' [29] in lattice and networks models currently have two important limitations. One limitation is that the approximation schemes are uncontrolled and not guaranteed to provide an exact result in any particular limit [45, 46] . An alternative more reliable approximation scheme introduced in Ovaskainen & Cornell [47] and Ovaskainen et al. [48] for spatial point processes and individual-based models provides asymptotically exact results when interactions between individuals are sufficiently long-ranged. The approximation can be applied to a wide class of individual-based models [49] , but until now has rarely been applied to epidemiological problems (but see [50] for applications to spatially explicit metapopulations).",

Bolker, in particular, has shown [43] that spatial moment equations cannot be used to compute invasion eigenvalues for a dynamic system such as an epidemic. Instead, as stated in Brown & Bolker [44] , 'to compute the threshold, one needs to compute the spatial structure of the initial phase of the (potential) epidemic'. Accordingly, it is necessary to estimate or assume the local spatial structure [29, 44, 50] and use that to determine whether a global invasion can proceed. The invasion threshold is therefore estimated not at the start of the epidemic, but at a certain later time when the so-called 'pseudoequilibrium' at the local scale is achieved [44] . Examples of such estimates can be found in individual-based models [44], in network-based models [29] as well as in spatially explicit metapopulation models [50] .",

Our solution permits rapid exploration of the relative impact of different control scenarios with a view to the identification of the optimal control strategy. Our approach also overcomes the limitations associated with uncontrolled approximation schemes. By exploiting the fact that the invasion is a localized phenomenon when interactions are localized, we estimate the invasion threshold at the start of an epidemic. In the case when re-infection is possible, we also quantify the fraction of infected individuals at the endemic equilibrium. We show that our analytical model allows a classification of a wide class of control measures into spatial and non-spatial measures based on their influence on spatially explicit transmission of infection. This classification leads to a quantified estimate of the impact of control measures on disease incidence, and, therefore, to the identification of the optimal control strategy subject to the known relative cost of different control measures. This paper was motivated by the current COVID-19 pandemic [51, 52] , and, therefore, for numerical results, we used parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK as the most relevant example. However, our approach is applicable to a wide class of diseases in populations of humans, animals and plants.",

The dispersal kernel b(r) is defined as a normalized ( \u00d0 1 0 2prb(r) dr \u00bc 1), nonincreasing, non-negative function of the distance r between infected and susceptible individuals. Moreover, the kernel, b(r), is a finite-ranged kernel characterized by the length scale L (e.g. a radius of the Tophat kernel, or a standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel). Thus, within the spatially explicit model with finite-ranged kernel b(r), one infected individual has direct contact only with a finite number of susceptible individuals and does not contact individuals located at distances much larger than L. By contrast, in non-spatial models because of homogeneous mixing each infected individual can infect each susceptible individual in a population directly with the same constant infection rate. In our model, which considers individuals in infinite space, homogeneous mixing is obtained in the limit L \u2192 \u221e.

It defines the invasion threshold for a pathogen and hence for the invasion of disease: when R 0 > 1 an initial introduction of a pathogen grows, and the pathogen invades the population causing an epidemic; when R 0 < 1 an initial introduction of a pathogen decays. Also, in non-spatial models, R 0 determines the so-called 'herd immunity threshold' [40, 41] : the pathogen cannot invade the population of N individuals where N(1 \u2212 1/R 0 ) individuals are immune to the infection. Herd immunity may be achieved by the accumulation of natural immunity or by vaccination. However, it has been shown that the estimates of R 0 based on non-spatial models may break down when stochasticity and discreteness of individuals are taken into account [53] . R 0 is defined as 'the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual during its entire period of infectiousness in a completely susceptible population' [33] . Thus, R 0 can be calculated as 'the product of the infection rate and the mean duration of the infection' [35] . Assuming the invasion of a pathogen occurs at time t = 0, the infection rate can be expressed as Q \u00c01",

In contrast with non-spatial models, a single infected individual within a spatially explicit model interacts not with the whole infinite-sized population, but only with individuals that can be contacted directly via a finite-ranged dispersal kernel, b(x). Even if mathematically the dispersal kernel b(x) is positive everywhere in infinite space, the infection transmissions over sufficiently large distances have an extremely low probability and therefore can be omitted from consideration. Thus, practically, the invasion is a localized phenomenon. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider a local neighbourhood area around an introduced infectious individual, such that all individuals within this neighbourhood area have a sufficiently high probability of having direct contact with the initially introduced infected individual during a single period of infectiousness. For clarity and in order to provide a mathematically transparent and intuitively clear estimate for R 0 , we define a neighbourhood area around an introduced infectious individual as a disk that includes a newly infected individual from that initial infected individual with probability P = 0.95. The radius L * of the neighbourhood area is determined by the equation royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsif J. R. Soc. Interface 18: 20200966 is also large. Next, considering the whole space as such that is covered by non-overlapping neighbourhood areas, the introduction of a single infected individual to each neighbourhood results in the initial density Q I (0) \u00bc 1=(p L 2 \u00c3 ). We assume that the total size of the population as well as the density, n, of the population are conserved; therefore, an infection can be introduced to each neighbourhood area by converting a single susceptible individual in each neighbourhood area into an infectious individual. Consequently, the initial values of other densities are as follows: Q S (0) = n \u2212 Q I (0), Q R (0) = 0, i.e. the total density equals n. The initial rate of change (dQ I /dt)| t=0 consists of leading and sub-leading contributions and is expressed straightforwardly from dynamical equations for these contributions, see electronic supplementary material, Supplementary Note S2.

Details of this estimation and resulting analytical expression forg SI (k,0) are presented in electronic supplementary material, Supplementary Note S3.

Next, we explored properties of these thresholds. We find that the thresholds for R 0 (s L ,s \u03b2 ) = 1 and Q endemic I (s L ,s b ) \u00bc 0 differ in spatially explicit models (figure 1e). Thus, in spatially explicit models the pathogen (and hence disease) can invade a population, but then can fail to become endemic even when re-infection is possible, contrary to predictions for non-spatial models. This difference between thresholds occurs due to the lower density of susceptible individuals when the disease is endemic, making it less probable to find a susceptible individual near an infected individual. However, when the range of the dispersal kernel, L, increases, it is expected that the difference between invasion and endemic thresholds decreases and eventually vanishes. This was confirmed by our model: figure 2a where both thresholds coincide when L = \u221e. Earlier studies [44, 61] showed that in spatially explicit models where the host density is uniform, the invasion threshold is unchanged whether the interaction is short-or long-ranged. In line with those findings, we find only a weak dependence of the invasion threshold on L (figure 2a(i)). Such a dependence is weak because changing only L increases the local transmission rate due to the normalization of the dispersal kernel, thus the reduction in the number of contacts is compensated by the increase in the intensity of transmission. In contrast with the invasion threshold, the dependence of the endemic equilibrium on L is much stronger ( figure 2a(ii) ). This is again explained by the lower density of susceptible individuals at the endemic equilibrium. In principle, a disease can also be controlled by increasing the fraction of the population that has immunity to a pathogen, e.g. this can be achieved by vaccination. We have considered the trade-off of two types of control measures and the level of vaccination required to achieve invasion and endemic thresholds (figure 2b). Vaccination has a strong effect on both thresholds. Unsurprisingly, if a larger fraction of the population is vaccinated, then weaker control measures are required to control the disease. However, the inverse is practically useful when available vaccines or resources are limited: if stronger control measures are in place, then a lower fraction of the population needs to be vaccinated to control the disease. The shape of the dispersal kernel (e.g. Gaussian or Tophat, or intermediate case) has a weak effect on the invasion threshold, but a stronger effect on the endemic threshold, see electronic supplementary material, Supplementary Note S4 for further details.",

We demonstrated this by using three hypothetical scenarios with different relative costs of control interventions (see equations (2.7)). The static optimal control strategy for each scenario is shown in figure 3a-c. It is highly likely that the optimal control strategy would change during the course of an epidemic, due to inevitable changes in the cost of control measures. To illustrate this, we assumed that the socio-economic cost of spatial control measures increases in time (e.g. due to the strong economic impact of lockdown on the economy). Correspondingly, we assume that the socio-economic cost of non-spatial control would slightly reduce in time (e.g. due to the development of new production facilities, or the increase in compliance with non-spatial control regulations). Under these circumstances, the time-dependent Figure 3 . Optimal control strategies.

[49] for the analysis of individual-based models to assess the optimal combination of spatial and non-spatial control interventions taking into account the socio-economic cost of control and the epidemiological impact on epidemics. In the current paper, we considered a simple example of a spatially distributed population of hosts. However, the methods of our paper could be used to model epidemics in populations in which individuals move or aggregate in clusters. The approach can also be applied to a wide class of diseases in populations of humans, animals and plants. For example, the methods we describe here can be readily applied to allow consideration of a large number of different types of individuals and interactions, therefore permitting analysis of, for example, stochastic multitype epidemics [37] of multiple infective strains [62] in heterogeneous spatially explicit populations with age structure [63] and different levels of mixing [63, 64] . The work also contributes towards a new generation of analytical epidemic models that combine the following three characteristics that are necessary for realistic and reliable predictions: (i) stochasticity, (ii) spatially explicit dynamics and (iii) reliable mathematically controlled approximations. The strong advantage of analytical models is that they provide insight and a general understanding of what combination of control measures would constitute an optimal control strategy taking account of the relative socio-economic cost of the measure. In addition, analytical models allow a rapid exploration of different intervention scenarios. This has a practical value: for example, the trade-off derived here between the two kinds of control measure and vaccination can suggest an optimal strategy for resource allocation. In particular, we showed that the application of stronger control measures reduces the level of vaccination required to achieve the herd immunity threshold [41, 65] . Therefore, when the required number of doses of vaccine is not available or unacceptably costly, the application of stronger control measures can help to achieve the herd immunity threshold. This is valuable in the case of the current COVID-19 pandemic with the availability of vaccines [66] . The results of the methods explored here are also important in light of preparation for future epidemics especially in identifying ways to minimize the cost of future optimal control strategies [67] [68] [69] .
