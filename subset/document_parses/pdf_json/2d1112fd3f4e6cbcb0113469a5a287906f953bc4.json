This study explored the association of retrospective extent of exposure on current day depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among 125 youth attending a college in Kathmandu, Nepal. A self-administered survey including socio-demographic variables, scale for earthquake exposure and Nepali language validated standardized scales for depressive and PTSD symptoms was used. Prevalence estimates for depressive symptoms was 43.2% and PTSD symptoms was 19.2%. For each increasing unit of the extent of earthquake exposure, the odds of having depressive symptoms increased by a factor of 1.26 (p = 0.001) and PTSD symptoms increased by a factor of 1.26 (p = 0.002). Being in a complicated romantic relationship increased the odds of both depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms. Exposure to earthquake is an important factor to consider while assessing depressive and PTSD symptoms among youth earthquake survivors in Kathmandu. It is important that programs or policies aimed at youth mental health concurrently address disaster exposures.",

Adolescent survivors are especially vulnerable to adverse mental health issues, both because of the ongoing mental and behavioral development [3] and the course of trajectory these exposures might trigger. Prior studies have indicated that adult mental disorders, such as depression [4] , may first appear during adolescence [5] and exposure to traumatic events, such as natural disasters, during adolescence can have long-term impact. For instance, although mental health symptoms decrease over time during the post-disaster period [6] [7] [8] [9] , residual effects have been observed as long as 17 years after exposure to the disaster [8] . However, mental and behavioral health outcomes among adolescent disaster survivors continues to be understudied.",

Additionally, our results confirm positive associations between the extent of exposure and both outcomes (depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms) four years after the 2015 earthquakes among youth survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal. Prior studies analyzing mental health among children exposed to disaster-associated traumatic experiences in the U.S have argued that a dose-response relationship exists between the extent of exposure and severity of the outcomes [30, 31] . This study appears to be the first on this topic from Nepal. The positive association between exposure and depressive symptoms four years later contrasts with a study that found such association 6 months but not 30 months after the Wenchuan earthquake in China [28] . It is important to note that after the Wenchuan earthquake, a comprehensive reconstruction policy was formulated by the Government of China and the goals of reconstruction (for example, building stable housing for every family, providing job stability for at least one member of the family, etc.) were achieved within three years after the earthquake via multisectoral collaborations [32] . Similar efforts in scale and magnitude did not occur in Nepal [33] . The lack of comprehensive rehabilitation programs coupled with frequent aftershocks and lack of youth-friendly mental health services could be responsible for explaining some of the factors contributing to long-lasting depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms in this study. The findings support the need for long-term support and treatment for survivors of earthquakes in such areas, specially where this association persists in the long term.",

The association of negative qualities of romantic relationships with depressive symptoms among adolescents has been established before [34] . However, to the best of our knowledge, our study was the first to include the option of \"it's complicated\" to assess current romantic relationship status among young disaster survivors. To provide some context, the Nepali society generally frowns upon premarital romantic relationships, often equating it with a premarital sexual relationship [35] . Being romantically involved can be taken as having a \"bad character\", especially in the case of unmarried girls and thus is stigmatized [36] . Another plausible explanation leading to \"it's complicated\" could be romantic involvement with someone from a different caste or ethnicity. The illegal caste-system is still socially prevalent across different ethnic groups in the country and predisposes people to stigma if involved in a romantic relationship with someone from a different caste/ethnicity [37] . This could add to the perception of complication in the relationship.",

Participants who had been born outside Kathmandu had lower odds of having depressive symptoms after the earthquakes as compared to participants born in Kathmandu. This might have been because if they were born outside Kathmandu, they still likely had relatives in the village and could travel there after the earthquakes to \"get away\" from Kathmandu. Approximately 300,000 people were estimated to have left Kathmandu to their villages after the earthquakes [38] . This might have helped them in recuperating and coping with the aftermath of the earthquakes. They might not have faced other challenges that the ones who had to stay back had to face, for example, living in tents, or continuing to see the destruction around them, which could have aggravated depressive symptoms. For example, findings of a study conducted in Pakistan 18 months after an earthquake in 2005 indicated that living in a tent was associated with general psychiatric morbidity among the participants [39] . Thus, avoidance of potentially difficult situations by temporarily emigrating to the villages they were born in could have worked as a protective factor against depressive symptoms after the earthquake among the study population.",

This was in contrast with findings of another study where the authors found a significant negative association (r = -0.5, p < 0.001) between resilience (measured using CD-RISC 25) and depressive mood (measured using Patient Health Questionnaire-9) among survivors of the Nepal earthquakes who had suffered from spinal cord injury (SCI) due to the earthquakes [40] . This could have been because the Connor-Davidson scale was developed to measure resilience in patients living with chronic pain [26] and thus, the validation of the scale in Nepali language was also conducted among individuals living with chronic pain [27] . Despite the fact that participants from both studies were exposed to earthquakes, the factors that lead to resilience in chronic pain might not be the same as those that lead to resilience in people with depressive symptoms or PTSD symptoms. In addition, the mean age of participants in the SCI study (34.8 \u00b1 11.38 years) was higher than in the present study (18.3 \u00b1 0.6 years). Lack of association could be indicative of uniqueness in resilience among youth who faced earthquakes during their adolescence, the character of which needs further in-depth analysis.",

First, there was lack of baseline data on depressive and PTSD symptoms in the population, thus, making it difficult to ascertain the negative mental health outcomes are attributed to the earthquakes. In absence of baseline data from before the earthquakes, disentangling adverse mental health outcomes as they relate to other life events can be challenging. Second, the study was conducted in one management college of Kathmandu. Thus, the results might not be generalizable to the youth earthquake survivors in the region. Third, while a significant association was found between relationship status and adverse mental health outcomes, the confidence intervals were wide. In future studies, a larger sample size might result in better estimates. Fourth, the pool of participants might have been cognitively higherfunctioning individuals as compared to others who underwent severe trauma and did not continue their education or dropped-out of school. Individuals who had extreme scores in the depressive and PTSD symptoms scales might not have chosen to participate in the study. Efforts were made to negate this possibility by the following efforts: 1) avoiding the use of the words 'depression', 'PTSD', or 'mental health' in the study title; 2) presenting the study as an opportunity to explore the overall well-being of youth in Kathmandu after the earthquake; and 3) presenting the study as a study of youth in Kathmandu after the earthquake rather than of youth earthquake survivors, hence putting emphasis on the event rather than the people.",

So, the results of this study reaffirms the conclusions from prior studies that youth mental health needs additional attention, be it in terms of research, services or policies. Positive association between earthquake exposure and both outcomes-depressive symptoms and PTSD, even after 4 years of exposure points to the need for youth-friendly mental health related services that integrates assessment and addressing of earthquake exposure vulnerabilities.",

Undiagnosed and untreated adverse mental health conditions are detrimental to functioning and the quality of life of all youths. Results of the study indicate that exposure to earthquake needs to be considered to further identify the need of mental health services in this population. The findings suggest the need for long-term, youth-friendly mental health services and support system mechanisms for earthquake survivors. Similarly, for preparedness and preventive purposes, it is essential for future disaster survivors to have access to mental health services immediately following the disasters. Availability of longitudinal data that covers both risk and protective factors is essential for evidence-based planning and programming for youth populations. The present study opens a path for future studies to take a step further and assess possible explanatory pathways between the extent of earthquake exposure and adverse mental health outcomes. It also calls for exploring the meaning of resilience in youth who were exposed to earthquakes during their adolescence.",
