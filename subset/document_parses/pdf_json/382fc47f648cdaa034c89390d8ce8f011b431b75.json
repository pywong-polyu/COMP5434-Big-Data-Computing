One recent study showed that the virus test was negative in the postpartum milk of infected pregnant women ( Chen H, 2020 ) , while another study showed a substantially lower level of the virus in various cell types at the maternal-fetal interface, indicating that maternal-fetal interface may lack SARS-Cov-2 receptor ACE2, preventing vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus ( Zheng QL, 2020 .02.20) .

Symptoms of anxiety and depression may increase in infected women during the postpartum period ( Duan and Zhu, 2020 ) , who may exhibit varying degrees of mental health problems. One report of public awareness and attitude towards new coronavirus pneumonia among 3165 respondents in the general population showed that 98.54% of respondents expressed a high degree of fear, and 94.45% were worried about themselves or their family members being infected ( Qi Yi, 2020 .02.11) . Studies have shown that over half of respondents who experienced mental health problems in previous public health emergencies had a strong need for psychological intervention ( Fang et al., 2020 , Abdelaziz et al., 2020 , Chan and Huak, 2004 .",

Midwifery and nursing staff should be aware of the potential psychological issues that may arise in pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and offer timely psychological counseling, while midwifery and nursing management of women with COVID-19 depends on the individual situation and specific needs of each patient. We should highlight practical measures, such as preventing and reducing care-related complications and nosocomial infections, ensuring adequate care for infected pregnant patients, and ensuring the safety of all participants-mothers, infants, and medical staff. Although the women we have described were in their third trimester of pregnancy, our observations and recommendations could be followed for women in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, to prevent coronavirus-related complications and optimize outcomes for women and their infants.",
