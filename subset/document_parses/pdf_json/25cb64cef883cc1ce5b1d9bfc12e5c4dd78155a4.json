In particular, to avoid media-led confusion, we should respect the boundaries between illness, objectively verified disease and laboratory-confirmed infection. We are now relying on nucleic acid amplification tests to confirm recent infection with exquisite sensitivity, while hoping that primer and probe-binding viral sequences do not mutate beyond recognition. This level of technical sensitivity may suit the demands of public health agencies grappling with disease control, but diagnostic specificity across the varied range of COVID-19 presentations, and different stages in their clinical evolution, is less clear. As a result, we are in the invidious position of having to chase a moving viral target in a rapidly escalating pandemic without the full set of test performance, clinical and epidemiological data that we normally rely on. And with our eyes on a single diagnostic target, there is a fair chance we may miss other treatable infectious diseases in plain sight. Hence, in addition to the nucleic acid detection assays, there is also great interest in the development and assessment of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 to assess previous infection and possible immunity and for seroincidence surveys. Those involved with existing microbiological testing will appreciate that the characteristics of analytical and clinical sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values and correlates of protection will be challenging to determine.",

The conventional Koch-Henle approach to aetiology offers little help here. Instead, we need to use more contemporary methods of assessing causality to make sense of its inherent complexity [1] , so that clinical, laboratory and public health measures can draw on a rational, evidence-based approach to argumentation. There are enough data at this stage in the COVID-19 epidemic to start populating a cohesive cause and effect narrative: congruence (convergence of molecular biology, clinical features and epidemiology), consistency (reproducible features of this nexus, and its temporal-spatial clustering), cumulative dissonance (upscaling through multiple levels of biological organization) and curtailment (diagnosis, containment, control and preventive interventions). A formal review of the argument for causality goes much further than attribution of a pathogenic role for a named microbe. The original purpose of the priobe hypothesis was, and remains, the derivation of actionable insights into emerging infectious diseases. As the COVID-19 pandemic is the latest substantial emerging infectious disease challenge, the priobe hypothesis provides a prism through which to view this novel disease and its causal agent and to determine priorities for evidencebased action. This short review serves as an introduction to a conversation between medical microbiologists and their colleagues, to be supported by a moderated blog that will be updated with new insights as they appear in the scientific literature.",

Once outside China, COVID-19 spread was rapid, leading to new national epidemics in distant locations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) European region [15] . A consistent clinical picture emerged in which more severe infections affect older patients with cough, expectoration, chest pain, dyspnoea and a higher computed tomography (CT) score [16] .

There is a structural basis for cellular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 [18] , a potentially blockable cell entry pathway [19] , and a mouse model of coronavirus infection that may be a small step towards establishing causality [20] .

At present, the available measures are principally containment and control by physical distancing and improved hygiene. Their efficacy has been the subject of intense debate in view of the disruption they caused in the main centres of infection, but evidence has been presented to justify the control measures taken in China [21] and a case has been made for wider application of containment and control measures in other countries using mathematical modelling [22] . Meanwhile, patients at the severe and critical end of the COVID-19 spectrum are being treated on a compassionate, experimental basis with the antiretrovial drugs lopinavir/ ritonavir [4, 23] . An expert consensus from the epicentre of the original COVID-19 outbreak has recommended the use of chloroquine for treatment of mild, moderate and severe pneumonia during the current outbreak [24] . As these findings have been rebutted by other groups, there is obviously a need for careful assessment [25] . Clearly, it will take too long to develop novel pharmaceutical products targeted at SARS-CoV-2, but repurposing existing products that are widely available is eminently feasible if clinical benefit can be demonstrated in suitable trials. Finally, work has commenced on vaccine development [26] . Whilst welcome, these initiatives will likely take too long to be useful in the short term, but may have a use in the prevention of future epidemics, or in targeted prevention among highly vulnerable populations.",

A better understanding of the mechanisms of progression or cumulative dissonance should lead us to additional interventional insights, thus aiding the assembly of a cohesive COVID-19 defence strategy. This approach, as previously applied during local emerging infection events [1] , may be what we need to identify COVID-19's centre of gravity and critical vulnerabilities. In this rapidly developing field, we shall be discussing further aspects of COVID-19 on the Microbiology Society blog. ",
