Reworking two central theses of Marshall McLuhan's (1994) study of media, the author proposes two dispositions as necessary to encountering the role of new media in the teaching of the humanities: a state of wilful unpreparedness and a state of artistic creativity. These in turn pose educational dilemmas that require changes to the relationship between teachers, students and the learning environment, wherein these relationships become subjects of conscious study by the participants. The article draws on a range of classroom experiences in which the instructor and students attempted such a study. In encountering the shock of the new media, a series of concepts emerge that can help promote an artistic approach towards the medium itself.",

Surveys of faculty and student experience underline not so much the pain, but the ease of the transition. About 52% of undergraduate students in the United States said they were satisfied with the new online experience (EY-Parthenon, 2020). Dismal as the numbers may be, they closely hound pre-pandemic trends: in the past 14 years, no more than 58% of students have expressed satisfaction with their college education (Ruffalo Noel Levitz, 2019). By June, 74% of faculty felt confident about teaching entirely or mostly online in the coming fall (Chronicle of Higher Education, 2020). The process was by no means painless, but it also did not give rise to widespread debate, protest and soul-searching. The laboratory sciences, engineering, and studio arts have had a more difficult time with the transition -a difficulty caused not by the remoteness of people, but of equipment. 1 But in the liberal arts, the only cries of protest we hear are from students demanding tuition remission, from social justice advocates who correctly point out the inequalities of access to online resources, and from a single philosopher in Italy, Giorgio Agamben (2020), one of the very few (see also Daniels, 2020) who cannot reconcile himself to the mandate of virologists to abandon the physical environments of his work, the university.",

            "text": "The traditional role of the professor -a talking head, practically disembodied, explicating texts, introducing concepts, etc. -fits the design of online meeting platforms quite well. A nationally representative survey of more than 480 professors of philosophy we conducted just before the lockdown shows that more than 60% of all philosophy classes are made up entirely, or almost entirely, of lectures. Where there is discussion, the chief purpose, according to the professors themselves, is to correct student misconceptions. 2 Even Agamben (2020), who encourages professors and students to refuse the move online at all costs, ignores the problem of teaching. 'We are not so much interested' he says, 'in the consequent transformation of teaching, in which the element of physical presence . . . disappears definitively, as we are in the disappearance of group discussion in seminars, which was the liveliest part of instruction' . All that remains, apparently, is to figure out how to hold 'lively' discussions online, and then there is almost nothing left to be 'interested in' . Send in the 'how-to' experts of online teaching -they can tell us what to do. In less than 3 months since the lockdown, The Chronicle of Higher Education, the chief news and opinion outlet on academia in the United States, published 42 how-to guides for the online classroom. 3 The idea (albeit within a single publication) that a whole slew of experts know how to get the move online right, coupled with scarcity of debates and provocations within the same publication, might signal the general readiness of the field for what is to come -but it also signals a profound anxiety that announces itself by reaching for the numbing tonic of readymade solutions. This is not a pedagogic problem. The explicative order (Ranci\u00e8re, 1991) of the classroom rests on the idea that someone has already understood the situation, that the right concepts have already been developed, that the right attitude 1 Of the first 120 relevant articles that Google Scholar produces for the query 'Teaching online coronavirus' , sorted by date of publication until 31 May 2020, at least 55 concern teaching medicine. Of the rest, only five concern higher education, and four of these five are how-to guides for professors. The proliferation of articles on medical teaching can in part be explained by the tendency of the field towards producing rapid, quantitative research. At the same time, it can also correspond to a need to understand a felt, radical change in the work of medical educators. 2 In the data, professors report that for 50% of their small or medium-size courses and 86% of their large courses, sessions are either fully or almost fully composed of lectures. In a multiple-choice question regarding the purpose of discussions, the two top choices are 'practicing philosophical discourse' and 'correcting student misconceptions' . 3 The same publication does not offer almost any accounts of pedagogic experiments, actual failures or an in-depth look at what is lost or gained in this process. Only 12 articles could be rated as explorations of the complexities of online teaching. To arrive at these numbers, the complete output of The Chronicle, between 15 March and 15 June, that related to classroom teaching was coded and checked for inter-rater reliability.",

The disequilibrium the announcement causes is deeper than if I had danced, or declared my political allegiances or waved a knife. It colours the discussion that follows, whatever it might be, and I need only to fall silent for a few minutes, let the discomfort brew, before a student points out our unreadiness to deal with the hidden contracts that bind all we might study of theory, justice, art or pedagogy.

The learning entailed here extends one's thinking in just the same way that media act as 'extensions of man' . The learning can amplify, streamline, diversify, disintegrate, etc. what one can do in the world. It gives form. But just as the form of media can become content (the medium, the message) and undermine freedom of thought and action, just as amplification, streamlining, etc. are by no means purely benevolent changes, the more one learns, the more one must view oneself critically. Unprepared humanities then requires an extremely high threshold for uncertainty and disequilibrium, to the extent that one must cultivate, among other tools, an internal mechanism for disrupting equilibrium on purpose -a lesson that business schools, with their promotion of agile leadership, adaptive leadership or transformational leadership, have learned with much more urgency than the social sciences (see Rorty, 1989 ) that inspired them in the first place.",

For the first time in the history of the class, people begin to voice one-word approvals or disapprovals for this or that statement. Some merely snap their fingers to indicate agreement. Some call for the class to turn around, to seek fullbodied connection. We are, it seems to me, in a Facebook battle, with snaps serving as 'likes' and hisses as 'dislikes' . It has become easier to hurt others and to grieve alone. This is as much as I can 'see' , and I state it.

' Here, in what happens to this student's language, one encounters the second, active aspect of an unprepared humanities: the attempt at artistic creation. In these classes, students were encouraged to think as much as possible about what they had read, their own experiences, and what was happening in the here-and-now. Becoming aware of their modes of perception and interaction, they saw also the possibility to transform them. The separation between learning and action is shattered, and in the wake of that breakdown, within a dialogue, what can emerge often has the shape of an artistic creation -an attempt to express an internal state that is not pre-figured in the mode of expression. To speak of the possibilities of learning online, Shelly has to connect the classroom to the bedroom, the voices of classmates to that of a lover, and transform the word 'test' beyond its place in schooling into something semi-spiritual.",

The serious artist is the only person able to encounter technology with impunity, just because he is an expert aware of the changes in sense perception ' (1994, p. 18) . McLuhan, however, could not shoulder the full implications of his own discovery. Having confined the artistic sensibility within 'serious' artworks -in Shakespeare, for example (pp. 9-10, 58-59, 149-150, 175-176) -he could not study it in everyday encounters. He could only, and very briefly, dream of a more commonly held sensibility: 'If men were able to be convinced that art is precise advance knowledge of how to cope with the psychic and social consequences of the next technology, would they all become artists?' (p. 66). That is as far as he could go (Browne, 2015) . We can see the pattern of his thinking more clearly in his much earlier, firebrand writings: 'The media are not toys; they should not be in the hands of Mother Goose and Peter Pan executives. They can be entrusted only to new artists, because they are art forms' (McLuhan, 2011, p. 14) . New artists is a much more active (and far less pre-figured) formulation than serious ones. Today, with so much of one's life given over to undecipherable, algorithmic art forms (iPhone, Facebook and, in the case of the online classes in this study, Zoom) run, indeed, by Mother Goose executives, the call for new artists has the clear ring of a battle cry. But instead of searching solely in the works of 'serious' artists, we must watch precisely for the dilettante, the desperate teacher, the failing student, the regular user awakened to a sense of agency.",

The problem is at the heart of the debate regarding the effect of algorithms on humans (see Harrison, 2018; Magalh\u00e3es, 2018) . On the one hand, there are those who hold with the 'moral harm paradigm' , focusing on the powerlessness of users before algorithms that shape their lives (Mittelstadt et al., 2016) ; on the other hand, the school of actor-network theory holds that users shape the experience of digital media as do producers (Neyland, 2016; Ziewitz, 2016) . In the latter paradigm, there is no common experience of media to be 'revealed' (Ananny & Crawford, 2018) . What, however, seems like a debate between two opposing conceptions is, at the core, the result of an unwillingness in both camps to perceive the emotional force behind their split. Each side is the corollary of the other. To see users as victims is an expression of excessive despair -a despair that exists and is justified by the overwhelming force of media and the inactivity of people. To see users as co-creators of media is an expression of excessive hope, and this hope, too, is justified by what we know of human activity. It would be more accurate to go back and forth between an icy plunge into despair and a rising into the heat of hope -to remain awake to both feelings at the same time. One must simultaneously keep green in the mind the two commandments: 'enter as if unprepared, and remember that you are an artist' .",

The hybridity of online spaces has already been pointed out in many studies (e.g. Fuller, 2005; Mulcahy et al., 2015) . What Kitchin and Dodge (2011) call the code/space, \"when software and the spatiality of everyday life become mutually constituted\" (p. 13), is amenable to extraordinary transmission and extension, because it is partly pure digital data. The vanishability of online participants, however, suggests a complementary phenomenon: so far as your presence is concerned, the online classroom is an absolute space, a constellation that can vanish instantly, cutting off the process of extension. We recognise this from our experience with television. The actors and sets we are watching exist as bodies on a different ground, as waves in the air, as images on countless screens, including the one in our room. Turn off the machine now, and the space, so far as it involved you, has vanished. But you yourself were never in television. The physical classroom, too, was a hybrid. It included the chats that took place before or after each session, the phone screens students secretly turned on, the small group meetings in different rooms without the teacher. Online hybridity, however, is of such a different magnitude that it suggests an entirely different quality. You gaze into the houses of other students. You can mute yourself, call another participant, and speak privately just as the class continues -each voice whispering in the other's home. The physical classroom, too, had finality (walls, a time boundary). But the space stretched into the doorway, the hallway, the school as a whole, until little by little you were completely elsewhere. The absolute/hybrid space of the online class has deep consequences. Students were never before in an equal position to hybridise, to shape the space of learning. At the same time, they have never been so much dependent on the spatiality created and administered for them by other powers.",

Edwards (2015) has talked about the 'hidden curriculum of software' . In the online platform, however, we have cases of what was hidden becoming apparent, without becoming any more painful, without necessarily being forced into awareness. The violence of the verb 'to mute' , for example, is softened to a basic option, coupled with 'unmute' as a whimsical corollary. These buttons do for interactions what gestures (raising your hand, crossing the arms, snapping fingers, leaning forward) have always done: to codify a complex of thoughts and actions into an instantly communicable act (Kendon, 2004) . The difference is that the physical gesture carried the complexity of the body and, at any point, was marked by the specific state of the person. Raising a shaking, uncertain hand and shooting a hand up into the air do not signify the same thing. The encoded gesture -the image of two hands clapping, the musical signature (a doorbell) that announces the arrival of a new participant -is the work of absent artists, and, if deployed in isolation from other communicative acts, relates only to the general milieu and not the individual. Two digital 'thumbs up' look exactly the same, even if the thoughts behind them are wildly different.

In the first online session of one of my classes, a student, Joshua, has finished saying how much being online allows him to focus on individual voices (those very voices that Shelly, earlier, had linked to that of the lover). Another student begins to speak -but we cannot hear her. The Internet on her side is too weak for the transmission. We can only see her gestures in choppy staccato and hear only a static. She is separated from her image and her sounds. This is an accident, but here one can turn one's own image off and only come through as a voice, or vice versa. The key difference with the telephone call or the recorded lecture is that the online platform can switch rapidly, and even arbitrarily, between one sense and another. You, therefore, curate yourself along separate sensory channels. There is also an impact on what bell hooks (1994) calls 'the erotics' of education. hooks focuses on the separation between mind and body in academia -the denial of the body. But if the body has been traditionally disavowed in the teacher-student relationship, it was always a loud presence in the student-student relationship.",

These anxieties link directly to the teacher's fear of losing authority over the event, though they can also be read as expressions of paternalistic altruism -the desire to protect students from distraction, exhaustion and intrusion, respectively. There is also a secret facet: each of these is also a form of protest, just as passing notes, putting one's head down on the desk and occupying classrooms have served as acts of defiance. To think about what is new in the current situation, we need to hold on to our understanding of the old phenomena and our unreadiness before the current. Most classrooms, for example, have forever been drudgeries, or Shakespeare would not have depicted an entire age of man as 'the whining schoolboy . . . creeping like snail unwillingly to school' (2000, 2.7.145-6) .

Technology companies that develop computer software are interested in maximising the transmission of information -period. The direction of transmission is secondary. The Zoom platform offers the ability to text-chat (between individuals or with the whole group), a polling software, closed captioning, links to other social media and so on. To sit behind a computer, in any case, is to have almost immediate access to a vast set of texts and people. Software companies like Zoom, of course, have understood that they need to help clients replicate the traditional classroom or meeting as closely as possible (profit being more important than information transfer). To reach this traditional mode, the user must actively block the extra channels. What was in the physical classroom a historically agreed upon arrangement, supported by the architecture, in the online classroom becomes an obvious limiting of the participants' extended faculties.

All of these, however, might be minor mental efforts compared to the immense difference in terms of the relationship to one's self-image. The constant awareness of how one appears to others, as described above, is taxing on its own. It is moreover coupled with an attack on the conditions that help many people maintain a differentiated and complex sense of self -a fragile so-called 'self-complexity' (Linville, 1987) . 6 A lowering of self-complexity, research showed almost three decades ago, exacerbates fatigue and depression (Dixon & Baumeister, 1991) . Whether this is the main cause of zoom fatigue requires more empirical research. We can, however, speculate that the hybridity of the online space erodes the once sacrosanct barriers between home and office, family and work. The mind has to either reconcile itself to the hybrid space and create a new sense of self-complexity, or to constantly perform gymnastics to maintain the old separations. Both options require work.

The koan deals with problems for which everyday or even specialised language prove insufficient. The teacher cannot explain the koan away or solve it for the student, because its real subject is a change within the student of a magnitude and quality that would allow a different perspective on, or approach to, the world. When the Zen master Hyakujo (720-840 C.E.) wanted to choose an abbot for a monastery, he devised the following test: he took a pitcher, placed it on the floor and asked the monks: 'This must not be called a pitcher. What do you call it?' The best response the head monk could come up with was 'Well, you cannot call it a wooden sandal.' At this point, another monk, Isan, walked up, kicked over the pitcher, and left the assembly. Hyakujo awarded Isan the abbotship (Shibayama, 1974, p. 279 ). Hyakujo's question, a koan, requires an active, internal understanding of language, of decisiveness, and of social norms (it is significant that Isan walks away after kicking the pitcher). The teacher cannot anticipate the responses of the students, nor can he consider his work finished without a response. He cannot set a rubric for the proper response, nor can he hold all responses to be of the same value.",

Tsing, in the discussion of a text that refers to prisoners, transforms her background to a jail cell, and the group begins to talk about confinement as a social and philosophical construct that refers both to prisoners and to themselves, though not alike. Someone, in an argument with Tsing, tells her: 'I'm trying to tell you \"you have spinach in your teeth!\"' Almost immediately another student changes his background to a cartoon of Popeye holding a can of spinach, the source of his strength. Mahdah, for an entire class, refuses to look directly at the camera. She looks to the side, or just above, and the entire time, she paints her face. Layer after layer of paint, on her face, on her neck. 'I'm trying to look beautiful' , she says, when finally questioned -beauty having been a regular concept in the class, but here having become tied to the gaze, to an addressability, that both displays itself on the body and refuses to become a display. Joshua has turned off all the lights in his room, sitting in total darkness, save for a candle that does not have enough power to light up anything but itself. When someone asks him to let the class see his face, he holds up a photograph of himself to the camera, and the light from his screen illuminates this image of an image. Raul spends an entire hour with half of his camera covered with a piece of paper, his face perfectly positioned so that the paper cuts it in half, too. Irena does not turn on the lights in her room, and as the sun goes down, all her surroundings turn into darkness, while her face remains lit by the computer screen. The image now resembles a painting, like a Georges de la Tour, with the figure deep in concentration before a small flame. It's a simple, painful and beautiful composition. I spotlight it. I have seen nothing similar to it on a videoconference before and will not see one like it for months to come.",

She is on mute, and she begins to speak to someone real or imaginary off-screen. We cannot hear her, we can only see her wide smile, her animated hands, and the beach. This is the clearest expression of 'I'm checking out' or 'I am multi-channeling' that we have seen; but having been communicated in this way, we know that something of Bessie, something more than her ire and resistance, is with us.",

In one session, I forget to turn off the recorder. The students remain behind for 90 minutes. At first there are 25 of them, discussing the class, the texts, their own actions. After 70 minutes, six of them have remained, the rest having said goodbye or simply vanished. And then the six say goodbye, too, and one by one begin to log off. At the end, there is only Tim. He is by himself, sitting in silence for about two minutes, looking at the screen. 'I know this is being recorded' , he finally says. 'I like being the last person in a room. . . I just like being in empty rooms, I find myself in empty spaces a lot. There is something liberating about being in an empty space where there's nobody else around' .

Precisely for this reason, those involved in such an attempt have more agency over the media that govern their environment than those who try to 'fix' a problem they scarcely have described. The 'empty room' to which Tim addresses himself has always been there, right at the centre of any humanities class, or wherever people have gathered to think their conditions. The pandemic has enlarged this room to unbearable dimensions. Technology has made it more recordable, shareable -just as writing had done before.

Maybe, once we return to the physical walls, the conditions therein will strike us as strange as they really are. It is possible then that in a few classrooms, people will ask how the modes of interaction and study impact what is being studied, or what the environment is making of the people, or vice versa. It is possible to cultivate a state of learned unpreparedness where false certainty and rhetorical questions had dominated. And it might even be possible for people to approach each other, the environment and the ideas with the wilful artistry that, in its failures and master strokes, elevates the classroom to a place worth partaking in.",
