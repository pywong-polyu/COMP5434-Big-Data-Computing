In order to characterize the global crotonylation proteome, a proteomic method based on sensitive immune-affinity purification and Open Access high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was applied to identify new crotonylated proteins and modification sites. With the utilization of high specificity antibodies, increasing crotonylated lysine residues and crotonylated proteins were identified so far. Also, the involvement of crotonylated proteins in multiple cellular processes were wellrecorded [3] .",

We reported the proteome-wide profiling of Kcr in S. agalactiae and identified 241 Kcr sites of 675 proteins for the first time. The bio-informatics analysis showed that 164 sequences were matched to a total of six definitively conserved motifs, and many of them were enriched in metabolic processes, cellular process, and single-organism processes. Moreover, we also found a considerable four crotonylation modified proteins involve in sensing system and bacterial virulence, potentially providing targets for vaccine development. The present data provides new insights into the pathogenesis of S. agalactiae from fish, and the virulence mechanisms should be further investigated. . c CsbD (29kDa) protein in S. agalactiae using Western blotting with specific antibody (1:2000) . dYebC (49.7kDa) protein in S. agalactiae using Western blotting with specific antibody (1:3000). e cold shock protein (29.1kDa) in S. agalactiae using Western blotting with specific antibody (1:2000) ",
