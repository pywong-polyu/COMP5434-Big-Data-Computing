Each school was making their own decisions regarding student safety and suspending students from clinical involvement. From the hospital's perspective, removing students was not something being considered during the early stages of surge planning. However, as COVID patients began to outnumber other patients, and there were still questions regarding how COVID was being spread, the hospital realized that removing students from clinical rotations would be necessary to decrease transmission rate, reduce PPE burn rate, and increase safety for both students and patients. Everyone in the hospital including physicians, nurses, students, technicians, and environmental services were pieces of the patient care puzzle. Students have some training and can be important contributors to patient care. However, our main goal in the hospital was preserving patient lives, not educating students, and so taking students off the front line made the most sense for this goal. Ultimately, the decision to remove students from the hospital was made by the medical school. While there were some discussions about involving students in non-clinical ways, it was challenging to coordinate student involvement across the multiple Rutgers entities such as the medical, dental, and nursing schools.",

If this occurred, we wanted to ensure that proper protections were in place. For example, there were concerns for potential student exposure while providing childcare support for healthcare workers and for volunteering efforts that occurred at the hospital, such as temperature screenings and meal distributions. For efforts on-site at the hospital, student health created a screening questionnaire in order to clear students to volunteer for on-site hospital activities. We were truly amazed by the number of projects the students developed, the number of overall students involved, the connections with other community organizations, and the impact on the community overall, all initiated, implemented, and led by the students themselves.

A small but vocal few viewed things in a more transactional way, wanting elective credit or financial compensation in exchange for labor and personal risk. There was significant concern over whether volunteering would be might be coercive in image or actuality. Those staying home to protect their parents and children feared that residencies would pass them over in favor of those with tales of COVID heroism, despite the fact that both actions demonstrated commitment to aiding the fight against the pandemic. In particular, the concrete need for some activities to be on-site, and the hard rule against remuneration or credit for volunteering, were major obstacles for a large fraction of the class, reducing the pool of possible volunteers. A common compromise that arose as schools wrestled with this problem in parallel was to restrict volunteer initiatives to non-clinical environments.

This individual would be self-sufficient and have the capability of managing volunteers and resources with minimal need to refer to those who are more senior. Similarly, there should be a student representative present at relevant high-level meetings (such as our hospital's all-department briefing every morning), so that they can have a better grasp of how the hospital is running and where the current needs are, and, in turn, communicate their findings to fellow students. Since Rutgers has various health professional schools within the university's division of health sciences, a streamlined mode of communication among the various schools and the hospital would have also improved communication and the relaying of consistent messaging to the various student bodies.",

It would be helpful to have the entire leadership team with representatives from each activity meet together with hospital and medical school leadership on a regular basis. Such planned and structured meetings would allow all parties to have a clear understanding of plans, decisions, and the development of projects. Furthermore, all parties should set clear expectations from the very beginning, including roles of each group, and discussion regarding communication with the student body as a whole as well as potential for credit toward academic progression.",

            "text": "In order for student volunteers to have a role in the planned response to a resurgent or future outbreak, there needs to be continuity in volunteer leadership, as well as an institutional champion. When planning for sustainability, we should acknowledge that the staff generally remains longer than any student, and so institutional support is key. One form that this could take is if advancing students recruit incoming students, similar to other clubs, and link them directly with the relevant hospital administrator in the ICS structure. With the experience gained during COVID-19, the potential roles for student volunteers can be anticipated and largely planned for. Rather than recruiting ad hoc for newly sprouting roles, recruitment should be for a general student labor pool, with the flexibility to be deployed by student leaders to address whatever needs are identified by hospital leadership in an evolving situation. This could help prevent redundancy in response, free up resources for the hospital, and reduce potential liability issues [15] . Schools may even choose to incorporate pandemic preparedness into their curriculum which may increase the size and skillset of a potential volunteer response [16] . It is important to acknowledge that the role of students will change over time. At our school, clinical students (third and fourth years) were welcomed back onto the floors after the initial spring peak wound down. Despite smaller waves later on, the hospital was able to segregate most COVID patients into non-teaching services and floors, keeping the experience of clinical students mostly unchanged. They were also permitted to join the first wave of vaccinations, which in combination with ample PPE supplies, partially assuaged the fears of administrators. In contrast, pre-clinical students remained remote, and many moved away from the hospital and back in with vulnerable unvaccinated family. The hospital itself was able to streamline its pandemic measuresfor example, tasking entry security guards with temperature screenings -which reduced reliance on the student labor pool. As such, the nature of volunteering changed. Students, especially clinical year students, were less involved in direct in-hospital laboring but maintained a role in telehealth operations such as the State COVID Hotline and follow-up calls for patients under investigation, as well as more community-focused initiatives like neighborhood food delivery.",
