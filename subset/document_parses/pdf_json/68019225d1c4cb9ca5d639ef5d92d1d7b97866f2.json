            "text": "The pandemic of coronavirus disease spreading is impacting mental health globally. Even though the pandemic is challenging for patients, the community, policymakers, as well as health organizations, and teams, the data on COVID-19 and its association with anxiety and coping mechanisms towards infection among community members are currently limited. Thus, the study is intended to assess COVID-19-related levels of anxiety and coping strategies among community members of Bale and East Bale Zones, Southeast Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based survey was carried out among 634 study participants of Bale and East Bale Zones from June 1 to 20, 2020. The level of anxiety was determined by using the 5-item Coronavirus Scale and the coping strategies were determined by using the 15-item Coping and Adaptation Processing Scale. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect the data. Bi-variable analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to estimate the relationship among the variables. Results: COVID-19-related dysfunctional level of anxiety was found 95 (16.58%). About 290 (50.6%) respondents were copied from anxiety that occurred as a result of COVID-19. Factors significantly associated with the dysfunctional level of anxiety related to COVID-19 were being an urban resident (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.86), those who had no information from TV/radio (AOR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.84), and walking a long distance more than 1 hour from the health institution (AOR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.97). Conclusion: COVID-19-related dysfunctional levels of anxiety were 16.58% in the study community. Half of the community was coped with COVID-19-related anxiety. Being an urban resident and walking along distances more than 1 hour from the health facility were the factors that decreased the odds of having a dysfunctional anxiety, whereas respondents who had no information from TV/radio increased the odds of having a dysfunctional anxiety. Accordingly, focusing on these identified factors could improve a dysfunctional level of anxiety in the study community.",

            "text": "The absence of face-to-face communication and other regular social interventions during the epidemic outbreak results in stressful conditions. 4, 5 Being alone also results in the feeling of loneliness and anger. 6 Adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder can be developed due to these short-term effects. 7 Globally, many preventive measures have been taken. These include restriction of movement, stay at home, and closure of the school, and other social services that lead to increased anxiety among the society. 8, 9 It has been indicated that the increasing number of patients and suspected cases, as well as the increasing number of provinces and countries affected by the outbreak, have elicited public worry about being infected in this outbreak, which has increased anxiety. 10 However, nobody is sure when the disease will be under control. The unpredictability of the current crisis and being alone for indefinite periods results in a stressful situation for Ethiopian people. Common mental health problems like anxiety can be increased in stressful situations. 11 Inappropriate information regarding the COVID-19 epidemic on social media may also lead to a suicide attempt. 12 A psychiatric intervention follow-up was delivered by the mental health team coping with the outbreak, as suggested by the occurrence of high mortality infectious disease outbreaks. 13 Apart from the primary source of anxiety that is COVID-19, there may be secondary sources like fear of the scarcity of resources, fear of losing a beloved person, fear of lack of social support, and others. 14 These psychological difficulties to cope with the current situation are aggravated with the extreme measures taken by the Governments of different countries to decrease the virus spread, especially by keeping people in quarantine.",

Unexpectedly, these findings indicated more dysfunctional anxiety among study participants who had no information from TV/radio regardingCOVID-19. This finding contradicts to the previous study, where social media exposures were associated with higher anxiety. 29 This could be justified as evidence showed that during a severe social change due to pandemic, there is usually a high need for information and sense seeking by individuals and the mass media are generally perceived to best satisfy these needs. 30 In particular, the general public depend closely on the media to obtain information regarding pandemic guidance to the public on the response. One of the reasons why people usually need more information in the context of pandemic time is to reduce the anxiety caused by uncertainty in the pandemic time. 31, 32 Research indicated that in the pandemic/epidemic time, uncertainty and uncontrollable feelings were positively related to anxiety. 33 In addition to this lack of household electric broadcast facilities, such as TV or radio, may hinder them to have the real information such as its severity, way of transmission, and how to prevent pandemic because much of communication by government and health agencies is done via DovePress mass media. The source of information for these people is mainly simple talks and saying from persons in the community. Even anxiety might not be only regarding the pandemic, it may also relate with thinking from where to acquire the right information. Study participants from urban residents were less likely to have dysfunctional anxiety by 56% as compared to study participants from rural residents. This finding is similar to a study conducted in China. 24 The possible reason for these could be that urban residents are relatively more educated, economically improved, have better information from media, accessible infrastructure, and improved technologies.",

Residence, distance from health facility, and information from radio/TV were statistically significant variables to COVID-19-related dysfunctional level of anxiety among the study community. Accordingly, being an urban dweller and walking a long distance of more than 1 hour from the health facility were the factors that decreased the odds of having dysfunctional anxiety, whereas respondents who had no information from radio/TV increased the odds of having dysfunctional anxiety-related COVID-19. It is good if the concerned health programmer gives priority in rural areas to disseminate reliable, scientifically supported, and timely information for the community regarding pandemic COVID-19. It is also better if the concerned body considers factors identified in this study and puts them into action. It is also recommended that health workers frequently create awareness about COVID-19, which may have a multiplier effect to decrease the dysfunctional levels of anxiety and increase coping in the community.",
