This study used the Conceptual Model for Fostering Civility in Nursing Education as its guiding framework. The Incivility in Higher Education Revised (IHE-R) Survey and a detailed demographic questionnaire were used to gather self-assessment and personal perspective data regarding incivility in the higher education setting. This approach aspired to collect a comprehensive perspective of incivility in higher education. With data from 400 students and 69 faculty, there was limited agreement between faculty and student participants about perceptions and experiences with incivility. Faculty and students did agree that the solution to incivility may be found with the creation of a code of conduct that defines acceptable and unacceptable behavior, role-modeling professionalism and civility, and taking personal responsibility and standing accountable for actions. Despite significant differences in participants' perceptions of incivility, they shared common solutions. With a shared goal, faculty and students can work toward cultivating civility in higher education.",

Higher education is a microcosm of the world, and like the world, institutions of higher education are mixing bowls of cultures, attitudes, behaviors, expectations, and personalities. The fluid culture of higher education facilitates dynamic encounters between participants. While many of those encounters are enriching, some are harmful to the higher education environment and its members. These harmful encounters are best described as uncivil and present a serious risk to a conducive learning environment for faculty and students (Clark & Springer, 2007) . Despite ongoing investigation into the dynamics of incivility, there is a worsening of the phenomena. These uncivil encounters are the focus of this study.",

As a result, different groups within higher education may have greater or lesser ability to demonstrate civility as a shared norm. First-generation, working-class, and racially or culturally underrepresented students, as well as faculty members, may be excluded from unspoken power and civility codes (Bassett, 2020; Collier & Morgan, 2008; Kezar, 2013; Rend\u00f3n et al., 2000; Tinto, 1993) .",

As ever-increasing numbers of once excluded student perspectives enter into higher education institutions, the literature registers the backlash against those who fail to maintain traditional norms. Lippmann et al. (2009) use the term \"student entitlement\" to describe students who come from newly affluent segments of the population and who reject the view of faculty as \"intellectual leaders who are to be respected\" (p. 200). Newer studies point to power differences and distances between students and faculty as causes of incivility in higher education and look toward models of shared authority and increased communication within the classroom as potential pathways forward toward both greater civility and improved learning environments for both faculty and students (Alt & Itzkovich, 2019) .",

Clark (2008a) explains that \"creating a culture of civility requires communication, interaction, and an appreciation for the interests each person brings to the relationship\" (p. e37). This model demonstrates a continuum between civility and incivility that is influenced by participants' attitudes (faculty attitudes of superiority, student attitudes of entitlement), highstress encounters, and opportunities to engage (or not) with each other.

Student and faculty participants then reported the frequency for witnessing the same 24 behaviors using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = never to 4 = often. This study also asked faculty to self-report the frequency of engaging in these behaviors. While the IHE-R asks faculty to report the frequency of witnessing student behaviors, our study sought to probe further into the professional codes of conduct that may affect individual behavior. By prompting a moment of self-assessment among the faculty who are responsible for establishing classroom codes of conduct, this alteration to the instrument provided information about faculty members' self-reported tolerance for violating civility norms. Finally, faculty participants reported the frequency of engaging in those same 24 behaviors using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1-never to 4-often. Internal reliability for the lower level and higher-level incivility subscales is 0.95 and 0.99 for student participants and 0.94 and 0.97 for faculty participants (Clark et al., 2015) . The total item Cronbach alpha was reported as 0.96 for students and 0.98 for faculty (Clark et al., 2015) . For this study, internal reliability for the lower level and higher-level incivility subscales was 0.99 and 0.98 for student participants and 0.93 and 0.87 for faculty participants. The total item Cronbach alpha for faculty participants was 0.94 (which includes the adapted frequency of engaging in behaviors) and 0.97 for student participants. For this study, the researchers asked faculty and student participants to rate their perceptions of incivility for 24 behaviors, asked faculty to rate the frequency in observing these 24 behaviors with other faculty, and asked students to rate the frequency in observing these 24 behaviors in faculty. With permission from the author of the IHE-R we adapted the instrument to include faculty reporting the frequency of engaging in these 24 behaviors. In contrast, the original IHE-R evaluates faculty and student perceptions of the incivility of 24 behaviors, frequency of observation of faculty displaying 24 uncivil behaviors by students, frequency of observation of students displaying 24 uncivil behaviors by faculty, and frequency of faculty and students engaging in 24 uncivil behaviors. An overall average of individual item responses is calculated and higher scores on this instrument indicate a higher presence of uncivil behavior and/or a higher frequency of these behaviors.",

Data were screened for missingness, normality, and outliers before performing inferential statistics. All participants who completed the survey in less than 5 min were removed from the data before analysis (n = 80 students and 23 faculty). This was to ensure data accuracy as it was not possible to read and respond to all items in less than 5 min. Perceptions of uncivil behavior and frequency of witnessing uncivil behavior were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests to determine whether significant differences exist between student and faculty participants. Mann-Whitney U tests were also utilized with the following additional comparison groups: non-tenured faculty, white and non-white participants, and those with and without a licensure or certification program. Programs which include licensure or certification often have a professional and/or program code of conduct which potentially includes expectations of civil behavior (e.g. nursing, social work, education). Such programs may demonstrate heightened attention to such codes in the classroom, and their disciplines and accrediting bodies may explicitly interrogate the power dynamics between professionals in the field and the vulnerable populations they serve. The presence of formalized codes of conduct provides a rationale for comparing groups with and without licensure or certification programs. For white and non-white and licensure and certification program comparisons, faculty and students were combined into a single group for comparisons. Nonparametric analyses were utilized due to unequal group sizes and/or unequal variances. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.",

Higher mean ranks for faculty (290.1) were also observed for \"Making rude gestures or non-verbal behaviors toward others (eye-rolling, finger-pointing, etc. )\" compared to students (222.3) (U = 8876.5, p \u2264 0.001). \"Using a computer, phone or another media device in faculty meetings, committee meetings other work activities for unrelated purpose\" was also witnessed more by faculty (355.8) when compared to students (211.2 (U = 4674.5, p \u2264 0.001). \"Arriving late for class or other scheduled activities\" or \"Leaving class or other scheduled activities early\" was observed more by faculty (355.8, 319.0) compared to students (217.7, 215.9) (U = 7055.0, p \u2264 0.001, U = 6529.0, p \u2264 0.001) respectively. Faculty also reported witnessing \"Being unprepared for class or other scheduled activities\" (313.6) compared to students (218.) (U = 7398.5, p \u2264 0.001). Being distant and cold toward others (unapproachable, rejecting student's opinions) was witnessed more by faculty (276.9) compared to students (224.3) (U = 9707.0, p \u2264 0.001). Students reported witnessing \"allowing side conversations by students that disrupt class\" less (221.6) than faculty (294.2) (u = 8617.0, p \u2264 0.001). Students also witnessed less \"Making condescending or rude remarks towards others\" (222.5) compared to faculty (284.7) (U = 9157.0, p \u2264 0.001). Ignoring or failing to address or encouraging disruptive student behaviors was witnessed more frequently by faculty (274.6) when compared to student participants (223.5) (U = 9726.5, p \u2264 0.001). Being unavailable outside of class (not returning calls or emails, not maintaining office hours) was observed more frequently by faculty (266.1) compared to students (226.0) (U = 10,391.5, p = 0.02). Finally, students observed \"Sending inappropriate or rude emails\" less frequently (223.8) than faculty participants (276.2) (U = 9687.5, p \u2264 0.001).",

The recruitment period for this study occurred during the global COVID-19 pandemic during a time when the majority of the nation remained teaching and learning remotely. This likely influenced results for students and faculty. Further, the nation was also experiencing a renewed racial justice movement in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. The potential for self-selection bias as well as response bias due to self-reporting of data are also limitations of this research. Due to low response rates for faculty and student participants nonresponse bias is possible. However, demographic characteristics of faculty and staff participants were similar to overall characteristics of all eligible faculty and students. Students were not asked how frequently they engaged in uncivil behaviors which limits the ability to compare the frequency of engaging in uncivil behaviors between students and faculty.",

Several key points were brought to light through the student and faculty responses in this study. The first, generational differences, emerged in the areas of technology (specifically using computers and mobile devices), and the impact of the lifestyle of today's students on perceptions of incivility. A second key point is that there is no standard set of shared norms among faculty and students, or between tenured and nontenured faculty. Overall, faculty and students differed greatly in their sensitivity to uncivil behaviors. Without agreement about what constitutes incivility, differences between student perception of incivility and faculty perception arise. There is inherent value in understanding the differences between subgroups. Future research would be supportive in better understanding these phenomena.",

Because the distribution of age-related categories was so wide, a meaningful statistical comparison of responses by generation was not possible. Generational differences are likely to be a contributing factor to differences between faculty and students in their perceptions of civility norms. Overall, faculty perceived more behaviors as more uncivil than students did and had a greater range of perceptions of behaviors; faculty mean ranks of perceptions of uncivil behaviors ranged from 187.8 to 285.2 compared to students' mean ranks of 222.9 to 237.8.",

Although a majority of students (59.4%) found incivility was not a problem in their department, 58.5% of faculty in this survey identified incivility as a mild, moderate, or serious problem in their departments. The only behavior students perceived as significantly more uncivil than faculty did was ineffective or inefficient teaching methods, such as changing the syllabus. Piotrowski and King (2016) emphasize that students complain more about uncivil faculty behaviors that affect their academic outcomes. The findings in this study are consistent with previous research (Clark, 2008b; Connelly, 2009) ; however, previous studies did not ask faculty about the faculty behaviors they witnessed or engaged in. This study found that while students found ineffective teaching particularly uncivil, this was one of only two uncivil behaviors that a majority of faculty (50.8%) were willing to admit engaging in. They reported doing so rarely (41.3%), sometimes (7.9%), or often (1.6%). Both students and faculty witnessed the behavior at nearly the same frequency with very similar mean ranks (231.3 and 232.5 respectively) (U = 12,504.5, p = 0.95).

With constant access to email, and the increase in remote learning, especially during the pandemic, the lines between work/school and home blurred. The necessity of using technology to deliver classes during the pandemic increased students' communication with faculty through computers and mobile devices. One study published just before the COVID-19 pandemic found the \"most frequently experienced uncivil student behavior for both faculty (44.86%) and students (65.22%) was using a computer, phone, or other media device during class, meetings, or activities for unrelated purposes\" (Wagner et al., 2019, p. 267) . The present study finds that faculty members, especially tenured faculty members, were particularly aware of the use of technology for unrelated purposes, and they reported witnessing the behavior far more often than students did. Using devices for unrelated purposes was also the uncivil behavior most faculty (55.6%) reported engaging in either rarely (33.3%), sometimes (15.9%), or often (6.3%). Like students, faculty appear to use mobile devices as a regular part of their everyday communication, and they engage in this use while in class, meetings, or other activities.

Although there was no difference between student and faculty perceptions of incivility in using devices for unrelated purposes, it is not clear how those witnessing the behaviors determine whether the use is related or unrelated. Students may use mobile devices to look up definitions or follow along in an ebook during a lecture. They use laptops to take notes, research the topic being discussed in class, complete in-class group assignments, and more. Students may also need to learn using alternate methods of processing information. For example, students may need to type or record or follow along in their ebook because they can't process aural information at the rate necessary to understand conventional lectures. Many faculty may view the use of these devices in class as unrelated, uncivil behavior and develop classroom policies that penalize students who use devices during class. However, when faculty do not honor the behaviors students use to learn, learning is decreased. If higher education is going to meet the needs of today's students, faculty must expand their understanding of what learning looks like in ways that are more inclusive and provide more accessibility to a range of learners. However, many faculty members were not prepared by their graduate programs to teach adult students, and there is a lack of expectation that continuous professional development related to teaching be part of a faculty members' responsibility.",

The days of students going to school full-time, living on campus, and learning in environments separated from other communities and other cultural norms are not the experience of most students today. Today's students are parents, work full time, manage others in their workplaces, and interact with a variety of different communities where they are often engaging with adults as equals or even as leaders. Coming to campus and being in the classroom requires them to switch both cultural codes and status roles. Clark (2008a) stresses the relationship between civility and norms of mutual respect, yet it is clear that not all students know the codes of higher education as faculty perceive them. Students who do not understand the context of higher education may question why professors are entitled to be listened to just because they have a degree. Alt and Itzkovich (2019) argue that breaking down power relations and fostering more shared authority in the classroom may lead to increased civility in learning environments, but the results of this study point to a more fundamental need to communicate about and codify norms to bridge the differences in perception of incivility across faculty and students in higher education. This communication should be granular and involve developing a shared taxonomy that describes the detailed elements of civility and incivility.",

All participants rank the creation of a code of civil conduct, role-modeling professionalism and civility, and taking personal responsibility and standing accountable for actions as the top strategies for addressing incivility. Collating these three solutions into a meaningful intervention has the opportunity to strengthen the likelihood of successful implementation due to a shared agreement between faculty and students. Any successful interventions require both groups to set aside feelings of superiority and entitlement and engage in a new dance (Clark, 2008a) . Faculty have an opportunity to socialize students to their professional role identities using civility as a framework if they are willing to reflect on their behaviors as a first step in the dance. Civil faculty have the best opportunity to function as role models for students. During the role modeling process, faculty can bridge students' understanding of how civil behavior aligns with professional role expectations (Luparell & Frisbee, 2019) . These relational bridges create a gateway to crafting a shared taxonomy for civil behavior that can guide both groups in the educational setting and into professional roles.",
