In this paper, we describe a multicentre, retrospective, observational study to describe the course of SARS-CoV-2 disease in patients treated with ImmunoFormulation (IF), an add-on therapy developed to decrease duration of clinical symptoms. In parallel, a group of patients that did not receive IF was used for comparison (using standard of care treatment). A total of 39 patients were evaluated. Throughout the observational period, 90% of patients recovered in the IF cohort and 47.4% in the Control cohort (p=0.0057). From the symptoms with statistically significant differences, the duration of symptoms (i.e., the time to recover from it) was shorter in the IF cohort than in control cohort (in days, average), especially for fever (2.25 x 21.78), dry cough (4.38 x 24.00), dyspnoea (3.67 x 20.00), headache (2.00 x 26.50), diarrhoea (5.25 x 25.25), and weakness (1.92 x 23.30). This demonstrates a potential promising role of IF as adjuvant therapy on the evolution of symptomatology to COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "When it comes to the pathological mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2, it is now clear the major involvement of the immune system with consequent (hyper)inflammatory effects. In fact, some authors consider that the disease presents itself in three stages: (I) Mild (early infection, viremia phase), (II) Moderate (Pulmonary Involvement with and without Hypoxia; pneumonia phase, inflammation in the lung), and (III) Severe (Systemic Hyperinflammation) or Recovery phase. 1 In general, the three main findings common to all phases are lymphopenia (T-cell and, more specifically, CD8 + T cells), imbalance between Th1 and Th2 responses (leading to cytokine storm and inflammasome activation), and decreased circulating eosinophil numbers. 2 CD8 + lymphopenia (with raised C-reactive protein, D-dimer and ferritin) has been linked to the severe progression of the disease, 3, 4 and it is shown to be reversible after patient recovery, notably for mild cases 5 . When we consider previously known coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, it is also understood that T cell immunity can play a decisive role in recovery and longterm protection of patients. 6 In addition, it seems that T cell-mediated immune response is paramount for a good prognosis, as antibody responses in coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1) are short-lived and can even aggravate lung pathology. [6] [7] [8] This reduction in T cells subsets are also reported to be followed by an exhaustion of effector T cells, which contributes to the defective immune response against the virus. 9, 10 The dysfunctional immune response related to the reduced functional diversity of T cells in peripheral blood is also a key parameter to predict severity, as ICU/Stage III patients tend to show a more marked Th2 profile. 3, 11 This triggers a cytokine storm which, in turn, leads to inflammatory cell infiltration and consequent secretion of proteases and reactive oxygen species (oxidative stress), which altogether contribute to the lung damage and COVID-19 severity. [12] [13] [14] This raise in inflammatory cytokines can be observed in peripheral blood 15 , as well as a reduced level of IFN-\u03b3, 3 which is currently linked to a faster resolution of the infection. 16 This knowledge brings up the concept of three points of action for improvement of symptomatology and faster recovery: regulation of the immune system, decrease of hyperinflammation and decrease of oxidative stress. Some treatments target on those have been already described and tested, but we focus here on a blend of ingredients that were first described by Ferreira et al. 17 and with positive responses in isolated patients. 18 This blend (further referred to as ImunoFormulation, IF) can potentially play a role in the prevention and/or support treatment of the symptomatology associated with COVID-19. The IF consist of: transfer factors (oligo-and polypeptides from porcine spleen, ultrafiltered at <10 kDa -Imuno TF \u00ae ) 100 mg, 800 mg anti-inflammatory natural blend (Uncaria tomentosa, Endopleura uchi and Haematoccocus pluvialis -Miodesin TM ), 60 mg zinc orotate, 48 mg selenium yeast (equivalent to 96 \u03bc g of Se), 20,000 IU cholecalciferol, 300 mg ascorbic acid, 480 mg ferulic acid, 90 mg resveratrol, 800 mg spirulina, 560 mg N-acetylcysteine, 610 mg glucosamine sulphate potassium chloride, and 400 mg maltodextrin-stabilized orthosilicic acid (equivalent to 6 mg of Si -SiliciuMax \u00ae ). The quantities correspond to the daily intake of the IF, which can be split into 3 doses, taken every 8 hours.",

For example, for severe cases, the symptoms can last for more than 28 days, leading to hyperinflammation/hypercoagulation responses and pulmonary fibrosis formation. 27 The improvement in the time needed for recovery of the symptoms in the IF cohort can be related to the multiple mechanisms that the components of the IF theoretically acts on as described earlier by Ferreira et al. 17 We will highlight four. First, immune system regulation. This can be related to macrophage activation by Imuno TF \u00ae28,29 and spirulina, 30, 31 to development of neutrophils by Spirulina and Zinc, 32 to activation of NK-cells by Imuno TF \u00ae , Spirulina, Zinc, Vitamin C, and Resveratrol, 31, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] to the increase in T-cells functions by Spirulina, Vitamin C and Vitamin D 3, 32, [39] [40] [41] and to CD4 + cells activation by Imuno TF \u00ae and Selenium, which can regulate the antigenic stimulus triggering CD4 + Th1 cells to produce IFN-\u07db, IL-1 and TNF-\u07d9. 28, 29, 32, [42] [43] [44] In addition, Imuno TF \u00ae positively regulates Th1 cytokines, while decreases the release of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13). 45 This is relevant once there is evidence that the Th2 overresponse are linked to bronchoconstriction, dyspnea and exacerbations of allergic airways diseases. 46 Secondly, targeting the virus itself by: (i) avoiding the virus to enter the cell: N-acetylcysteine and Resveratrol have shown DPP4R inhibitory effect, and Resveratrol also showed potential to block the binding of ACE2 at the molecular level; 47, 48 and (ii) decreasing virus replication: studies have shown that high concentration of intracellular Zinc inhibited the replication of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and other RNA viruses, through inhibition of RNA polymerase. 49 Resveratrol can act synergistically with Zinc, as it has been shown to increase the intracellular entrance of Zinc. 50 In addition, N-acetylcysteine, Selenium, and Glucosamine might be expected to help to prevent and control RNA virus infections because they amplify the signalling functions of TLR7 and mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) in type 1 IFN production. 51 Recently, U.",

[57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] Indeed, a negative correlation between vitamin D 3 serum levels and the number of cases of COVID-19, and also the number of deaths, has been observed. [63] [64] [65] Vitamin C, can increase lymphocyte B and T proliferation and differentiation at a controlled rate. 40, 66, 67 Resveratrol and Ferulic acid can inhibit the TLR4 signalling pathway, which provides potential protection against tissue damage (including lung) coming from excessive inflammatory response. 51 Among the potential pharmacological effects of Ferulic acid figures the decrease of the serological concentration of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, the suppression in TLR4 expression and the reduced activation of MAPK and NF-\u03baB. 68, 69 Another ingredient, Miodesin TM , was shown recently to decrease inflammation through inhibition of the release of cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5) and the expression of NF-\u03ba\u0392, inflammatory enzymes (COX-1, COX-2, PLA2, iNOS), and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5). 70 Finally, the add-on treatment provided was idealized to also act on the oxidative stress. Phase 2 inductive nutraceuticals as Ferulic acid and Resveratrol induce various peroxidase enzymes (enzymes that neutralize hydrogen peroxidase, a reactive oxygen species) and promote synthesis of glutathione. Glutathione production can also be promoted by administration of N-acetylcysteine.",

Overall, the reduction in time for the resolution of the symptoms indicate a possible positive effect for IF as an add-on therapy for COVID-19. Robust studies showing the time for recovery of symptoms are still lacking, as most of them focus on the time for symptom onset and in the rate of recovery/complications. The time from exposure to symptom onset is usually reported as is in average 11.5 days, and the time between symptom onset and hospital admission about 7 days. 20,21 Usually the first symptoms (Stage I: fever, dry cough, headache, diarrhoea) appear between 0 to 4 days; the Stage II symptoms (hypoxia) in 5-13 days; and Stage III symptoms (ARDS, cardiac failure, shock) after 14 days of infection. 1 This is in concordance with what was found by Wang et al, a median 5 days (range 2-8 days) for the progression from mild-moderate cases to severe condition, and a hospital stay range from 14 to 22days.22",
