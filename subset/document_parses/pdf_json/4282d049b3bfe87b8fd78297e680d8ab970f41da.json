Although synthetic radiosensitizers are pragmatic solution to enhance tumor sensitivity, they pose concerns of toxicity and non-specificity. In the last decades, scientists scrutinized novel plant-derived radiosensitizers and chemosensitizers, such as flavones, owing to their substantial physiological effects like low toxicity and non-mutagenic properties on the human cells. The combination therapy with apigenin is potential candidate in cancer therapeutics.

Combinatorial therapy may be applied to cancer cell cultures, animal xenograft models, or clinical trials in cancer patients. In Biosystems, the combination of two drugs may exhibit synergistic, antagonistic, or additive effects compared to their properties in monotherapy.

Since chemoresistance is one of the main hindrances in cancer therapy, we aimed to describe a natural bioflavonoid as apigenin, based on its chemosensitizing effect. Many tumors are initially chemo drug responsive but eventually develop drug resistance. Apigenin is reported to be useful in combination therapies along with its role as a chemosensitizer on chemo drugs. Table 1 abridges the combination of apigenin with several chemo drugs. Apigenin can make tumor cells vulnerable to chemotherapeutic agents, so conventional chemo drugs can be amalgamated with flavonoids, giving a new direction to chemotherapy. We comprehensively presented nearly all important research findings on apigenin as an important co-treatment drug in cancer therapy. Nevertheless, we lack data for clinical trials of apigenin in combinatorial therapy and its significance as chemoprotective and chemosensitizing agent. We strongly recommend perform further studies on this subject.",

It is a trihydroxyflavone that has hydroxyl groups at positions 4' , 5, and 7 [9] . Apigenin mostly occurs as a glycoside found in many fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants, and occasionally in as aglycone. Various factors, such as environmental growth condition, genetics, and developmental stage etc., determine the form of apigenin glycoside present in plants [10] . Some of the naturally occurring apigenin glycosides include apigenin 7-glucoside (apigetrin), apigenin 8-C-glucoside (vitexin), apigenin 6-C-glucoside (isovitexin), apigenin 7-O-apioglucoside (apiin), apigenin 7-O-neohesperidoside (Rhoifolin), apigenin 6-C-glucoside 8-C-arabinoside (Schaftoside), 4'-methoxy 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (Acacetin), and 4' ,5-Dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (Genkwanin) [11] . Moreover, in some plants, apigenin dimer is also found e.g. Amentoflavone (3\u2032, 8\u2032\u2032-biapigenin) with pharmacological activities found in Hypericum perforatum L. [12, 13] , and Ginkgo biloba L. [14] . Chemical structures of various forms of apigenin are represented in Fig. 1 . Apigenin aglycone or its conjugated forms exist in dietary plants (such as fresh parsley, celery seed, dried oregano, and cilantro) and medicinal herbs. Dried parsley and Chamomile tea have a particularly high amount of apigenin among vegetables or herbs [15] . The amount of apigenin as a flavonoid in the daily diet (mg/100 g of edible portion) may vary in different fruits and vegetables. It has been stated that fresh parsley and salary contain 215.46 mg/100 g FW and 24.02 mg/100 g of apigenin respectively. Apigenin also occurs in spices from the family Lamiaceae such as thyme, oregano, mint, rosemary, and sage [16] . C-glycosides is reported as a dietary supplement in algae [17] .",

            "text": "Generally, the C2-C3 double bond in flavonoids structure, including apigenin, is allied to the anti-cancer activity by inhibiting membrane efflux transporters in resistant breast cancer cells [23, 24] . The presence of the OH group in C-5 along with the O-CH3 group in C-3 is attributed to inhibitory activity against cancer resistance protein [25] . Furthermore, the study of a theoretical model of anti-cancer properties of flavonoids suggests that the 5,7-dimethoxy flavonoids are the most potent anti-cancer agents than others [26] . Substitutions of p-hydroxyl, 3, 5\u2032-dimethoxy, 5\u2032-amino, and 2\u2032-chloro [130] at ring B of flavone are vital for anti-cancer activity via various mechanisms. Besides, substituted aliphatic/aromatic amino groups on C-6/C-8, on ring A hydroxyl and chloro groups at C-5 and C-6, respectively, and 3-methoxy on ring C are significant for the anti-cancer effect [27] . Alkyl amine moieties also escalate the anti-cancer activity of apigenin derivatives by enhancing their lipophilicity. Alkyl amine moieties linked to the apigenin ring system at C-7 impede proliferation in A549, HeLa, HepG2, and MCF-7 cancer cell lines [28] . Protoflavones; derived from apigenin with non-aromatic B-ring and OH group at C-1\u2032, are potent anti-cancer agents in vitro and in vivo that prevent multidrug resistance by evading P-glycoprotein both [29] . Moreover, the synthesized triazolyl analogs of apigenin have been considered to induce apoptosis in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. Particularly, 1, 2, 3-triazole analogs synthesized from apigenin-7-methyl ether possess stability against acidic/basic hydrolysis and facilitate the interaction with membrane proteins [30] .",

However, evaluation of the acute toxicity of apigenin resulted in no mortality or signs of toxicity in mice/rats at oral doses up to 5000 mg/ kg [32] . Moreover, in vitro evaluation of carcinogenicity proved that apigenin has no toxic or mutagenic effects [33, 34] . Intriguingly, after 30 min treatment in vitro, the hemolytic activity of apigenin was reported to be lower than the acceptable limit of 5% signifying its potential safety in intravenous dosages [35] . Apigenin glycosides in dietary sources have not been reported to have any toxic effects, however, consumption in high doses or prolonged usage as dietary or pharmaceutical supplements must be considered. In male Swiss mice, apigenin stimulates oxidative stress followed by liver damage at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg, when administered intra-peritoneal as a single dose [36] . Correspondingly, in an in vitro study, the treatment of a normal trout liver cell line with apigenin for 24 h caused hydroxylation that might hamper the cell growth at 25 \u03bcM concentration [37] .",

            "text": "Pharmacokinetics determines the amount of consumed apigenin available to the human gut microbiota. The metabolism and conjugation of apigenin occurs in the gastrointestinal tract before entering into the systemic circulation. As a dietary flavonoid, the absorption and excretion of apigenin were investigated clinically by ingesting a bolus of 2 g parsley (containing 65.8 \u00b1 15.5 \u00b5mol apigenin) in healthy subjects. Analysis of urine, plasma, and RBCs revealed that the concentration of apigenin in the blood of all participants first increased; after a bolus ingestion, and then decreased in 28 h below the detection limit. The concentration of apigenin in 24-h urine samples was 0.22% of the ingested dose [38] . In another clinical study regarding ingestion of parsley (3.73-4.49 mg apigenin/MJ), 0.58% of the apigenin was excreted in the urine [39] . Apigenin metabolism by gut microbiota can be detected in feces after oral ingestion. Oral administration of radiolabeled apigenin in rats was traced, where 51% retrieved in urine and 12% in feces during 10 days. It was specified that apigenin could be bioaccumulated due to its slow metabolism and elimination [40] . Apigenin, in its aglycone form, is quickly absorbed in the duodenum apart from its dietary consumption in a perfused rat intestinal model [41] . Similarly, apigenin glycosides are absorbed as it is from the stomach to the large intestine and deglycosylated in the cecum [42] . Oral administration of apigenin leads to low concentration in blood [43] . Furthermore, intravenous administration of the same amount of apigenin and its glycosides renders a higher concentration of apigenin in blood than its glycosides. The metabolism of absorbed apigenin in rat liver follows Phase I in the presence of NADPH, cytochrome P450, and enzymes like flavin-containing monooxygenase [44] . In both humans and rats, during phase II, apigenin mainly undergoes glucuronidation and sulfation [45] . Luteolin, such as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates are the main blood metabolites of apigenin [40] . Further glucuronidation of apigenin also occurs in the intestine [45] .",

            "text": "In 2009, Choi and Kim [47] investigated the effects of 5-FU in combination with apigenin on cell proliferation and apoptosis in human breast cancer. For this purpose, they selected the MDA-MB-453 cell line with overexpression of erythroblastic oncogene B-2 (ErbB-2, also as known human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 or HER-2/neu) compared to the other human breast cancer cell lines. The result turned out with a synergistic effect between the two compounds, when the cells were exposed to 5-FU and apigenin at 90 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM concentrations, respectively. This co-therapy led to a significant reduction in ErbB2 and protein kinase B (AKT) expression and AKT phosphorylation as compared to monotherapy [47] . Increased resistance to 5-FU in monotherapy has been attributed to the overexpression of ErbB2 in human breast cancer cells. Apigenin is reported to induce apoptosis by down-regulating the ErbB-2 expression [48] . Treatment by 5-FU alone could not affect the expression of ErbB-2 in MDA-MB-453 cells, while its co-administration with apigenin notably decreased the expression of ErbB2. Additionally, this combinatorial therapy significantly induced the apoptosis in the treated cells (up to 50%) compared with the induced apoptosis with 5-FU alone. It was shown that the combination of 5-FU and apigenin exerted apoptosis induction by the reduction in AKT expression and AKT phosphorylation [47] . Several studies demonstrated that anti-cancer effects of the apigenin were related to inhibition of the AKT pathway [49, 50] . Choi and Kim [47] presented that co-treatment with 5-FU and apigenin diminished AKT expression and phosphorylation in human MDA-MB-453 cells which could be an important mechanism of this combination therapy. Moreover, caspase-3; a major death protease catalyzing the cleavage of several key cellular proteins, was considered as an apoptosis biomarker in this study. According to the results, co-administration of 5-FU and apigenin exhibited an anti-cancer activity by reducing cell proliferation and stimulating apoptosis and the authors attributed this finding to the significant increase in the caspase-3 expression in the breast cancer cell line. Finally, the authors suggested that the obtained results could be encouraging for the clinical trials of cotreatment of 5-FU and apigenin in human breast cancers to curtail the limitations of 5-FU.",

In this study, it was proved that the cytotoxicity of 5-FU to HNSCC SCC25 cell line was enhanced by apigenin. To determine the effects of apigenin co-treatment with 5-FU, SCC25 cells were treated for 72 h with 5 \u03bcM apigenin and 2.5-200 \u03bcM 5-FU alone. In monotherapy, apigenin and 5-FU reduced the cell viability by approximately 20% and 0.8-74.3%, respectively. The co-administration of apigenin (5 \u03bcM) and 5-FU (10, 20, 50, and 100 \u03bcM) in SCC25 cells for 72 h increased the cytotoxicity of 5-FU in a dose-dependent manner, particularly when 5 \u03bcM apigenin was applied in the combination with 20 \u03bcM 5-FU. Consequently, apigenin alone up-regulated both TNF-R and TRAILR, down-regulated B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), activated caspase-3, and induced apoptosis in the SCC25 cell line. The synergistic effects of apigenin and 5-FU on the SCC25 cell line have been ascribed to the difference between their underlying intracellular pathways alone and that of their combination therapy [51] . Although, the authors suggested that this co-treatment could be an effective novel strategy against HNSCC, they did not ponder the molecular mechanism of its action.",

For this purpose, they used SK-Hep-1 and BEL-7402 cell lines and an animal HCC xenograft model. The growth of SK-Hep-1 and BEL-7402 cells was significantly reduced by apigenin or 5-FU in a dose-dependent manner. The simultaneous treatment of 4 \u00b5mol/L apigenin significantly increased the cytotoxicity of 5-FU in 100 \u00b5g/ml concentration in both HCC cells lines compared with apigenin or 5-FU alone. In the HCC xenograft animal model, co-administration of apigenin (20 mg/kg, five times/week for 3 weeks) and 5-FU (20 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days) notably impeded the growth of the xenograft tumors. This Combinatorial treatment enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequently decreased the potential of the mitochondrial membrane (D\u03a8m) in HCC cells. The ROS production in cells co-treated with apigenin and 5-FU was greater than in the cells treated with 5-FU alone and there was no significant difference in D\u03a8m between the control and apigenin-treated cells. On the other hand, co-incubation of the cells in apigenin and 5-FU induced the apoptosis signaling pathways, by down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, diminishment of D\u03a8m, and upregulation of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). According to these results, apigenin may enhance the sensitivity of liver cancer cells to 5-FU by the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathways. So, the authors concluded that apigenin could be a potential chemosensitizer for 5-FU and utilized as a novel co-therapies in liver cancer treatments [53] .",

[54] considered solid Ehrlich carcinoma (SEC), a murine undifferentiated malignancy that is mammary in origin. In this study, 80 SEC mice were divided into 4 equal groups including: 1) SEC control group, 2) SEC treated by 5-FU, 3) SEC treated by apigenin, and 4) SEC treated by 5-FU plus apigenin. The co-administration of 5-FU and apigenin improved the survival rate in the groups receiving combination therapy as compared to the groups treated with 5-FU or apigenin alone [54] . Beclin-1 is another protein that regulates the autophagy [55] and its down-regulation has been observed in breast cancer [56] . In this study, Gaballah et al. [54] proposed that the co-administration of 5-FU and apigenin markedly increased Beclin-1 protein levels in SEC compared to 5-FU or apigenin treated groups. These findings could be helpful to reduce chemoresistance of SEC cells to 5-FU by induction of the cell autophagy. The activation of JNK can induce Bcl-2 phosphorylation, resulting in the release of Beclin-1and autophagy [57] . In general, these results revealed a pivotal role of JNK in apigenin-induced autophagy and apoptosis. The activation of the Mcl-1; an inhibitor of apoptosis pathways, may trigger carcinogenesis and develop chemo drug resistance in cancer cells [58] . In Gaballah's study, the down-regulation of Mcl-1 has been attributed to apigenin induced AKT. Overall, in this study the authors provided evidence that apigenin can sensitize SEC models to 5-FU cytotoxicity and offer new insights for targeted cancer therapy.",

It has been reported that CST6 down-regulation was observed in metastatic primary cancer cells and loss of its function has a vital role in the progression of various types of cancers including breast cancer, glioma, and lung cancer [65] . Therefore, it seems rational that an increase in CST6 expression may be effective in cancer prevention, however in the study carried out by Boeckx et al. [63] , its reduction was intensified by co-treatment with cetuximab and apigenin. Hence, such paradoxical findings are seemingly inadequate for cetuximab-apigenin co-therapy and more similar studies are required to clarify the exact cell signaling pathway. FOSL1 is a leucine zipper transcription factor that is involved in the formation of the AP-1 transcription factor complex [66] . In a study performed in 2016 [67] (after Boeckx's study), the role of FOSL1 in HNSCC cells growth and resistance to the chemotherapy was highlighted. The silencing of the FOSL1 gene in HNSCC cells (FaDu cell line) resulted in inhibition of the cell growth and migration in HNSCC cells [67] . On the other hand, there is strong evidence supporting the role of PLAU in HNSCC. Overexpression of PLAU and its receptor induces tumor cells migration, invasion and consequently metastasis [68] . VIM is over-expressed when cancer cells undergo the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and it plays a key role in the invasive behavior of tumor cells [69] . Therefore, the down-regulation of FOSL1, PLAU, and VIM by the co-administration of cetuximab and apigenin may be considered as an innovative therapeutic strategy in the treatment and prevention of HNSCC in the future.",

According to the obtained results, simultaneous administration of apigenin and cetuximab decreased the viability and growth of HONE1 and CNE2 cells more than when apigenin or cetuximab was used alone. Apigenin also improved the percentage of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest when it was used in combination with cetuximab. Besides, apigenin amplified the inhibitory effects of cetuximab on the EGFR signaling pathway. The expression of down-stream proteins of the EGFR pathway including p-EGFR, p-AKT, p-STAT3 and Cyclin D1 was suppressed in apigenin and cetuximab groups compared to the control groups or when apigenin or cetuximab was used alone in both HONE1 and CNE2 cells. In the NPC nude mice simultaneously treated with apigenin and cetuximab, the tumor size surprisingly reduced compared to the control group and those treated with apigenin or cetuximab alone [70] . EGFR; as a signal transducer, has imperative regulatory roles in different cellular events such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival and is over-expressed approximately in 80% of NPCs [71] . It has been stated that the overexpression of EGFR is associated with resistance to chemotherapy, poor prognosis, and a more aggressive phenotype of cancers [72] . Therefore, it seems that targeting EGFR signaling pathway by cetuximab and amplification of its anti-tumor activity by apigenin may be considered as a potential treatment for NPC.",

            "text": "The nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin is associated with ROS production and p53 activation [76] . It has also been demonstrated that apigenin selectively affects apoptosis induction and cell growth inhibition in cancerous cells without influencing normal cells [77] . In this regard, Ju et al. [78] examined the effects of combination therapy on the complications posed by cisplatin in human renal proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells. Pretreated HK-2 cells with different concentrations of apigenin (5-20 \u03bcM) were treated with 40 \u03bcM cisplatin for 12 and 24 h. They found that induced apoptosis by cisplatin in HK-2 cells was suppressed by apigenin. Apigenin also reduced: (1) the cisplatin-induced caspase-3 activity, (2) the cleavage of caspase-3 substrate (PARP), and (3) the cisplatin-induced phosphorylation and expression of p53 in HK-2 cells. The results of this study indicated that apigenin could render chemoprotection against cisplatin on HK-2 cells by inducing PI3K/AKT pathway. To investigate the cisplatin-sensitizing effects of apigenin in a p53-dependent manner, Liu et al. [79] co-treated different human cancer cell lines with apigenin and cisplatin. Apigenin co-administration with cisplatin, enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis via the up-regulation of p53, decreased cell proliferation, increased MAPK, and proapoptotic proteins activation. According to the obtained results from two aforementioned studies [78, 79] , apigenin chemoprotects and chemosensitizes by inactivation of p53, however this remarkable molecular behavior of apigenin in normal and cancerous cells require more investigations. In the other study [80] chemoprotective effect of apigenin against cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction was investigated in vivo. The male BALB/c mice were divided into six groups including the cisplatin group (20 mg/kg), cisplatin plus apigenin group (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg), and apigenin group (20 mg/kg). According to the results, pre-administration of apigenin markedly reduced renal destruction owing to the dramatic reduction in the levels of serum creatinine, BUN, GSH-PX, and SOD compared to the cisplatin-treated group. The levels of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and TGF-\u03b2 were decreased in the group which was simultaneously treated by cisplatin and apigenin compared with the cisplatin-treated group in the renal samples. In addition, apigenin caused suppression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), phosphorylated necrosis factor kappa B (p-NF-\u03baB p65), and p-p38 MAPK in cisplatin-induced kidney damage. CYP2E1 actively produces ROS [81] and increases cisplatin-induced oxidative stress in the kidney. NF-\u03baB, as a pro-inflammatory transcription factor, is inhibited by the inhibitory I\u03baB protein in the cell cytoplasm. External stimuli like viruses or bacteria cause the ubiquitination of I\u03baB and NF-\u03baB release. Then, NF-\u03baB enters the nucleus followed by transcription of target genes, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and TGF\u03b2 to promote inflammatory responses. These proteins play a key role in the nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin. These results demonstrated that the pretreatment of mice by apigenin dramatically reduced cisplatin-induced kidney dysfunction and renal injury due to its anti-oxidant and antiinflammatory properties [80] . Figure 2 summarizes the chemoprotective effects of apigenin. In a similar study, the molecular mechanism of reno-protective effects of apigenin were investigated in vivo on 8 groups of adult female Wistar Albino mice. According to the results, apigenin strikingly reduced blood BUN, serum creatinine, caspase-3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6. Moreover, histopathological cisplatin-induced kidney injury was improved by apigenin administration. It seems that apigenin being an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory substance might possess nephron-protective effects [82] .",

Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1); a hypoxic marker, has a key role in malignant glucose metabolism. Fig. 2 Chemoprotective effects of apigenin. Part. 1, a mouse was administrated with cisplatin. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms of renal injury by cisplatin, followed by treatment, kidney cells were extracted and molecular analysis were performed. Cisplatin causes nephrotoxicity by oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and necrosis. Cisplatin enters into the renal cells by OCT-2 and over-activates CYP2E1 as an active producer of ROS in mitochondria and triggers ROS production which in turn leads to oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, different cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2) production, MAPK pathway activation and cell death. CYP2E1 plays a pivotal role in the promotion of oxidative stress in the kidney and increases cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. The produced ROSs by CYP2E1 can activate NF-\u03baB and MAPK. NF-\u03baB is a pro-inflammatory transcription factor and regulates the expression of different inflammatory factors. NF-\u03baB is separated in the cell cytosol by binding to an inhibitory protein, I\u03baB. Whenever, NF-\u03baB is stimulated by stimuli such as viral, bacterial or other pathogens, a proteasome ubiquitinates and degrades I\u03baB and releases NF-\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus it triggers the expression of target genes, like TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and TGF\u03b2 which play important roles in cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Part 2, a pre-treated mouse by apigenin, was treated with cisplatin. The molecular analysis of the renal cells demonstrates that pre-treatment by apigenin significantly reduced cisplatin-induced renal injury by anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Apigenin significantly suppressed the cisplatin-induced increase in the CYP2E1 levels in the mouse. Subsequently, it inhibited the renal oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and TGF\u03b2 from the kidney tissue of cisplatin-treated mouse. Apigenin protected kidney cells against DNA damage (apoptosis) after cisplatin administration. It also significantly decreased the activities of NF-\u03baB p65 and p38MAPK that were increased by cisplatin. (Inhibition Activation )",

[84] supposed that GLUT-1 over-expression and AKT hyperphosphorylation could be associated with the resistance of laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells to cisplatin. Afterwards, they investigated the apigenin chemosensitizing effects on cisplatin considering the levels of GLUT-1 and p-AKT in Hep-2 cells. The results suggested that apigenin could significantly increase the cisplatin-induced inhibition of Hep-2 cells growth and reduce the expression of GLUT-1 mRNA, GLUT-1, and p-AKT proteins in Hep-2 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner during the co-administration with cisplatin. Conclusively, the over-expression of GLUT-1 and hyper-phosphorylation of AKT may be associated with the insensibility of laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells to cisplatin. Therefore, apigenin could decrease the resistance to cisplatin by the suppression of GLUT-1 and p-AKT expression [84] .",

The combination of apigenin and cisplatin markedly induced apoptosis and down-regulated cyclin D, cyclin B, and cyclin E compared to the cells treated by each agent alone. The astounding chemosensitizing effect of apigenin on SKOV3/DDP cells made them vulnerable to cisplatin even more than SKOV3 cells. Moreover, apigenin induced the caspase-3 (as an apoptosis inducer) cleavage and decreased Bcl-2 (as an anti-apoptotic factor) in both cell types. Apigenin significantly reduced Mcl-1, (which belongs to an anti-apoptotic proteins family (Bcl-2 family) and plays an important role in the apoptosis inhibition) at mRNA and protein level, both in SKOV3 and SKOV3/DDP cell lines [87, 88] .

Prolonged treatment with doxorubicin in gastric cancer patients results in the development of drug resistance and tumor regression [93] . In 2011, the mutagenic and anti-genotoxic effects of apigenin and DOX were studied in vitro (400 \u00b5g/plate of apigenin + 0.2 \u00b5g/plate of DOX) and in vivo (100 mg/kg Fig. 3 The schematic apoptosis and autophagy induction by apigenin when it is simultaneously used with a chemo drug. Two dimers of the RTK phosphorylate together in multiple tyrosine sites within the RTK intracellular domain which mediate different downstream signaling cascades such as PI3K/AKT pathway. PI3K/AKT signaling is initiated through interaction between activated RTK and adaptor proteins. PI3K phosphorylates AKT protein and p-AKT triggers the activation of several proteins playing critical role in apoptosis. The over-activation of PI3K/AKT results in the over-expression of the anti-apoptic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, Bad and Mcl-1. These proteins inhibit the down-stream cascade of apoptosis and cause indefinite cell proliferation. Co-administration of apigenin and chemo drugs induces apoptosis by the inhibition of the anti-apoptic proteins. Autophagy is the other activated mechanism by apigenin-chemo drugs suggested in different studies. In autophagy, apigenin-chemo drugs increases JNK. It has been reported that activation of JNK can induce Bcl-2 phosphorylation, resulting in the release of Beclin-1and autophagy activation. Generally, these results revealed a fundamental role of JNK in apigenin-induced autophagy and apoptosis. Nrf2, a redox-sensitive transcription factor, regulates the expression of cytoprotective genes and protective cells against oxidative/electrophilic agents-induced damages. Nrf2 binds to the AREs in the promoters of various cytoprotective genes and regulates their expression. Nrf2 overexpression increases chemoresistance, therefore, its inhibition by apigenin plus chemo drugs sensitizes different cancer cells against chemo drugs. NF-\u03baB, is inhibited by the inhibitory I\u03baB protein in the cell cytoplasm. External stimuli causes to the ubiquitination of I\u03baB and NF-\u03baB release. Then, NF-\u03baB enters to the nucleus and starts the transcription of target genes, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and TGF\u03b2 to promote inflammatory responses. These proteins play critical roles in the nephrotoxicity which is induced by some of the chemo drugs such as cisplatin. Apigenin dramatically reduced chemo drugs-induced kidney dysfunction by anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibition of the NF-\u03baB-I\u03baB complex separation by p38 protein.",

As formerly mentioned, apigenin sensitized prostate [101] , uterine [103] , and breast [104] cancer cells to DOX by ABCB1 inhibition. Choi et al. investigated the effect of apigenin on the bioavailability of PTX in the animal model. After oral administration of rats by 40 mg/kg PTX plus 0.4 mg/ kg apigenin, they noticed distinct inhibition of ABCB1 activity compared to the group which was treated only by PTX. Apigenin also significantly increased the terminal half-life of PTX when it was used orally. Taken together, the improvement of oral bioavailability of PTX by apigenin might be due to enhanced intestinal absorption owing to ABCB1 inhibition by apigenin [114, 115] . Xu et al. showed that apigenin could sensitize different human cancer cells such as cervical epithelial carcinoma, lung epithelial carcinoma, and hepatocyte carcinoma cells to PTX through inducing apoptosis by suppressing SOD activity leading to accumulation of ROS and caspase-2 cleavage [116] .",

Nonetheless, nowadays TMX resistance has become an important clinical problem and the underlying mechanisms of this issue are not completely clarified yet [121] . To cope up with this challenge, some studies have scrutinized the chemosensitizing effects of apigenin to TMX on breast cancer cells and xenograft animal models. In 2003, Samuel et al., induced breast cancer in female albino Wistar rats and treated them with apigenin (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) and TMX (50 mg/kg). They found that apigenin at 100 and 200 mg/kg doses had a maximal effect in boosting the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx, and CAT) and suppressing VEGF expression compared to the TMX alone [122] . In another study, the combination of apigenin with TMX had synergistic, growth-inhibitory effects on breast cancer cells. Furthermore, apigenin dwindled ER-\u03b1, AIB1, and multiple protein kinases (p38, PKA, MAPK, and AKT) expressions. AIB1; the ER-\u03b1 co-activator, is often up-regulated in breast cancer, acts as an oncogene through transmitting kinase-mediating growth factor signaling to the ER-\u03b1, therefore, the inhibition of AIB-1 by simultaneous administration of apigenin and TMX could be effective for the treatment of TMX-resistance breast cancers [123] .",

In a study, TF1 cells (human erythroleukemic cell line) after treatment by apigenin, were exposed to vincristine. The results demonstrated a significant drop in the cytotoxic effect of vincristine compared to the control groups. To clarify the chemoprotective effects of apigenin against vincristine, apoptosis induction by the combinatorial treatment was analyzed. The number of apoptotic cells without any treatment, treatment with vincristine, and with apigenin were recorded as 10.7 \u00b1 0.007%, 33.6 \u00b1 1.4%, and 22.34 \u00b1 0.4%, respectively. Intriguingly, vincristine treatment of the apigeninpretreated cells showed 19.8 \u00b1 0.2% apoptotic cells, a significant reduction in the number of Annexin-Vpositive cells compared to vincristine treatment alone. Therefore, it is obvious that apigenin protects TF1 cells against vincristine-induced cell death.

[135] , demonstrated that metformin abridged pancreatic cancer cells (AsPC-1 cells) viability by increasing ROS levels. They presented that it had a minimal cytotoxic effect on human primary dermal fibroblasts (HFD) as normal cells. According to their findings, metformin dwindled ATP production in mitochondria of HDF cells, but it did not change ATP levels in AsPC-1 cancer cells. As a result of the reduction in ATP levels, AMPK, p-AMPK, FOXO3a, p-FOXO3a, and subsequently manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) levels were increased in HDF cells and an elevation in MnSOD levels reduced existing levels of ROS in normal cells, but not in cancer cells. Therefore, the increased levels of ROS in AsPc-1 cells was attributed to the MnSOD inactivation. Most chemo drugs induce ROS production and decrease ATP levels by binding with mitochondria and leading to mitochondrial damage. However, some agents such as metformin and apigenin make a mild leakage in the electron transport chain (ETC) without affecting cellular integrity and survival. Warkad et al. showed that normal fibroblasts viability was not affected after treatment with metformin (0.05 to 20 mM for 48 h) or apigenin (1 or 20 \u00b5M) alone, however, its combination with apigenin (0.05, 0.5 or 5 mM of metformin and 20 \u00b5M of apigenin) reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in HDF cells dramatically but did not affect cellular integrity and cell viability. They suggested that metformin and apigenin synergistically inhibited mitochondrial membrane potency and this effect was attributed to a notable increase in ROS levels in cancer cells. They assumed that the metformin-apigenin combination activated the ETC in mitochondria causing ROS production in cancer cells, which finally instigated irreversible DNA damage. This effect was not observed in the AsPC-1 cells treated by each drug alone. According to the findings, Warkad et al. concluded that cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by metformin-apigenin was cancer cell specific because they did not observe synergistic interaction between metformin and apigenin in HDF cells. In this study, an in vivo experiment on ASPC-1 xenograft demonstrated that the oral treatment with a lower amount of metformin (75 mg/kg) or apigenin (5 mg/kg) alone for 4 weeks did not affect the tumor size. However, concomitant administration of metformin and apigenin for 4 weeks synergistically reduced tumor volume. These results suggested that a combination of metformin and apigenin could be beneficial for examination in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer.",

These combinatorial strategies aim to overcome drug resistance and augment anti-cancer properties. According to recent researches, combinatorial therapy with natural compounds such as apigenin can upsurge the anti-tumor effects and alleviate the side effects of chemo drugs. In a nutshell, the synergistic effect of apigenin and various chemo drugs on different cancer types revealed that apigenin boosts the effect of above-mentioned chemo drugs on cancer cell lines and xenograft models. Furthermore, it lessens their toxicity and resistance by down-or up-regulating the molecules in respective cell signaling pathways. Therefore, it seems that apigenin could be a potent chemosensitizer for these drugs. Clinical studies in this regard are still in infancy and according to the reported information in the clinical trials.gov, just one study has been documented about the anti-tumor activity of apigenin (NCT00609310). So, the authentication of anti-tumor activity of apigenin and its final approval still awaits more clinical trials [136, 137] .

Drug-loaded and dual drug-loaded liposomes possess substantial cytotoxic effects on cell lines contrary to the free drugs. The results proved that the highest cell cycle arrest and apoptosis activation was induced by dual drug-loaded liposomes. The cell signaling investigations indicated that the treatment by dual drug liposomes resulted in a significant up-regulation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [138] . The Warburg effect states that in varied oxygen conditions, cancer cells can increase their survival and thus cause to tumor aggressiveness. AMPK is a negative regulator of the Warburg effect maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. Therefore, the activation of AMPK could reverse the Warburg effect and cause ATP depletioninduced apoptosis [139, 140] . Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was significantly suppressed by dual drug liposome-activated AMPK in examined cancer cell lines. Moreover, a noteworthy reduction was also observed in hypoxiainducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) expression as a result of the synergistic activation of AMPK by dual drug loaded liposome treatment. HIF-1\u03b1, is a transcription factor that regulates different genes in critical events in cancer development, including angiogenesis, cell survival, glucose metabolism, and invasion. In human cancers, intra tumoral hypoxia causes overexpression of HIF-1\u03b1. Owing to the overexpression of COX-2 and HIF-1\u03b1 in human cancers, their inhibition is considered to be the effective therapeutic strategy to target the angiogenesis and cell proliferation. Furthermore, ROS production was intensified by the dual drug-loaded liposomes in CRC cell lines. The designed nanocarriers were also tested on mice tumor xenograft model. Like the in vitro study, dual drug-loaded liposomes had greater anti-neoplastic and anti-tumorigenic effects [138, 141] .",

They observed a significant reduction in cell survival during combined treatment of Cal27 and LICR-HN1 cell lines compared to the drugs monotherapy.
