The present study aimed to investigate the associated risk of T2D with obesity risk alleles of fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) and melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) genes. Methods: The study includes 400 subjects (300 T2D diabetic cases and 100 healthy controls). Genetic analysis was done by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. Results: The findings of the study show no significant increase in odds of diabetes associated with the prevalence of FTO and MC4R minor alleles. Rare allele frequencies for ''A'' of FTO rs9939609 were 0.34 and 0.30 in cases and controls, respectively. Rare allele frequencies for A of MC4R rs12970134 were found to be more common in controls (0.45) than cases (0.41), but the difference was insignificant (p 0.246); however, an increase in body weight with the presence of allele ''A'' of the FTO gene (p value \\ 0.001) was found, indicating indirect involvement in the development of T2D. In addition, these were also correlated with the demographic/lifestyle and clinico-pathological parameters between T2D cases and controls. We found that T2D patients with a history of smoking and high consumption of alcohol, fast foods and sweetened beverages are at high risk of T2D compared to healthy controls (p \\ 0.01*).

In the last decade, advances in SNP genotyping technologies have facilitated genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to determine various risk loci/SNPs associated with increased risk of obesity and T2D [12] . The FTO and MC4R genes are known to play a pivotal central role in energy regulation and appetite, leading to better management of obesity [13, 14] . The FTO and MC4R genes are located on chromosomes 16q12.2 and 18q21.3, respectively, which uphold cell physiology by maintaining different biochemical features in the body. The important obesity-associated risk alleles (ORAs) FTO rs9939609A and MC4R rs12970134A are often studied in different ethnic groups and populations across the globe. These are linked to a greater risk of obesity, higher body mass index (BMI) and T2D in the UK [15] [16] [17] [18] , Asia [16, 19, 20] , Palestine [21] , Iran [22] , Italy [23] , Japan [24] and Arabic countries [25] .

Frayling et al. [13] were the first to observe the role of the FTO SNP rs9939609 on the upsurge in BMI and the result was successfully replicated in many populations [28] [29] [30] [31] . In the present study we also did not find significant obesity-associated risk for allele ''A'' of FTO. MC4R rs12970134 SNP did not show any significant association, but minor allele ''A'' of Our findings agreed with the previous studies as the two genders had differences in free fatty acid metabolism, contributing to the accumulation of visceral adipose tissue [32] . A study conducted by Aline et al. [32] reported that T2D was associated with female carriers of the risk allele for the MC4R gene. Some similar studies showed an association of the FTO and MC4R risk alleles with type 2 diabetes [13, 17, 20] . The findings of the few other studies reporting the contribution of these studied polymorphisms in FTO and MC4R genes to type 2 diabetes mellitus were controversial, probably because of the ethnic and lifestyle differences among populations [33] . Furthermore, one of the studies based on the ethnic Chinese Han population with a sample size of 2351 did not show any association of FTO rs9939609 and MC4R rs17782313 SNPs with the development of T2D. However, the risk alleles were reported to be associated with an increase in obesity [34] . Nonetheless, the present study did not show any significant association of T2D with the risk allele of the FTO gene, but it showed a strong association with obesity. These findings perhaps suggest that although these alleles may be associated with increased body weight, they may only be indirectly involved in the development of diabetes, and lifestyle factors may be more indicative of an increased risk of T2D. The FTO gene is highly expressed in the hypothalamus region of the brain, which is involved in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure [35] . The association studies of FTO variants with obesity are additionally supported by subsequent animal studies. A few of the animal studies on mouse models also reported that FTO is an important candidate gene for obesity [36] . Loss of function or expression of FTO is more relevant for a lean phenotype, whereas, overexpression results in obesity [36] . However, the MC4R gene showed high expression in the mesentery of obese and diabetic rats compared to lean rats [18] . In addition, some studies also supported that the association of FTO rs9939609 T [ A and the MC4R rs12970134 G [ A polymorphism with type 2 diabetes and obesity could be modified by lifestyle and diet [23] . In the present study, high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, not eating vegetables and eating fast food were observed among T2D cases compared to controls. The T2D patients also had a history of higher caloric intake and were less (42%) physically active compared to controls (52%) ( Table 4 ). The present study included 300 T2D patients, 60% males and 40% females, and found that most of the lifestyle and dietary-related parameters did not vary greatly between genders, while smoking and consumption of alcohol were found to be important factors among males. However, the social taboo probably weighed in favour of females in the Indian population. There may be some limitations to the present study. First, the sample size was small although India is a geographically vast country with diverse ethnic populations having different cultures, lifestyles and eating habits. However, a study including most regions with a larger, more diverse sample size might provide greater insight into the association of the genetic variability of these genes with obesity and T2D. Second, an intervention-based follow-up study on diabetic subjects could help better understand the role of these SNPs in obesity and T2D.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 184, "end": 188, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 207, "end": 211, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 357, "end": 361, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 362, "end": 366, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 367, "end": 371, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 372, "end": 376, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 742, "end": 746, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 783, "end": 787, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 977, "end": 981, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 982, "end": 985, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 986, "end": 989, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1237, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1531, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2100, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2323, "end": 2327, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2450, "end": 2454, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2569, "end": 2573, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2777, "end": 2781, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3076, "end": 3083, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the present study did not find a direct association of rs9939609 in FTO and rs12970134456 in MC4R genes with the occurrence of diabetes, but their role in T2D development cannot be overlooked altogether.
