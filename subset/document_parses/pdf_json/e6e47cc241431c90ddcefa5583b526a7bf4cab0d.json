At the time of recovery, gross anatomical abnormalities were evident in both infected and non-infected fetuses from the infected dams. Virus isolation and immunohistochemistry identified the thymus as the primary site of virus replication. Steady state RT-PCR amplification of inflammatory, Th1 and Th2 cytokines, showed elevated IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423 mRNAs in tissues from infected fetuses, which corresponded to elevated cytokine proteins in serum but not amniotic fluid. Further evidence for induction of immunity was found in the hyperplastic response of lymph nodes, which included the development of germinal centers occupied CDw75+ B cells. Collectively, these data support the notion that the immunocompetent fetus is capable of initiating an antiviral response, which is compartmentalized within the infected fetus.

The tissues selected for RT-PCR amplification were lung, lymph node and placenta. Lung and lymph node represent sites cytokine alterations in the post-natal pig. Placenta was selected as an accessory tissue located at the fetal maternal interface.

The amplification of \u24242m mRNA was included as an internal control. The determination of a cytokine response was based on the presence or absence of a PCR product. IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-10 products were detected in tissues from both control and infected fetuses. Because of the qualitative nature of the PCR method, it was not possible to accurately determine quantitative differences between control and infected fetuses; and therefore, these cytokines were not subjected to further study (data not shown). IL-4 mRNA was not detected in any of the selected tissues for control and infected fetuses. Marked differences in expression were observed for TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 mRNAs.

The internal control mRNA, \u24242m, was amplified from all tissues, indicating that the RNA was intact. IL-10 was amplified from lung and mandibular lymph nodes from two of the four control fetuses and from all infected fetuses. The presence of IL-10 was not unexpected, since increased IL-10 production is associated with fetal T cell responses (Lin et al., 1993; Rainsford and Reen, 2002) .

Consistent with the body of published literature, the fetuses from the infected dams obtained in this study exhibited several anatomic pathological features typical of PRRSV infection of the fetus, including lesions associated with the accessory organs, such as umbilical cord and amniotic sac (Lager and Halbur, 1996; Mengeling et al., 1996) . One interesting observation from this study was the apparent absence of a correlation between the presence of gross abnormalities and productive fetal infection. For example, several fetuses from dam no. 2 exhibited several types of gross pathology, including death, growth retardation, or merconium/blood stained amniotic fluid. There were also examples of productively infected fetuses that showed no evidence of gross pathology (see fetuses 1-2, 3-12, 4-9, 4-11, 4-13 in Fig. 1 ). The mechanism for fetal pathology remains unclear, but the results suggest that the source pathology is likely result of the infection of tissues on the maternal side and damage to maternal tissues or production of maternal factors that affect the fetus. In this study we did not observe lesions in the myometrium or placenta; however, Stockhofe-Zurwieden et al. (1995) reported PRRS virions budding from maternal vascular endothelial cells at the maternal-fetal interface. Lager and Halbur (1996) reported damage to the myometrium during PRRSV infection. Virus-associated lesions in the myometrium are observed for horses infected with EAV (Coignoul and Cheville, 1984) .

The significance of mutations in ORF5 as a source for increased fitness during infection is not completely understood; but is useful for following the fate of individual PRRSV subpopulations over the course of a long-term infection . In this study, one dam, no. 4, showed evidence of a mixed PRRSV infection as indicated by the presence of two different ORF5 sequences, which were distinguished from each other by a nucleotide substitution at position 77 in ORF5. The C to T change was observed in approximately 60% of the cloned plasmid products obtained from dam no. 4 (see Table 2 ). However, the same frequency was not transferred to the individual fetuses, which included two fetuses that possessed only viruses with the T-77 mutation and a single fetus with a virus population dominated by C at position 77.

The negative influence of Th1 cytokines on fetal development can be demonstrated experimentally in mice, which show that a single injection of IL-2 or IFN-\u2425 into certain strains induces fetal resorption (Lala, 1990; Chaouat et al., 1990) . TNF-\u2423, when infected into mice is abortifacient (Clark et al., 2004) . Th1 cytokines can also have important long-term impacts. For example, newborn mice that survive maternal infection with influenza virus exhibit behav-ior similar to hyperanxiety and autism. The behavioral changes are a consequence of the altered distribution of dopamine and glutamine receptors during fetal brain development. The effect of influenza virus infection on the fetal brain can be mimicked by the administration of poly I:C, an inducer of IFN (Shi et al., 2003) . Furthermore, the addition of IFN-\u2425 to hippocampal neuron cultures alters the distribution of glutamate receptors, sufficient to affect synaptic activity between neurons (Vikman et al., 2001) . Virus infections during pregnancy present an interesting paradox: those cytokines that protect the fetus from viral infection, tend to inhibit fetal development or potentiate rejection of the fetus; while those cytokines that maintain and promote fetal development are associated with the inhibition of antiviral immune responses. Because of the potential negative impact of Th1 cytokines on fetal outcome, there is a natural predisposition for the fetus to block the induction of Th1-associated cytokines. For example, the IFN-\u2425 response in the developing fetus can be blocked by a combination of factors, including (1) defects in the capacity of fetal dendritic cells to express MHC class II and synthesize IL-12, (2) hypermethylation of the IFN-\u2425 gene in fetal T cells, (3) the absence of target macrophages, and (4) the presence of an immune environment dominated by Th2/regulatory cytokines (Goriely et al., 2001; Langrish et al., 2002; Melvin et al., 1995; Marodi et al., 2001; Murphy et al., 2009; Prescott et al., 1998; White et al., 2002,) . With this in mind, there are examples of viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which are capable of stimulating antigen-specific IFN-\u2425 responses in human umbilical cord blood lymphocytes (Ito et al., 1998; Wilson and Morgan, 2002) . These and other data provide a description of the fetus as capable of initiating a robust antiviral Th1 immune response (Chaouat et al., 2002; Chipeta et al., 2000; Murphy et al., 2009) . In this study IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423 mRNAs were identified in tissues from infected fetuses. RNA message was not identified in tissues of fetuses from mock-infected dams or non-infected fetuses from infected dams. This indicates that altered gene expression is the direct result of fetal infection. Up-regulated expression was confirmed by the presence of detectable levels of IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423 proteins in serum. Furthermore, the results indicate that INF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 cytokines response are compartmentalized within the fetus and do not extend to other compartments, such as amniotic fluid or placenta, thus lessening the probability of allorejection by the dam. From these data, it is apparent that the fetus is capable of initiating a Th1-like response; however, the capacity of IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423 to control PRRSV infection in the fetus is not known.
