The IgM antibody was detected in the breast milk of some mothers confirmed with COVID-19 between 3-68 days after the onset of symptoms.

Considering the lack of evidence for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through breast milk, health care workers should provide adequate breastfeeding counseling along with appropriate hand hygiene precautions and facemasks to all pregnant women to minimize the risk of transmission, and the decision of breastfeeding should be made together by the families and doctors. The separation of mothers and infants should be avoided wherever possible. Additionally, a longer follow-up period is likely needed to detect IgG antibody.",

Most research studies thus far have not found evidence of vertical transmission of COVID-19 from mother to child [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, some studies found that a few neonates born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19 presented positive SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) results, including one neonate with a nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR within 16 h after birth [10] , and three of 33 neonates with nasopharyngeal and anal swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR within two days after birth [11] . There have been no confirmed cases of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to child through breastfeeding, but the possibility of COVID-19 transmission to neonates through breast milk has been postulated. Until September 18, 2020, sixteen studies have published the testing of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in breast milk, half of which reported with negative results from the intermittently collected samples [ 7 , 12-17 ] . However, a few studies reported positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in breast milk on 1-13 days post-delivery [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , or 1-5 days after the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 [ 24 , 25 ] , and one study did not include the testing time [26] . The positive rate of RNA was nearly 14 \u2022 29% (20/140 samples from 9/49 patients). Even though Bastug and colleagues reported positive results of one neonate's nasopharyngeal swab, stool, and blood samples after breastfeeding by the positive mother, neither the mother nor infant exhibited any symptoms [21] . However, the largest cohort study published thus far found no evidence of mother-to-child transmission when neonates roomed-in with mothers and breastfed [27] . In the past few months, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of IgA, IgG and IgM in breast milk have also been reported [ 13 , 28 , 29 ] , but the number of samples was limited and the effects of prolonged mother-child separation on breastfeeding practices due to quarantine control measures have not been reported. The risk of transmission through breast milk and impact of COVID-19 infection on neonates need to be carefully balanced with the early-and longer-term negative health consequences of not breastfeeding.",

This finding supports prior studies that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid has not been detected in breast milk [ 7 , 12-17 ] , even when the mother was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 [13] . Although recent studies reported a 14 \u2022 29% (20/140) positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in breast milk, these studies only identified viral RNA by RT-PCR test rather than the infectious virus [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Two cases of neonatal infection have been reported due to unprotected contact with undiagnosed mothers, while there were ten neonates who did not become infected by mothers who directly breastfed while wearing a mask [28] .

Furthermore, the majority of studies reported no respiratory or other illness in neonates born to mothers with confirmed/suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection [ 28 , 33 ] . According to the current evidences, the WHO recommends that the neonates born to mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be breastfed within 1 hour of birth with maternal masks and handwashing [ 45 , 48 ] . Moreover, the American Academy of Pediatricswhich initially supported the separation of newborns and advised against direct breastfeeding-has changed its recommendation to discourage separation and encourage breastfeeding based on current evidences [49] . Although the benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risks [50] , considering the positive results of one neonate's nasopharyngeal swab, stool, and blood samples after breastfeeding by the positive mother (although the infant did not exhibit any symptoms), the breastfeeding decision should be made together by the families and doctors [21] . Additionally, pasteurization (62 \u2022 5 \u00b0C for 30 min) of breast milk has been reported to eliminate the replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 or viral RNA, which could also be used to might benefit the safety of breastfeeding [24] .",

We also found that most of the samples with IgM positive were collected within the first 40 days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms as compared with the IgMnegative samples. Previous studies tested IgG and IgM in blood samples which showed that the median seroconversion time for IgM and IgG were day-12 and day-14 after the onset of disease, respectively [51] . Furthermore, a study reported positive results of secretory-IgA (sIgA), IgM and IgG in breast milk samples which were obtained 14-30 days after maternal symptoms had abated [29] . However, the antibody concentration might differ between serum and breast milk which needs further investigation. Breast milk of mothers infected with influenza has been shown to contain IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies, which has been hypothesized to neutralize viruses in breast milk or in the gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts [52] . Given that antibodies may help to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [53] , it is theoretically possible that breast milk secreted by lactating mothers with positive IgM may have a positive impact on infant health, although more data is needed to study.",

IgG antibodies are primarily expressed after recovery from an infectious disease and last for months or years [54] . It has been reported that the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum is only 11 \u2022 8% at seven days after infection and increased gradually to 100% at three months post infection [54] . In our study, most of the samples (31 of 38) for antibody testing were collected within two months after the onset of symptoms, and none were collected after three months following symptoms onset. A longer follow-up period is likely needed to confirm whether IgG (comprises only ~2% of breast milk Ig) [29] of SARS-CoV-2 is expressed in breast milk. In addition, a previous study demonstrated that IgG concentration in breast milk was reduced by 34% after pasteurization (62 \u2022 5 \u00b0C for 30 min, IgM was not detected), which may be a contributing factor for our negative IgG results [55] . Additionally, sIgA is another common antibody that maybe expressed in breast milk, which had been identified as a dominant antibody in breast milk following recovery from COVID-19 [29] . However, we failed to test the sIgA of SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk because the kits were not available during the study period and the milk samples were not available anymore to redo the testing.",

Firstly, while our study had a larger sample than in some prior studies, the sample sizes for each group remained relatively small with limited power to detect differences by group. Secondly, we had incomplete breast milk sampling from each mother due to challenging field conditions, resulting in low numbers of breast milk samples for antibody testing. Thirdly, we also failed to test the sIgA of SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk because of unavailable testing kits. Lastly, the national protocols for isolation limited support for expressing milk among the mothers, and the inactivation process (incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 30-60 min before testing) may have reduced the detection of RNA and antibodies across the samples [24] .",

Our study also highlighted the late initiation of breastfeeding even among mothers without confirmed or suspected COVID-19. There was no evidence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in breast milk. The presence of IgM in some samples suggests the possibility that breast milk might have a protective effect on newborns. Considering the lack of evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through breast milk, health education and counseling on breastfeeding support should be strengthened to all pregnant women and their family members. The separation of mothers and infants should be avoided wherever possible. Nevertheless, in view of the possibility of respiratory, contact or breastfeeding transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 during breastfeeding, the decision should be made together by the families and doctors, and appropriate hand hygiene precautions and facemasks are recommended to minimize the risk of transmission.",
