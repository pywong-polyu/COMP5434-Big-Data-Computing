            "text": "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly used medications in the United States and have been linked to side effects including bone fracture, chronic kidney disease, and gastrointestinal (GI) infections, among others (1) . Although a recent randomized controlled trial did not confirm most of these purported complications, it found that once daily PPI use increased the odds for enteric infection by 33% (2) . Meta-analyses also reveal that PPIs are associated with increased risk of both enteric infections and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (3) (4) (5) , and a 2019 study by Vilcu et al. (6) found that continuous use of PPIs is associated with increased risk of viral infection during periods of high endemic prevalence. Thus, although most hypothesized complications from PPIs have not withstood the test of time (1) , enteric infection is one adverse event supported by both metaanalyses and randomized controlled trial data. This effect is likely related to PPI-induced hypochlorhydria, which impairs the body's proximal defense against ingested bacteria and viruses (1) , and may also occur because prolonged use of PPIs reduces microbial diversity in the gut (7) , an effect believed to enable colonization of some enteric pathogens (8) .",

This is relevant because SARS-CoV-2 can enter the body not only through the respiratory system but also through the GI system (10, 11) . The virus uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor, which is widely expressed throughout the intestinal tract (12) , to rapidly invade and replicate within enterocytes (13) . Once SARS-CoV-2 colonizes the GI tract, it can lead to gastritis, enteritis, and colitis (10, 14) , and a recent report posted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documented evidence of infectious virus-not just viral RNA-in the stool from a patient with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) infection (15) . Similarly, another study also described finding \"live\" virus in the feces (16) . Other reports reveal that nearly half of patients with COVID-19 have viral RNA in their stool (17) , at times when not concurrently found in the respiratory tract (18) , and research suggests that monitoring SARS-CoV-2 levels in sewage may provide a lead-time indicator for COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations within a community (19) (20) (21) (22) ; this technique is now being tested by municipalities around the world. Taken together, this body of research, in addition to other studies (23, 24) , strongly implicates the GI system as a major portal for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "In addition, because the gut is the largest immune organ in the body and can host colonies of rapidly replicating SARS-CoV-2 (13) , there is concern that the virus could spread beyond the GI tract not only by causing digestive symptoms but also by seeding infection or promoting inflammation in other organ systems, including the respiratory tract via a \"gut-lung axis\" (11, 25, 26) . Previous research with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus found that pretreating mice with pantoprazole, a PPI, showed \"exaggerated\" evidence of not only enteric infection but also revealed epithelial degeneration in the small bowel. Notably, the virus was subsequently found to emerge in lung tissue. The authors note that the spread of virus from intestine to lungs indicates \"development of sequential respiratory infection\" after inoculating the stomach-not the lungs-with a coronavirus that uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor to gain gut entry into the body (26) . Other investigators posit that SARS-CoV-2's disruption of the epithelial layer can lead to release of endotoxins and microbial metabolites that subsequently trigger inflammation and cytokine release in distant organs, such as the lungs (11, 25) . Because PPIs may undermine the gastric barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry and reduce microbial diversity in the gut, coupled with the established link between PPIs and GI infection shown in meta-analyses (3) (4) (5) and randomized controlled trial data (2) , it is possible that PPIs might also increase the risk for COVID-19, a hypothesis previously posed by other researchers (27, 28) . In this study, we further investigated the potential link between PPIs and COVID-19 in a nationwide survey of Americans.",

We collaborated with an online survey research firm (Cint; www.cint.com) that sought to recruit a nationwide, representative sample based on US Census data on age, sex, and region. The Cint research panels have been widely used by investigators across the globe on a range of studies, including GI research supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Rome Foundation (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) All participants who were 18 years of age or older were eligible for the study. Respondents were first shown a list of common GI symptoms, and those endorsing a history of abdominal pain or discomfort, acid reflux, heartburn, or regurgitation were separately asked about any current PPI and/or histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) use. For those currently taking PPIs and H2RAs, we assessed their frequency and duration of use. We also examined whether respondents were tested for COVID-19; those with a positive test were asked about new symptoms they experienced, if any, at the time of diagnosis, including ageusia, anosmia, GI (abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea/vomiting), respiratory, or systemic symptoms. Individuals taking a PPI or H2RA for #1 month and who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at least 2 months before survey completion were classified as nonusers to help reduce the risk of protopathic bias.",

The data revealed shifts in the respondent profile as the study progressed; the latter group was meaningfully different from the initial group across many sociodemographic characteristics. For example, in the first half of the survey period, the COVID-19 positivity rate was 2.5% and the overall demographics seemed more consistent with the overall US population. In the second half the self-reported positivity rate rose substantially. Similarly, as the study progressed, the COVID-19 population of survey takers became younger, more likely to be from the South region of the United States, more likely to be Latinx, less educated, and more likely to report a total annual household income $$200,001.

Moreover, investigators tested a step-down therapy approach among patients whose GERD symptoms were under control with PPIs and found that 34% were able to switch to H2RAs and 15% remained asymptomatic off PPI therapy 1 year later (58) . Our study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the relationship between PPIs and COVID-19 among a nationwide sample of Americans. Our finding that PPI use is associated with increased odds for acquiring SARS-CoV-2, which invades and replicates within enterocytes (13) , is consistent with previous literature showing that PPIs also increase the risk for other enteric infections (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Most of these studies, though, did not assess the impact of twice-daily dosing; further research examining whether PPI twice daily increases the risk for such infections over once-daily dosing are needed. We also examined the association between PPIs and GI COVID-19 symptoms and found that PPIs do not increase the odds for reporting such symptoms. Because GI symptoms are prevalent in those with COVID-19 (14) , further studies assessing the mechanisms behind its differential presentations are needed. Moreover, unlike many studies that use retrospective data to examine potential PPI side effects (1), we prospectively constructed this online survey to test an a priori hypothesis. Although this approach has inherent limitations, as described below, leveraging an online, self-administered platform allows for efficient recruitment of a national sample; findings from single-site studies with limited sample sizes of patients presenting with COVID-19 may be less generalizable to other settings and populations.",

As previously noted, this was not a study of the general population; it was a study of individuals with previous abdominal pain or discomfort, acid reflux, heartburn, or regurgitation and was not designed to arrive at a population estimate for COVID-19. Because most survey questions focused on GI symptoms, those with such symptoms may have been predisposed to completing the survey (the COVID-19 questions came at the end of the survey). Because COVID-19 commonly leads to GI symptoms (14) , this selection may have contributed to the higher than expected positivity rate. There are other potential explanations for this finding. Although we generically positioned our survey at the outset as a \"national health survey\" and not as a COVID-19-or PPI-focused study, our results may be subject to participation bias because it occurred during a pandemic and, as a result, may have oversampled patients with COVID-19 who considered a \"health survey\" particularly relevant at a time of illness. It is also possible that those with COVID-19 may have been more likely to complete an online health survey while quarantined at home or may have heard about it from friends or family who received the survey.",

Although it is unclear why an individual would falsify his or her COVID-19 status, it is also less clear how dishonesty would fall along a biological gradient of acid suppression. For example, it is not clear why people using twice daily PPI would be more dishonest about COVID-19 than patients on once daily PPI or why those on once daily PPI would be more dishonest than those using H2RAs. Perhaps use of PPIs-but not H2RAs-is a surrogate marker for other factors associated with dishonesty, but we are challenged to offer a reasonable explanation. In addition, self-reported COVID-19 status has been used in other recent surveys regarding pandemic epidemiology (59, 60) .",

This disconnect between the high prevalence of GERD symptoms but low rate of formal physician diagnosis suggests that many individuals in this sample were self-managing their GERD symptoms with over-the-counter PPIs or H2RAs without guidance from a clinician, consistent with published data (61) , and thus would not have received a formal diagnosis. It is also possible that some respondents mistakenly failed to endorse \"GERD\"-a medical term-in contrast to \"acid reflux\" when they were asked to select among a list of physician-diagnosed conditions but did endorse symptoms when presented with a list of cardinal GERD symptoms. Some may also have forgotten having received a formal diagnosis of GERD. In any event, the PPI users did have a high prevalence of GERD symptoms, as expected.",

However, in adjusted analysis, men had slightly increased odds for being positive. At first glance, this may seem paradoxical. However, in bivariate analyses, we found that women in this sample were more likely to be insured (potentially allowing easier access to COVID-19 testing), more likely to be Latinx (a group disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (45)), and more likely to be from the South (a region with a high and increasing prevalence of COVID-19 during the conduct of this study (62) ). Thus, there were multiple imbalances likely operating together to increase risk of COVID-19 among women in this cohort. When multivariable regression analysis was performed while accounting for these multiple imbalances, the analysis revealed that being a man was independently associated with slightly increased risk of COVID-19. That is, being a woman was a surrogate for several predictors of COVID-19 but was not, itself, a predictor of COVID-19. Although men seem to have higher rates for COVID-19-related hospitalizations vs women (63), the pandemic is rapidly evolving and time will determine whether there are also disparities regarding cases of COVID-19.",

They did note, however, that during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a surge of engagement with Cint surveys in tandem with the conduct of this study, possibly because people have been social distancing and staying home, or have lost a job or suffered a pay cut, and therefore joined survey panels for additional income and to pass time at home. Others may have been quarantined because they had COVID-19. As the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded sociodemographic disparities, particularly among Latinx and less educated individuals who have experienced pay cuts and job losses at a higher rate than other groups (71, 72) , it is plausible to observe a disproportionate increase in these demographics in the second half of this survey.

In the first 2 weeks of the study, when the demographic distributions of the COVID-19 sample seemed more closely tied to the general population, there was a dose-response effect between use of PPIs and COVID-19. Similarly, in every period thereafter, no matter the demographic shifts that occurred, the same result remained consistent.",

For instance, individuals with certain comorbidities that increase the risk for severe COVID-19 (e.g., cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease (63) ) may also be more likely to take PPIs. However, it is unclear whether these risk factors apply to acquiring COVID-19, which was the subject of this study, in contrast to developing severe COVID-19.

The short recall period also reduces risk of recall bias, and it is less of a concern for the medication data because we asked respondents about their current usage. Another potential limitation is that we did not determine how respondents tested positive for COVID-19 (e.g., polymerase chain reaction or serology testing) nor did we measure disease severity. We suspect, though, that most participants underwent polymerase chain reaction testing, in contrast to antibody surveillance, because most respondents had symptomatic COVID-19.

For the current study, the consistency criterion can be addressed in both general and specific forms. Generally, this study reveals a link between use of PPIs and acquiring an enteric pathogen. Of all the purported adverse events linked to PPIs, Vaezi et al. acknowledge that \"consistency has been shown among various studies examining this association\" based on the strength of meta-analyses and prospective, randomized data discussed earlier (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Moreover, the pooled OR in meta-analysis is 3.33 (4), a value similar to the aOR of 3.67 for twice daily PPI found in this study, supporting consistency with the published literature. In addition, we found consistent results across subgroup analyses, such as across study time periods and when excluding certain subgroups, further supporting the durability of the findings. The specific form of consistency relates to the link between PPIs and SARS-CoV-2 as an instance of enteric infection risk. Here, there is currently very little published data because this study represents the first large effort, to our knowledge, evaluating the relationship. We are aware of other efforts underway to evaluate the link between PPI exposure and COVID-19 outcomes, including mortality, and await the results of those analyses.

For example, if the event occurred before the exposure, then clearly there would be no causal link. Protopathic bias is a form of time bias in which a drug is used to manage the adverse event itself. In the case of COVID-19 and PPIs, one might imagine someone with COVID-19 developing GI symptoms and then turning to a PPI for relief. Failing to account for protopathic bias would artificially inflate the effect of PPIs. For that reason, individuals taking a PPI or H2RA for #1 month and who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at least 2 months before survey completion were classified as nonusers to help reduce the risk of protopathic bias. Another related form of bias is time lag between the expected effect of PPIs and the onset of the adverse effect. For example, it is possible that patients on long-term PPIs have a different gastric acid profile than those on short-term PPIs. For that reason, we compared results among those using PPIs for #6 months vs those using it for .6 months and found significant results for all analyses, with the highest odds seen for those on longterm twice daily PPI (aOR 3.81). However, despite these efforts to address protopathic bias and time lag, only a prospective study can generate sufficient data to satisfy the temporality criterion.",

However, this study does not offer evidence of causation in the absence of a prospective trial and should be further investigated in different populations and settings. In the meantime, our findings support good clinical practice that PPIs should only be used when indicated at the lowest effective dose, such as the approved once-daily label dosage of over-the-counter and prescription PPIs. Additional studies should also assess whether there is an association between PPIs and indicators of COVID-19 severity, such as hospitalization, need for intubation, or mortality.",
