This study takes the case of the Italian destination of Pisa during the early stages of the pandemicwhen most infection cases were assumed to be imported from China -and investigates Social Representations of Chinese tourists from an Italian host perspective. Through fifteen interviews with local suppliers, two co-existing Social Representations are identified and expressed through Italian literary metaphors: \"the Hen with Golden Eggs\" and \"the Anointer\". This research shows that, while the dominant hegemonic representation is rooted in rationality, the emerging polemic representation is anchored in pre-Enlightenment sociocultural fears. Finally, the uncertain future of post-COVID19 tourism considering potential stereotypes, xenophobia and racism is discussed.",

She saw a man approach; he wore a black cloak, his hat was drawn over his eyes, and in one hand he carried a paper, \"upon which\", she says in her deposition, \"he placed the other as in the act of writing.\" She perceived how, when entering the street, he neared the walls of the first houses which he came to after turning the corner; and how, from time to time, he drew his hands along the walls.\" Seized with this suspicion, she passed into another room from whence she could see the length of the street, so as to keep her eye upon the Unknown, as he advanced along it, \"and saw\", says she, \"that he continued to touch the said walls with his hand.\" Encounter with the \"Untore\" in Alessandro Manzoni's \"History of The Column of Infamy\" (1840).",

However, by now it is apparent that COVID-19 also has created sociocultural impacts and has led to international conflicts and stereotyping, i.e. category-based generalizations of certain groups. This is particularly worrying, as stereotypes often lead to discrimination, with negative behavior towards these sub-category members (Dovidio, Hewstone, Glick, & Esses, 2010, p. 46) . For example, the pandemic caused international friction, with borders being closed, certain nationalities being denied entry, and flights being canceled. In this context, negative stereotypes, nationalism, and xenophobia have been rising (Habibi et al., 2020; Ruiz Estrada, 2020) . COVID-19 has also been labeled an \"infodemic\" and \"misinfodemic\" where social media have helped to inform, but also spread \"fake news\" and increase panic about the disease (Fedeli, 2019; Sokolov, 2020; Williams, Wassler, & Ferdinand, 2020) .",

First, the tourism industry will unquestionably suffer heavy impacts of this crisis, but the long-term consequences on the \"mutual gaze\" -the ways guests and hosts view, grasp, conceptualize, understand, imagine and construct each other (Maoz, 2005, p . 222) -are not yet understood. The understanding of how \"the other\" is represented socially is an essential first step to identify stereotypes and potential conflict. Violence and discrimination have drastically increased on a global scale since the outbreak and the nature of tourism as an intercultural and cross-cultural industry is likely to exacerbate these issues, even after the pandemic ends. Throughout 2020, the shift of the public eye has rapidly shifted, with epicenters of the pandemic being identified in China, Italy, the USA, the United Kingdom, etc. The temporary snapshot of Italy, which is offered by this study, could thus function as a warning sign on how fast and unpredictably external events can trigger hostile attitudes between communities. In particular, taking a hostperspective, this research thus offers the first step towards a deeper understanding of how communities \"gaze\" at each other in times of COVID-19. Second, it is hoped that resident representations of \"the other\" during times of crisis can be understood from a socialpsychological perspective and how similar events can alter existing, and give birth to new Social Representations.",

            "text": "Social Representations are defined as a system of values, ideas, and practices which establish an order which: enables individuals to orientate themselves in their material and social world and master it and; enables communication to take place among the members of a community by providing them with a code for social exchange and a code for naming and classifying unambiguously the various aspects of their world and their individual group history (Moscovici, 1976) . In other words, Social Representations are fluctuating and shared values and belief systems among a group of people or within a certain (sub-section of or the overall) society. Social Representations can thus be considered as a form of social psychology (Moscovici, 1984 (Moscovici, /2000 , investigating a society's shared realities and common sense. Social Representations Theory has guided research on communities across different academic fields and disciplines (Rochira, Salvatore, Veltri, Redd, & Lancia, 2020) and this study adopts a similar social-psychological perspective. It furthermore provides a particularly good lens for this research as, contrary to other widely used concepts such as Social Exchange, it provides a tool to understand nonrational reactions based on personal and social values; while also highlighting the importance of socially transmitted messages. As Italy has been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, surpassing the number of deaths even in China in March 2020, it is assumed that this is an adequate case-study to understand whether external crisis associated with a certain nationality or geographical location (such as COVID-19 and the case of China) relates to Social Representations of Chinese tourists in the Italian society. The goal of this study is thus to investigate Social Representations of Chinese tourists from an Italian host, tourism-supply perspective during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This typically follows a positive to negative attitude continuum and, although clusters have been named differently, this is mostly consistent. In an early related study, Davis, Allen, and Cosenza (1988) identified five attitude clusters from negative to positive: haters; inbetweeners; love'em for a reason; cautious romantics; and lovers. This study suggests that people who are more knowledgeable about the tourism industry would be more favorable to tourism in general. In another early research by Ryan and Montgomery (1994) a similar continuum was confirmed, ranging from somewhat irritated; middle-of-theroaders; to enthusiast. The most extreme positive and negative attitude clusters are relatively stable throughout follow up research (e.g. Aguilo P\u00e9rez & Rossell\u00f3 Nadal, 2005; Brida, Osti, & Barquet, 2010; Fredline & Faulkner, 2000 , 2001 Wassler et al., 2018; Wassler, Nguyen, Mai, & Schuckert, 2019; Zhou & Ap, 2009 ); although differences in the more moderate clusters have been found, presumably due to cultural differences in the destinations (Fredline & Faulkner, 2000) and the contextbased underlying values, beliefs and social representations (Wassler et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "According to Faulkner and Tideswell (1997) , variables investigating the antecedents of residents' attitude towards tourism are commonly subdivided into intrinsic (based on the heterogeneous nature of the host community, such as age, gender, income) and extrinsic (based on the context of the destination, such as seasonality, political context). Commonly examined intrinsic factors are graphical proximity to tourism activities (e.g. Harrill & Potts, 2003; Pizam, 1978) , involvement in tourism or financial benefit (e.g. Ap, 1992) , and a wide range of demographic variables, such as age, income, gender, and education (e.g. Fredline & Faulkner, 2000; Harrill, 2004) . Extrinsic variables often refer to classic concepts such as the development stage of a destination (e.g. Butler, 1980; Doxey, 1975) , seasonality (e.g. Belisle & Hoy, 1980) , culture (e.g. Butler, 1975) , and impacts of tourism (e.g. Perdue, Long, & Allen, 1990 ). Arguably the most stable variable identified is economic dependency on tourism, (Jurowski, Uysal, & Williams, 1997) . However, even this has been questioned and studies have even shown an inverse relationship (e.g. Haukeland, 1984) . Harrill (2004) highlights that this may be due to sociocultural impacts, increasing cost of living, or cultural, political, and historical factors (Wassler et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "Finally, although the attitude towards tourism and attitude towards tourists are often used interchangeably in previous studies, there is a potentially important difference. Recent studies have found that residents often look at foreign tourists as involuntary representations of their country of origin and that local attitudes are heavily influenced by political, historical, economical, geographical, and cultural factors, as well as often (negative and positive) stereotypes towards the tourists' country of origin. In a study on the Hong Kong locals' attitude towards visa policies for Mainland Chinese tourists, Wassler et al. (2018) found a complex interplay of Social Exchange and Social Representation principles; mostly related to the often-strained relationship between Hong Kong and the Mainland. Wassler et al. (2019) furthermore found that Vietnamese residents looked at Chinese tourism through various Social Representations, rooted in culture, history, economics, and politics. Interestingly, involvement in tourism was not found to be significant in forming these attitudes. This study thus looks specifically at the attitude towards Chinese tourists, not Chinese tourism as a general concept.",

            "text": "There is also a rapidly developing body of COVID-19 research in tourism which, although not specifically related to Social Representations, has looked into tourist behavior and other general issues. Scholars have focused on the economic impacts of the pandemic on the tourism industry (e.g. Newsome, 2020; Sigala, 2020; Ugur & Akb\u0131y\u0131k, 2020; Williams, 2020) , with some focussing specifically on crisis management and/or resilience (e.g Prayag, 2020; Yeh, 2020) . COVID-19 and sustainability have been a major topic of interest, whereas scholars highlighted the need for a higher focus on sustainability moving forward (e. g. Cai, McKenna, Wassler, & Williams, 2020; Galvani, Lew, & Perez, 2020; Higgins-Desbiolles, 2020a Newsome, 2020) . Sociocultural impacts have been highlighted in residents (Farmaki et al., 2020; Qiu, Park, Li, & Song, 2020) , although a focus on tourist behavior has been more evident (e.g. Kim & Lee, 2020; Kock, N\u00f8rfelt, Josiassen, Assaf, & Tsionas, 2020; Li, Nguyen, & Coca-Stefaniak, 2020; Li, Zhang, Liu, Kozak, & Wen, 2020; Sigala, 2020) . Although this body of research is rapidly evolving and spans several topics of urgency and interest, a focus on sociocultural impacts is largely absent and this is particularly evident when it comes to issues such as stereotyping, racism, and xenophobia. With the advent of several vaccines in late 2020, a recent study by Williams et al. (2020) calls for a further research stream into new potential conflicts between communities, which might be augmented by misinformation circulating on social media. Social Representations Theory in its complexity, can give further insight into this process.",

However, in a later work, Moscovici and Markov\u00e1 (2001) give room for more flexibility for the use of the concept, by stating that Social Representations can transform over time, and thus a narrow definition would be restrictive. Moscovici (1988 Moscovici ( , 2001 adds that Social Representations are of three types. First, hegemonic Social Representations are shared by the majority and emerge from groups with power and dominate public opinion and the media. H\u00f6ijer (2011) offers \"climate change\" as an example for a hegemonic Social Representation, as politicians, media, and the public largely agree that this is a serious problem. Second, emancipated Social Representations are popular only in certain subgroups of the population.",

First, they are anchored through familiarisation; a process in which a social object is named and characterized. This can differ across groups. COVID-19 for example was hegemonically anchored as a global pandemic, while other sub-groups see it through the lens of global conspiracies, ranging anywhere from planned genocide to a leak of biological weapons. Once a social object is anchored, it is usually objectified through icons, metaphors, and tropes (Wagner, Valencia, & Elejabarrieta, 1996) . This makes a social phenomenon more tangible by materializing it into specific phenomena. Jodelet (1991) offers an example of objectification of \"madness\" in a rural French community, where abstract ideas get turned into common sense thinking and experience through treating them as \"real experience\". If this is completed, a new Social Representation has entered a communities' social world. Both anchoring and objectification are crucial to understanding how Social Representations enter the lifeworld of a community (Moscovici, 1976) and have been used as a guideline in previous resident studies (Wassler et al., 2019) . They are subsequently used in this study to understand and explain the identified Social Representations.",

Nonetheless, Social Representations in a tourism context have been applied to a wide range of other contexts and across a wide range of qualitative and quantitative methods; among which stakeholder studies (Moscardo, 2011) , quality of life (Moscardo, 2009 ), sustainable and volunteer tourism (Aquino & Andereck, 2018; Dickinson, Robbins, Filimonau, Hares, & Mika, 2013) and photography (Pearce & Moscardo, 2015) . Two examples of resident studies investigating Social Representations are offered by Wassler et al. (2018) and Wassler et al. (2019) . The first looks at residents' attitudes towards tourism policies for Chinese tourists in Hong Kong, first quantitatively clustering and then qualitatively interviewing locals. Findings showed that Social Representations were mixed with Social Exchange principles in forming attitudes. In the follow-up study, a three-step method was proposed by adding a round of interviews with experts and identifying anchoring and objectifications (Wassler et al., 2019) .",

Quantitative methods in Social Representation rely largely on large-scale surveys using methods such as cluster analysis (e. g. Fredline & Faulkner, 2000) . For this, there is a need to have a validated measurement-scale for a clustering variable. In this case, the exploratory nature of the pandemic-context suits itself to qualitative inquiry and thus a semi-structured approach. Second, the time frame and contextual factors (fear of a lockdown, increasing restrictions on travel) have made a large-scale survey approach inadequate. Furthermore, due to a severe lockdown for local citizens imposed by the Italian Government on the 9th of March 2020, larger-scale data collection with a quantitative sample was not possible during this specific timeframe.",

According to the Comune di Pisa (2020), the historical city of 91.000 inhabitants is one of the most visited destinations in central Italy and has a high amount of international tourists; among which Chinese inbound tourists constitute a significant number with approximately 60,000 annual arrivals (PisaToday, 2019). Pisa was particularly hard hit by the onset of COVID-19, when 1000 Chinese tourists canceled their hotel bookings in the last week of January 2020 alone (Bartolini, 2020) . This also suggests that at the time of the interviews, the respondents were aware of the then epidemic -now a pandemic, spreading and affecting Pisa and Italy as a whole. In late April 2020, local media sources stated that Chinese tourism is unlikely to recover in Pisa in Summer 2020 and that the eventual focus might be on European markets (Centro Studi Tci, 2020), a prediction which has proven right.",

The goal of this study was to investigate Social Representations of Chinese tourists from an Italian host, tourism-supply perspective during the COVID-19 pandemic and informed the development of the research questions. Past studies centering on Social Representations mostly take resident attitudes as a starting point, which is often approached quantitatively through cluster analysis. The qualitative nature of this study thus took attitudes as the first core concept for the interview guide. Second, impact is another facet of resident studies, particularly in a hostguest relation context. The impacts of in-bound Chinese tourism were thus identified as the second theme. Finally, to contextualize this to the emerging pandemic, Chinese tourism and its relation to COVID-19 was identified as the third and final theme. Interviewees were thus asked centering on the core themes of \"their general attitude towards Chinese tourists\"; \"their evaluation of impacts of Chinese tourism\"; and \"their perceptions of Chinese tourists concerning COVID-19\". Throughout the interview phase, modifications to the interview guide and spontaneous follow-up questions were employed if new information arose, given the exploratory nature of this study (see Table A1 in Appendix).",

Within the population of local tourism-related individuals in Pisa, a purposive sampling technique was employed, particularly based on a high-level of self-perceived involvement in the tourism industryagain, to increase the richness of the obtained data. First, one of the researchers (residing in Pisa) used a snowball-sampling technique, where local suppliers referred to other potential respondents with different insights and working in diverse supply-sectors. At this stage, interview dates were settled through telephone calls. This was complemented with a random sampling technique, where local workers were approached directly in the historic city center of Pisa, with a focus on Corso Italia and Piazza del Duomo, two major tourist centers. Finally, all interviews were held face-to-face in Italian and the audio was recorded. Table 1 shows the profile of the participants. All of them were involved in a variety of tourism-related businesses (self-identified as such) and had job experience between 2 and 33 years. Finally, a total of 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted and lasted approximately 45 to 60 min in length each.

The first social representation of Chinese tourists during COVID-19 emerged as \"la gallina dalle uova d'oro\" (lit. \"hen with golden eggs\"). The popular Italian saying derives from a fable of Aesop that tells of a farmer who one day found in his chicken coop a golden egg. Every day the same hen laid one but the farmer, eventually, was no longer satisfied with receiving only one egg a day and thinking that the hen had a large amount of gold in her belly, killed her but found that inside it was like all the others; thus, out of greed to get rich quickly, lost the opportunity to benefit from what he had received up to that day. The expression is commonly used in Italy for a phenomenon that is extremely valuable and leads to steady economic or other benefits if maintained correctly (Benedetti, 2010) .",

This generally reflects the picture provided by the authorities, where Chinese tourists are recognized as being one of the highest spending visitors in Italy and where conscious marketing efforts have been made to attract more Chinese tourists to Pisa, by portraying and promoting the leaning tower in Chinese soap operas (Salemi, 2020) . Since these efforts have been made throughout 2019, another respondent mentioned that \"the local population from Pisa, which is a small city, lives on Chinese tourism since the Chinese population represents a positive tourist flow.\" (P9; mentioned by most participants).

Historical accounts of anointments punctuate the centuries, with cases reported in Piedmont (e.g. Cardano, 1558) , Milan, and even Geneva (Cant\u00f9, 1854) . Although it is generally agreed upon that some anointments have happened, the historical validity of many accounts is still debated (Pastore, 2007) . According to Calimani (2013) , the concept of the purposefully spread plague (pestis manufacta) has commonly been blamed on outsiders, such as the Jewish community or French visitors, thus creating a physical manifestation of an else invisible enemy. According to Farinelli and Paccagnini (1988) , the supposed existence of the untori has commonly led to conspiracy theories among the local population.

Alessandro Manzoni (1785-1873), one of Italy's most famous novelists and poets, has immortalized the concept in his 1840 historical novel History of the Column of Infamy. He re-tells the stories of real-life suspects Guglielmo Piazza and Gian Giacomo Mora, both of them executed by the breaking wheel during the 1630 plague epidemic in Milan. Through a historical, juridical, and psychological lens, Manzoni critiques concepts such as abuse of power and popular paranoia. The book takes its name from the so-called \"column of infamy\", a monument to shame the memory of the two presumed anointers. Albertini (2020) writes that the psycho-character symptoms experienced by the local population during COVID-19 in Italy and apocalyptic scenarios that were painted can be compared to the characters in Manzoni's novel.",

This suggests that there is an ongoing concern for resident communities about the safety of restarting the tourism industry and that negative attitudes and representations of tourists might persists even after the pandemic. Risk perception is usually not a major concern of resident studies in a tourism context, but the findings of this study suggest that this might be a leading factor to lead to hostility towards tourists. Next, a majority of COVID-related studies in tourism have been concerned with either economic impacts or sustainability, dividing tourism scholars into different related \"tribes\" (Higgins-Desbiolles, 2020a; Nepal, 2020). Sociocultural impacts and issues such as racism, xenophobia, stereotypes and in the worst case, violence, have not been deeply investigated (Tse & Tung, 2020) .

The findings of this study have shown that the same respondents could indeed hold two contradictory representations and the same time and even mention them in the same sentence, suggesting the importance of cognitive polyphasia and themata, two concepts often related to Social Representations. In terms of polyphasia, findings indeed show that individuals hold two contradictory representations of Chinese tourists, which occasionally overlap. Although the identified representations were relatively consistent in the local context, our respondents were fulfilling different roles at the same timeparticularly as service providers, but also as residents. It might thus be that through the identified representations, cognitive polyphasia allows the respondents to relate and communicate through different aspects of their everyday life (Jovchelovitch, 2008) .

Although some respondents notably disagreed with this Social Representation, they also stated they were aware of the local community being increasingly skeptical towards Chinese tourists. In the case of Pisa, it seems that during COVID-19 a new, polemic representation of the untore has emerged to join, not replace, the existing representation of the gallina dalle uova d'oro. Certain characteristics which were already attributed to the Chinese tourist, such as \"culturally different\", took over new forms in the historically revived \"mystique\" of the historical plaguespreader (Cant\u00f9, 1854; Cardano, 1558) . The same shift was largely expressed through linguistic choices, such as the resurfacing of the controversial term \"untore\" (La Repubblica, 2020b) , \"hunt for the untori\" (La Repubblica, 2020a) , and the concept of \"pestis manufacta\" (Calimani, 2013) . Common terminologies used in hegemonic representations such as \"different\" and \"distant\" were found to co-exist with \"incomprehensible\", \"unhealthy\" and related to issues such as \"hygiene\" and \"food\". Similar terminologies have at the same time resurfaced in Italian media and among public personalities in the country (Merelli, 2020; Palma, 2020; Pegoraro, 2020; RAI News, 2020) , while mainstream media still point to the importance of the Chinese tourist market (Bartolini, 2020) .",

As an industry that depends on a successful and arguably, understanding the relationship between host and guest, tourism is likely going to be hit by negative representations of the other emerging during COVID-19. While governments are blaming each other (Aarabi, 2020; Mangan, 2020) , the emergence of the untore representation shows that this is also happening to the local people. More worryingly, while the gallina dalle uova d'oro representation has been found as rooted in what tourism scholars would traditionally call rational Social Exchange principles, the untore is deeply anchored in late medieval historical and cultural factors (Calimani, 2013; Farinelli & Paccagnini, 1988) , a specter from the past reemerging to haunt the present and potentially the future of tourism. Based on the increasing tension among nations that have emerged during COVID-19, it can thus be assumed that negative Social Representations are likely to arise or re-emerge across the globe, threatening the tourism industry with an uncertain future of xenophobia, stereotyping and conflict.",

In addition to the obvious economic impact of COVID-19 and increasing political barriers to travel during the pandemic, tourism practitioners will also need to guarantee their future customers safe and low-risk travel experiences. The findings of this study can constitute a warning sign that political polemics, (mass and social) media, and re-emerging historic-cultural animosities could expose travelers to increasing risk or lead them to boycott certain destinations. Studies have shown that for example, fake news has an immense impact on travel decisions (Fedeli, 2019) and the findings of this study show that this could be exacerbated during COVID-19. It is thus up to the tourism practitioners to identify misconceptions and representations which could threaten the tourism industry and to inform the public while guaranteeing safety for their future customers. The same can be said for governing bodies and relevant authorities, who need to identify representations and their often groundless anchoring; such as the recent attacks of 5G facilities in the UK after the rumors spread online that they may have helped in transmitting COVID-19 (Schraer & Lawrie, 2020) . Government bodies and authorities will also play a major role in re-building the local tourism sector and the local tourism industry in the upcoming year(s). A focus, therefore, should be not only to monitor emerging Social Representations, but also to combat misinformation and fake news on the more long-term. Public information campaigns about issues such as racism and conspiracy theories could be held on a local, regional and national level. This will also be particularly important as vaccine-hesitancy and related fringe-groups are already gaining a foothold among the population .",

Besides, Social Representations are volatile by nature and tend to fluctuatea phenomenon which has likely been enhanced by the recent event of social media and (mis)information spread online (Fedeli, 2019) . The snapshot offered by the findings should thus not be interpreted as a permanent change in resident attitudes towards Chinese tourists, but rather show a case of the potential dangers of Social Representations triggered by external factors. In the months following the first wave, roles have often \"reversed\", with China going so far as to blame Italy for the advent of the virus in late 2020 (Innocenzi, 2020) . This might likely also change the less permanent and newly emerged Social Representations found in this study. However, it is unlikely to change the fact that external events can trigger Social Representations which are buried in the collective psyche of a community, such as the controversial pre-Enlightenment \"untore\" of Italian folklore. It is crucial to identify and monitor such Social Representations which are triggered by external events, as their emergence and fluctuation are likely to tamper with host-guest relations.",

Specific to Italy, the first wave hit the north of the country the hardest and reactions have been numerous. Governors in the south of Italy have specifically asked northerners to \"stay away\", which has later also been applied to southerners living and working in the north and wanting to return home. The southern region of Calabria has used this divide for tourism purposes, where tourists were told to \"come south\", as they would \"get sick on the crowded beaches of the north\" (Priante, 2020) . During Christmas 2020, Italy initially banned flights from the UK due to a newly identified viral strain, leaving Italian expats stranded in British airports and causing political uproar (Sarzanini & Del Frate, 2020) . The findings of this study have shown that residents were often referring to the news when forming their Social Representations, and the numerous and varying travel bans throughout 2020 might likely have given birth to additional Social Representations.",

First and foremost, scholars should identify a wider range of Social Representations emerging during COVID-19 and investigate their potential impact on host-guest relations and tourism as a whole. Although in this context there are certain difficulties with large-scale data collections, future studies should attempt to look at representations using a larger sample size and following multiple or mixed methods. Resident studies have also shown that involvement in tourism and/or financial benefit derived from the industry is a major factor conditioning resident attitudes. This study was particularly focused on locals involved in tourism which, in general, tend to have a more favorable attitude towards tourists (Jurowski et al., 1997; McGehee & Andereck, 2004) . However, the context of the pandemic might have biased these findings, as our respondents were in closer contact with tourists than most other people not involved in the industry. Future research should thus look at sociocultural impacts on a resident population which is not necessarily involved in tourism. Upcoming studies should also investigate potential tensions within the resident community, particularly once the lockdown restrictions ease and international travel resume. Williams et al. (2020) have suggested that with the introduction of the vaccine(s), there might be tensions among vaccinehesitant and non-hesitant groups, also in terms of relaunching the tourism industry. This tension could potentially influence interior conflicts in the local community. Futures studies should also investigate the long-term impact of Social Representations emerging through global and local crises, such as epidemics, natural disasters, conflict, and others. Finally, in terms of COVID-19, the actual and potential sociocultural impacts of the pandemic on the tourism industry need to be understood more in detail and a wide range of research avenues should open to academics interested in this issue.",

            "text": "Finally, this study needs to acknowledge several limitations. Due to the difficult circumstances in which the data were collected, the relatively small sample size makes a more detailed description and the distribution of the Social Representations among the local population impossible. The nature of this study is thus exploratory and should be considered as the first step towards deeper understandings of Social Representations and sociocultural impacts of COVID-19. Furthermore, some of the comments obtained by the respondents were also rather general and this might be due to the early stage of the pandemic when the data were collected. Follow-up studies should bridge this gap by investigating the evolution of Social Representations throughout and after the pandemic. This could also imply follow-up studies in Italy where Social Representations of Chinese tourists are compared during and post-pandemic. Also, sociologists and political scholars could investigate if there are further Social Representations of Chinese tourists and others during this pandemic; and how they are anchored and objectified. Large-scale multiple mixed-method studies would be able to give a more detailed and accurate overview. To this end, including residents without a tourism connection would have been useful as they may have provided a different dimension to the Social Representations of Chinese tourists. Second, the convenience sampling technique aimed at locals who were involved in the tourism business was established through their self-identification. This narrow sample did not allow for an investigation of any intrinsic or extrinsic factors which might influence the formation of Social Representations. It also needs to be acknowledged that the timing of this data collection and the subsequent events, in terms of the wider spread of Covid-19 to other countries, present a significant limitation concerning the analysis of the data and the generalisability of the Social Representations of Chinese tourists from an Italian host perspective. Also, the location-based study makes it impossible to generalize the findings to the whole Italian territory and to ethnic communities living within certain destinations. To truly understand the uncertain future of the tourism industry following COVID-19, larger samples and more various methods are needed to identify, categorize, and analyze Social Representations.",
