            "text": "Based on the data so far, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children is shown to run a milder course with lower reported mortality rates (1, 2) . Both Chinese and Italian epidemiological studies have shown that approximately 10% children may present with gastrointestinal symptoms, and the presence of these symptoms is associated with increased disease severity (3) . However, as the definition of suspected cases does not include presentations with gastrointestinal symptoms only, there is still no clear answer to the question \"should we screen for SARS-CoV-2 infection in children who require admission to hospital with gastrointestinal symptoms?\". The current advice from Public Health of England points against this direction (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-initialinvestigation-of-possible-cases/investigation-and-initial-clinical-management-ofpossible-cases-of-wuhan-novel-coronavirus-wn-cov-infection). In addition to the fact that most of the presentations of the infection in children are atypical, there is very recent evidence showing that the highest viral shedding is taking place 2 to 3 days before onset of symptoms (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5). This evidence could potentially add on existing stress to front-line pediatricians not only around diagnosis and timely management, but also around their protection from contracting the disease. There is mounting evidence around increasing number of deaths in healthcare professionals (4) . Therefore, data clarifying the definition of suspected cases is eagerly anticipated. Case studies could be valuable in providing this information while wider epidemiological data is underway.",

Ileocolic intussusception was confirmed by ultrasound examination 2 hours after admission and pneumatic reduction was successful. Abdominal X-ray after pneumatic reduction did not reveal any evidence of perforation. Two days after, due to development of progressive respiratory distress, a chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan was performed showing small dense infiltrates in both lower lung fields. Her throat swab and antibody testing were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The infant's clinical condition continued to deteriorate with progressive distention of the abdomen and absence of bowel sounds. Abdominal CT showed signs of peritonitis, ascites, and swelling of the small intestinal wall. Two days later, a laparotomy was performed with the placement of a defunctioning ileostomy. Despite maximum support with antibiotics, inotropes, and mechanical ventilation, there was a deterioration in her condition; and with the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, the infant passed away on 8th March.",

Following resuscitation, and suspicion of intussusception she was transferred to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Due to failure of air enema reduction management, a surgical reduction was undertaken during which a malrotation was also identified for which a Ladd's procedure was performed. After full recovery, the infant was discharged on 5th of April. Her nasopharyngeal and throat swabs on 30th of March and on 4th of April tested positive in SARS-CoV-2.

Abnormal CT findings have been reported even in children with no respiratory symptoms, but this did not alter their management M a n u s c r i p t course (6) . Although both infants presented with symptoms suggestive of intussusception, their disease course differed.

Rectal swab for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was not part of the standard of care provision at the National Health Service (NHS) at that time of the pandemic. In the second case, the child was incidentally found to have undiagnosed malrotation of the bowel. Waugh's syndrome has been described in toddlers who present with signs of chronic intussusception and malrotation of the bowel.

            "text": "The suggested mechanisms underlying include either gut epithelial cells' infection with local reactive mesenteric adenitis that can trigger intussusception or mesenteric adenitis secondary to upper respiratory tract infection with SARS-CoV-2. Back in 1992, the association between adenovirus and intussusception has been documented (11). Adenovirus-2 (Adv-2) serotype, most frequently described as a respiratory pathogen, was the most detected pathogen in children with intussusception (12) . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Immunohistochemistry in human tissues revealed the surface expression of ACE2 protein on enterocytes of the small intestine, functioning as a co-receptor for nutrient uptake such as amino acid resorption from food (13) . These finding highlights that the gut might also be an important entry site for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is still no evidence of viral replication in gut epithelial cells (14) . Many asymptomatic patients undergoing procedures are being found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive and association with underlying problem (intussusception, appendicitis) is unclear and requires further study (15) . In adults, evidence of asymptomatic infection on admission for elective surgical procedure was associated with evidence of increased inflammatory response and more adverse outcomes (4).",

For future management and prevention strategies, it is also crucial to understand whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect gut epithelial or endothelial cells and whether susceptibility to gastrointestinal infection is associated with differential innate immune responses of the host. Also, a probabilistic model like the one set up for the associations between rotavirus vaccine and incidence of intussusception, would be particularly helpful (16) . ",
