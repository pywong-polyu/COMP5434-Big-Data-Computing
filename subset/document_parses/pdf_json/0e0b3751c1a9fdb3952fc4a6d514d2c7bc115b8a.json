            "text": "As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads across the world, the transfusion of efficient convalescent plasma (CP) to the most critical patients can be the primary approach to preventing the virus spread and treating the disease, and this strategy is considered as an intelligent computing concern. In providing an automated intelligent computing solution to select the appropriate CP for the most critical patients with COVID-19, two challenges aspects are bound to be faced: (1) distributed hospital management aspects (including scalability and management issues for prioritising COVID-19 patients and donors simultaneously), and (2) technical aspects (including the lack of COVID-19 dataset availability of patients and donors and an accurate matching process amongst them considering all blood types). Based on previous reports, no study has provided a solution for CP-transfusion-rescue intelligent framework during this pandemic that has addressed said challenges and issues. This study aimed to propose a novel CPtransfusion intelligent framework for rescuing COVID-19 patients across centralised/decentralised telemedicine hospitals based on the matching component process to provide an efficient CP from eligible donors to the most critical patients using multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. A dataset, including COVID-19 patients/donors that have met the important criteria in the virology field, must be augmented to improve the developed framework. Four consecutive phases conclude the methodology. In the first phase, a new COVID-19 dataset is generated on the basis of medical-reference ranges by specialised experts in the virology field. The simulation data are classified into 80 patients and 80 donors on the basis of the five biomarker criteria with four blood types (i.e., A, B, AB, and O) and produced for COVID-19 case study. In the second phase, the identification scenario of patient/donor distributions across four centralised/decentralised telemedicine hospitals is identified 'as a proof of concept'. In the third phase, three stages are conducted to develop a CP-transfusion-rescue framework. In the first stage, two decision matrices are adopted and developed on the basis of the five 'serological/protein biomarker' criteria for the prioritisation of patient/donor lists. In the second stage, MCDM techniques are analysed to adopt individual and group decision making based on integrated AHP-TOPSIS as suitable methods. In the third stage, the intelligent matching components amongst patients/donors are developed on the basis of four distinct rules. In the final phase, the guideline of the objective validation steps is reported. The intelligent framework implies the benefits and strength weights of biomarker criteria to the priority configuration results and can obtain efficient CPs for the most critical patients. The execution of matching components possesses the scalability and balancing presentation within centralised/decentralised hospitals. The objective validation results indicate that the ranking is valid.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a cluster of patients with a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China. Initially named as 2019 novel coronavirus, the virus has now been named as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses [1] [2] [3] . This virus can cause the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 [4] [5] [6] [7] . The COVID-19 pandemic has shocked the world for the first time in decades, resulting in an extraordinary impact on human life [8] . The number of patients worldwide increases consistently, and the number of patients closely infected follows an exponential trend [9] . Researchers from different countries have recently contributed to the application of different technologies that can help medical and healthcare providers stop this pandemic, such as the transfusion framework of convalescent plasma (CP) [10] . CP transfusion to COVID-19 patients, which is considered as one of the most successful protocols, is used in hospitals to treat this disease [11, 12] . Moreover, integration amongst hospitals in terms of the intelligent transfusion of CP across centralised/decentralised telemedicine architecture is necessary to help doctors in the rapid delivery of COVID-19 treatment [10] . For a clear view on how to support the hospital community in managing a CP-transfusion-rescue intelligent framework across the centralised/decentralised telemedicine architecture for the COVID-19 pandemic, five sequential questions are raised and answered as follows.",

Studies have reported that the virus can be eliminated by managing the healthcare quality of patients and providing them with protective antibodies from the blood of recovered patients via strong practice [13] [14] [15] . Thus, the transfusion of these antibodies to deteriorating patients can theoretically boost their immune system. Convalescent blood products (CBPs) are obtained by collecting plasma from a patient who has recovered from a viral or bacterial infection and has developed immunity against the pathogen causing the disease [16] . When transfused, CBPs can neutralise viruses and bacteria, thereby suppressing them in the blood [17] . Furthermore, the transfusion of CBPs from patients who recovered from COVID-19 can be the primary approach for preventing rapid virus spread and treating the disease [18] . For plasma=protein therapies, general safety measures have been established regarding plasma collection from donors.",

Meanwhile, identifying an adequate number of blood donors for COVID-19 patients is difficult particularly because some blood types are almost rare [24] . The health providers during this pandemic still face serious aspects regarding distributed hospital management; for example, patients may be increased in a particular hospital but not in others [25] . This scenario is becoming common for hospital workflow when the demand for CPs increases as in COVID-19. Furthermore, the dataset for COVID-19 in literature either presents with limited number of patients/donors or lacks the use of sufficient biomarker criteria that affect the prioritisation process [26, 27] . COVID-19 samples are difficult to collect because of protection of patient privacy. Finally, the issue of fair management and efficient distribution of CPs amongst patients and donors regarding distributed hospitals simultaneously has not been considered [10] . Accordingly, the full picture of intelligent managing patients/donors with COVID-19 in terms of prioritisation with regard to connected hospitals simultaneously is not presented yet, and this aspect is considered as the primary distributed hospital-management issue.",

Tiers 1 and 2 are responsible for clients' side. This architecture is a medical centre connected to distributed hospital servers. This architecture is also called centralised connected hospitals and is considered as the first recommended direction when no shared medical data resources are found amongst the countries [30] [31] [32] , which can benefit countries during the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a medical centre. For example, the ministry of health, which controls all hospitals either private or public, can customise the proposed framework [10] and share hospital-data resources to COVID-19 patients and donors. However, the second recommended direction is to determine whether shared medical-data resources can be found amongst the countries. This process can benefit countries through the blockchain technology. This proposed technology can eliminate the third party of centralised phenomena with regard to authentication and adapt to the telemedicine architecture, namely, decentralised connected hospitals [33] .

In these contexts, balancing a huge number of patients/donors to avoid an acute shortage of CPs can be accomplished. If this framework is appropriately developed, then it would exhibit the potential to save more lives. One way of achieving this aim is to develop a rescue framework that achieves the transfusion approach of CPs. Moreover, the matching process must be considered to enable balance across distributed hospitals. Thus, a prioritisation methodology is often conducted to ensure that CP is given in an appropriate and timely manner [35] . Therefore, for a sustainable health system and best care, improvements must be made to satisfy current requirements, particularly the need to present an interoperability rescue intelligent framework to manage the transfusion of best CPs between patients and donors with COVID-19 across centralised and decentralised connected hospitals.

For these challenges, DA can be used to generate dummy data to help prioritise patients/donors with COVID-19. An expert in the virology field with more than 10 years of experience provides a subjective judgment and generates an augmented dataset on the basis of medical-reference ranges (Tables 10 and 11 in the Appendix) to reduce this gap. These tables also present the reference ranges that serve as an indicator to identify the emergency health levels for the patients.

Prioritisation is considered challenging for different kinds of medical perspectives [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . With regard to the adopted DMs, a previous work [10] has suggested the use of the SODOSM method in handling prioritisation. However, the SODOSM method is conducted with regard to the idle solution amongst each criterion within the CP DM. The ideal solution is an alternative for specific criteria [62] , and this concept cannot be applied to the COVID-19 case study. The problem in identifying the ideal solution with regard to the reference range for the COVID-19 serological/protein biomarkers has not been detected and recognised [34] The newest trend regarding the use of MCDM methods is to combine two or more methods to recoup the weaknesses of a single method [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] .

In general, the evaluation criteria can be classified into two types: benefit and cost [92, 93] . Benefit criterion indicates that a larger value is more valuable, whereas cost criteria are the opposite. From a medical point of view, all criteria of the serological/protein biomarkers are considered important except for C2 = 'C-reactive protein' and C3 = 'IL-6 (pg/mL, cytokines)', which are considered as cost criteria. Thus, transferring physicians' preferences and experiences to an expert system can be proven effective. TOPSIS allocates the scores to each alternative on the basis of their geometric distance from positive and negative ideal solutions. The best alternative is selected, which according to this technique obtains the shortest geometric distance to the positive ideal solution and longest geometric distance to the negative ideal solution. The results of patients' prioritisation are ranked in descending order, indicating that the patient in order 1 has the poorest critical health condition, and the patient in order 80 has the least critical health condition. In the same context, the results of donors' prioritisation are also ranked in a descending order, indicating that the donor in order 1 is the least efficient donor, and the donor in order 80 is the most efficient donor. The steps of the TOPSIS method [35] are described as follows.",

As shown in the above-mentioned results, each patient is matched with a suitable CP donor on the basis of prioritisation results. Additionally, the matching between patients and donors is operated across four connected hospitals. For example, patient (P1_A) admitted to hospital 1 obtains the suitable CP from donor (D8_A), who is admitted to hospital 2. In these contexts, balancing across hospitals is achieved for all patients/donors and proven within the four hospitals. Moreover, matching amongst patients and donors could be achieved by the inverse relationship between them. For example, the patient (P3_AB) who gains order 1 with score = 0.74719 is considered the most critical condition amongst all patients, and the suitable donor for this patient is the last donor (D12_B) who gains order 80 with a score of 0.09808 according to Rule 3. Therefore, the intelligent matching process of CP transfusion between patients and donors is tested and verified towards the balancing approach across either centralised or decentralised telemedicine hospitals simultaneously.

Each group comprises 20 patients. The mean \u00b1 SD is calculated for each group on the basis of normalisation scores generated by TOPSIS to ensure that the prioritised patients/donors undergo systematic ranking. The prioritisation results presented in Table 8 are visualised in graphical formats (Fig. 7 for patients and Fig. 8 for donors) after categorising them into four groups based on descending patients' scores for comparison. The initial observation of the ranking results of the four patients and donors groups show that the groups are systematically distributed as the ranking results of the second group starting from the end of the ranking results of the first group and so on for other groups. Statistical analysis is performed amongst the patient groups, and Eqs. (15) and (16) are applied to obtain the M \u00b1 SD. In the first group, the value is M = 0.14538 \u00b1 0.08301. The first group obtains the highest score amongst the four groups. The second group has a value of M = 0.11977 \u00b1 0.07101 and a lower score than the first group but higher scores than the third and fourth groups. The third group has a value of M = 0.10887 \u00b1 0.05795 and a lower score than the first, second, and third groups but a higher score than the fourth groups. The fourth group has a value of M = 0.09705 \u00b1 0.04771 and has the lowest scores amongst the four groups. Furthermore, statistical analysis is performed amongst the donor groups, and Eqs. (15) and (16) are applied to obtain the M \u00b1 SD. In the first group, the value is M = 0.12993 \u00b1 0.08581. The first group obtains the highest score amongst the four groups. The second group has a value of M = 0.10759 \u00b1 0.07600 and has a lower score than the first group but higher scores than the third and fourth groups. The third group has a value of M = 0.10041 \u00b1 0.07080 and has a lower score than the first, second, and third groups but higher scores than the The selection of the best CP for critical COVID-19 patients is also challenging because this process is considered as a problem of MCDM, which complies with the national health requirements and known standard routine procedures [97] . The present study addresses these issues and indicates valid results on the basis of a fully automated intelligent computing framework. Thus, the transfusion of the CPs amongst patients and donors in either centralised or decentralised connected hospitals is accomplished, and the shortages of acute plasma in any hospital can be avoided.",

However, the field of COVID-19 infectious diseases has numerous aspects that need to be addressed comprehensively and continuously because this pandemic has shocked clinical organisations for the first time in decades. Therefore, various questions have emerged, and they should be assessed carefully before establishing the prioritisation characteristic intelligent framework. Do the five criteria cover all clinical characteristic aspects for the prioritisation configurations of patients and donors? If other criteria are missing, then how could the newly defined clinical criteria be added to the proposed DMs to be sufficient for the prioritisation process? How large should the group of participating clinical experts be and how should it be composed? If the methodology of prioritisation follows this COVID-19 clinical characteristic approach, then the original purpose for the transfusion of CP would be severely constrained and would result in desirable scalable load balancing amongst patients and donors within telemedicine hospitals. However, this new type of disease often requires more methodological approaches. Therefore, a patient/donor priority list may still be beneficial if decision makers keep in mind how to identify the importance of COVID-19 criteria from clinical prospective studies after collecting baseline information.
