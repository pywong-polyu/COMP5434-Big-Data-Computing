Specifically, deciding the response over months or several months requires accurate long-term forecasts which is particularly challenging as the model errors accumulate with time. A critical factor that can hinder accurate longterm forecasts, is the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases. While there have been early serology tests to estimate this number, more tests need to be conducted for more reliable results. To identify the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases, we take an epidemiology data-driven approach. We show that we can identify lower bounds on this ratio or upper bound on actual cases as a factor of reported cases. To do so, we propose an extension of our prior heterogeneous infection rate model, incorporating unreported/asymptomatic cases. We prove that the number of unreported cases can be reliably estimated only from a certain time period of the epidemic data. In doing so, we construct an algorithm called Fixed Infection Rate method, which identifies a reliable bound on the learned ratio. We also propose two heuristics to learn this ratio and show their effectiveness on simulated data. We use our approaches to identify the upper bounds on the ratio of actual to reported cases for New York City and several US states.

Due to a long period of social distancing, the infection dynamics are 'stable',i.e, the parameters that drive the number of cases can be assumed to be constant over the period. This is unlike the earlier phase when the world had just started taking precautions during which a single model with fixed parameters would not have been able to explain the trends. Using the data from this \"stable\" phase (see Figure 1 ) of social distancing phase and before the precautions are reduced, we may be able to observe the effect of unreported cases. We demonstrate that the probability of reporting can be reliably obtained only from certain parts of the time-series. This in turn provides an estimated upper bound on the number of total actual cases as a factor of number of reported cases. Particularly, we prove that the probability of reporting has a negligible effect on the trend of reported cases in the initial part of the epidemic. Therefore, during that period, we cannot reliably learn the reporting probability. On the other hand, we also prove that learned probability is not reliable using only the later phase of the epidemic. Thus, there is a certain time interval over which the learned bound on reporting probability is reliable. We leverage the fact that reporting probability has negligible effect on the initial part of the timeseries and significant impact in the later part to construct an algorithm termed Fixed Infection Rate method. Our method can guarantee that the obtained upper bound is close to the true upper-bound. We also propose two heuristics that attempt to learn this upper-bound without any guarantee.

On the other hand, complete isolation implies that a part of the population is removed and does not participate in the epidemic, effectively reducing the population by a constant factor.

The state-level timeseries were relatively less noisy, and were smoothed with moving average over one week. All the code was written in MATLAB and is available online 1 . We set k = 1 and J = 7 for the US counties and states. The choice for J was driven by observed weekly periodicity in the data [11] .

We attempted to retrieve the parameters (\u03b2,\u03b3 ) using our three learning approaches -Non-linear Incremental Learning NL(i), Non-linear Curve Fitting NL(f), and Fixed Infection Rate Learning (F). These methods learn the models fitted on data for T \u2208 (\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 ) for various intervals. Here, Fixed Infection Rate approach is simplified to use use (1, \u03c4 1 ) to first identify \u03b2, and (\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 ) to identify\u03b3 , without any reliability guarantee. Note that here, k = 2 and our reliability analysis applies only to k = 1. Regardless, we perform these experiments to observe the effect of k > 1. Figure 3 shows the fit along with forecasts until the end of the epidemic. Observe that for the interval (30, 50) all methods are able to accurately forecast. 'NL(i)' and 'NL(f)' are able to accurately forecast for the interval (50, 70). It also seems that the three methods accurately forecast by learning on the interval (70, 90). To assess whether these fits actually retrieve the values of \u03b3 , we present the learned parameters in Table 1 . Note that only for the interval (30, 50) all three methods are able to identify\u03b3 close to its original value, i.e., 0.1. While we were able to see accurate forecasts for the interval (70, 90), the learned values of\u03b3 are far from the true value. This reinforces our claim that there exists a certain window of data which is needed to accurately learn\u03b3 . Figure 4 shows the model fit obtained on New York City and Los Angeles. Recall that\u03b3 = (1 \u2212 \u03c1)\u03b3 , where \u03b3 is the probability of reporting an infected case. Therefore, 1/\u03b3 forms the upper bound on the estimated number of total cases as a factor of reported cases. We report these upper bounds in Table 2 . We have shown the factors obtained using 95% confidence interval on\u03b3 . Additionally, for Fixed Infection Rate learning, we have provided an additional bound Figure 4 suggests that all three methods produce good fit for New York City. Note that this factor provides an upper bound on the actual ratio of total to reported cases. As an illustration, if we agree that the bound obtained for NYC is 40 and \u03c1 = 0.5, i.e., half of the population was able to completely isolate itself reducing its probability of infection to zero, then the the number of true cases will 0.5 \u00d7 36, i.e, 18 times of the reported cases. On the other hand, none of the results for Los Angeles were sensible (see Table 2 ). 'OOR' indicates that the 95% confidence interval was out of the feasible range of the solution. For the method 'F', Test1 failed. It implies that it may be too early to reliably estimate the upper bound of this factor from Los Angeles data. Note that antibody tests in New York in April estimated that 24.7% of the entire population were infected 2 . Based on the population of New York City and the number of reported cases at the time, this translates to actual cases being roughly 13.8 times the reported cases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 753, "end": 761, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1195, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1559, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1853, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2021, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 2541, "end": 2548, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Simulation"}, {"text": "We also estimated the bound on the total number of actual cases as a factor of reported cases for various states.

Note that the state-wide antibodies study in early May estimated that 12.3% of the state population was infected 3 . This translates to actual cases being roughly 7.6 times the reported cases. For Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey, this factor is roughly 33-37, 27-31, and 19-21, with worst case upper bound being 40.86, 38.28, and 29.22, respectively. If we assume that these states are similar enough that they have the same probability \u03b3 of reporting and the same fraction of population that is completely isolated, then we can conclude that for all these states, the true cases cannot be more than 29.22 times, which satisfies all the upper bounds.

The algorithm is built upon key theorems that identify limitations of learnability of reporting probability. We have also proposed two heuristics that learn this bound but do not provide guarantees. We demonstrate through simulated experiments that all three methods are able to identify the bound correctly on certain regions of the epidemic. We emphasize that these algorithms learn\u03b3 which combines the effect of reporting probability and isolated population. Particularly, if a fraction \u03c1 of the total population completely isolates itself, thus getting removed from the epidemic, then\u03b3 = (1 \u2212 \u03c1)\u03b3 , where \u03b3 is the probability of reporting a case (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Hence,\u03b3 forms the lower limit for reporting probability. In other words we can find an upper bound on total number of infected cases. Applying our algorithm on the data during the social distancing phase, we conclude with high confidence that the actual number of cases cannot be more than 35 times in New York, 40 times in Illinois, 38 times in Massachusetts, and 29 times in New Jersey, than the reported cases. In future work, we will explore obtaining tighter bounds, when the precautions are relaxed and the fraction of isolated population \u03c1 is reduced.
