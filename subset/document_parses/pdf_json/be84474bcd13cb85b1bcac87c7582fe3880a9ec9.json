From the onset of the pandemic, patients with cancers appeared to be at increased risk for more serious illness with COVID-19 (Kuderer et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020; Sica et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 2020) . In such a chaotic time, with insufficient quality data available and limited knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, understanding the real impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients had quickly become a challenge for the thoracic cancer community.

Only smoking seemed to significantly correlate with higher death rates (Garassino et al., 2020) . Results from 1,000 patients were presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO2020) virtual congress and confirmed the significantly high mortality related to COVID-19 among the thoracic cancer patients included in the registry, evaluated at 32% (N = 326; note that a large proportion of patients were diagnosed early in the pandemic in the first wave in Europe and North America). The results of the multivariate analysis (Table 1) suggested that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 3 2 (OR 3.6: 95% CI 2.7-5), smoking history (OR 1.8: 95% CI 1.2-2.7), stage IV (OR 1.9: 95% CI 1.4-2.7), age >65 (OR 1.5: 95% CI 1.1-2.0), steroids >10 mg (OR 1.7: 95% CI 1.1-2.0), and chemotherapy or no treatment were significantly associated with negative outcomes.

However, global engagement required the collection of manageable and comparable data. The information recorded is based on an extensive literature review and reflects daily clinical practice at different cancer centers worldwide. The data collection focused on thoracic malignancies, mainly lung cancers, in order to guarantee the uniformity of the study population. Furthermore, to ensure the quality of the registry, TERAVOLT has established a data management system, including database managers, statisticians, and epidemiologists, to cover such aspects as data collection, data quality controls, error correction, data analyses, and reporting. A scientific steering committee has been established to ensure the timely dissemination of results and the effective, appropriate, and transparent use of data collected. Furthermore, the availability of similar or common clinical practice guidelines, the existence of standard protocols of care for thoracic malignancies accessible worldwide, and the involvement of academic cancer centers in Western countries have helped minimize possible information bias related to the treatment of the enrolled patients. Comprehensive knowledge of the predictive and prognostic factors for lung cancer ensured adjustment for known confounding factors at the time of analyses.",

To correctly interpret this information, however, the potential sources of bias (selection and information) that challenge observational studies need to be addressed. In this regard, TERAVOLT registry also has some limitations. It includes patients from countries with different socioeconomic levels and data from both academic and community hospitals; thus, it is not immune to generalizability issues. The first 200 TERAVOLT patients were mostly from Europe and were mostly registered from Italy, France, and Spain during the initial wave of the pandemic, which nearly overwhelmed the health care systems at that time. Thus, the geographical locations included in the initial cohort could partially explain the low number of intensive care unit admissions observed (Garassino et al., 2020) . Since the first publication, the countries contributing to TERAVOLT have increased significantly, including 20 countries across Europe and North and South America and a limited number from Asia and the rest of the world. As the pandemic continues to evolve, patient enrollment has been and will continue to be clearly determined by the geographical spread of SARS-CoV-2.",

Furthermore, the initial limited and subsequently growing knowledge about the pathology and natural history of SARS-CoV-2, together with increasing experience in treatment of the infection and evolution of surveillance criteria, may have influenced the collection of data regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In addition, TERAVOLT is envisioning long-term data collection to adequately contextualize the results of the registry in pandemic waves and to adapt data collection over time to capture additional information. TERAVOLT investigators have also launched an international patient questionnaire to determine perceived impact of the pandemic on their cancer care. A Dutch survey showed that 30% of patients have experienced consequences of COVID-19 on their treatment and follow-up visits, which makes patients very concerned about the impact of these decisions on their cancer outcome (de Joode et al., 2020) .",
