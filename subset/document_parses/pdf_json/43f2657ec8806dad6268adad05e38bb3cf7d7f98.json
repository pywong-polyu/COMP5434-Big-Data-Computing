While the summer ICONS conferences (see reports in APMR [1, 3] for details) are equally broad in scope as the seminars, the spring conferences are focused on a narrower subject, such as techniques, where the interaction of electron and nuclear spins play a pivotal role (ICONS-2, see APMR [2] for details) or the various flavors of hyperpolarization and NMR signal enhancement (present ICONS-4 installment). The main goal of the ICONS-4 focus was to present an overview about the current state-of-the-art of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP), Parahydrogen-based techniques (PHIP, SABRE), Chemically Induced Nuclear Polarization (CIDNP), Nitrogen Vacancies (NV), and Optical Pumping (SEOP) with the idea to further support and stimulate interactions among groups employing these techniques in EPR, NMR and MRI. To achieve this goal, twelve speakers were selected among the leading experts in these fields and invited to report at the conference.",
