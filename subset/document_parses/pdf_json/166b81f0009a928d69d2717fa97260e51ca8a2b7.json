            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented response in terms of clinical research activity. An important part of this research has been focused on randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate potential therapies for COVID-19. The results from this research need to be obtained as rapidly as possible. This presents a number of challenges associated with considerable uncertainty over the natural history of the disease and the number and characteristics of patients affected, and the emergence of new potential therapies. These challenges make adaptive designs for clinical trials a particularly attractive option. Such designs allow a trial to be modified on the basis of interim analysis data or stopped as soon as sufficiently strong evidence has been observed to answer the research question, without compromising the trial's scientific validity or integrity. In this paper we describe some of the adaptive design approaches that are available and discuss particular issues and challenges associated with their use in the pandemic setting. Our discussion is illustrated by details of four ongoing COVID-19 trials that have used adaptive designs.",

They are an essential component of an outbreak response (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). Ideally, a rapidly conducted trial will provide definitive evidence about an intervention, allowing its immediate wide-spread deployment in the field. A vaccine that reduces risk of infection has the potential to end an outbreak. Alternatively, a treatment that improves outcomes in those who are ill may reduce transmissions by encouraging infected individuals to visit clinics (to receive treatment), thereby reducing community spread.",

This poses a particular challenge as trials therefore need to be initiated and started before the natural history of the disease is fully understood (Baucher and Fontanarosa, 2020) . In the West African Ebola outbreak, clinical trials were devised, funded and initiated in record time. However, by the time most studies opened, the incidence of new cases was dropping and most studies failed to complete enrolment (Thielman et al., 2016) . A similar experience is now repeated in COVID-19 where early trials in China (e.g. Wang et al, 2020) were stopped prior to reaching the pre-planned sample sizes due to dwindling patient numbers and a large number of separate trials have been initiated investigating the same treatments. Such experience has led to some feeling that treatment trials conducted during one outbreak are about finding therapies to use during subsequent episodes of the disease, although this is certainly not always the case.",

We highlight the benefits provided by the flexibility of adaptive designs. Following the recent CONSORT extension for adaptive designs (Dimairo et al, 2020; Dimairo et al, 2018) , we define an adaptive design as \"A clinical trial design that offers pre-planned opportunities to use accumulating trial data to modify aspects of an ongoing trial while preserving the validity and integrity of that trial\". We provide a guide to the literature on statistical methods for such designs, briefly describing the main approaches and giving key references. We seek to remind readers that one must ensure that possible adaptations are considered in the final trial analysis, as some critics will otherwise raise questions about the scientific integrity of the study, and definitive trials are meant to resolve, not stir, controversy. We provide examples of COVID-19 trials that use different adaptive features and finally discuss some of the more challenging aspects of implementing adaptive designs during a major disease outbreak.",

These range in scope considerably, including an early (phase I/II) dosefinding platform, a confirmatory (phase III) trial, and two trials of COVID-19 patients embedded within previously-running trials. In all cases an adaptive design has been employed, the aim of which is to obtain a meaningful result from the trial as quickly as possible without any loss of scientific integrity. Our aim in including these examples is not to give a comprehensive review of COVID-19 research, or even a full description of each of these four trials, details of which can be found via the trial registration numbers given, but to highlight the nature and purpose of the adaptive design approach used in each case. More detailed descriptions of the different methodological approaches used for the adaptive designs are then given in Section 3.",

The AGILE-ACCORD (ACcelerating COVID-19 dRug Development, EudraCT 2020-001860-27) trial is a randomized seamless phase I/II trial platform in which multiple different candidate treatments, potentially in different populations, can be evaluated. Each candidate compound entering the platform undergoes dose-escalation initially to establish its safety profile. Safe doses are then graduated into a Bayesian adaptive group-sequential (GS) phase in which the efficacy of the doses is established. For each compound, the trial is seamless in that the efficacy data observed during the dose-escalation phase of the trial are used in the efficacy phase, and similarly safety information from the efficacy phase contributes to the safety model.",

In recent decades, however, there has been a rise of adaptive designs for clinical trials in all phases of drug development Suppose we want to perform a clinical trial to test whether an experimental treatment is superior to control (placebo or current standard of care). Measuring the benefit of the novel treatment over control by \uf071, we want to test the one-sided null hypothesis H0: \uf071 \u2264 0 versus the alternative H1: \uf071 > 0. In order to claim control of the type I error rate for the trial, the probability of incorrectly rejecting H0 must not exceed a pre-specified level \uf061. The need to maintain strict control of the type I error rate is well established, particularly in the context of late-phase studies (Lewis, 1999) where a typical choice for \uf061 is 0.025. In many situations, however, clinical trials have several objectives. For example, trialists may want to compare several experimental treatments or active doses with control, or evaluate the effect of a novel treatment in several patient subgroups. In this setting, a trial begins testing m null hypotheses H0i: \uf071i \u2264 0, for i = 1, ..., m, and often is designed to maintain strong control of the family-wise error rate (FWER) at some level \u03b1, which is achieved if the probability of rejecting one or more true null hypotheses does not exceed \u03b1. The requirement to control the FWER is similar to that of controlling the type I error rate in that it restricts the probability of making a false claim of efficacy.",

To address such uncertainties, it is tempting to learn from accumulating data and adapt if necessary. Adaptations of interest for COVID-19 trials may include early stopping for futility or efficacy at an interim analysis, sample size reassessment, change of allocation ratio or modification of the primary endpoint in a data dependent way. For all adaptive design approaches, data dependent changes may introduce bias and, particularly for late stage trials, appropriate statistical methods must be used to preserve the type I error rate.

If an extraordinarily large benefit of the experimental treatment over control is observed at an interim analysis, it is desirable to have the option to stop the trial for efficacy with early rejection of the null hypothesis. In case such an option is incorporated, a multiple testing problem emerges which needs to be handled by adjusting the local significance levels for the interim and final analysis in order to maintain the nominal type I error rate. In GS trials with one or more interim looks, this can be done by using adjusted rejection regions tailored to pre-specified interim analysis irrelevant or negative treatment effects, in order to prevent harm to patients and to enable resources to be diverted to more promising interventions. A futility rule can either be binding in the sense that it needs to be strictly adhered to at the interim analysis, or non-binding, meaning that the rule may also not be followed. While binding futility rules allow for a relaxation of the local significance levels, non-binding rules can be regarded as more advantageous from a practical perspective due to their increased flexibility. However, the type II error rate increases with the use of a non-binding futility rule, requiring an increased sample size to achieve the target power.",

At an interim analysis, each experimental arm is compared against control using all patients with outcome information up to that point: experimental arms with test statistics below the futility boundary have further recruitment stopped and experimental arms with test statistics above the efficacy boundary can be concluded to be effective (and the respective null hypothesis rejected). Setting stopping boundaries is not trivial, but can be done using analytical formulae , which sets a fixed number of arms to progress at each interim analysis. An advantage of this is that the design has a fixed sample size (in contrast to a random sample size for the approach described above). The main disadvantage is that it may lead to dropping of promising arms if there are more than the design is permitted to take forward. Approaches that combine the drop-the-losers approach with pre-specified stopping boundaries have been proposed to allow early stopping for futility and efficacy. Most of the methods above assume normally distributed outcomes with known variance.",

As mentioned in Section 3.3, many GS trials are monitored according to the alphaspending function approach (Lan and DeMets, 1983) , and accommodating early termination in this framework is relatively straightforward. At the final analysis, we choose the critical value of the test so as to 'spend' all the remaining type I error rate. Choosing the final critical value in this way preserves the type I error rate of the trial, although there will be a drop in power relative to the originally planned design. CIs and p-values based on the stagewise ordering of the test's outcome space can be calculated conditioning on the observed sequence of information levels (Fairbanks and Madsen, 1982, Tsiatis et al., 1984) . A similar idea can be used to reach a final hypothesis decision in a GS trial which does not follow an alpha-spending design: one finds the critical value for the final analysis so that the trial has type I error rate \uf061 given the observed information levels and the test boundaries used at previous interim analyses.",

Combining data across studies in a meta-analysis will increase the statistical information available for estimating a target treatment effect. If we prospectively intend to update the meta-analysis as each new study is published, the cumulative results should be monitored using a GS test in order to avoid over-interpretation of random highs and lows in treatment effect estimates, and inflation of the type I and type II error rates (Berkey et al., 1996) . Different approaches have been proposed for monitoring a cumulative meta-analysis (Simmonds et al., 2017) . Sequential meta-analysis approaches use GS boundaries to monitor standardized Z statistics obtained from random-effects metaanalyses. For example, boundaries could be from a triangular GS test or a restricted procedure using a 'Christmas tree' correction for discrete monitoring (Whitehead, 1997b, Higgins and Whitehead, 2011) , or an alpha-spending test spending type I error as a function of the estimated proportion of the target information level accumulated thus far. The DerSimonian-Laird (1986) estimate of the between-study heterogeneity may be unstable in the early stages of a cumulative meta-analysis when few studies are available, so that estimated information levels may decrease between successive interim analyses (Higgins and Whitehead, 2011) . With (very) few studies also Bayesian approaches with weakly informative priors for the between-study heterogeneity were found to be more robust than standard methods (Friede et al, 2017) . It may be possible to reduce between-study heterogeneity and increase borrowing across studies by leveraging data on baseline covariates, either in a meta-regression approach if only aggregate data are available, or in models for patient responses if individual patient data are available.",

Therefore, the DMC is \"responsible for [\u2026] protecting trial integrity and patient safety\" (Herson, 2009) . Although all trials require safety monitoring, this does not mean that a DMC needs to be established for all trials. However, safety monitoring by a DMC is recommended \"for any controlled trial of any size that will compare rates of mortality or major morbidity\" or more specifically for a \"population at elevated risk of death or other serious outcomes, even when the study objective addresses a lesser endpoint\" (FDA, 2006) , which is likely to be the case for any COVID-19 trial. Compared to other studies, COVID-19 trials might be shorter with faster recruitment (given the pandemic situation) and shorter length of follow-up (e.g. restricted to length of stay in hospital). For safety monitoring by a DMC this, in turn, requires shorter review intervals, which might lead to weekly safety reviews in some instances. This has obvious consequences for logistics in terms of data management, statistical analyses, as well as the required availability and commitment of the DMC members. Given these demands it might be practical to set up committees to monitor not only an individual trial but to oversee several trials on a programme level. This would not be uncommon for trials investigating the same compound, but in COVID-19 might be applied also to settings where different compounds are being investigated by the same sponsor. This would also enable the DMC to consider data emerging from other ongoing trials in their decision making, allowing them to integrate rapidly increasing and changing information. This type of oversight committee tends to be larger than the standard DMC which typically comprises two physicians and one statistician, since a wider range of expertise might be required and several regions might need to be represented. In the case of adaptive designs or complex platform trials, the DMC might be charged with extra responsibilities beyond safety monitoring. For example, when performing a formal interim analyses, the DMC might make recommendations regarding treatment or subgroup selection, as well as futility stopping or sample size re-estimation. Since COVID-19 trials often use quickly observed endpoints, such adaptations might still be meaningful, although the trials might be quite short overall given rapid recruitment.",

Regulatory principles of subgroup selection are given in the EMA guideline on the investigation of subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials (EMA, 2019), to be applied in case a positive effect has been established in the overall population but plausible heterogeneity with respect to efficacy and severe side effects asks for a refinement of the population.",

The time limiting factor should be identification of candidate treatments, and not the development of a statistical design. Hence, research on trial designs that are most suitable for the purposes of a pandemic should become a research topic that goes beyond the actual case in order to be better prepared for future pandemics.",

Debates about trial design, including whether \"best available care\" can vary amongst centers and whether Bayesian or frequentist approaches are appropriate should be settled between pandemics, and not re-opened when they strike. It might be supposed that such a generic approach is impossible and that the design cannot be created without details of the natural history of the disease or the specification of candidate treatments. However, in almost all cases the primary patient response will be status, a certain number of D days after randomization, classified as dead/severely ill/moderately ill/recovered. The magnitude of differences between treatments can be conveniently assessed in terms of odds-ratios, and an odds-ratio of 2 is almost always clinically important. A potential generic design has been suggested by Horby (2017, 2018 ) that might be a starting point in the search for a suitable vehicle. Perhaps the COVID-19 experience will motivate the clinical trials community to devise and agree upon such a generic design once the current pandemic subsides.",

The primary endpoint for COVID-19 patients entering REMAP-CAP is a composite of inhospital death and the number of ICU free days over 21 days, thus forming a 23-point ordinal scale, i.e. -1 (death), 0, 1, \u2026, 21. Adult patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 are enrolled into the COVID-19 stratum of REMAP-CAP, on an open-label basis, and classified into severe (in ICU) or moderate (hospitalized but not in ICU) disease states. Within each disease state, there are multiple domains, each of which is a set of mutually exclusive interventions. An example is the antiviral domain comprising four interventions: (1) no antiviral; (2) lopinavir/ritonavir; (3) hydroxychloroquine; (4) lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine combination. The trial is adaptive so that new domains or interventions can be added at any time. Sites do not necessarily need to include all of the available domains or interventions.",

They increase efficiency by comparing multiple experimental treatments against a shared control group (Parmar et al., 2014), while the adaptive design allows early stopping of non-promising (or highly efficacious) arms using pre-specified decision rules (Wason and Jaki, 2012). Platform trial designs (Meyer et al, 2020) allow new experimental treatments to be added as the trial progresses and often start as, or become, MAMS trials. Platform trials provide notable operational efficiency (Schiavone et al., 2019) since evaluation of a new treatment within an existing trial will typically be much quicker than setting up a new trial. For a more detailed review of adaptive clinical trial designs, we refer the interested reader to Bauer et al. (2016) and Pallmann et al. (2018), and the references therein. For a technical description of the methods for confirmatory clinical trials, we refer to the book of Wassmer and Brannath (2016).

The authors showed that if adaptive designs are properly implemented, then such innovative designs are well accepted by health authorities. Strict control of the type I error rate can be achieved by using pre-specified adaptation rules such as early stopping boundaries in GS designs (Jennison and Turnbull 1999, Todd 2007) or blinded sample size reassessment rules when estimating nuisance parameters at an interim analysis (Wittes and Brittain 1990; Birkett and Day 1994; Friede and Kieser, 2006). However, pre-specified designs do not permit unplanned modifications. To allow for further flexibility, fully adaptive designs have been suggested which allow adaptations not completely specified in the adaptation rule while still controlling the type I error rate. Many designs of this type use p-value combination tests (Bauer, 1989; Bauer and K\u00f6hne, 1994) to allow for more flexible decision making, while still preserving the integrity of the design. Alternatively, designs follow the conditional error principle (Proschan and Hunsberger 1995; M\u00fcller and Sch\u00e4fer 2001, 2004",

GS stopping rules for efficacy can also be incorporated in adaptive designs using a combination test approach(Bauer & K\u00f6hne 1994, Lehmacher & Wassmer 1999 or the conditional error principle(Proschan & Hunsberger 1995, M\u00fcller & Sch\u00e4fer 2001.

The stopping and selection rules are pre-planned, meaning that the trial must be conducted according to the pre-specified rules. This can be generalized to a flexible confirmatory adaptive approach(Magirr et al., 2014) which is usually based on the combination testing principle(Bauer, 1989). This principle can be applied for testing multiple hypothesesby use of the closed testing principle (Bauer et al., 2016; Bauer and K\u00f6hne, 1994; Bretz et al., 2009; Wassmer and Brannath, 2016; Posch et al., 2005). An application is the multi-arm setting where, for example, treatment arms can be selected and sample sizes for the selected treatment arms can be recalculated based on the observed response (Bauer and Kieser 1999; Posch et al. 2005; Koenig et al 2008; Magirr et al 2014; Wassmer and Brannath, 2016). For these designs, the adaptation rules, need not be pre-specified. Consequently, this approach allows for testing in MAMS trials controlling the FWER in a strong sense. R packages are available for confirmatory adaptive designs in the multi-arm setting, such as asd (Parsons et al., 2012; Friede et al, 2020) and rpact (rpact, 2020), with MAMS (Jaki et al., 2019) also having an extension for dealing with unexpected design modifications. Some MAMS trials use adaptive randomization (AR) to guide allocation to better performing arms. In a multi-arm setting, if the shared control group is kept separate from the AR procedure, this maintains the power at a high level (Trippa et al., 2012; Wason and Trippa, 2014; Williamson and Villar, 2020; Viele et al., 2020). Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to AR can be used, although in practice it is more common to use a Bayesian approach. AR has been criticized for being susceptible to temporal trends in the trial (Thall et al. 2015, Proschan and Evans, 2020), which may be possible in COVID-19 settings due to mutation of the virus. However, if the allocation to the shared control group is maintained, there is little impact on the statistical properties of the trial (Villar et al., 2018). Another type of MAMS design is the drop-the-losers design (Sampson and Sill, 2005; Wason et al, 2017)",

            "text": "Magirr et al. (2012), Wason et al (2017) and Robertson and Wason, (2019) describe how FWER control can be achieve in a MAMS design. However, there has been debate about which type of multiplicity adjustment, e.g. pair-wise or family-wise, is needed for a multi-armed design (Wason et al., 2014; Howard et al. 2018; Stallard et al. 2019; Collignon et al. 2020). Generally, the decision will be determined by the relative importance of making a type I error and a type II error, as correcting for multiple testing reduces the power. In a platform setting, it is more difficult to formally control the FWER unless it is known in advance how many treatments will be tested. New methods for online control of error rates may provide a way of doing this if it is required (Robertson and Wason, 2018). Most methodology work in MAMS has focused on settings with a shared control group. In the case of no obvious control group, we would refer the reader to the Magaret et al. (2016) and the motivating example in Whitehead et al. (2020). When there is a shared control group, the relative allocation between control and experimental treatments can affect the power. A natural choice is to randomize patients equally between each available treatment. One can gain a small amount of power by increasing the allocation to the control group (Wason et al. 2016; Wassmer, 2011; Viele et al, 2020), although in a MAMS study the optimal allocation depends on the likelihood of dropping arms only. Setting the allocation ratio of new arms in a platform study can also be optimized (Bennett and Mander, 2020).",

Naive point estimators that assume a twoarm single-stage design can be substantially biased for an adaptive trial because of the possibility of stopping early for futility or overwhelming effect (Whitehead, 1986; Koopmeiners et al., 2012) and/or selecting the most promising experimental treatments at an interim analysis (Bauer et al, 2010; Carreras and Brannath, 2013; Kimani et al., 2013). For twostage trials, conditional on the trial continuing to stage 2, the selection rule and the treatments continuing to stage 2, several uniformly minimum variance conditional unbiased estimators (UMVCUEs) exist (Kimani et al., 2013; Cohen and Sackrowitz, 1989; Bowden and Glimm, 2008; Robertson et al., 2016; Stallard and Kimani, 2018). The UMVCUEs can have large mean squared errors (MSEs) and are computed if the trial continues to stage 2. Alternative shrinkage estimators that are based on empirical Bayes approaches tend to have smaller MSEs but they are not necessarily unbiased (Carreras and Brannath, 2013; Brueckner et al., 2017). Estimators that also reduce bias when a trial stops in stage 1 exist (Carreras and Brannath, 2013; Shen, 2001; Stallard and Todd, 2005) as well as generalizations to multiple stages (Whitehead et al., 2020). Naive CIs can have incorrect coverage. When an adaptive design selects the most effective experimental treatment in stage 1, among the methods that adjust for adaptation (Stallard and Todd, 2005; Sampson and Sill, 2005; Wu, Wang and Yang, 2010; Magirr et al., 2013), the Sampson and Sill (2005) method performs best in terms of coverage while the approach of Wu et al. (2010) is the most straightforward for computing CIs (Kimani et al., 2014). Methods for computing CIs with other selection rules are available (Magirr et al., 2013, Neal et al., 2011).One of these methods allows continuing with multiple experimental treatments in stage 2 but sometimes the computed CIs are non-informative(Magirr et al., 2013).",

            "text": ", to gain efficiency by using data across different doses of the compound, a modelbased approach that stipulates a parametric relationship for the underlying differences should be used. This, in turn, poses a challenge in terms of how to select the dose-response model. To overcome this, an MCP-Mod approach which considers several candidate models (Bretz et al, 2005; Pinheiro et al., 2014), or a model-averaging approach (Buckland et al, 1997) can be used.",

In addition, the time span and course of the disease up to the time of study inclusion is prognostic for the outcome. For the design of clinical trials this implies that the inclusion criteria have a strong impact on the distribution of the primary endpoint and the corresponding sample size planning. Furthermore, in the analysis of the clinical trial, the precision of treatment effect estimates can be substantially improved by adjusting for important covariates in the analysis. Also, stratified randomization according to the risk factors can improve the efficiency of the design.An important question is to what extent the prognostic factors are also predictive for the efficacy of the treatment. For example, for anti-viral drugs it is usually assumed that efficacy is largest when treatment starts early after infection. However, co-morbidities and demographic variables can also play a role in the mechanism of action or affect the safety profile. If the treatment effect varies across subgroups that are defined by baseline characteristics, treatment effect estimates are only meaningful for a well-defined patient population. In addition, subgroup analyses will be critical to better understand the treatment effect. Challenges are the typically small sample sizes in subgroups and the multiplicity problem connected with multiple analyses. Adaptive enrichment designs can be a useful tool in this context (see e.g. Friede et al, 2020 for a recent overview). Based on interim results, they allow one to increase the sample size in specific subgroups or to restrict randomization to these populations, while controlling frequentist error rates(Ondra et al. 2019(Ondra et al. , 2016Chiu et al., 2018). However, pre-specification of subgroups can be difficult, especially for quantitative predictive factors (e.g. time from the onset of the disease), where thresholds need to be pre-specified in order to define the corresponding sub-populations. If there is not enough prior information to select a single threshold, subgroup analyses with multiple thresholds can be implemented if an appropriate adjustment for multiple testing is foreseen(Graf et al., 2019(Graf et al., , 2020.",

It should be possible to suspend recruitment to a trial during times when the disease is under control and to resume if it re-emerges (Dean et al., 2020). The use of adaptive platform designs, in particular for clinical trials in COVID-19, has been proposed by a number of authors (Baucher and Fontanarosa, 2020, Murthy et al., 2020) and, as illustrated by the examples given in Section 2, a range of sequential and adaptive design methods are being employed in ongoing clinical trials. Although not a focus of this paper, adaptive design methods also provide valuable tools to allow for modification of trials in other diseases necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic (Kunz et al, 2020).",
