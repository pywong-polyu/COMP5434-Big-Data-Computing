LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonists can be used for the treatment of dry eye disease, such as Lifitegrast which has been approved by the FDA in 2016 as a new drug for the treatment of dry eye disease. In this study, we designed and synthesized some new structure compounds that are analogues to Lifitegrast, and their biological activities were evaluated by in vitro cell-based assay and also by in vivo mouse dry eye model. Our results demonstrated that one of these analogues of Lifitegrast (compound 1b) showed good LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonist activity in in vitro assay; meanwhile, it also significantly reduced ocular surface epithelial cells damage, increased goblet cell density in dry eye mouse and highly improved the symptoms of dry eye mouse.",

            "text": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a complex, multifactorial condition characterized by inflammation of the ocular surface and lacrimal glands, as well as the reduction in the quality and/or quantity of tears [1] . DED can be categorized as \"dry eye with reduced tear production (aqueous deficient) and dry eye with increased evaporation of the tear film known as the hyperevaporative type\" [2] . Dry eye patients suffer from ocular-related symptoms, such as stinging, burning, itching, light sensitivity, and blurry vision which limit the quality of their life, as well as their ability to work [3] . The prevalence of DED is between 5% and 50% in the different countries, and this prevalence can be up to 75% in adults over age 40, with mostly female patients. In adults aged 18-40, 2.7% of these people have had an experience of DED [4] . Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) is a leukocyte cell surface glycoprotein widely expressed on cells of a hematopoietic lineage [5] . Previous functional studies indicated that intercellular-adhesion molecule-1 functions as a ligand for LFA-1-dependent adhesion by a variety of leukocytes [6] . LFA-1 functions are extremely varied but play a critical role in facilitating effective immune responses. It has been reported that LFA-1 was implicated in numerous autoimmune and inflammatory conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, diabetes, and arthritis [7] . The previous study suggested that LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction may play important roles in the cell-mediated immune response and inflammation associated with DED. Notably, inhibition of LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding offers a novel and possible approach to reducing ocular surface inflammation in this condition [8] .",

Lifitegrast (Fig. 1) is a small molecule that inhibits T-cell-mediated inflammation by blocking the binding of LFA-1 and ICAM-1, thus lessening overall inflammatory responses [9] . In vitro, Lifitegrast potently inhibited the attachment of LFA-1 to ICAM-1 in a concentration-dependent manner, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 2.98 nmol/L [10] . The results from the phase 3 clinic trial of Lifitegrast have shown its ability to improve ocular surface epithelial health and associated symptoms of dry eye patients, thereby demonstrating its potential as a relatively fast-acting second-generation agent for the treatment of DED [11] . Lifitegrast became the second topical anti-inflammatory agent which has been approved by the FDA in 2016 for the treatment of DED [12] .",

Such high concentrations result in many side effects, such as ocular irritation, dysgeusia and reduced visual acuity, especially an unusual taste sensation in the mouth. The LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonist activity of Lifitegrast is not high enough to overcome these side effects. Therefore, it is very interesting to find novel higher LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonist activity compounds. The discovery process and structure-activity relationships (SARs) of Lifitegrast were reported in a previous report [13] . So far, no other medicinal chemistry studies about Lifitegrast analogues have been reported. In this study, a novel series of Lifitegrast analogues with systematic modifications were further designed, synthesized, and their activities as LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonists were evaluated by in vitro and in vivo assays.",

            "text": "Previous SAR studies have shown that an aromatic group in the \"left-wing\" residue is necessary for LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonist activity [15] . Therefore, we attempted to link tetrahydroisoquinoline and benzofuran with different groups (Fig.  2, 1a-1c) to investigate the LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonist activity. In order to investigate the effect of X groups with different electron-absorbing properties and different sizes on the activity, we selected sulfone group, N-methylene carbamoyl and methylene carbonyl as substituents. Meanwhile, the effects of substitution of benzofuran with different aromatic groups (Fig. 2, 1d-1e ) on the activity were investigated. Although benzotriazole and benzofuran have different atomic compositions, they are both benzo five-membered rings. From the activity results of benzotriazole, it can be seen whether there is a more suitable Ar 1 group. Ethynylbenzene was selected to investigate whether Ar 1 ring opening would have a significant effect on activity. At the same time, we incorporated different aromatic groups into \"right-wing\" amino acids (Fig. 2, 1f-1j ) to investigate the LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonist activity. We cyclized methylsulfonyl with phenyl and converted methylsulfonylphenyl to benzene six-membered rings such as quinoline and 2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin to investigate the effect of cyclization and different group size on the activity. According to the results of previous studies, Lifitegrast is located in the I-domain allosteric site of LFA-1/ICAM-1. Ar 2 group of Lifitegrast interact with the protein mainly through hydrogen-bonds with residues such as Tyr257 and Lys287 [16] . Therefore, methylsulfonyl group was converted to acetyl group and hydroxyl group to change the interaction mode of the hydrogen bond between Ar 2 with the protein to investigate the effect on the activity.",

With Lifitegrast as a lead compound, in the \"left-wing\" residue, changing carbonyl group in Lifitegrast to sulfone group (compound 1a), or changing furyl to triazole (compound 1d) or acetenyl (compound 1e) decreased LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonist activity obviously when compared with Lifitegrast. The activity of compound 1a showed that the carbonyl group could not be replaced by the more electron-absorbing sulfone group between benzofuran and tetrahydroisoquinoline, probably because the charge distribution of the whole molecule was affected. The charge distribution of triazole is quite different from that of furyl, which may contribute to the poor activity of compound 1d. The ring structure of benzofuran was opened is the reason for the poor activity of compound 1e, indicating that the ring structure plays an important role in the activity. While the carbonyl was changed to the N-methylene carbamoyl (compound 1b) and methylene carbonyl (compound 1c), the analogues show certain LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonist activity. This result indicated that the length of the carbonyl between benzofuran and tetrahydroisoquinoline can be appropriately extended without adversely affecting the binding of the molecule to the target protein. The IC 50 value of compound 1b reached the level of 262 nM, this result suggested that the LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonist activity can be maintained or even improved by only changing the X group to the other groups. In the \"right-wing\" Ar 2 residue of the Lifitegrast, replacing methylsulfonyl benzene with quinoline (compound 1f), 1-dioxido-2,3-dihydrobenzothiophen (compound 1g), 2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin (compound 1h), 3acetyl-4-hydroxyphenyl (compound 1i) or 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl (compound 1j) respectively decreased LFA-1/ ICAM-1 antagonist activity. The cyclization of the sulfone group with benzene (compound 1g) resulted in a loss of activity because of the influence on the binding mode of the sulfone group to the target protein. Meanwhile, the IC 50 value of compounds 1f and 1h also reached several micromol levels. These results showed that replacing the Ar 2 residue with benzene six-membered ring could not improve the LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonist activity, this may be related to increasing the size of the AR 2 group. Conversion of methylsulfonyl group to acetyl or hydroxyl groups on benzene ring also could not produce good activity. This result indicated that adding hydroxyl groups to the benzene ring did not increase the hydrogen bond interaction between the analogues and the target protein.",

            "text": "The Lifitegrast eye drops showed a statistically significant reduction in ocular surface injury compared to the model control group, and the effect was stronger than compound 1b. As shown in Fig. 4 , 5% and 7% compound 1b significantly reduced ocular surface epithelial cell damage in dry eye mice. 5% and 7% compound 1b reduced the damage of corneal epithelium in dry eye mice model. The conjunctiva goblet cells secrete the mucin to maintain the stability of the tear film. The symptoms of dry eye are usually accompanied by a decreasing of the number or density of goblet cells. We evaluated the effect of 5% and 7% compound 1b on goblet cells in dry eye mice model. A statistical histogram of goblet cell density is shown in Fig. 5 . 5% and 7% compound 1b significantly increased goblet cell density and improved dry eye symptoms in mice with dry eye. As shown in Fig. 6 , 5% and 7% compound 1b has a protective effect on apoptosis of ocular surface cells in dry-eye mice, but the effect is weaker than that of Lifitegrast. The results from our in vivo animal model experiments showed that topical administration of 5% and 7% (W/ V) compound 1b improved the dry eye symptoms through reducing the ocular surface injuries, increasing the density of goblet cells on conjunctival epithelium and decreasing the apoptosis of cornea and conjunctiva. There was no statistical difference in the effect between 5% and 7% compound 1b. There was no statistical difference in the effect between 5% and 7% compound 1b. The in vitro assay showed the IC 50 value of compound 1b reached the level of 262 nM which is lower than that of Lifitegrast (IC 50 value is about 11 nM). This result suggested that the LFA-1/ICAM- Fig. 4 Effect of compound 1b on ocular surface damage in dry eye mice. After 14 days treatment on dry eye mice model, ocular surface of mice were stained with fluorescein sodium, the green fluorescence staining points represent the damaged area of ocular surface epithelium (A-F), and the corneal fluorescence staining score in graph A-F were calculated and shown in a bar graph (G).

The Jurkat cell attachment assay was used to assess the LFA-1/ ICAM-1 antagonist activity of these 10 analogues of Lifitegrast. Among them, the IC 50 value of compound 1b reached 262 nM. To further verify the biological activity of compound 1b in vivo, dry eye mice model was developed to investigate if compound 1b could improve the symptoms of dry eye. The results of animal model demonstrated that 5%(W/V) compound 1b significantly improved the symptoms of dry eye mice through reducing ocular surface epithelial cells damage, increasing goblet cell density and decreasing the apoptosis of cornea and conjunctiva in dry eye mice. The results of this study encourage us to further optimize the structure of compound 1b in our future work, looking for a compound with a better LFA-1/ICAM-1 antagonist activity.",

All animal experimental protocols in this study were also approved by the animal ethics committee of He University. Thirty female C57/BL6 mice (age range, 6-8 weeks) were purchased from Liaoning Changsheng Biotechnology Co., LTD. The animals were divided into 6 groups (each group, n = 5): blank control group, model control group, two compound 1b treatment groups (concentrations: 5% and 7% W/V), vehicle control group treated with the vehicle of compound 1b solution and positive control group treated with 5% Lifitegrast. The dry eye model of mice was created by intelligent environment control system combined with drug induction. Two-step dehumidification method was used to control the environmental humidity, The relative humidity in the room was reduced to 40 \u00b1 5% using the temperature dehumidifier, and the intelligent dehumidifier (dehumidification range RH 10-80%) is used to further reduce the humidity of the cabinet. At the same time, the air flow in the cabinet were maintained at 2.1 \u00b1 0.2 m/s by the ventilator located 20 cm from the mouse cages in the cabinet. Through the above measures, humidity, temperature and air flow are effectively regulated. C57/BL6 mice were exposed to dry conditions (RH = 15; WV = 2 m/s; T = 21-23\u00b0C) for 14 days, subcutaneously were injected to hindquarters alternately with scopolamine hydrobrominde (0.5 mg/0.2 ml) three times a day (9:00 am, 1:00 PM, 4:00 pm) for 14 days to induce dry eye symptoms [30] . At the same time of dry eye development, the treatment groups mice were administrated on the surface of the both eyeball with 5 \u00b5L compound 1b eye drops, or treated with Lifitegrast (5%, USA) individually, and treatment with the vehicle of compound 1b solution was used as vehicle control group. There were 5 mice in each group, and twice a day for topical administration of drugs (at 9:00 am and 3:00 pm, respectively).",
