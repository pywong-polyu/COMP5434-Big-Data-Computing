Current knowledge regarding the behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is very limited, although its RNA has been detected in faeces of symptomatic (Holshue et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020) and asymptomatic individuals Tang et al., 2020) , and in municipal wastewater in different countries, starting in the Netherlands (Medema et al., 2020) .

It is known that enveloped viruses, due to the presence of a lipid bilayer surrounding the protein capsid, have a different affinity to non-enveloped viruses, with a greater tendency to adsorb to solid and/or colloidal particles (Ye et al., 2016) . This was experimentally proved to occur for two enveloped viruses: Murine coronavirus MHV (murine hepatitis virus) and Pseudomonas phage \u03d56 (Ye et al., 2016) . Therefore, most probably, SARS-CoV-2 and particles thereof are indeed hydrophobic and, accordingly, they would be associated to the solids and/or colloidal material. Yet, most of the current literature concerning SARS-CoV-2 or its genetic material in wastewater deals with their presence in the water phase and very little attention has been paid to their fate in the sludge line, with the exception of the work carried out by Peccia et al.

Being sludge and the water effluents the main outflows from a WWTP, it is important to ascertain whether SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in these streams. However, whether the absence or detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material can lead to any conclusion on the infectivity of water or sludge remains to be ascertained.",

The sludge treatment is very heterogeneous in WWTPs as large plants often feature anaerobic digestion treatment, usually at moderate temperatures (35-40\u00b0C) and long residence times (10-20 days), which would help to inactivate the possible viral load. Furthermore, thermal hydrolysis or similar thermal treatment of sludge is increasingly common in large WWTPs and provides effective inactivation of viral inputs. In contrast, in smaller plants sludge can receive a mere heat drying treatment before being shipped to an authorized manager, or even just centrifugation to reduce its water content.",

Properly operated settlers would lead to sludge streams with steady solid contents despite incoming rain in sewerage. Among the different sludge streams in a WWTP, solid concentration in thickeners seems to be much more stable than the characteristics of the primary influent thanks to characteristics of the thickening stage and to the comparably larger retention time.

The titers in raw wastewater are in the low range compared to other results currently reported. For instance, titers were reported from 2 to 20 cp/mL in Istanbul (Turkey) area WWTPs (Kocamemi et al., 2020a) , 5-20 cp/mL in a WWTP in Massachussets increasing to 100-1000 cp/mL in Murcia region, Spain (Randazzo et al., 2020b) and 50-3000 cp/mL in Paris, France (Wurtzer et al., 2020) . Foladori et al. (2020) , in probably the first review of the work rapidly being reported on SARS-CoV-2 content in wastewater, point out to very different levels of loadings in WWTP, with a range of 20 copies/L to 3\u00b710 6 copies/L. According to these authors, many factors are identified as responsible for this large range, including the occurrence of rainwater in combined sewers, the high variability of the viral load in faeces (up to 4 orders of magnitude) and methodological differences in sampling, concentration and quantification. Such a large variability in the detected virus loadings suggests that a widely standardised methodology would be required to obtain more comparable figures. Still, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be based on timecomparison of measurements from the same location and that comparisons between different sites will be inaccurate.",

Another potential mechanism of transmission of airborne viruses is the production of aerosol in secondary treatment, particularly if aeration is provided by horizontal rotors or surface turbines (Gotkowska-P\u0142achta et al., 2013; S\u00e1nchez-Monedero et al., 2008) .

On the 5th sampling day (April 21st) it can be seen, that virus RNA is detected in the outflow of the primary settler. This is consistent with a partition between the water and the sludge line and would correspond with the high loading detected in the primary sludge (24 cp/mL). From these results it is concluded that the virus particles are mostly diverted to the sludge line although RNA degradation may also contribute to their absence in the water line beyond the primary settler. Interestingly, the virus RNA concentration increases in the thickeners which have a longer retention time, (approximately 24 h) and a higher solid content. In the interpretation of results from Table 3 , it must be understood that a WWTP should not be seen as a \"plug-flow\" but as a complex system with many recirculation streams to the plant inlet. As an example, it is seen that the virus RNA detected in the thickeners on the 5th sampling day is lower than in the remaining streams and in contrast with the very high loading of the primary sludge. However, the thickeners integrate the incoming concentration of the previous 24 h and therefore are not a complete correspondence to the primary sludge of the same day. Interestingly, the solid concentration in the thickened sludge is significantly lower on April 21st compared to the rest of days (less than 30% of the solid concentration of the remaining days), which can be related to maintenance and washing and may explain the low virus RNA loadings.",

            "text": "It is seen that the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material is systematically higher in some sludge sampling spots (particularly at primary sludge and thickened sludge) compared to the influent samples (Table 3) . This result confirms one of the hypotheses of this work, namely that the affinity of virus particles for biosolids would divert the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 towards the sludge line. Peccia et al. (2020) also pointed out at the sludge line as suitable for indication or detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the population. Although the number of samples analysed in this work is limited and replication in other WWTPs is required, this finding suggests that detecting COVID-19 incidence in the population in the sludge might have a higher sensitivity than in the wastewater\u2026 In this WWTP, the primary settler and the sludge thickeners would act in effect as \"concentrators\" of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. Furthermore, the retention times in sludge thickeners (~24 h) are usually higher than in primary settlers (~1-2 h). In small WWTPs with limitations of staff or instrumental (in particular flowproportional automatic samplers), these spots could replace or complement the influent as the preferred spot for sampling. This higher retention time results in dampening the potential variations of SARS-CoV-2 particles in wastewater in an even more effective way than taking composite samples. Such a buffering is not helpful when the phenomenon to be monitored has fast dynamics, but in the case of COVID-19 population incidence, the desired monitoring dynamics would be in the order of days, making both the thickened and the primary sludge, suitable sampling spots even if used for early detection of outbreaks (Orive et al., 2020) . Further investigation will be needed to establish the validity of this work in smaller WWTPs in absence of a primary settler, where all the sludge would be collected after aerobic biological treatment with larger solid retention times.",

As a consequence, SARS-CoV-2 genetic material was not detected in the WWTP effluent, indicating its probable safety which could be confirmed with infectivity tests. The combined treatment of thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion also prevented the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sludge leaving the plant. The primary sludge and mostly the thickened sludge showed higher and steadier concentrations, which suggests that COVID-19 incidence could be monitored in the sludge line, possibly in addition to the raw wastewater sampled in the influent. Longer residence times and higher solid concentrations in sludge thickeners would make it a robust sampling spot, which merits being further investigated.",
