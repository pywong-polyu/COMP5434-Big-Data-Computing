The article's research question is: to what extent was Australia's federal structure responsible for the relative successes and failures of the national pandemic response? The method chosen to answer this question is largely theoretical, supplemented by aspects of institutional and policy analysis. That is to say, the inquiry identifies what were widely considered to be important policies, and considers the extent to which the formulation and implementation of those policies was furthered or hindered by the institutions and relations forming Australia's federal structure. Five policy areas are considered, namely: the National Cabinet; social distancing and related policies; international travel and quarantine; interstate travel; and cities and local government. The conclusions reached are that a number of policy responses achieved federalism's objectives of enhancing local decision-making power, increasing state and federal cooperation, and cabining policy failure. While Australia's was not an unmitigated success story, on the whole the pandemic galvanized and reinvigorated Australia's federal structure and institutions.",

            "text": "The story of Australian federalism has traditionally been dominated by design deficiencies, decay and the apparently inexorable concentration of power in the federal government. It came as something of a surprise, then, that Australia's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic was celebrated as a federalism success story. Politicians, academics, and media commentators all argued that Australia's federal division of power was crucial to the success of the nation's early response to the pandemic. That enthusiasm was somewhat muted by the realities of the \"second wave\" of infections. At that point, some of the same people who had previously championed the federal response began to suggest that, in fact, the federal structure had contributed to national failures in quarantine and economic recovery. Whether one is a proponent or a critic of the federally structured response to the pandemic in Australia, it is now common ground that federalism matters. This article seeks to provide an evaluation of the federalism-implicated aspects of Australia's response to the pandemic. In particular, we consider the extent to which Australia's federal structure was responsible for the relative successes and failures of Australia's major pandemic-response policies up to December 31, 2020.",

That is to say, the inquiry identifies the major policy responses to the pandemic and considers the extent to which the formulation and implementation of those policies was furthered by the institutions and relations forming Australia's federal structure. The article proceeds in five parts, each considering an aspect of Australia's federal response to the pandemic. The five parts are: the National Cabinet; social distancing and related policies; international travel and quarantine; interstate travel; and cities and local government. We assess these major federalismimplicated policy responses to the pandemic and measure the extent to which each of them produced the benefits or detriments commonly associated with federalism. Some of the claimed benefits include prioritizing local knowledge in policy formulation, maximizing political responsiveness, and cabining policy failures. Some of the alleged detriments include confusion and costs due to policy nonuniformity and delay in policy coordination involving multiple actors. The pandemic response provides a timely opportunity to assess the current health of Australian federalism. The article offers insights to both Australian and comparative audiences, at once enriching the local debate and adding an illuminating case study to comparative discussions about federalism in times of crisis. The principal contribution of this article is to contribute to the general and recurring scholarly debate about the advantages and disadvantages of a federal structure by examining the operation of federalism in a crisis situation, with an eye to focusing on the Australian experience.",

            "text": "We reach several conclusions about the performance of Australian federalism in responding to COVID-19. On the one hand, there were a number of policy areas in which the Australian federal government effectively cooperated and coordinated with the states, mainly through the National Cabinet. This allowed policy formulation and adaption at state level, based on the different impact of the pandemic on local communities. On the other hand, we also identify failures in Australia's pandemic response in areas such as state border closures, where federal cooperation was not pursued at all, or was pursued too late. The unilateral actions of the states in this regard created some of the common problems of nonuniformity, including delays in policy coordination, confusion, and costs. In conclusion, we consider that Australia's federal structure has responded relatively well under the strain of the pandemic and, as a result, has reinvigorated academic and public interest in Australian federalism.",

The early Australian response to the pandemic was characterized by conflicting messages from the leadership of state 1 and federal governments (Doherty 2020) . This was epitomized when, at a time that social distancing was already being seriously debated in a number of states, the Prime Minister insisted he would attend a stadium sports game, before reluctantly canceling (SBS News 2020). It was thus possible that Australia's federal structure might have resulted in an uncooperative, politicized, and inefficient response to the pandemic, as occurred in the United States (see further Murphy 2020). Thankfully, Australia's federal and state institutions began to work together more harmoniously as the threat of the pandemic became more immediate. The most celebrated way in which this occurred was the creation of the National Cabinet.",

Certainly, the body is styled as a \"cabinet\" and is asserted to attract the protections of cabinet confidentiality that are afforded to deliberations of traditional cabinets (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet 2020). However, the body does not function as a \"cabinet\" in the traditional sense because its members are not responsible to a single parliament but rather eight separate parliaments, thus fracturing the fundamental concepts of collective cabinet responsibility and cabinet solidarity. In reality, then, the National Cabinet appears closer to an intergovernmental forum than an entity capable of making decisions that are binding, either on its members or otherwise.",

Established in 1992, COAG had essentially the same composition as the National Cabinet (although it also included the President of the Australian Local Government Association) and the same remit-to address matters of national significance requiring a coordinated response from federal and state governments. The widely recognized limitations of COAG, however, were that it met only twice a year and dealt with out-of-session issues through a protracted process of negotiating formal intergovernmental agreements and settling on the wording of joint \"communiqu es.\" The somewhat cumbersome nature of COAG did not recommend itself for adaptation to the demanding circumstances of the pandemic, and it was for this reason that the National Cabinet was formed. Tellingly, COAG was subsequently disbanded on 29 May 2020 by an agreement reached by the National Cabinet (Morrison 2020b) .",

To that effect, and given the rapidly evolving nature of such advice, the National Cabinet met regularly and received advice from a committee of federal and state chief health officers. Typically, the National Cabinet would endorse or make in-principle decisions on the basis of that advice, with the legislative implementation of those decisions to be worked out by the respective state parliaments. The National Cabinet's focus in its regular meetings was on issues that involved all of the jurisdictions, such as suppression of the virus, international and interstate travel and trade, personal protective equipment stocks and supply chains, and the like.",

Where COAG had only met biannually, the National Cabinet met as regularly as was necessary, sometimes as often as daily. The fact that it started as a purely virtual forum added to its agility and responsiveness. More substantively, the success of the National Cabinet can be attributed to its character as an example of what is known in Australia as \"cooperative federalism.\"",

Cooperative federalism has always been necessary in Australia because the Constitution allocates certain powers exclusively to the federal government, designates other powers as concurrent (i.e. able to be exercised by both the federal and state governments), and leaves yet further powers unallocated and thus by default in the realm of the states. The constitutional division of powers meant that the pandemic was not a problem the federal government (or any of the states) could address on their own. The pandemic engages many areas of human activity across state lines, such as health and education (primarily state concerns) as well as aged care, immigration, and the economy (primarily federal concerns). Cooperation was thus required. That is exactly what occurred in the National Cabinet although, as will now be explained, it occurred almost exclusively at an executive level rather than by a process of legislation, which is how many cooperative federal schemes have previously operated in Australia.",

It did not require, for example, the passage of detailed mirror legislative regimes in all of the states. This allowed the National Cabinet to harness a certain level of goodwill and pragmatism at the highest levels of the executive of each jurisdiction and largely avoid the obstacles of party politics, both at the national and state levels. In fact, it was reported as running effectively at least in part due to the respectful interpersonal relations of its geographically and political diverse membership (Coorey 2020) . In these respects, the National Cabinet is a paradigmatic example of the potential efficacy and flexibility of \"executive federalism\" (Wilkins 2020) . This mode of federal cooperation can be contrasted with constitutional or legislative cooperative schemes. In the former, all states must agree to refer lawmaking power to the federal government on a particular issue-such as terrorism, which is now a matter of federal legislative power after a referral from all the states (French 2003) . Legislative cooperation requires each of the eight state (and territory) parliaments to pass mirror legislation. This can be extremely difficult (often impossible), and can take years of negotiations, due to differences in the policy and legislative agendas of state parliaments dominated by opposing political parties.",

This was especially the case in regard to social distancing and related policies. Indeed, one of the first decisions of the National Cabinet was to endorse the necessity of social distancing policies (although without agreement as to their details) (Morrison 2020a). As might be expected, the different states with their differing infection levels, risk appetites, industries, economies, and socio-political priorities produced a diversity of social distancing and related policies. The way in which these policies have been formulated, emulated, amended, and abandoned by the states has, for the most part, been a story of the success of politically accountable and responsive federalism. The dynamic by which this occurred fits well within the orthodox Australian understanding of \"competitive federalism.\" Less traditionally, but no less usefully, the same dynamics display what has elsewhere been described as \"laboratory federalism\" (as discussed below). Each of these characterizations is explored below, with a final note of caution in regard to the continued centralizing influence of the vertical fiscal imbalance that exists in Australia. Before engaging in that analysis, however, it is useful to illustrate some of the policy diversity supporting the analysis.",

At that time, New South Wales allowed twenty-person outdoor gatherings and permitted pubs to hold up to 300 persons in an indoor space. In the neighboring Australian Capital Territory, 100 person outdoor gatherings were permitted and pubs were allowed to have 100 people in an indoor space. The infection levels were not markedly different between the two jurisdictions, but each was obviously making different political compromises in terms of public enjoyment, economic recovery, and risk of virus spread. By contrast, Victoria was at the highest level of social restrictions of any jurisdiction due to a second wave of the virus (see more about this below).",

The point to be made is that the pandemic revealed starkly different preferences in different parts of the country, which preferences were not solely attributable to the infection levels (as indicated by the contrast between New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory above). This might seem obvious to students of federalism, as federalism is often celebrated as a constitutional structure facilitating the coexistence of regional differences within a single nation. However, recent Australian scholarship has emphasized the homogeneity of Australia's sub-national jurisdictions and even doubted their continued utility as separate entities (Brown 2008) . The National Cabinet's model of leaving policy detail to the states revealed differing preferences and allowed these preferences to be factored into policy formulation, with the result that the policies produced reflected more closely the preferences of the people affected (Saunders 2020a, 3) .",

To the contrary, Australian press conferences of state leaders are typically highly orchestrated affairs designed to advance government messaging rather than offer true accountability. That changed during the pandemic. In Victoria, for example, the Premier (the highest elected state official) held 120 consecutive daily press conferences, which often went for hours and involved largely unrestricted questioning from the media. The Premier's conduct during these press conferences was widely seen to involve a genuine attempt to explain and justify, day-by-day, the severe restrictions imposed on his constituency. Undoubtedly, these conferences demonstrated greater sensitivity to the demands of the local citizenry than did the less substantial federal press conferences held by the Prime Minister.",

Some states maintained face to face schooling for almost the entire pandemic while other states imposed various differing levels of mandatory remote education. There was little that the federal government could do to directly enforce its preference for schools remaining open, as education is a state constitutional responsibility. Accordingly, the federal government sought to act indirectly, using fiscal carrots and sticks. It threatened to withdraw federal funding to certain schools that remained closed while, at the same time, offering priority funding to certain schools that re-opened for in-person learning (Tehan 2020) . Ultimately, the states were relatively steadfast in their school closures despite the federal incentives. This experience might thus suggest that federal fiscal incentives can only go so far in an area where states are firm in their policy commitments.

There was a public health motivation for these quotas, however they have been criticized as insufficiently sensitive to the interests of Australians stranded abroad. The flight caps were the subject of an unsuccessful challenge in the domestic courts (LibertyWorks Inc v Commonwealth of Australia [2021] FCAFC 90) and are now the subject of a complaint to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, apparently on the basis of the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of the ability to return to one's country (Hicks 2021, 1) .

The complexities of this process were lost on many of the critics of flight caps, who for the most part blamed the federal government for the perceived injustice of \"stranding\" Australians abroad for considerable periods of time.

These facilities were then closed after the success of mass immunizations (Twomey 2021, 255) .

Consequently, in addition to the overseas travel ban imposed by the federal government and sketched above, since March 2020 state governments have imposed various limitations on the interstate movement of people to protect public health. Such restrictions have been periodically updated to reflect the changing pattern of the pandemic at state level. Among other things, limitations to the interstate movement of people have included border passes, identification screening but also an outright closure of internal borders, although most limitations have allowed for exceptions for specific categories of travelers and/or for compassionate reasons. Unlike the highly popular international travel ban, interstate travel bans have proved to be controversial, with interesting implications from a federalism standpoint. Although domestic/state border closures fall under the jurisdiction of state governments, the federal government has generally disapproved of them, alleging that such measures were not supported by public health advice, and had potentially damaging effects for the economy (Bateman and Stone 2020, 227; Twomey 2020, 4) .",

The case, initiated by the Australian businessman and mining magnate Clive Palmer, focused in particular on the Western Australia border closure-the Quarantine (Closing the Border) Directions (WA)-which was issued as effective from 15 March 2020 pursuant to a delegated power under the Emergency Management Act 2005 (WA). Palmer alleged that the border closure breached s 92 of the Constitution, detrimentally affecting his business interests and his freedom of movement. The federal government initially intervened in the case in support of Mr Palmer, before increasing infection rates made border closures look more prudent, at which time it withdrew from the case fearing that its intervention would be damaging for the federal government within the state of Western Australia (Twomey 2020, 5) .",

The Federal Court also concluded that other measures (such as mandatory hotel quarantine or hot spot approaches as used by other states) would not be equally effective (Aroney and Boyce 2020, 28) . Such findings were based on the uncertainties on the level of risk and the grave outcomes which might result from community transmission (Palmer, para 81).

Cole also clarified that the \"trade and commerce\" limb should be construed as freedom from discriminatory burdens having a protectionist effect: therefore, if a law does not have a protectionist purpose, it may be valid if other conditions are met (Palmer, paras 30 and 32). As for the \"intercourse\" limb, the Cole court regarded it as extending to a guarantee of personal freedom to cross state boundaries without burden, hindrance, or restriction (Palmer, para 33).",

The HCA further found that the law restricting the movement of persons into a state to prevent persons infected with COVID-19 from bringing the disease into the community was proportionate during an emergency such as an epidemic (Palmer, para 77). The findings of the Federal Court were thus confirmed by the HCA, which concluded that the severity of the restrictions was necessary to protect the health and life of the people of Western Australia (Palmer, para 81).",

From a federalism perspective, interstate travel restrictions and border closures can also be seen as expressing a subsidiaritybased approach to the pandemic, and illustrate that, in the Australian case, cooperation is not pursued at all costs, and states retain a basic prerogative to close their borders if that is a proportionate response to a particular threat. However, while fostering subsidiarity, such policies may have a detrimental effect on other, equally important, federalism-based values such as solidarity. In conclusion, then, state-imposed interstate travel restrictions in Australia illustrate both an advantage of a federal system, in the sense of permitting subsidiarity-based approaches to combatting the virus, but also a disadvantage in the sense of weakening solidarity. In any event, internal border closures might offer some interesting insights for a comparative analysis with similar decisions made in other federal and supranational systems.",

Furthermore, local governments initiated measures to support local communities and businesses through relief from council rates, fees, and other taxes, and have engaged with states in developing and implementing coordinated government responses (Aroney and Boyce 2020, 7). At the same time, however, local governments have been excluded from representation at meetings of the National Cabinet (Aroney and Boyce 2020, 38; Twomey 2020, 4) . Local governments, then, have not been involved at a leadership level during the pandemic but have played a limited role in implementing state laws and in giving effect to pandemic plans (Twomey 2020, 4) .",

At the same time, although the severity of such restrictions was considered necessary to curb the number of infections, it was also criticized (with protests taking place in the city at various moments), both for the severity of the measures and the duration of the lockdown, and for the economic impact on local businesses, already financially imperiled by previous restrictions in place since March 2020.",

The plaintiff's argument focused on an implied freedom of movement within a state contained in the Australian Constitution, which the Victorian direction allegedly infringed upon. The HCA, however, dismissed the case (Rizzi and Tulich 2021, 5) . The second case, Loielo v Giles, VSC 722 (2 November 2020), was brought in the Victorian Supreme Court by a caf e owner in Melbourne challenging the curfew as breaching the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) 5 with regard to the freedom of movement and liberty (Rizzi and Tulich 2021, 5) . The Court dismissed the claim, holding that-while significantly restricting individual rights-the measures taken by the Victorian government were proportionate to the protection of public health (Rizzi and Tulich 2021, 5) . As was the case in most other countries in the world, policy measures were required to balance health protection and other values such as economic viability.",

In Australia, aged-care facilities are normally considered a federal responsibility. While the Constitution does not explicitly allocate any \"aged care\" power to the federal government, it does assign as exclusively federal the powers over pensions to the aged and sick, and the federal government has also used its financial powers to fund and regulate aged-care facilities (Twomey 2020, 5; Aroney and Boyce 2020, 22) . States, on the other hand, are responsible for public health and hospitals, as already noted. When nursing homes became infection clusters, the issue arose as to whether residents should be moved to hospitals or within such facilities, and which level of government would be in charge. Ultimately, the federal government and the Victorian government established the Victorian Aged Care Responsibility Centre to help coordinate action during the crisis (Aroney and Boyce 2020, 22-23; Twomey 2020, 5 ) in yet another, albeit belated, show of cooperative federalism.",

This allowed policy formulation and adaption at state level, based on the different impact of the pandemic on local communities. Such flexible cooperation has maximized political responsiveness and limited the effects of policy failures (such as the Victoria's bungled hotel quarantine program). This is where subsidiarity has come into the picture. In particular, we illustrated how, in the Australian case, subsidiarity has come to the fore both in the relationships between the federal government and the governments of the states and, especially during the second wave of infections, between the states and the local level of government, particularly with the different responses implemented in Metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria.",

In some policy areas, such as state border closures, cooperation was not pursued at all, or was pursued too late. The unilateral actions of the states in this regard created some of the common problems of non-uniformity, including delays in policy coordination, confusion, and costs. This draws attention to another problem typical of federal systems: how to reconcile subsidiarity with other federal-based values such as the intrinsic solidarity that should inform relationships among the various states (at horizontal level) and the states and the federal government (at vertical level). Finally, it should also be pointed out how the success of the Australian story has come at the great price of isolating itself internationally (Rizzi and Tulich 2021, 5) . Nevertheless, on a balanced analysis, Australia's federal structure provided the flexibility required to curb the pandemic. It remains to be seen whether the tighter federal bonds formed during the pandemic will endure through the difficult processes of vaccine rollout and economic recovery.",
