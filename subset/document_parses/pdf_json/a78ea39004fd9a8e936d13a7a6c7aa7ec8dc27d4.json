            "text": "The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first reported in Wuhan, China, in 2019, and has since spread around the world with exponential growth. Currently, it affects individuals on all continents, in one of the largest pandemics in history. 1 The World Health Organization declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 2 Its symptoms can range from a common cold, with fever, malaise, stuffy nose and dry cough, to more severe findings, involving dyspnea and short of breath, as seen in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). [3] [4] [5] Other symptoms are headache, myalgia, sore throat, diarrhea, sputum production, hemoptysis, and vomiting. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] These symptoms can vary in magnitude among infected people, and some may test positive for the virus being asymptomatic, whereas others may have mild, medium, or severe symptoms. 6, 8 About 1 to 2% of the cases culminate in death. 3 The transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2 include direct ways, such as droplet inhalation through coughing, sneezing, or even speech; and contact transmission, by oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 9 It has been confirmed that asymptomatic individuals are capable of spreading the virus. 10 Saliva is one of the body fluids used for COVID-19 tests. 11 The biggest concern with COVID-19 is the speed with which the disease spreads, contaminating many people at the same period. In this scenario, the health systems may be challenged. 12 As it is a novel disease, there is neither an established treatment protocol nor vaccine for its prevention. 3 Hence, several countries have adopted self-isolation or social/physical distancing as an effective measure to reduce the rates of mass transmission and to prevent their health care systems from collapsing. 13 Currently, the social distancing has been recommended by the government and is being practiced in most cities of Brazil. However, professionals from essential areas must continue working. Among these are health care professionals, including dentists. 2 The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), a public (free of charge) universal system for oral health, is divided into 3 strataprimary (primary care to oral health), secondary (specialized oral care), and tertiary (oral care in hospitals). 14 Primary health care is organized by the family health team, composed of a doctor, a nurse, a dentist, health assistants, and community health agents. The secondary level of care is met by specialty dental clinics. During the pandemic, all SUS levels are working in a coordinate manner to prevent the COVID-19 spread and care for those in need (either COVID-19-infected individuals or those with other health problems, such as oral health emergencies). Therefore, we sought to understand the levels of knowledge and practice of Brazilian dentists, from primary and secondary public health care, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.",

However, other symptoms, such as headache, muscle pain, and sore throat were comparatively lesser known to them. Our results also showed no relationship between the knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and execution of dental treatment, either urgent or elective, during the pandemic. It is not clear whether there is a relation between this knowledge and safer The infection of salivary glands by coronavirus is being given increasing importance and attention in recent studies, in which the potential diagnosis of COVID-19 in saliva is revealed, 17 as well as its connection with the development of asymptomatic infections. 18 Ren et al. 19 reported that loss of taste is an early symptom of COVID-19. The fact that this symptom appears before fever and other common symptoms of COVID-19 supports the hypothesis that the oral cavity, especially the mucosa of the tongue, may be an initial site of infection for SARS-CoV-2. 19 According to The New York Times, dentists are at the greatest risk of infection, 20 since they work directly with salivary fluids in the form of aerosols, which have a great potential for viral transmission. 21 This places the dentist community, especially the ones in primary health care, in an extremely vulnerable position, as they are the frontline oral health care professionals caring for patients, some of whom may be asymptomatic. This calls for greater preparation, including more protective barriers for the safety of these individuals while they perform their work.",

It is not clear whether this high percentage is due to a low level of preventive methods being used in primary and secondary dental care, or due to the professionals' lack of knowledge regarding biosecurity and clinically safe practices during the pandemic.

However, the scientific information does not seem to be flowing to all dentists at the desired speed. It remains in the personal interest to seek for most of this information, and the scientific method is probably not dominated by most professionals. Therefore, it is important to have a leadership in the dissemination of adequate information during a pandemic, as the overload and the uncertainties caused by confused and contradictory articles may disorient rather than clarify the biosecurity and PPE methods that must be used. 23 Public policies are extremely important in the dissemination of proper information. On that manner, SUS has played an important role in responding to the disease, with initiatives to improve its capacity and with the establishment of specific protocols for the clinical management of patients, and a good control on the community transmission of COVID-19. 24 However, a protocol for dental treatment is yet to be established. Additionally, as the primary health care system is run by the municipalities, some differences may be seen as the implementation of COVID-19 preventive measures in different parts of the country, which is also influenced by the financial challenges faced, and the availability of supplies. Additionally, as Brazil is a highly populated country with an extended continental territory, individual state governors are enforcing social distancing measures based on the number of cases and intensive care unit occupancy rates in public and private hospitals. 25 Differences in the rules of social isolation among the various regions of the country may be influencing social isolation/distancing and the provision of elective and urgent care to some extent.",

This finding corroborates with the study of Rostamzadeh et al., which deals with other viral infections and obtained a lower level of knowledge in recent graduates. 21 The higher knowledge may be due to clinical experience or postgraduate courses. This is further supported by a recent study on dentists' knowledge of COVID-19, which found that professionals with higher qualifications (postgraduates) reported better knowledge scores as compared with recent graduates. 28 It is unavoidable to discuss that post-pandemic, the cost of dental treatment will probably increase. New treatment protocols in the patient-dentist relationship might also be needed, especially in the case of pediatric and special-needs patients. The SUS is financed by the public government, and, despite its importance in providing health care to the Brazilian population, it has been suffering from insufficient funding for a long time. 29 After the acute COVID-19 pandemic, the need for implementation of additional preventive measures during dental treatment will add to the financial stress on primary public health service and may interfere with the amount and diversity of treatments offered. Management of pediatric and specialneeds patients quite often demand close contact with the dentist. Commonly, this involves interactions without dental masks and PPE before the dental treatment itself, in order to familiarize the patient with the dental environment and personnel, which is fundamental in the patient-dentist bond and allows for less traumatic and better quality treatment. The additional preventive barriers, which are necessary to prevent the COVID-19 infection, might interfere with this interaction and, therefore, make dental treatment complex.",

Nevertheless, we found that the region in the country, practice of social isolation, belief in PPE and biosafety preventive measures influenced the likelihood of dentists performing elective or urgent dental treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic period. After the acute COVID-19 pandemic period, the need for extra preventive barriers during dental treatment may lead to extra financial stress on the primary and secondary health care system, as well as on the patient-dentist relationship, guidelines for which may have to be reframed.
