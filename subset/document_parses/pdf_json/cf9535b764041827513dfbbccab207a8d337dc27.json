[11] [12] [13] [14] Decrements in episodic memory, particularly paired associative memory (i.e., integrating contextual information such as linking a face with a name) as well as associative inference, 15 are observed in preclinical AD. [16] [17] [18] Regions critical for associative memory such as the entorhinal cortex and anterior hippocampus 19, 20 are also early sites for phosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles. 21 Likewise, pattern separation (i.e., the ability to discriminate between previously learned items and those that are perceptually similar 22 ) is an aspect of memory performance reliant on the dentate gyrus and connections to the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. 23 Finally, measures which facilitate learning using semantic cues have been shown to be particularly useful in identifying decrements in memory encoding in preclinical AD. 24, 25 Digital cognitive tasks that target cognitive processes that decline during preclinical AD, such as the Boston Remote Assessment for Neurocognitive Health (BRANCH), would be particularly relevant to prevention trials that are seeking cognitive outcomes that can track putative therapeutic benefit.",

Another limitation of our study was the high (college) education level. However, we were able to achieve a balanced representation by sex (54% female) and a relatively racially diverse group (28% non-White registry sample). 55 Further work will be needed to determine feasibility of BRANCH in samples with lower educational attainment.",

Digital capture of cognition, unlike traditional measures, has multiple benefits including increased accessibility, automated data capture and storage, scalability, and costeffectiveness. There is a need in AD secondary prevention for digital cognitive tests which target fundamental aspects of early memory decline and which can be completed on a personal device. Here, we provided evidence for the feasibility, reliability, and validity of BRANCH as a cognitive measure for use in preclinical AD. K.

Unsupervised digital cognitive testing on an individual's own device is an appealing means to capture AD-related memory decrements and a growing area of research. 2. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that Boston Remote Assessment for Neurocognitive Health (BRANCH) is a valid cognitive measure for preclinical AD; BRANCH exhibited moderate correlations with traditional cognitive tests and worse BRANCH performance was associated with greater global amyloid and entorhinal tau burden on imaging. 3. Future directions: BRANCH reliably captures meaningful cognitive information remotely, suggesting promise as a digital cognitive marker sensitive early in the AD trajectory. Future work will explore short-term learning curves by capturing BRANCH more frequently, developing BRANCH for use in different languages, and incorporating additional metrics (e.g., subjective report, environmental factors) to enrich and contextualize cognitive data.",

To determine the feasibility of BRANCH, we examined rates of administration errors, self-reported technical issues and task difficulty, and engagement in the registry sample.To characterize BRANCH psychometric properties, we computed descriptive statistics for each BRANCH test accuracy score across both samples. We expected accuracy measures to be approximately 70% and that minimal floor or ceiling effects would be observed. One exception is the less challenging Categories test, for which we expected ceiling effects.Correlations were used to examine whether BRANCH captured age-related memory decrements 26 across registry and observational samples. BRANCH retest reliability was assessed on re-testing among a subset of participants. Pearson correlation coefficient with an r of 0.8 to 0.9 was considered \"good\" reliability.44 Correlations were used to examine BRANCH convergent/discriminant validity in relation to traditional cognitive tests in the observational sample. We expected composites (i.e., BRANCH, PACC-5) to be more strongly correlated compared to individual tests.Similarly, we expected traditional memory measures (LMDR, FCSRT) to be more strongly correlated with memory-oriented BRANCH tasks (convergent validity), whereas traditional processing speed measures (TMTA) would be less correlated with BRANCH memory measures (discriminant validity).
