Many viral proteinases have only been identified recently, and characterization is consequently in its early stages.

The gag and pol genes encode inner structural, and replicative proteins respectively, and are translated as polyproteins that are cleaved at eight sites by the proteinase (PR) ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). These polyproteins are transported to the plasma membrane and cleavage occurs after budding of immature particles, resulting in morphological changes associated with virion maturation. The substrate specificity of HIV-1 PR is puzzling in that PR catalyzes specific cleavage at a small number of polyprotein sites that show no apparent sequence conservation. Analysis of viral and non-viral substrates suggests that no subsite has absolute specificity, and that a combination of moderate interactions may be sufficient to confer catalytic specificity [4\"]. Heterogeneity in the composition of viral polyprotein cleavage sites probably plays a role in determining the rate, and consequently the order, of cleavage at different sites.",

The successful design of substratebased inhibitors of other aspartyl proteinases, such as pepsin and renin, suggested the strategy of designing analogous peptide-mimetic inhibitors of HIV-1 PR by incorporating non-hydrolyzable 'transition-state' mimics into substrate analogues [7\"',8\",9-]. This approach is based on a key step in aspartyl proteinase catalysis: generation of a tetrahedral diol by hydration of a trigonal amide (Fig. 2a) . The high (millimolar) K m values of peptide substrates indicate that potent (i.e. nanomolar) PR inhibitors must incorporate structural features that significantly increase their binding affinity. Peptide-based inhibitors have several disadvantages, including vulnerability to degradative enzymes, rapid clearance, and poor oral absorption. These problems are commonly addressed by minimizing size and peptide-like character of promising lead compounds.",

This weak inhibitor contains two statine residues that embody transition state analogue I (Fig. 2b ). To identify more potent inhibitors, Dreyer et al. [11] compared the effectiveness as PR inhibitors of five different classes of dipeptide isosteres inserted into a consensus heptapeptide template. Heptapeptides (P4-P3' or P3-P4') are the shortest substrates that are cleaved efficiently by PR. Statine-based (I), reduced amide (II) and phosphinate (III) transition state analogues exhibited modest potency, but placement of Phe-Gly hydroxyethylene dipeptide isosteres (IV) into the consensus template yielded compounds that inhibited HIV PR at nanomolar concentrations in vitro and prevented polyprotein processing, virion maturation and viral spread at 25-100btM in cell culture. Truncation and extensive structure-activity analysis at the P1, PI\" and P2' positions led to the identification of highly potent (subnanomolar) PR inhibitors based on dihydroxyethylene (V) [12-] and hydroxyethylene (IV) [13\"] isostere transition state analogues. Potency was enhanced by incorporating residues that stabilize the extended inhibitor structure, presumably due to optimized hydrogenbonding in the substrate binding cleft. For example, the P2' and P3' residues (Leu-Phe) can effectively be replaced by various substituted aminobenzocycloalkanes [14\" ]. The PI' position can accept side-chains unrelated to natural amino acids, allowing modifications to be made that enhance solubility and thus cell penetration [15\", 16-] . Such substitutions may reduce binding affinity (K i) but the enhanced solubility may nevertheless result in a net increase in antiviral activity.",

Hydroxyethylamine (VI) structures that readily accomodate the prolyl imino acid have been incorporated into a number of potent inhibitors [17,18\",19,20\" ]. Modification of a protected tripeptide incorporating this structure by substituting the imino residue decahydroisoquinoline at the PI' position yielded highly potent inhibitors of PR in vitro and in cell culture, such as the compound Ro 31-8959 [19,21\" ]. This inhibitor was expected to have considerable selectivity, and indeed it inhibited human aspartyl proteinases such as gastricsin, renin and pepsin by less than 50% at a concentration of 10pM. Typical IC90 values for Ro 31-8959 (5-30 nM) are 1000-fold below its cytotoxic concentration in uninfected host cells. Recent reports indicate that a 600 mg oral dose every 8 hours is sufficient to maintain the mean human plasma concentration at about 70nM. The potency of Ro 31-8959 is strongly dependent on tight binding by the P2 and particularly the P3 substituents, whereas binding of a second class of hydroxyethylamine inhibitors (which contain a noncyclic, secondary amine in place of the decahydroisoquinoline residue) [22\" ] is less dependent on these interactions, and this second class binds more tightly in the PI\"-P2' region.",

Symmetry is permissible for inhibitors, however, and might even improve binding affinity and selectivity over endogenous aspartyl proteinases. These considerations have led to the design of a serieS-of diaminoalcohol-and diaminodiolbased inhibitors with C 2 (VII) or pseudo-C 2 symmetry [23,24\"-26\" ]. These inhibitors are potent even at subnanomolar concentrations and highly selective in vitro, but most have suffered from poor solubility, leading to modest potency in cell culture. Strategies to circumvent this deficiency and thus enhance activity in cell culture have included modification of terminal residues and their linkage groups to increase solubility. These interactions include extensive Van der Waal's contacts with residues that define the hydrophobic 82-82' binding pockets, and a hydrogen bonding system that sandwiches the inhibitor strand between the catalytic cleft and the flaps. The hydroxyl groups of type V, VI and VII inhibitors form hydrogen bonds with both catalytic aspartates. Significantly, all complexes contain a tetrahedrally coordinated active-site water molecule, which bridges two flap residues and two inhibitor carbonyl groups, prompting suggestions that an improved inhibitor would contain a functional replacement for the water [24\",27] . The similarities in the extended conformation of all inhibitors, as well as in the induced conformational changes that they cause in the enzyme, indicate that it is possible to model and improve peptidic inhibitors on the basis of these known structures. An alternative approach to discover novel templates for the design of non-peptide inhibitors is to search three-dimensional structure databases for molecules with a shape that is complementary to the active-site cleft. To date, this approach has led to identification of the antipsychotic agent haloperidol as a weak PR inhibitor [29] .",

Poliovirus 2Apro cleaves Tyr-Gly dipeptides at the P1-2A junction and within the three-dimensional polymerase, but although all corresponding sites in other picornaviruses have a Gly residue at the PI' position, various residues occur at the P1 position. Aliphatic residues occur at the P4 positions of most 2AP r\u00b0 and 3CP r\u00b0 sites. Mutagenesis and peptide cleavage experiments indicate that cleavage site recognition depends on a minimum substrate length (six residues for 3CP r\u00b0) and the presence of specific residues at positions that differ according to both the virus and the proteinase [38,39\",40\",41\"- 43\" ]. There are additional conformational determinants of recognition of cleavage sites within polyproteins, so the large (millimolar) K m values of peptide substrates may reflect their greater conformational freedom. Potential peptidemimetic in- hibitors are likely to exhibit similar flexibility, and must therefore be conformationally constrained and incorporate structural features that increase their binding affinity. The lack of absolute specificity at most subsites, and the requirement for peptide substrates to extend to the P4 position indicates that the substrate binding clefts of 3CP r\u00b0 and probably 2AP r\u00b0 are capable of extensive hydrogen bond interactions with such inhibitors.

Although they are all potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention, significant progress in inhibitor development has only been reported for HIV-1 PR. In the few years since its identification, the structure of PR and numerous inhibitor complexes have been determined, and highly potent peptidemimetic inhibitors have been developed. Knowledge of the strategies used in enhancing the potency and specificity of PR inhibitors, and in overcoming the inherent limitations of peptide-based inhibitors is likely to prove invaluable in the development of peptidemimetic inhibitors of other viral proteinases.

Inhibitor binding induces a slight 'hinge' closure of the interface between subunits, and extensive movement of both flaps, tightening the active-site cavity and shielding P3-P3' residues of the bound inhibitor from solvent contact. Despite the diversity of inhibitor structures, they all adopt generally similar extended conformations and make very similar contacts with the proteinase, binding of the hydroxyethylamine (VI) inhibitor Ro 31-8959 being a notable exception[20\"].",
