Here, we build upon this analysis to consider associations between county-level vaccination rates and 68 different demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors for 1,510 American counties with over 228 million individuals for which vaccination data was also available. Our analysis reveals that counties with high levels of uninsured individuals have significantly lower COVID-19 vaccination rates (Spearman correlation: -0.264), despite the fact that the CDC has mandated that all COVID-19 vaccines are free and cannot be denied to anyone based upon health insurance coverage or immigration status. Furthermore, we find that the counties with high levels of uninsured individuals tend to have the highest COVID-19 incidence rates in March 2021 relative to December 2020 (Spearman correlation: 0.388). Among the 68 factors analyzed, insurance coverage is the only factor which is highly correlated with both vaccination rate and change in COVID-19 incidence during the vaccination period (|Spearman correlation| > 0.25). We also find that counties with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic individuals have significantly lower vaccination rates (Spearman correlations: -0.128, -0.136) and lesser declines of COVID-incidence rates (Spearman correlations: 0.334, 0.330) during the vaccination period. Surprisingly however, after controlling for race, we find that the association between lack of insurance coverage and vaccination rate as well as COVID-19 incidence rates is largely driven by counties with a majority white population. Among the counties with high proportions of white residents (top 10% decile), the association between insurance coverage and vaccination rate is significant (Spearman correlation: -0.210, p-value: 0.002), but among counties with low proportions of white residents (bottom 10% decile) this association is not significant (Spearman correlation: 0.072, p-value: 0.088). Taken together, this study highlights the fact that intricate socioeconomic factors are correlated not just to COVID-19 vaccination rates, but also to COVID-19 incidence fluctuations, underscoring the need to improve COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in marginalized communities. The strong positive correlation between low levels of health insurance coverage and low vaccination rates is particularly concerning, and calls for improved public health messaging to emphasize the fact that health insurance is not required to be eligible for any of the FDA-authorized",

However, this rapid vaccine rollout has not benefited all Americans equally, and the vaccination rate in some marginalized communities has lagged significantly behind the average 3 . It is well known that social determinants of health (SDoH) and aspects of an individual's life that occur \"outside of the four walls of healthcare\" have tremendous impact on actual health status 4, 5 . As we approach the status of 'herd immunity' with COVID-19 vaccinations, it is of critical importance that the US is not viewed as a monolith, and that the vaccination coverage to promote herd immunity is equally distributed across all communities. A recent study by the CDC showed that vaccine coverage is lower in counties with high social vulnerability based upon socioeconomic indicators (poverty, unemployment, low income, no high school diploma) 1 . This study did not, however, assess the interplay between these factors and new COVID-19 incidence rates. In addition, another recent analysis 580 US counties found that the change in COVID-19 incidence from December 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021 is significantly correlated with cumulative vaccination rate through March 1, 2021 6 . However, it remains unclear whether disparities in vaccine rollout and associated COVID-19 infection rate fluctuations have been driven by some specific socioeconomic and population health factors.",

We demonstrate that variables related to uninsurance status and racial minority make-up are both negatively associated with vaccine coverage and new case incidence. By stratifying counties according to minority population percentage, however, we also find that the relationship between being uninsured and poor vaccine coverage is not uniform across all races, and that this relationship is much stronger in predominantly white counties. We additionally stratify counties by their vaccine coverage and determine the relative risk of different socioeconomic factors with high and low vaccination rates. Our findings show that the most significant risk factors for poor vaccination at the county-level are those related to poverty and environmental safety such as uninsurance prevalence, teen births, and violent crimes, and the most significant protective factors are related to food security, social connectivity, and education level.",

In addition, county-level COVID-19 incidence data was obtained from the CDC COVID Data Tracker 7 . The change in COVID-19 incidence is defined as the 7-day rolling average COVID-19 incidence rate on March 1, 2021 minus the 7-day rolling average COVID-19 incidence rate on December 1, 2020, where the COVID-19 incidence rate is the number of new COVID-19 cases reported in the county per 10,000 individuals.",

However, the relationship between these two factors and the incidence change in COVID-19 cases from December 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021 was vastly different. There was a significant positive correlation between the percent of the county who was uninsured and the case incidence change (Spearman correlation: 0.388, p-value: <1e-5), but no significant relationship was observed between unemployment level and new cases (Spearman correlation: 0.008, p-value: 0.20). Table 2 demonstrates that the relative risk related to the percent of uninsured adults in the population is 0.742, where counties in the top quartile of vaccine coverage have 9.9% uninsured adults and those in the bottom quartile have 13.4%. This translates to counties in the top quartile of vaccination coverage have a 25% lower uninsured population compared to those in the bottom quartile. Table 3 looks at the top and bottom deciles of counties, ranked by percent of the county that is uninsured. On average, counties in the bottom decile have an uninsurance rate of 24.1%. We find that less-insured counties are more rural, have more minorities, and higher percentages of young people.

Going further, we found that these relationships were strongest in predominantly white counties, indicating a specific relationship between being white and uninsured and poor vaccination coverage. We hypothesize that this relationship may be due to widespread misunderstanding about individuals' eligibility and financial responsibility for the COVID-19 vaccine, and .

In fact, the percent of individuals uninsured in a county was the only variable whose Spearman coefficient exceeded 0.25 for both vaccine coverage and new case incidence. Juxtaposed with the relationships seen with unemployment, which was only significantly correlated with vaccination coverage but not with new COVID-19 incidence, this is an important insight. The relationship between unemployment and vaccine coverage was recently analyzed by the CDC, but not its association with new incidence rates, which we find here to be insignificant. One hypothesis to explain these differing relationships with uninsured status and unemployment is in community education about COVID-19 and vaccine eligibility. Many individuals receive information about general health and also about their vaccine eligibility status from their primary care provider 12 . This relationship does not exist in the case of individuals without health insurance, and so individuals without health insurance may be significantly uninformed about basic COVID-19 precautions that could prevent new incidences, and also about their eligibility for the vaccine. Direct messaging from the government to inform individuals that they are eligible for the vaccine regardless of insurance status may have a significant impact on both vaccine coverage and new case incidence rates.",

            "text": "In this study we also highlight the significant racial disparities that exist in the US in the context of COVID-19, which have been covered by numerous other studies [13] [14] [15] . Many of these studies have shown that overall outcomes of COVID-19 are poorer in communities with large populations of racial minorities. In the same vein, we demonstrate that counties with higher percentages of racial minorities are showing higher incidence rates in the first several months of 2021. While still significant, the relationship between racial minority make-up and lower vaccine coverage is weaker. These findings suggest that communities with larger populations of racial minorities are still suffering from the pandemic two-fold: the vaccine is not as readily available to them, and to those who the vaccine has not yet been administered, social precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are not being as widely implemented. Interestingly, the impact of uninsurance status in minority communities is not related to vaccine coverage, and this relationship appears to be most present in predominantly white communities. We do see relationships between uninsurance and new case incidence in both predominantly white and non-white counties, although the relationships are opposing in directionality. It is difficult to draw conclusions about the cause of new cases, as the virus' timeline varies widely across different regions of the country, but we hypothesize that it could be due to uninsured white individuals living in more rural areas with less virus spread, versus uninsured minorities living in more densely populated areas (Supplementary Figure S4) .",

Specifically, 52 of the 63 incomplete variables were specific to racial minority groups, and all data variables with less than 35% completeness were specific to racial minority groups. Had this been available, we may have been able to parse out more specific relationships of COVID-19, vaccination coverage, and racial minorities. We also note that one of the challenges in assessing both vaccine coverage as well as new incidence rates is in the diversity of state roll-out plans, in terms of timeline and eligibility criteria.

All of these factors show some relationship with poorer vaccine coverage, and higher recent incidence rates. We highlight in our results that there are also environmental risk factors that fall into the same pattern. In general, our findings show that all factors that fall into the bottom-right quadrant of Figure 1 , the quadrant with the most favorable outcomes, pertain to having a higher education, a higherpaying career, homeownership, general quality of life, social connectivity and being white. For the most part, factors that fall into the top right and bottom left quadrants with mixed outcomes, are educational factors signifying a mid-range level of education, or pertain to age-related factors that directly impact vaccine eligibility such as being under 18 years old. Taken together, our findings reiterate what is known about the vast racial and socioeconomic disparities that are still ongoing in the US surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.
