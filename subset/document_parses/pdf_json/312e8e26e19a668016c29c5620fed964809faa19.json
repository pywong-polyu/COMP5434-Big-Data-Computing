We herein describe a patient in the blast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia who was hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The patient was successfully treated with tocilizumab, and intubation was avoided. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mostly related to a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome that develops secondary to cytokine release syndrome, and interleukin 6 is the main cytokine involved in cytokine release syndrome. Very few reports have described the use of tocilizumab in patients with hematologic malignancies who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, although a few cases of patients with multiple myeloma have been reported. To our knowledge, however, this is the first report of a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient in the blast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia who had a favorable response to treatment with tocilizumab. The management of patients with hematological malignancies who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 is a major challenge for practitioners, necessitating more specific research in this direction.",

            "text": "In December 2019, the world experienced the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, a new strain in the family of beta-coronaviruses that causes COVID-19. This virus caused millions of deaths due to SARS, causing the world to enter a state of high alert. In SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that is mainly transmitted from human to human. Its cell receptor is angiotensinconverting enzyme 2, which is bound to the spike (S) protein present on the outer surface of beta coronaviruses. 2 Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 is preferentially expressed in the lung and intestinal epithelium, which explains the pulmonary tropism of the virus. To simplify, the pathophysiology of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is secondary mainly to an abnormal host response or to overexpression of inflammatory cytokines, free radicals, and chemokines. Indeed, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which causes an acute respiratory distress syndrome subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection, remains the main cause of mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2. 2, 3 Among the key elements of CRS is IL-6. This well-known cytokine is endowed with both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory effects, and it is secreted mainly by macrophages, monocytes, endothelial cells, and T lymphocytes. 3 Among the functions of IL-6 is maturation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. 3 In another sense, patients with hematological malignancies represent a major challenge during this pandemic because of the high infectious risk in this group of patients, on one hand by the disease itself and on the other hand by the immunosuppressive treatments. 4, 5 According to He et al., 6 patients with hematological malignancies do not have a high risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection, but their clinical course is more severe than that of other patients. This can be explained by either the progression of their hematological malignancy or the occurrence of bacterial superinfection during hospitalization. Notably, after the introduction of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor as a mainstay of CML treatment, the prognosis of these patients becomes almost identical to that of the general population. Despite this therapeutic progress, however, the management of patients followed for CML in the blast phase remains a challenge, and thus the prognosis remains poor. 7 Because IL-6 is the main mediator of CRS that induces the acute respiratory distress syndrome, the use of an IL-6 inhibitor is a therapeutic measure that became very important at the beginning of the pandemic to avoid fatalities due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subtype. 3 Its mechanism of action is inhibition of signal transduction mediated by IL-6 receptors, 3 and it is effective in CRS. 8 The published results regarding the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe cases of SARS-CoV-19 infection to date are highly divergent. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients with severe SARS-CoV-19 infection conducted by Stone et al. 9 showed that the use of tocilizumab did not prevent intubation or reduce mortality; however, this trial could not rule out a benefit of tocilizumab because of the wide confidence intervals. In contrast, another randomized controlled trial by Gordon et al. 10 showed that the use of tocilizumab improved survival, including in patients with severe infection. There are few published data regarding the use of tocilizumab in patients with hematologic malignancy and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Zhang et al. 11 was the first to describe a patient with multiple myeloma who was successfully treated with tocilizumab for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ranger et al. 12 described a patient with uncontrolled CML who was favorably treated with tocilizumab for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although these two reports are insufficient to conclude whether tocilizumab is effective in this group of patients, there are still exceptional and special cases. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of therapeutic success of tocilizumab in a patient in the blast phase of CML.",
