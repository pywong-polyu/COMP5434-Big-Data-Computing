First, we build two distinct product spaces of ports and port regions, and provide direct estimates of the role of neighboring ports as spillover channels spatially linked. This is in contrast to the previous literature that mainly regarded ports as transport infrastructure per se. Second, we confirm that the knowledge spillover effect from neighboring ports had a non-negligible role in sustaining regional economies during the recovery after the economic crisis but its power has weakened recently due to a loosened global value chain.",

            "text": "Economic development has been widely examined in various research streams in social science from the era of mercantilism to the recent globalized world. Over the history of capitalism, the detailed strategies and policies for the economic development have been evolved over time as the answer of the demand of the times. From the fall of the Iron Curtain and the \"end of history\" in the 1990s, the second wave of globalization became a global phenomenon. This new global regime changed the battleground for the economic development of firms, sub-national regions, and states. From the mid-2000s, the main drivers of the industrial transformation of a state was not the domestic factors including state-led policies, but the factors associated with complex global production networks (GPNs). With this observations, scholars in economic geography examined how regional actors and resources co-evolve with the globalized world, show the strategic coupling with plug into the GPN, and in the long run, result in the economic development of region (Coe and Yeung, 2015; Yeung, 2016; 2021) . Yeung (2016) explained how the industrial structure of a nation could be upgraded in the recent economic globalization and cross-border production by looking at three East Asian countries, which are Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore. Regarding the economic development of those nations in the 1970s and the 1980s, as Amsden (1992) ; Wade (2003) ; Evans (1996) showed, the role of state for industrial transformation was crucial and the domestic factors on the development that were associated with a legacy of Friedrich List played a critical role for the development (Jun et al., 2016) . However, Yeung (2016) observed that from the 2000s, economic globalization dimmed the role of state in the industrial transformation, and transnational economic actors such as a globally significant lead firm and geographically dispersed network of overseas affiliates gave more significant effects on the industrial upgrading of a nation. He 2 conceptualized this co-evolutionary mechanism of economic development as strategic coupling.",

Those empirical evidences were recently formalized as the Principle of Relatedness . While in the initial work on related variety of Frenken et al. (2007) , the entropy measure the related variety, the density measure has been more used to measure the related variety following the seminar work of Hidalgo et al. (2007) . Hidalgo et al. (2007) built a product space, which is a network structure among products, by looking at co-exporting patterns of products in world trade, and calculated the density of related product for each product of each country on the product space. They found that the industrial diversification pattern exhibits path-dependency, which means that countries are more likely to enter a new product when they already export the related 3 product to the new product. This finding holds at regional level. Boschma et al. (2013) , Gao et al. (2021) , and Jara- Figueroa et al. (2018) found that regions in Spain, China, and Brazil are more likely to enter a new industry when they already have the related industries. These findings told us that existing related industries within regions are a source of industrial diversification through inter-industry spillovers.",

Consistent with the previous research (Hidalgo et al., 2007; Neffke et al., 2011; Boschma et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2021) , a region neighboring the port is more likely to enter a new industry when it already has the related industries within their region. In addition, we find the evidence of cross-space spillover that more related products in ports increase the probability of success in neighboring regions' entering a new product. Our results imply that inter-industry spillover is the prime engine of industrial diversification in a region, and cross-space inter-regional spillover from nearby ports catalyzes the diversification of the region. In other words, the main drive of industrial diversification at sub-national level can be found within the region and their plugging into the GPNs boosts their industrial diversification. Finally, upon the recent change in the global trade circumstances including the trade war between China and the US, and the global pandemic crisis with COVID-19, we investigate the period-variant spillover effect of neighboring ports and discuss the economic resilience of port regions. In particular, we explore the role of the spillover effects when the regional economy faces an exogenous economic shock, such as the financial crisis in 2008. Our estimates for the years of the crisis show that strong inter-industry spillover helps port regions to sustain their industrial diversification, while the effect of cross-space spillover from neighboring ports becomes insignificant. However, during the recovery periods, cross-space spillover from nearby ports increases the probability of success in port regions' entering a new industry, which verifies having a port nearby positively contributes to the regional resilience. Our results imply that regions' connecting the GPNs benefits their industrial diversification but for the sustainable industrial diversification, the main source should be within the regions.",

            "text": "In parallel, the literature on economic complexity has further developed this concept with empirical methodology from network science (Hidalgo et al., 2007) . As a pioneering work, Hidalgo et al. (2007) calculated proximity between products based on the probability that a country exports both products in tandem by using world trade data, suggesting the idea of the product space as a network representation of proximity. For example, the proximity between a shirt and socks are closer than that between a shirt and a car. In addition, they proposed a measure of product relatedness of each product for country as the average proximity of the product based of the country's current industry structure. For example, when a country tries to enter a car industry, the probability of success can be higher when the country already has the related product of the car, such as tire or engine industry, rather than when the country only has textile and food industry. They found that the product relatedness works as a good predictor for their future industrial structure implying the path-dependency characteristics of industrial diversification. Owing to its methodological intuitiveness and flexibility, a growing number of recent studies utilized this framework to confirm that the relatedness between industries, occupations, and patents possibly measures their localized knowledge and capabilities, and identifies with the channels of knowledge spillovers (Neffke et al., 2011; Boschma et al., 2013; Kogler et al., 2013; Felipe et al., 2014; Boschma et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2017; Jara-Figueroa et al., 2018) . The growing evidences by expanding literature, exploring the regional diversification and development as a function of the density of related activities within a region, has become formalized as empirical principle called the Principle of Relatedness .",

Of importance, however, the knowledge spillover has the spatial dimension (Audretsch and Feldman, 2004) : the interconnections with geographical neighbors provide access to new economic knowledge, thereby exerting knowledge spillover. In this regard, Bahar et al. (2014) explained the knowledge spillover from neighbors by showing that the probability of a country developing a comparative advantage in an industry increases if a neighboring country has a comparative advantage in that same industry. Similarly, Boschma et al. (2017) suggested the neighbors sharing borders as the source of regional diversification at the sub-national level, demonstrating the specialization pattern of geographical neighbors shapes the local capability to develop new industries in a region. In a recent paper, Jun et al. (2020) pointed out that knowledge spillover from neighboring exporters is a significant predictor of increases in bilateral trade flows. In the similar context, Gao et al. (2021) showed that inter-regional spillover played a significant role in the industrial diversification of China's provinces.",

Specifically, how do the international flows of commodities through neighboring ports contribute to regional diversification and resilience? Between spillover from a port (source from outside of a region) and other related industries within the region (source from inside of a region), which one is the prime knowledge source of industrial diversification of a sub-national region? Our expected contribution to the literature on economic geography and related diversification concerns the role of neighboring ports as a special case of neighbors exerting inter-regional spillover based on their own product spaces. Also, our research can nuisance to bridge the literature on the GPNs and that on the principle of relatedness regarding the economic development of sub-national regions.",

As shown in Figure 1 , moreover, the port regions in our analysis are geographically scattered over all three coasts in the Korean peninsula. Busan port, which locates in the Southern coast of Korean peninsula, has been regarded the representative gateway of Korean product towards the global market, but other ports such as Incheon port in the Western coast or Ulsan and Pohang port in Eastern coast are also handling more or similar massive quantity of cargo.

This contribution represents the knowledge spillover that occurs when two product spaces with different types of knowledge are spatially connected (i.e., cross-space).

Column (1) corresponds to the result considering all observations of the sample (see Table A5 for more regression estimates to test the robustness of our model). First, we find the positive dependency of \u03c9 on the development of a new industry, confirming the knowledge spillover within the regional product space (Hidalgo et al., 2007; Neffke et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2021) . This also supports the path dependency theory of regional diversification that a new industry emerges from existing industries in a region by recombining local capabilities related to them (Boschma et al., 2013) . For other estimators, we discover that the ubiquity k positively correlates with the development of a new industry while the product complexity PCI shows a significant and negative correlation. This result suggests that the more ubiquitous and less complex product is a good candidate for a new potential industry in a port region. In this respect, we further investigate whether the knowledge spillover within the regional product space varies by the knowledge intensity of products and the industrial characteristics. To analyze the effect of \u03c9 by levels of product complexity, the sample is divided into two groups based on the PCI value: products below the sample mean of PCI are classified in the low PCI group, and otherwise in the high PCI group. Columns (2) and (3) report the regression estimates for each group. The coefficients of omega between groups suggest statistical differences by the chi-square test (the chi-square with one degree of freedom = 14.16, p = 0.0002): the effect of relatedness of high PCI products is larger than that of low PCI products on the development of a new industry. This result proves that the higher the knowledge intensity of the product, the more is it influenced by knowledge spillover from related products when a region develops a new industry (Rauch, 1999; 2001; Jun et al., 2020) . 22",

Interestingly, we also proved that regions' entering a new industry can be catalyzed by neighboring ports having competitiveness in the related products to the new industry. In addition, by splitting our sample over PCI and leamer's classification, we found that the effect of inter-industry spillover within the same regions increases with product complexity and technological sophistication of the new potential industry, while the effect of cross-space inter-regional spillover is the strongest for the new potential industry with medium-level sophistication(i.e., labor-and capital-intensive industries). This result also supports the existence of different micro-channel in spillovers between ports and regions.

This research tells us that the various types of knowledge spillover channels are engaged in regional industrial diversification and each channel plays a role with different intensity over product complexity and technological sophistication, suggesting that more delicate and targeted policy is required for 30 regional industrial diversification.",

Instead, we include the ubiquity k calculated from the product space and the product complexity index derived from the world trade data to control product characteristics of importance in this context and use a standard error term allowing for within-cluster correlation of products to be robust. 1 Standard errors are in parentheses 2 *** p< 0.01, ** p< 0.05, * p< 0.1 3 This is the value of R 2 in the case of a linear probability model(LPM). 4 Mean VIF represents the mean of uncentered variance inflation factors (VIFs) for all applied variables, detecting the collinearity.

(2018) decomposed the related knowledge that workers bring into pioneer firms into two different dimensional spaces-the network of related industries and the network of related occupations. Then constructing the two relatedness indicators capturing industry and occupation knowledge, they estimated the spillover effect from different knowledge types on the survival rate of the firms within a region through logistic regression on the two relatedness indicators. In a recent paper,Catal\u00e1n et al. (2020) formalized the concept of a bi-layered network to represent the interactions between scientific and technological knowledge and capabilities at the country level by suggesting a modified measurement called the scientific and technological cross-space. The point is that Jara-Figueroa et al.(2018) considered two exogenous types of knowledge and applied two relatedness indicators in a regression model of spillover separately, while Catal\u00e1n et al.
