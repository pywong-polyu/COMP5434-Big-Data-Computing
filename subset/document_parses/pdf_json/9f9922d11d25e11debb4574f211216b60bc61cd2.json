At the same time, the human resources of health care are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. One of the management concepts that can help in solving this problem is business process management (BPM). The results of research conducted in the healthcare sector thus far prove that BPM is an effective tool for optimizing clinical processes, as it allows for the ongoing automatic tracking of key health parameters of an individual patient without the need to involve medical personnel. The aim of this article is to present and evaluate the redesign of diagnostic and therapeutic processes enabling the patient-centric organization of therapy thanks to the use of new telemedicine techniques and elements of hyperautomation. By using an illustrative case study of one of the most common chronic diseases, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), we discuss the use of clinical pathways (CPs) prepared on the basis of the current version of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as a communication tool between healthcare professionals, the patient and his or her caregivers, as well as the method of identifying and verifying new knowledge generated on an ongoing basis in diagnostic and therapeutic processes. We also show how conducting comprehensive, patient-focused primary health care relieves the health care system, and at the same time, thanks to the use of patient engagement and elements of artificial intelligence (predictive analyses), reduces the significant clinical risk of therapy.",

This requires a redesign of diagnostic and therapeutic processes to enable a holistic view of the patient's health and disease, and simultaneously enable the most effective use of available resources. To achieve the best cost/quality ratio, healthcare management must follow the same path as other sectors and therefore apply similar concepts, methods, and technologies. One of the most effective and most frequently used concepts today is business process management [1] . The results of research conducted in the healthcare sector thus far prove that BPM is a feasible and effective tool for optimizing clinical processes, as it allows for the ongoing automatic tracking of key health parameters of an individual patient without the need to involve medical personnel [2] [3] [4] . To expand and accelerate change and harness the potential of BPM in the health care sector, greater acceptance and commitment from the clinical community is needed, as well as stronger experimental research to test its actual and optimal scope of application [3, 5] . It is also necessary to be accepted by patients and their caregivers, who are not the object but the subject of diagnostic and therapeutic processes. Without their Sensors 2021, 21, 7383 2 of 13 cooperation, even the best and most innovative methods of diagnostics and therapy will not translate into better results.",

Their treatment is long-term and expensive and its effects usually depend on the coordination of therapeutic activities of interdisciplinary teams (often varying from a few to several dozen members) and the attitudes of the patients themselves. The contemporary view on disease and health management also draws increasing attention to the need to engage the patients and their caregivers in the therapeutic process. This trend is increasingly supported by changes in the social culture and the widespread availability of telemedicine technology that enables remote, real-time tracking and the prediction of changes in an increasing number of parameters critical to patient health. However, its use requires a change in traditional roles in the therapeutic process, according to which the doctor treats and the patient undergoes therapy. Especially in the case of chronic diseases, conscious and voluntary (without force or coercion) involvement of the patients and their caregivers in the treatment of the disease is essential. This requires specialists to provide the patient with knowledge about the therapy in a clear and understandable form and to clearly define the scope of the patient's responsibility. It also requires continuous updating of medical knowledge and continuous analysis of the patient's critical vital signs and updating their individual care plan (ICP) as needed. The care pathway approach offers interdisciplinary care teams the same focus, with roles and communication channels set and adhering to the same evidence-based standards.",

            "text": "The aim of this article is to present and evaluate the redesign of diagnostic and therapeutic processes enabling patient-centric organization of therapy with the use of new telemedicine techniques and elements of hyperautomation. This is particularly important today for two reasons. First, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that skilled and committed workers are the most critical healthcare sector resource, and how quickly these resources are depleted when poorly managed. Secondly, it caused significant changes in the social and work culture, as well as in health care, as a result of which the acceptance of the implemented telemedicine technologies and elements of hyperautomation abruptly increased. However, taking advantage of the emerging opportunity to increase quality, reduce costs, and improve the cost/quality ratio requires a redesign of health care processes and a change in the approach to protecting the health of patients and their caregivers. In this article, for the presentation of models of clinical pathways, as an example of a chronic disease, we used Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)-currently one of the three leading causes of death in the world, which is responsible for over 3 million deaths annually [8] . COPD is also the most common chronic respiratory disease in adults [8] . It is estimated that around the world, 11.7% of people over 40 suffer from COPD [8] . Due to aging populations and increasing environmental threats, the number of patients suffering from chronic diseases is expected to increase. Although COPD is a preventable and treatable disease, its course is often fraught with exacerbations, the presence of which usually greatly accelerates the progression of the disease itself. Unfortunately, it is estimated that the disease is diagnosed at an early stage in less than 20% of patients. Hence, a significant population of patients is not diagnosed or is diagnosed only in the advanced stage of the disease [9] . Moreover, COPD is an additional, very serious risk factor when a patient suffers from COVID-19 [8] .",

Problems and inefficiencies in the clinical pathway were identified and addressed in the iterative design process and consulted with two high-class experts in the field of COPD from the Lodz Medical University, as we wanted to get a broader view of the complex clinical process and cover patients' and their caregivers' full engagement, as well as the newest and quickly changing telemedicine technology, integrating events and changes for each individual situation.

For the purposes of health care, traditional process management is insufficient, as it assumes the possibility of accurately designing the course of a process based on the full knowledge of its course before its implementation. The health care system undoubtedly requires periodic reassessment and flexibility due to constant changes in clinical guidelines and the variability of the patient's condition, which leads to the model being permanently adapted and improved upon. Due to the unpredictability and dependence of the results of diagnostic and therapeutic processes on the use of knowledge in a specific context of process implementation, it is necessary to use dynamic business process management (dynamic BPM) to describe and implement diagnostic and therapeutic processes in the most effective way [5, 19] .",

This makes it impossible to design clinical pathways like traditional business processes as a sequence of mandatory actions ( Figure 1A ).

Such an analysis of hundreds or thousands of CP implementations is in practice impossible without the use of process mining techniques to discover the course of processes or artificial intelligence (AI) for a detailed analysis of their course and results.

The disease, which lasts for years (and sometimes decades), presents the patients and their caregivers with increasing challenges in everyday life, but also enables them to significantly influence the effectiveness of ongoing therapy. As the disease progresses, the influence of the daily involvement of the patient and their caregivers on the effectiveness of therapy is becoming increasingly apparent. It can be implemented through an appropriate lifestyle, diet, exercise and rehabilitation, consistent implementation of drug therapy, prevention of exacerbations, etc. [29] . Although it is not currently possible to cure chronic diseases, it is possible to slow down or stop their progress and improve the quality of life of patients and their environment. However, this requires actual, conscious cooperation of all participants in the therapeutic process [16, 30] . For obvious reasons, it is impossible to achieve positive effects of therapy without the commitment and co-responsibility of the patients and their caregivers.

For this reason, an IPC should be prepared with the participation of the patient. Should any doubt arise, the IPC should be negotiated among the patient and the therapist. In order to ensure effective and systematic cooperation among the patients and their caregivers and the members of the therapeutic team, it is crucial to use a tool which is understood by both sides with respect to evaluating the patient's actual state and comparing it to the intended state. CPs fulfil these conditions, as they describe in a clear and concise fashion the logic of the proposed therapy, the tasks of the particular participants and crucial parameters pertaining to the patient's state of health, which require control and which may result in even sudden changes to the methods used in the course of therapy. When the patient is empowered to consciously and actively participate in the diagnostic-therapeutic process with the use of CPs or the correlated IPC, he or she gains insight into the activities expected of them and is able to analyse them and undertake them. In turn, members of the therapeutic team gain the possibility of analysing the activities undertaken in the patient's environment at selected time intervals and, with the use of telemedicine devices, also in real time. By having knowledge on his or her disease and understanding the therapeutic activities consciously, the patient manages his or her disease and contacts the indicated members of the therapeutic team in situations which require such contact, while also being able to find answers to questions and doubts without the need for contact in situations foreseen and described in the CP and the IPC.",

Only as a result thereof, a decision about the necessity of hospitalization can be made (gateway no. 22 and final event no. 23). Thanks to the ongoing monitoring of the parameters of the patient's condition, which does not burden medical personnel, it is possible to significantly reduce the number of hospitalizations, which relieves the health care system, and at the same time significantly minimizes the risks associated with hospitalization of a patient with COPD [13] . This possibility is particularly significant when the therapy is overseen by nonspecialist doctors, who do not have deep knowledge of COPD, e.g., general practitioners.

For the patients, it provides a chance for more effective treatment and better quality of life thanks to better adjustment of therapy and recommended pro-health behaviours to a specific clinical condition and, which is particularly important, through the conscious involvement of the patient and his or her caregivers in the effective reduction of disease risks and controlled self-management of the disease. This is of particular significance in the case of chronic diseases such as COPD, as it may lead to a reduction in possible exacerbation, slow disease progression and even stop the disease, thereby significantly reducing the social and healthcare costs. However, such a solution requires viewing the patient as an equal participant of the therapeutic process; as someone with rights, including the right to medical education and the right to co-decide on the course of therapy. The patients are required to depart from their traditional passive role in therapy and to acknowledge that they also have certain responsibilities and that their realization has an essential influence on the results of therapy. This also requires, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, to use telemedicine technology in order to lift the burden off of the healthcare system and raise the pace of creating knowledge helpful in combating the pandemic. The use of IT technologies already available in healthcare, such a cloud computing, BigData, process mining, predictive analytics, ML or AI allows for the real-time collection and analysis of data and their use with a view to verifying existing and creating new knowledge directly in the course of performing diagnostic-therapeutic processes. However, this requires making certain adaptations to existing healthcare rules and regulations to allow for performing and financing such actions in accordance with the proposed model.",

A particularly crucial area of future work, which will have considerable influence on the effectiveness of COPD treatment, is the data-driven analysis of the causes or signals of exacerbations. The authors and the pulmonologists involved in the study assume that on the basis of analyses of sets of BigData from completed treatments, new variants of CPs will be proposed with a view to mitigating the risk of exacerbations. At the same time, economic analysis pointing to the possibility of lowering direct costs of COPD treatment (e.g., hospital visits due to exacerbations) and long-term costs (e.g., the social costs of the patients' exit from the labour market or the costs of long-term care) will result in rapid changes to healthcare rules and regulations and will allow for their broad use.",
