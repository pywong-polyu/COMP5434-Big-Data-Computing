It aims to involve patients and/or family members in decisions related to clinical care and should be part of clinical practice. Shared decision-making means respecting the autonomy of patients and ensuring care that is consistent with their values and preferences. Therefore, the participation of patients and/or family members in decision-making should be considered when there are uncertainties about the benefits or a possibility of risks associated with any intervention. Generally, the understanding of patients and/or families when there is a decision to be made is achieved by discussing the pros and cons of existing options.

Possibilities should be presented as options, and risks and benefits should be clarified, but the options should not presented as recommendations or impositions. (7, 9, 10) The interpersonal relationship should be healthy A healthy interpersonal relationship during the decision-making process is based on helpfulness and must be egalitarian, empathetic and respectful, which means it must be exempt from value judgments about decisions. The physician's acceptance of the patient's and/or family's decisions should be unconditional. A lack of acceptance weakens trust -a key element of an healthy interpersonal relationship. (7) Structure the communication A structured conversation is the best way to convey complex information and help with the decision-making process. We suggest following the 12 basic rules of adequate communication used in the OPTION protocol (Table 1) , a tool for measuring the quality of communication to guide the shared decision-making process with the patient and/or family.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 375, "end": 378, "text": "(7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 379, "end": 381, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 382, "end": 385, "text": "10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 838, "end": 841, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1079, "end": 1088, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Define priority issues"}, {"text": "As evidence, the content of the conversation and its steps should be recorded in the medical records. (11, 12) Be cautious when making any recommendations Contrary to common sense among health professionals, some communication models for shared decision-making suggest not generating direct recommendations in order to avoid imposing the values of the professional on the decisions of others. On the other hand, many patients and/ or family members ask for a doctor's recommendation, and the lack of an opinion can amplify emotional stress. In these cases, the professional's opinion should revisit the risks and benefits, indicating the possibility of postponing the decision or even reviewing it in the future. Providing emotional support during that conversation may be necessary.
