Pain, and the suffering people experience as a result of pain, is one of the greatest neglected global health challenges we face while the means to alleviate pain are some of the least costly and most cost effective global health interventions. 1 We live in a world where the strategies to manage pain have become more significant than the pain itself, and a world where privilege and postcode is more likely to determine when and how pain is alleviated. The opioid epidemic in the USA has put off kilter a decade of work to establish essential medicines for palliative care. 2 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) pain guidelines, developed by an expert working group for non-experts, are relevant in each African country. 3 However, these guidelines are only as effective as the capacity within each country for implementation. We will review the barriers and strategies for addressing challenges which are even more pertinent as we reflect on the impact on the COVID-19 pandemic on already stretched health systems.",

Limitations on who can prescribe morphine, how many cosignatures are required even when death is close and time-limited, add to lack of robust procurement, insufficient stock, suboptimal storage and absence of any buffer. In many African countries, morphine is only available in major city centre hospitals, or national cancer centres, and not in health centres in rural regions. Patients in severe pain due to illnesses such as cancer may struggle to afford their medications alongside other out of pocket health and travel costs, thus pushing them further into a spiral of debt and poverty.",

This may allow a range of affordable formulations that allow for cost-effective procurement and distribution, as well as flexibility, for patient use. Rigorous, protective yet flexible systems for monitoring opioid distribution, such as using mobile phone technology, could create linkages which can support procurement and match supply and prescriber availability to patients.",

The works of the pan-African Palliative Care Association (APCA), the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care (IAHPC) and the International Children's Palliative Care Network (ICPCN), have drawn together excellent resources to support services and build adequate pain relief at national levels. The WHO Planning and Implementing Palliative Care services published research conducted by the University of Edinburgh and Makerere University in their Integrate project (funded by a Tropical Health Education Trust and the UK's Department of International Development), which set out templates to show how these implementation strategies can be integrated into health systems. 5 6 Renee and colleagues note that ESMO is committed to assisting in achieving better care for patients with cancer in Africa, through the ESMO Designated Centre of Integrated Oncology and Palliative Care, and they ask for high-level advocacy to enforce regulations that monitor and evaluate morphine availability and palliative care training. With this vital 'pan-African public healthcare initiative', we would also suggest that a monitoring consortium to track and analyse policy, health system, socioeconomic and political responses to access and delivery of the guidelines through the journal is established.",

If ever there was a time for global solidarity and for ensuring palliative care is integrated into health and education systems alongside community empowerment and compassionate, holistic, dignified care for those in pain and at the end of life, that time has come.",
