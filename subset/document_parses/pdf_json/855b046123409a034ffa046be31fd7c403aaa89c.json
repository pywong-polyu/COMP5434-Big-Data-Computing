More than 500,000 cases were recorded in Saudi Arabia, as reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). 2 Vaccination is a critical strategy in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, to restrict infections and reduce disease severity. 3 As in other viral epidemic diseases in the past, vaccination has undoubtedly made a significant contribution to human and animal health, notably in developing countries. 4 Vaccination coverage will be more extensive if we can better identify vaccination barriers in the population, especially among vulnerable groups, of which one is pregnant women.",

            "text": "Recommendations from the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) have maintained that the vaccine should be offered to pregnant and lactating women based on their risk, and that mRNA-based vaccines are thought to pose a low risk to the fetus as the mRNA is expected to degrade in the circulation. 5, 6 According to the data, pregnant women are at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease. 7 Pregnant women were three times more likely than non-pregnant women to be hospitalized to the ICU or require intubation, and one and half times more likely to die from COVID-19, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 8 Acceptance of vaccination depends on society's awareness of disease risk, vaccine attitudes, and demand, and is crucial for immunization programs to achieve high vaccination coverage rates, particularly for newly developing contagious diseases. [9] [10] [11] Even before the current COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO identified vaccine hesitancy, as the delay in accepting vaccines or refusal of them, as one of the top ten threats to global health. 12 The general population's acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was high, and is recorded as at 90% in China, 13 70% in the United States, 14, 15 and 75% in France. 16, 17 This is in contrast to a previous study conducted in the United States in 2020, in which less than half of pregnant women stated they were likely to obtain the COVID-19 vaccination. 18 Another study reported that pregnant respondents had a lower rate of vaccine acceptance (44.3%) than non-pregnant women (76.2%). 19 Understanding the causes of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in pregnant women is critical for devising specific approaches to manage hesitancy and increase vaccination awareness. No studies have been conducted to evaluate the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the level of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and detect the factors that influence vaccine acceptance among pregnant women in Saudi Arabia.",

Sample size was calculated using Raosoft online sample size calculator. The calculation was based on 95% confidence interval and 5% margin of error. The calculated sample size was 306 participants. We further inflated that number to ensure accurate and generalizable results. Multistage sampling technique was used. First, we divided Saudi Arabia into North, South, East, West and Central Regions. Second, we assigned data collectors in each region to distribute the questionnaire link to the target population. The COVID-19 vaccine was initially approved for adults above 18 years old. Therefore, all pregnant women above 18 years were invited to participate in the study. Pregnant under 18 years of age and those with a contraindication to receiving COVID-19 vaccination (ie, allergy to vaccine components) were excluded. The patient's pregnancy stage was determined based on their latest menstrual cycle or first-trimester crown-rump length.",

We also found that the women with higher number of household members above 65 years were more likely to accept the vaccine. This is probably due to higher concern about the risk of disease transmission to elderly. While multiparity was associated with greater acceptance of COVID-19 in our study, another study performed in six European countries found the opposite. 25 In the multivariate regression analysis, we discovered significant geographic variation in pregnant women's acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Women in the South, North, and Central Regions were three times, twice, and one and a half times more likely to receive the vaccine compared to Western Region, respectively. This may be because of more comprehensively distributed primary healthcare centers in Southern Region. Better health education to pregnant women from healthcare workers may have led to an increase in their knowledge about the disease, through, for example, dissemination of brochures about COVID-19 preventive measures.",

Surprisingly, our study found that pregnant women were almost four times more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccination, similar to findings in a Turkish study. 5 Pregnant women in our study who thought that the vaccine has the possibility of harm to their babies were less likely to accept vaccination. The CDC has stated that the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women are proven. 30 The ACOG has reported no evidence of maternal or fetal complications from vaccinating pregnant women with COVID-19 vaccines. 31 The WHO recommends using the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women where the benefits of immunization exceed the risks.

The Saudi government and ministry of health have been encouraging pregnant women to be vaccinated, as recommended by the WHO. A high level of awareness about COVID-19 vaccination in the study population was noticeable; however, lack of data and fear of harming the fetus are two major concerns among pregnant women when considering COVID-19 vaccination. Considering the reasons some pregnant women refuse to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, continued public health efforts, such as educational television programs and awareness campaigns about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine for pregnant women, are required to raise awareness. More studies of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant women would assist in overcoming these obstacles and encourage pregnant women to be vaccinated.",
