In these countries, the population aged 60+ is expected to double within 20 years or less, while developed countries face the same problem within a timeframe of 150 years.

They proposed two solutions to the problem: The first one required the deployment of a common data model that seemed rather optimistic; the second one, the semantic web approach, employed SPARQL queries over data that were converted into RDF format.
