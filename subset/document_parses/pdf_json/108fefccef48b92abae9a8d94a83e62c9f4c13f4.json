            "text": "Numerous studies have focused on the need to expand production of 'blue foods', defined as aquatic foods captured or cultivated in marine and freshwater systems, to meet rising population-and income-driven demand. Here we analyze the roles of economic, demographic, and geographic factors and preferences in shaping blue food demand, using secondary data from FAO and The World Bank, parameters from published models, and case studies at national to sub-national scales. Our results show a weak cross-sectional relationship between per capita income and consumption globally when using an aggregate fish metric. Disaggregation by fish species group reveals distinct geographic patterns; for example, high consumption of freshwater fish in China and pelagic fish in Ghana and Peru where these fish are widely available, affordable, and traditionally eaten. We project a near doubling of global fish demand by mid-century assuming continued growth in aquaculture production and constant real prices for fish. Our study concludes that nutritional and environmental consequences of rising demand will depend on substitution among fish groups and other animal source foods in national diets.",

A common view is that the production of aquatic foods, referred to here as \"blue foods\" captured from or cultivated in marine and freshwater systems, will need to expand in coming decades to meet population-and income-driven demand. The regional and species-specific aspects of demand are often obscured, however, raising questions about the alignment of demand and supply across a diverse array of aquatic food systems. This paper examines blue food demand for multiple species groups across regions over time. Unlike other papers that present comprehensive models of fish demand and supply [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , this study provides a synthetic analysis based on secondary data from FAO and The World Bank, parameters from published models, and case studies at national to sub-national scales to characterize the diverse and changing nature of blue food consumption. It also compares consumption patterns for fish and terrestrial meat that are potential substitutes in demand. An assessment of blue food demand across geographies and time horizons provides insight into the nutritional and environmental outcomes of changing diets, as discussed in the \"Results\" section.",

            "text": "The conceptual framework for this study aligns with consumer theory 6, 7 characterizing blue food demand as a function of population, income, relative prices, and preferences; other household characteristics such as employment and urban versus rural residence are embedded in preferences. Consumption is determined by a two-step budgeting process wherein consumers first allocate expenditures among separate groups of goods (for example, food versus non-food) and then allocate spending within each group (for example, different types of fish or fish versus terrestrial meat). Food typically comprises a large budget share for low-income consumers, making their food purchases more responsive to changes in prices and income than wealthy consumers. Accordingly, the income elasticity of demand for food in the aggregate, a metric of the responsiveness of demand to changes in income (see \"Methods\"), is higher for low-income populations than for high-income populations and declines with income growth (Engel's Law) 8,9 . Consumers diversify food expenditures according to price and quality as their incomes increase, spending less of their budget on staple foods and more on luxury items 10 . Income elasticities of demand are thus greater for high market-valued foods, including aquatic and terrestrial animal products, than for low market-valued staple foods [9] [10] [11] . Since some wild fish are used for fishmeal and fish oil in animal feeds, demand for fish as a feed ingredient is expected to rise with per capita income growth 5 . These relationships provide a foundation for assessing both time series and cross-sectional trends in blue food demand within the global food system.",

Small island nations with an abundance of wild fish in their ocean territories record especially high per capita fish consumption (Supplementary Table 1 ). In other regions, particularly throughout Asia, the expansion of aquaculture has driven down real prices for farmed fish produced in large volumes, making them increasingly accessible to low-income consumers 13 . Meanwhile, wild capture fish have become more expensive, both in real terms and relative to farmed fish, often restricting their accessibility to wealthier consumers [14] [15] [16] . Our projections of future demand assume that producers are able to supply the quantity of fish demanded at constant real prices (see \"Methods\"), a plausible assumption given the steady growth in global aquaculture production [17] [18] [19] .

Diverse preferences have fostered use and trade in by-products, not just edible fish or fish fillets 31 . For example, salmon heads from Norwegian and Scottish aquaculture find viable markets as human food throughout Southeast Asia, and shrimp shells and pangasius oil from Vietnam are used in medical and agricultural products (chitosan) and livestock feed formulation, both domestically and after the edible fish products are exported to China 31, 32 .

Previous models of fish demand have shown that consumption of blue foods cannot be characterized by a single 'fish' variable, as preferences and income elasticities of demand differ widely between low versus high market-valued fish 1,3,5 . Fish consumption also tends to be measured less accurately than terrestrial meat in FAO data due to the wide variety of edible products 35 . Preserved blue foods (dried, salted, fermented, smoked) account for a substantial share of fish consumption, particularly in Southeast Asia and Africa, adding nutrients and distinct flavors to local cuisines 20, [36] [37] [38] . In the Mekong River Basin, small quantities of dried or otherwise processed fish account for 15% of fresh whole animal equivalent weights 39 , and in Myanmar they constitute roughly one-third of all blue food consumption 14 .",

Prices for the two commodities are roughly equivalent (as measured against the price of staple calories) in certain large countries undergoing nutritional transitions, such as China and India, but show greater divergence in other countries that have varied availability and tastes for fish versus poultry 43 . Preferences have long been recognized as a major factor in consumer choice of animal source foods 7,44 , highlighting the need for further analysis at regional to subnational scales where geography, culture, and tastes can be differentiated.",

The dietary transitions unfolding globally will serve to restructure food systems and will likely set certain countries onto particular nutritional trajectories 72 . Although projections in Fig. 8 rely on a partial structural model of demand, they suggest a significant rise in fish consumption from current levels. As blue food consumption increases in several of these 10 countries (i.e., China, India, Nigeria, USA, Peru, Mexico, Brazil), per capita consumption of meat, dairy, and eggs will likely decrease, leading to greater dietary intake of DHA + EPA fatty acids, iron, calcium, and vitamin B-12, but reduced vitamin A intake if aquatic foods are substituted for other meat and dairy products 60 . If preferences were also to shift toward aquatic foods and away from ultraprocessed foods at higher levels of income for health reasons, consumers would likely experience reduced rates of diet-related non-communicable disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke) 60 provided that they have access to affordable fish supplies. For most countries in Fig. 8 , rising fish consumption will enrich diets in terms of micronutrients, including iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and zinc, and seafood omega-3 fatty acids 60 . Dietary transitions will also influence environmental outcomes at local to global scales. The EAT-Lancet Commission report in 2019 concluded that sustainable and healthy diets for the global population require a shift away from beef and foods high in saturated fats and sugars, and towards nutritious foods such as fish, vegetables, nuts, and fruits 40 . Substituting seafood for terrestrial meat for a growing world population will be accomplished mainly through aquaculture expansion, although capture fisheries, if managed sustainably, also have the potential to add to future fish supplies 41, 73 . Aquaculture production is more geographically concentrated than capture fisheries, and thus an increase in the share of aquaculture in the total fish supplies will require more seafood trade or further development of aquaculture into new geographic areas 17 .",

Price and affordability are the main barriers to nutritious diets for poor consumers 64 . The FAO has created a global fish price index based on traded commodities which serves as a proxy for both traded and nontraded fish prices 19, 80 ; however, this index and others do not target the wide range of locally produced and consumed species that are important for nutrition security throughout the Global South ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). National data on fish prices should be improved and coordinated for policy purposes given the nutritional and food justice consequences of price hikes for foodinsecure populations. More generally, there is an urgent need to integrate blue foods into national and global strategies on nutritional security and sustainable food systems. The dominant shock to blue food systems during 2020-21 has been the global COVID-19 pandemic, a topic not covered in this paper. Much improved data on household consumption and prices of both raw and processed products (e.g., dried or salted for long shelf life) are urgently needed to ameliorate the impacts of shocks, including pandemics and climate change, on vulnerable populations. Only then can global food policy leaders begin to create an internationally coherent vision of blue foods --one that has policy relevance and can deliver on nutrition, equity, and environmental objectives.",

We use a best fit line, modeled as y = ax b to reflect the nutrition transition, and compare the per capita consumption-income relationships between fish and terrestrial animals with r 2 values (r 2 = 0.11 and 0.64 in the case of fish and terrestrial animal consumption, respectively) (Fig. 1) .",

(Oceania is omitted from the detailed regional analysis given that it comprises only 1% of global fish consumption.) We explore historical per capita consumption for seven fish species groups, measured in edible weight, for the top two fish consuming countries in each region (calculated by per capita consumption times population size): China, India, Ghana, Nigeria, Peru, Brazil, USA, Mexico, Spain, and France. International trade of all fish is disaggregated by the seven specific fish species groups used in direct human consumption (Mt, live weight equivalent), for these ten countries in 2015.

Rather than supply constraints and prices exerting downward pressure on demand, the income elasticities in the model to 2050 were set to converge at 0.4 by 2050 in line with the global results from Muhammad et al. 2 . We assume that all income elasticities that begin above 0.4 trend towards 0.4 in equal annual increments, and that the implicit downward pressure on demand from a lower income elasticity likely captures some of the additional inhibitors of demand that are not included in this model, such as prices. As incomes increase, income elasticities decrease.

Data Source: FAOSTAT23 .Consumption (kg/cap/yr, edible)Fig. 3 Per capita apparent fish consumption by region and species group (kg/cap/year, edible weight) in 2015. Numbers in parentheses above the bars represent the share of global consumption. Asia, Europe, and Oceania demonstrate a high level of edible fish consumption per capita in relation to the global average (14.6 kg/cap/year, edible). Fish consumption in North America is close to the global average, whereas Africa and South America are significantly below the global per capita average. Data Source: FAOSTAT 23 .
