This study aimed to explore the effects of communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) on microbial diversity and identify potential biomarkers of respiratory tract in CAP LRTI patients. In the current study, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed based on metagenomic next-generation sequencing technology, followed by alpha and beta diversity, LEfSe, and co-occurrence network analysis, and random forest model construction. Our results showed that CAP dramatically influenced taxon abundance, and the significant differences in microbiota including Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes and Spirochetes were observed at the phylum level. Co-occurrence network selected out novel modules involved in microbial proliferation-associated pathways. A random forest model screened Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus as potential diagnostic biomarkers with high AUC values. The microbial composition was different between CAP LRTI patients and non-CAP LRTI patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus were strongly associated with increased severity of LRTI with a pneumonia history. Our findings provided an insight for a better understanding of community and structure of lung microbiota for future diagnosis and treatment in LRTI patients with a history of pneumonia. Moreover, these microbes were considered as potential biomarkers for predicting the risks for the treatment strategies of LRTI.",

Previous studies have shown that potential pathogens can cause a variety of diseases, including LRTI and pneumonia [2] . For example, previous evidence suggests that Staphylococcus aureus is associated with the course of LRTI [3] . Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated as a common infection [4] . It has been showed more than 2 million children die from pneumonia each year worldwide [5] . Additionally, Mycoplasma Pneumoniae is considered to be a common causative agent of CAP [2] , and acute LRTI [6] . Antibiotics commonly used to treat Mycoplasma Pneumoniae are still necessary for LRTI secondary to Mycoplasma Pneumoniae in children [6] . Klebsiella pneumonia has been directly found in LRTI patients, and it was identified as a etiological factor causing LRTI based on clinical features [7, 8] . Nowadays, it is still a challenge for clinicians and microbiologists to reduce pulmonary complication and eliminate toxicity of empirical antibiotic therapies. By understanding the differences in the microbiological composition of patients with CAP and non-CAP LRTI, the disease risk can be predicted and treatment plans can be developed accordingly [9] .",

In addition, Acinetobacter, Bacillus and Staphylococcus were recognized as pathogenic bacteria associated with LRTI [14] . The balance of microbial composition is affected by inflammatory responses and antibiotic application [15] . Moreover, acute and chronic lung diseases change the migration and elimination of lung microbiome [16] . It has been demonstrated changes in the dynamics of the respiratory microbiota are associated with pneumonia, and pneumonia causes the lung microbiome out of balance [12] . The history of pneumonia was screened as a strong risk factor for COPD exacerbation [17] . The hospitalized patients with a history of pneumonia showed a higher risk of developing lung disease, compared to non-CAP patients [18] .

In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, the alpha diversity is significantly decreased compared to that of control groups [30] . In LRTI patients, the alpha diversity has been reported to decrease compared to that of patients with upper respiratory tract infection [31] . For beta diversity indexes, our results found a dramatical difference in the composition (PcoA, P = 0.0045), suggesting a potential effect of pneumonia history on lung microbiota in patients with LRTI. Similarly, studies have demonstrated significant differences in beta diversity of microbiota between the upper and the lower respiratory tract [31] . In upper respiratory tract infection, there is a higher probability in the alteration of lung microbial composition [32] . In saliva microbiota, the results of beta diversity analysis showed that the community structures were dramatically different in Helicobacter pylori uninfected and infected patients, showing that pathogenic bacteria affect the community structures of lung microbiota [33] .

A recent study showed that a random forest model is used for feature selection and biomarkers screening [41] . The random forest algorithm has been used to identify the gut microbiota as biomarkers in major depressive disorders [42] . Another study showed that a random forest model was established based on oral microbiota, which is used for biomarker selection [43] . To explore the novel microbial markers to distinguish LRTI patients with or without CAP, the random forest analysis was used to screen the biomarkers in the present study. Studies have reported that random forest classification at the genus level was used to select out the gut microbiota as biomarkers for major depressive disorders [42] . In children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, a random forest model was established to screen 12 genera in gut microbiota as biomarkers using nested crossvalidation analysis [44] . In nasopharyngeal microbial composition, the random forest model was used to explore the bacterial genera involving in pneumococcal colonization [45] . In LRTI, the random forest classifier analyses on the bacterial data were performed to discriminate LRTI from healthy individuals [20] . These results showed that a random forest model was considered as a universal method to screen potential novel bacterial genera and biomarkers.",

The obtained results showed that the accumulation in the increasing abundance of Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae was associated with the lung microbiota profiles of LRTI patients with CAP compared with that in LRTI patients without CAP. Studies showed that microbiome dysbiosis was considered as biomarkers for the development of potential colorectal cancer [46] . In addition, Bacillus cereus was regarded as a volatile human pathogen [47] . In pneumonia patients, Bacillus cereus contributes to the development of severe pneumonia and it is recognized as a potential pathogen [48] . There were few literatures reporting that Bacillus cereus causes LRTI [48, 49] . Our results showed Bacillus cereus was identified as a marker in LRTI patients with a history of pneumonia. Whether Bacillus cereus directly causes the development of LRTI or homeostasis of microbial diversity in pneumonia will be explored in our future study. Interestingly, our findings revealed Klebsiella pneumonia as the indicator of CAP LRTI patients using random forest classifier, which got an AUC value of 0.804. Studies have showed that Klebsiella pneumonia are the important pathogens causing pneumonia, which are associated with high morbidity and mortality [50, 51] . In wheezing episodes in children, Klebsiella pneumoniae are predictive markers for the prediction of wheeze [52] . In the diversity of pathogens responsible for LRTI, Klebsiella pneumonia were identified as the most predominant single pathogens [53] .",
