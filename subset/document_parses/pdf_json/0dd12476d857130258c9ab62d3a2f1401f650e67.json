            "text": "Of the estimated 400 000 annual malaria deaths, the majority occur in children < 5 years of age living in Sub-Saharan Africa. 1 Progress towards further reducing malaria's death toll has stalled in recent years and new and complementary approaches are needed to make progress towards global and national malaria elimination targets. 1 Access to prompt treatment with parenteral artesunate followed by an oral artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) alongside the management of complications can save a child suffering from a life-threatening episode of severe malaria. 2 Usually, only secondary or tertiary health facilities have inpatient wards with the capacity to manage a child with severe malaria comprehensively. Primary health centres (PHC) are often neither equipped nor allowed to administer injections and community health workers (CHW) are only trained to administer oral treatment for uncomplicated malaria episodes and are not qualified to diagnose or treat severe malaria. Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) programmes instruct CHWs to identify children with danger signs of severe illness (including those indicative of severe malaria) and then immediately refer the child to the nearest health facility. 3 Children are therefore more likely to suffer from fatal or debilitating consequences of severe malaria in areas where the services of higher-level health facilities are difficult to access. 4, 5 At primary health care level, options to manage severe malaria are typically limited to pre-referral treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a single dose of intramuscular (IM) artesunate, or, if injections are not available and the patient is <6 years of age, a single rectal dose of artesunate, followed by immediate referral to a higher-level health facility. 2 Rectal artesunate (RAS) rapidly reduces the malaria parasite load 6 and in a placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted in Bangladesh, Ghana and Tanzania, the use of pre-referral RAS was found to reduce case fatality of an episode of broadly defined severe malaria by 26% (risk ratio [RR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.59-0.93) in children below 6 years of age. 7, 8 In children who took more than 6 hours to reach a higherlevel facility, RAS reduced death and permanent disability by about 50% (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.77). 7 Evidence from a single randomized controlled trial is unlikely to reflect the real-world effect of rolling out RAS at scale 9 and offers limited operational guidance on the optimal way of introducing RAS. The community-wide exposure-response relationship is complex and affected by the broader health system context. 10 Previously, the unavailability of a World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified product hampered the generation of real-world evidence of the effectiveness of RAS. With two RAS formulations obtaining prequalification since 2018 and an increasing number of malaria control programmes ordering RAS, 11, 12 there was an urgent need to generate evidence of the impact of introducing pre-referral RAS in routine clinical practice. The potential of RAS to prevent malaria deaths in high-burden settings should be ascertained to establish the role of this intervention in the quest to reduce malaria mortality by 90% by 2030. 13 Here, we report on principal findings of the Community Access to Rectal Artesunate for Malaria (CARAMAL) Project, an observational study accompanying the large-scale introduction of pre-referral quality-assured RAS in is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint ",

Day 28 visits were carried out at the patient's home by trained study staff. Home visits included structured interviews with the patient's caregiver to record the health status and retrospectively elicit the history of signs and symptoms, treatment seeking behaviour, and administration of antimalarials including RAS.

Improved health has previously been reported as a reason for non-compliance with referral advice. 20, 24 However, comprehensive antimalarial treatment after a dose of RAS is crucial as one dose of artesunate alone (or in combination with another only partly effective antimalarial) cannot fully clear an infection. 2, 25 This study found patients receiving post-referral treatment with a parenteral antimalarial (plus ACT) to be significantly less likely to die (or be sick at follow-up). Yet, many patients who successfully completed referral did not receive both parenteral antimalarial treatment and an ACT at the referral facility ( Table 2 , manuscript in preparation). In Nigeria, parenteral treatment was common but none of the patients received an ACT at the Cottage Hospital.",

Pre-referral treatment with RAS with or without subsequent parenteral artesunate, but without an oral ACT, constitutes artemisinin monotherapy treatment. This is a risk for both resistance development and positive selection of circulating artesmisinin-resistant parasites, the latter of which has been found in Uganda (manuscript in preparation). 26 All patients included in this study had access to formal health care providers (enrolment criterion) and 42-73% of deaths occurred in a health facility, often several days after first contact with the formal health system (mean 2.4-6.3 days). In Nigeria, the CFR among patients enrolled at a PHC exceeded 20% over several months (mean 18.6%, data not included) (Supplementary Figure S5) . Together, these findings reflect weak health care systems that are often unable to save the lives of severely sick children. In these challenging settings, pre-referral RAS did not appear to have a beneficial health effect despite the potential of this intervention demonstrated under different circumstances. 7 Introducing pre-referral RAS without ensuring an effective continuum of care (including high referral rates and high-quality post-referral treatment) is unlikely to decrease mortality in settings with a high malaria burden but a weak health system. Conversely, RAS is most likely to be beneficial in locations where initial access to health care may be hampered, but post-referral services are available and of good quality. This is supported by the finding of a moderately beneficial effect in Uganda, where baseline CFR was lowest, the number of CHW per person was highest, accessibility of formal health facilities was best (measured eg. in distance/time to facility), and out of pocket treatment costs were lowest (manuscript in preparation). Evidence from implementing a package of interventions including RAS in Zambia also supports this notion. 18 ",

The beneficial effect of RAS pre-referral treatment on survival found in the trial by Gomes et al. 7,8 could not be replicated in the 'real-world' scenarios of the three study sites. On the contrary, in DRC and Nigeria, patients treated with RAS were more likely to die over the course of the follow-up period. The use of RAS was found to have a slight positive health effect in Uganda, driven primarily by a reduction in children reported sick at followup (aOR = 0.61). Patients who were sick at follow-up had a positive mRDT or severe anaemia (Hb < 7 g/dL) more often than those who were healthy. RAS users were less often mRDT-positive (all countries) or severely anaemic (DRC and Uganda) at follow-up.",

Anecdotal evidence suggests that health workers stocking only a small number of RAS doses may have administered RAS preferentially to more severely sick children (CARAMAL Project, unpublished data). The small number of deaths in Uganda did not allow accounting for such potential confounders in the CFR analysis. Due to the communitylevel enrolment strategy in all countries, an expert clinical assessment of patients (incl. diagnosis of co-morbidities that might impact the effectiveness of malaria treatment) was not available for this analysis.In the absence of comprehensive measures to strengthen the underlying health system implemented synergistically with the introduction of RAS, several factors along the continuum of care may have hampered the effectiveness of RAS. Between 32.5% and 45.8% of study patients did not complete referral to an appropriate health facility. In DRC and Nigeria, we found evidence of RAS use having an adverse effect on referral completion (manuscript in preparation). Non-completion of referral after pre-referral treatment with RAS has been reported from other studies, 20,23 and may prevent patients from obtaining adequate post-referral treatment. Economic barriers and distance were frequently mentioned as reasons for not completing referral in this study (manuscript in preparation).The finding that patients who did not complete referral were less likely to die may be a result of less severely sick .
