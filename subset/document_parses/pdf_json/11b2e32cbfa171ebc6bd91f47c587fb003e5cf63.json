If tested negative, patients should undergo Doppler ultrasound (DUS), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or peripheral angiogram followed by revascularization if indicated and if hospital resources allow. If tested positive for COVID-19, DUS or CTA should be performed to exclude total occlusion of arteries below the knee (BTK), and conservative treatment with GDMT should be pursued. In case of persistent flow BTK and the absence of imminent limb loss, revascularization should be postponed until 14 days after the positive SARS-Cov-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test with 3 days of being afebrile (<100 F) not on antipyretics and significant resolution of symptoms. In patients with RF class 5 or 6 wound care is crucial, and close monitoring for progressive tissue loss, wet gangrene, and ascending cellulitis is mandated since these represent indications for immediate revascularization regardless of COVID-19 status.",

In addition, since catheter-directed thrombolysis requires 24 hours of intensive care unit stay and repeat peripheral angiogram, mechanical thrombectomy may be preferred. Nevertheless, if the EVI results are not optimal, a low threshold should be maintained to convert to surgical therapy. Although reported in single cases, systemic thrombolysis as initial treatment of ALI in patients with severe COVID-19 cannot be recommended due to the lack of supporting evidence. 4 In patients with ALI stage III (non-salvageable limb), a decision on the timing of major amputation should be based on the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. 5 In addition to the above recommendations, the general considerations illustrated in Figure 1 should be taken into account and may guide clinical practice.

The patient did not have any fever, shortness of breath, or cough and had no known prior contact with COVID-19 positive subjects. The patient had a percutaneous right coronary intervention in 8/2019 and superficial femoral artery (SFA) stent implantation in 9/2019. The DUS revealed an occlusion in the stented SFA segment and resting anklebrachial index of 0.28 on the right and 0.87 on the left. Due to the acuity of symptoms and the DUS findings, the decision was made to perform a peripheral angiogram. The angiogram revealed thrombotic occlusion of the SFA with the reconstitution of the distal segment, and 3-vessel run off to the foot ( Figure 2 ). The SARS-CoV-19 virus PCR test was obtained prior to the angiogram and came back positive. Her chest X-ray was normal, and other COVID-19 prognostic biomarkers (e.g., D-dimer, lymphopenia) were negative. Based on the clinical presentation (Rutherford class 4; normal motor function with no imminent limb loss) and due to positive COVID-19 status, taking into consideration the high risk of intubation and general anesthesia to the patient and medical personnel, intervention was deferred. Other factors contributing to this decision included the consideration that endovascular intervention in this highly thrombotic in-stent stenosis might require catheter-directed thrombolysis as a bailout strategy. According to our institutional protocol, patients who undergo catheter-directed thrombolysis require ICU admission for the duration of thrombolysis followed by repeat angiogram 24 hours later. At the time of the patient's presentation New York was approaching the peak of the pandemic and ICU capacities were extremely limited. However, due to the young age of the patient and failed prior EVI the vascular team decided that surgical revascularization with femoral-popliteal bypass is the best long term approach for the patient. The patient was treated with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID, and analgesic agents. She was discharged home with telehealth surveillance twice per week. Her lower extremity symptoms did not deteriorate, and she underwent successful surgical revascularization utilizing a venous femoral-popliteal bypass after 2 weeks with a negative SARS-COV-2 virus PCR test.",

He was found to be hypoxic on admission (SpO2 90% on room air) and was placed on oxygen support. He was confirmed SARS-CoV-19 virus PCR test positive. D-dimer level on admission was 6,802 ng/mL, and DUS showed isolated popliteal artery occlusion with reconstitution of tibial arteries as well as soleal vein thrombosis (Figure 3, panel A) . Additionally, he was diagnosed with pulmonary thromboembolism. Therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin was administered. His chest X-ray was abnormal with multiple areas of infiltrates. Given his tenuous pulmonary status, the vascular team deferred emergent lower extremity revascularization. After initial improvement of the patient's foot pain, the clinical condition worsened with an increase in ischemic pain and deterioration of the neurologic status of the affected limb on day 8. The vascular team decided that an emergent peripheral angiogram should be performed due to imminent limb loss. An intraoperative angiogram demonstrated a second lesion in the left common iliac artery (Figure 3, panel B) in addition to the earlier popliteal lesion. Surgical intervention was performed with embolectomy of the popliteal and common iliac artery. The completion angiogram revealed excellent blood flow to the left lower extremity. Intravenous heparin was discontinued post-procedure. The postoperative course was unremarkable, and anticoagulation therapy was resumed on the third postoperative day. During surgery, gray-white thrombi were retrieved, and clot pathology demonstrated platelet-rich thrombus with red blood cells and minimal fibrin (Figure 4 ). Therefore clopidogrel therapy was initiated. After further discussion with the vascular team, the patient was discharged home on oral anticoagulation (due to PE/DVT) and clopidogrel (for arterial thrombosis) with complete recovery on day 14.",

Additionally, our considerations certainly apply to regions that are considered epicenters of the pandemic. Nevertheless, in view of the currently increasing numbers of infections in many other regions of the world our insights constitute a differentiated approach that may help others to identify the cases in which procedures can be safely postponed in order to avoid an exhaustion of the health care system but also the cases in which a procedure should not be postponed to avoid further harm for the patient. The application of this suggested triage system will facilitate the ongoing care of PAD patients during the current pandemic.",
