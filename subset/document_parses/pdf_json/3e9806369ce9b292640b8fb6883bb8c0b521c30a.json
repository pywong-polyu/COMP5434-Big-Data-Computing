The use of telehealth communication in intensive care unit settings, specifically between physicians and families, is an effective means of communication to avoid direct in-person contact [10] . Telemedicine has been effectively used to reduce physician exposure risks and conserve personal protection equipment (PPE) [3, 11] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has been applied in different subspecialties, including neurology [12] , orthopedics [13] , neurosurgery [14] , dermatology [15] , and even in ophthalmology [4] , for remote consultations and assessment. Family meetings and conversations between patients and families can be carried out by using telecommunication [16] .",

Two-way radio transceivers have the advantage of being relatively inexpensive, simple to operate while wearing PPE, and easy to decontaminate after use [17] . However, two-way radio transceivers do not have a secure channel, and there is often miscommunication between personnel sharing the same channel. Radio frequencies are often blocked by lead-lined walls [17] . Both audio and video communications are available on telephone devices, and video consultations are preferred by physicians managing acute conditions [18, 19] . When consulting by video, however, technical problems are frequently noted, and the information gained from communication is often inferior to that gained from face-to-face interaction. Therefore, video consultation is more suitable for less complicated clinical problems that do not require physical examination [20] .",

Prior to this community outbreak, suspected COVID-19 cases managed in the ED were very few in numbers. The ED managed patients with a high risk of COVID-19 infection in negative-pressure isolation rooms, donning and doffing PPE during each encounter. This patient care model was immediately challenged by the increase in suspected cases of COVID-19 infections during the beginning of the outbreak. In response to the pandemic, the model of patient care has changed dramatically, and applications of ICT have been used in several medical environments. During this pandemic, ED workers have faced several challenges. Strategies to reduce exposure risks and to decrease disease transmissions must be made. Patients must be diverted into different areas according to their clinical status and risk of infection to reduce risks of disease transmission. Evaluating and reallocating patients while ensuring staff safety prompted the use of telemedicine in the ED environment.",

Hospitals and healthcare facilities 3 of 14 play a critical role in response to epidemics and must react immediately to the disaster. To act promptly to a communicable disease epidemic, an ICT module can be added to a strategic preparedness and response plan. However, the challenges of patient evaluation in the ED using ICT are seldom discussed in the literature [3, 6, 27, 28] . Introducing a novel module in the ED, especially during a pandemic, can be an arduous experience. For those interested in utilizing ICT modules, avoidance of \"reinventing the wheel\" is recommended. Identification of the challenges may facilitate the process of ICT setup, reduce the cost of implementation, and improve the satisfaction of stakeholders. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the factors influencing the development and use of ICT to assess patients in the ED.",

Telemedicine was efficiently used in monitoring chronic conditions such as management of heart failure or blood sugar control consultations in diabetic patients [37] . Telemedicine was also widely utilized in prehospital settings, such as patient interviews and consultations, patient triage, and telemonitoring. In prehospital settings, synchronous video communication aided in providing the call dispatcher with more information on the scene when handling emergency calls [38] . In contrast to traditional remote telemedicine in outpatient settings, the purpose of applying ICT in the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic was to reduce direct contact between healthcare providers and patients and thus minimize disease transmission risk.",

Second, we did not evaluate the patients' perspectives. The comfortableness of medical and nursing staff using tablets for communication was not addressed in our study as well. Questionnaires on satisfaction of using ICT will be provided in the future. Third, prehospital settings were not included in our investigation. However, with appropriate devices and software applications, our protocol can be applied to connect physicians and nonphysicians, such as medical staff in nursing homes or emergency medical technicians. Finally, we used grounded theory in this study because as an exploratory method, grounded theory is suitable for investigating issues that have attracted limited prior research attention. As a method that has advanced over time, grounded theory is a broadly applied research method that has incorporated several different variants [41] . Our study was a pilot study focusing on the challenges of using ICT in the EDs during pandemics. Although digital expertise and ICT have rapidly advanced, there is a disparity in the attitudes and competence levels towards technology among different populations. During the pandemic, the pace of ED workflow changes and adjustments have been expeditious, adding to the difficulties of this study.
