However, insecure attachment can be divided into attachment avoidance and anxiety, so a better understanding of the relationship between attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, and depressive symptoms is needed. The current study applied a structural equation model to verify our hypothesis that different facets of affective empathy mediate the relationship between attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The participants of this study included four hundred and sixty-four undergraduate students who completed the Experiences in Close Relationships-Relationship Structures Questionnaire, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. The results indicated that the correlation between attachment avoidance and depressive symptoms was mediated by empathic concern, while the correlation between attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms was mediated by personal distress. These results implied that attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety work on depressive symptoms through different pathways.",

Although depression in youth (Thapar et al., 2012) and older adults (Fiske et al., 2009) has received much attention, depression in emerging adults has not. Their mental health deserves more attention (Ferro et al., 2015) . Aged between 18 and 25 years and being in a transitional period of life (Arnett, 2000) , emerging adults face substantial interpersonal pressure and chronic interpersonal stress, which are two unique predictors of risks for depressive symptoms (Vrshek-Schallhorn et al., 2015) . Even if they are not diagnosed with depression, they might also be disturbed by depressive symptoms. According to ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006) , the family, as an essential microenvironment system, plays a role in individual growth. Family also provides room for the formation of attachment during the early interactions between children and parents, which may be an essential factor explaining the subsequent formation and development of depressive symptoms.",

Attachment is a unique emotional connection between an individual and an important person, and it also represents an individual's natural tendency to seek closeness and emotional connection with a vital individual (Bowlby, 1977a) . In accordance with attachment theory, people develop internal working models of attachment figures by interacting with others, which influences the cognitive and affective process of how we handle social information and shape mental representations of social relationships (Bowlby, 1982) . Individuals with insecure attachment were more likely to have a higher risk of suffering from depressive symptoms than those with secure attachment (Galynker et al., 2012) . A recent meta-analysis showed that insecure attachment was positively related to depressive symptoms, whether measured by questionnaire or using representational methods (Madigan et al., 2016) .",

Attachment avoidance refers to the degree to which an individual does not trust others and keeps a distance from others, while attachment anxiety addresses the degree of an individual's fear of being rejected or abandoned by others (Brennan et al., 1998; Fraley et al., 2011) . Although attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety are positively related to depressive symptoms, they might function differently. Attachment avoidance may deactivate the attachment behavior system. Suslow et al. (2010) found that attachment avoidance correlated negatively with the automatic emotional response to sad faces, and the correlation remained the same when the attachment type was changed to attachment anxiety. An identical result was also found in Huang et al. (2019) , and they found that attachment avoidance was negatively correlated with fearful prosodic emotion recognition. This might explain why depressive symptoms persisted in individuals with attachment avoidance.",

Collins (1996) found that although both participants with attachment anxiety and those with attachment avoidance might explain events in negative ways, the former is prone to report more emotional distress. These results implied that attachment avoidance might weaken emotional responses. In contrast, attachment anxiety might strengthen the emotional response. Additionally, previous studies found a positive association between anxious attachment and depressive symptoms and no significant relationship between avoidant attachment and depressive symptoms (Bishop, Norona, Roberson, Welsh, & Mccurry, 2019) . Therefore, the relationship between attachment and depressive symptoms is not simply direct, but different attachment dimensions contribute to depressive symptoms through different mediating variables.",

            "text": "One potential mechanism of particular interest in understanding the links between attachment and depressive symptoms is affective empathy. Affective empathy is the capacity to match with or feel others' emotions (de Waal, 2017) . According to the theoretical and empirical literature, attachment formation, especially with one's mother, is based on early parent-child interactions (Noriuchi et al., 2008) . We develop our empathy during early parent-child interactions (Decety & Svetlova, 2012; P\u00e9rez-Manrique & Gomila, 2018) . Stern and Cassidy (2017) even suggested that attachment might be the root of empathy, meaning that attachment influences an individual's social functioning through empathy, especially affective empathy. Affective empathy is measured mainly by the subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI, Davis, 1983) , such as empathic concern and personal distress. Secure attachment means that an individual's emotional needs have been met and that one has received empathic caregiving. Furthermore, individuals with secure attachment can develop this ability to respond empathically to others (Kestenbaum et al., 1989) . However, empathy is also a risky strength that might lead to depressive symptoms (Tone & Tully, 2014) . Some research evidence has shown that affective empathy is significantly and positively related to depressive symptoms (Calandri et al., 2019; Gambin & Sharp, 2018) . Affective empathy might bring emotional contagion and emotional understanding of others' distress, inducing personal distress and increasing the risk of depressive symptoms (Russell & Brickell, 2015) . It is worth noting that affective empathy can be divided into empathic concern and personal distress, and the two have different functions: according to the empathy-altruism hypothesis, the former leads to approach behavior, while the latter gives rise to avoidance behavior (Batson et al., 2015) . Above all, the relationship between insecure attachment and depressive symptoms might be mediated by different facets of affective empathy.",

            "text": "Different facets of affective empathy play different roles. First, the correlation between insecure attachment and affective empathy is distinct. Attachment avoidance might relate to empathic concern, and attachment anxiety might relate to empathic concern and personal distress (Britton & Fuendeling, 2005; Laible et al., 2004) . Second, differences exist in the relationship between affective empathy and depressive symptoms. Although both personal distress and empathic concern are regarded as emotional components, they are considered to have opposite functions, with personal distress-making individuals focus on themselves and empathic concern enabling individuals to attend to others (Davis, 1983) . Previous research found that empathic concern was negatively related to depressive symptoms, while personal distress was linked with the negative emotionality aspects of empathy (O'Connor et al., 2002) , which were positively related to depressive symptoms (Burnette et al., 2009; Neumann et al., 2016) . According to classic theoretical models (Decety & Lamm, 2006; Preston & de Waal, 2002) , individuals with deep empathic concern are more likely to take others' perspectives into account, are less likely to be overwhelmed by others' distress, and consequently, are more resistant to mental health problems (Huang et al., 2020; Thirioux et al., 2016) . Conversely, individuals with high personal distress are more likely to look at things from their own perspectives, resulting in stronger feelings of personal distress when observing others in pain (Decety & Lamm, 2006) . Thus, a multipath model was considered to investigate the relationship between maternal attachment and depressive symptoms and the mediating effect of different facets of affective empathy.",

Model 2 fits well, with x 2 (82) = 283.03, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.935; TLI = 0.917; RMSEA = 0.073; SRMR = 0.066 (see Fig. 1 ). In the partial mediation model, nonsignificant indirect paths were eliminated to generate a more parsimonious model. Thus, Model 2 should be retained. Model 2 revealed different patterns of predictive relationships for each of the two insecure attachments. We found that the indirect effect of empathic concern on the relationship between attachment avoidance and depressive symptoms was significant (\u03b2 = 0.18, 95% CI 0.096, 0.394, Z = 3.22, p < 0.01), while the direct effect of attachment Empathic concern fully mediated the relationship between attachment avoidance and depressive symptoms. The indirect effect of personal distress on the relationship between attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms was also significant (\u03b2 = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.093, 0.302, Z = 3.70, p < 0.001), and the direct effect of attachment anxiety on depressive symptoms was significant (\u03b2 = 0.18, 95% CI 0.071, 0.361, Z = 2.91, p < 0.01). Personal distress partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms. The total effect of attachment on depressive symptoms was significant (\u03b2 = 0.50, 95% CI 0.444, 0.788, Z = 7.02, p < 0.001). Attachment could explain 41.60% of the variance in depressive symptoms, 9.5% of the variance in empathic concern, and 8.6% of the variance in personal distress. Furthermore, we also tested a full mediation model (Model 3) in which the direct paths from attachment to depressive symptoms were deleted to provide additional evidence for full mediation. The results of this full mediation model showed that Model 3 (x 2 (84) = 290.75, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.933; TLI = 0.917; RMSEA = 0.073; SRMR = 0.070) was still a good approximation of fit, but the index reported was worse than that of Model 2. At the same time, direct paths from attachment to depressive symptoms do exist, so Model 3 is also less applicable than Model 2. The chi-square difference test showed that Model 2 was better than Model 3 (\u25b3x 2 = 7.72, df = 2, p < 0.05), and Model 1 was better than Model 3 (\u25b3x 2 = 11.82, df = 4, p < 0.05); there was no significant difference between Model 1 and Model 2 (\u25b3x 2 = 4.10, df = 2, p = 0.13). Therefore, Model 2 was the most suitable model in our current study.",

Attachment could influence an individual's representation of self and others. Secure attachment develops a valuable, lovable, and worthy self, while insecure attachment does not (Morley & Moran, 2011) . The latter point is supported by the fact that the negative correlation between attachment avoidance and empathic concern emerged in the early stage of development (\u015etefan & Avram, 2019) . Attachment avoidance refers to the degree to which an individual Fig. 1 Mediation model of attachment, affective empathy, and depressive symptoms (standardized estimates). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.01 does not trust others and keeps a distance from others, which leads to avoidance behavior rather than empathic concern. For example, attachment avoidance is negatively correlated with individual emotion recognition, especially fearful prosodic emotion recognition (Huang et al., 2019) , which means that individuals are self-oriented and do not feel sympathy and concern for others' misfortunes. However, empathic concern is essential to social interactions (Davis, 1983) . Higher empathic concern always brings greater friendship quality to individuals (Bianchi et al., 2020) , while lower empathic concern does the opposite. In other words, individuals with lower empathic concern are more prone to depressive symptoms due to decreased interpersonal relationship quality and low interpersonal communication efficiency. Hence, attachment avoidance may increase the risk of depressive symptoms by reducing empathic concern.",

Attachment theory reveals that secure attachment constructed in the early stage of life will enable individuals to form positive cognitions and emotions about themselves (Bowlby, 1977a (Bowlby, , 1977b . In contrast, insecure attachment may develop negative cognitions, feelings, and interpersonal expectations about the self, eventually leading to depressive symptoms. Significantly and positively related to depression (Tone & Tully, 2014) , personal distress reflects the participant's feelings of personal unease and discomfort regarding others' emotions (Davis, 1983) . Individuals with high attachment anxiety always have emotional problems, and they are prone to report more emotional distress when they confront negative events (Collins, 1996) . The root of the problem may be their excessive acceptance of others' emotional information, especially negative emotions, resulting in personal distress; these individuals are unable to extricate themselves from negative emotions, which ultimately lead to depressive symptoms. Furthermore, as a negative emotion, anxiety occupies many psychological resources, leaving no room for individuals to take into account the feelings of others and making them unable to accept and adopt others' views. Anxiety will also affect their interpersonal communication and be a chief factor affecting depressive symptoms. Applying skin conductance responses to investigate the relationship between attachment and empathy, Henschel et al., (2020a Henschel et al., ( , 2020b found that individuals with attachment anxiety displayed higher skin conductance responses than those with secure attachment when viewing distressing pictures. Henschel et al. (2020a) also found that anxious individuals reported higher personal distress than secure and avoidant individuals. Undoubtedly, higher personal distress induces depressive symptoms. Thus, attachment anxiety may increase the risk of depressive symptoms by increasing personal distress.",

            "text": "The current study still has some limitations and further research is needed. First, it is difficult to make a causal inference from self-reports. Our results only support the proposed models because the data are cross sectional. However, we do not rule out alternative models (Cole & Maxwell, 2003) . In addition, some other experimental methods could also help further this research. For example, the influence of attachment might be examined by using an affective priming procedure (Mikulincer et al., 2001) . Empathy could also be manipulated by perspective instruction (Batson et al., 1997) . Second, maternal attachment undoubtedly plays an essential role in our development, but the influence of attachment to fathers on individual development may differ from that to mothers and has unique effects (Papini et al., 1991) . Therefore, further research could investigate whether this model is suitable for examining the attachment to fathers. Third, further research should consider the role of affective empathy in social relationships and relationship quality, as well as generalized anxiety and communication skills. It seems that these factors can also act as mediators of the relationship between affective empathy and depression, suggesting an even more complex model is needed. Therefore, a mechanism by which affective empathy affects depression levels should also be considered in the future. Fourth, the measurement of empathy is still facing considerable debate. As Chrysikou and Thompson (2015) suggested, IRI is unsuitable for a two-factor structure. Thus, the current study investigates how empathy concern and personal distress influence the relationship between insecure attachment and depressive symptoms instead of affective empathy. Whether the mediating effect will vary with different empathy measurements is still unclear and deserves further verification. Finally, recent investigations suggest that the CES-D might not be a single-factor scale (Carleton et al., 2013) . Although the reliability of indicators and the power of the tests of model fit could be increased with the item-parceling method, we might miss the results of different dimensions.",
