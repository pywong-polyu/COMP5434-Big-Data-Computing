These tumors more commonly affect premenopausal women, and have been noted to be associated with high-risk HPV infections (Castle et al., 2018) . Patients most often present with vaginal bleeding or with an abnormal pap smear. The World Health Organization recommends classifying neuroendocrine neoplasms as either low grade, including carcinoid or atypical carcinoid, or high-grade, including small cell and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. The majority of NECC are high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas that are aggressive tumors with a higher incidence of lymphovascular space invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and extra-pelvic recurrence when compared to squamous and adenocarcinoma of the cervix (Zhu et al., 2019; Kurman, 2014; Abdallah et al., 2016; Gadducci et al., 2017) . Due to their predilection for advanced disease, the five-year survival of all comers with NECCs is significantly lower than the overall five-year survival of squamous and adenocarcinoma of the cervix at 30% and >65%, respectively (Tempfer et al., 2018) .",

Unfortunately, no single mutation has been identified as the catalyst for neuroendocrine malignant transformation. The most common mutation is tp53 which may be present in around 62% of neuroendocrine tumors (Xing et al., 2018) . PIK2CA, a common mutation observed in other HPV related cancers, was also commonly identified. Interestingly, RB1 was not found to be very frequent in these small studies, yet it is almost ubiquitously present in small cell carcinoma of the lung. It is notable that RB1 mutation was also present in the present case being discussed and may have played a role in its unusual course. As new developments in targeted therapy progress, the need for additional studies regarding the genetic make-up of these tumors continues to increase.",

High grade neuroendocrine carcinomas are typically characterized by rapid recurrence and dissemination with short overall survivals after recurrence. This patient with large cell NECC is without evidence of disease 15 years after initial diagnosis, even in lieu of multiple recurrences that have been managed mostly with surgical resection alone. There continues to be a need for additional study regarding treatment of recurrent NECC, particularly regarding isolated recurrence remote from initial diagnosis. This case may provide reason to consider surgical treatment alone in appropriate candidates. ",
