While lower than observed against Delta, protection against severe outcomes appears to be maintained over time. The declining VE against infection is similar to results from England, where VE against Omicron and Delta in adolescents aged 16-17 years decreased from 76% and 93% after 7-13 days to 23% and 84% \u2265 70 days post second dose, respectively. 3 In the US, 2-dose VE against Omicron hospitalization for those aged 12-15 and 16-17 years was 92% and 94% after 14-149 days compared to 73% and 88% after \u2265 150 days, respectively. 4 This difference in VE over time since second dose was not statistically significant, whereas declines in VE against emergency department (ED) visits were. VE against ED visits increased following a third dose in those aged 16-17 years. 4 Limitations of this study included an inability to classify some specimens using SGTF or sequencing, changes to test eligibility over the study period, and potential unmeasured confounding between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. These results can inform third dose recommendations in adolescents, as 2-dose protection against symptomatic Omicron infection is relatively low and wanes over time, whereas protection of a second dose against severe outcomes is higher. A third dose substantially improves protection against Omicron infection in adolescents, but 3-dose VE is only moderate at approximately 60% in the early period following vaccination and the duration of this protection is unknown. Understanding the impact of a third dose on improved protection against severe outcomes will be important.",
