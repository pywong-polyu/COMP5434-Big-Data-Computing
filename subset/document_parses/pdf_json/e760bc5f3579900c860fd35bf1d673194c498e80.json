Although research indicates important determinants of HIV acquisition at the individual and interpersonal levels, structural-level stigma and discrimination continue to be critical barriers to reaching and retaining this key population for HIV prevention and sexual and reproductive health services. Innovative and multilevel interventions are needed that can address the intersectional structural and gender issues that young women face, including stigma, alcohol and drug use, gender-based violence, and other risk factors when seeking health services. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken daily has been found to be an effective biomedical HIV prevention tool. Testing a comprehensive gender-focused biobehavioral HIV prevention intervention that is inclusive of social ecological determinants, such as stigma and discrimination reduction in clinics, is critical for reducing HIV among adolescent girls and young women.",

In South Africa, new HIV infections are concentrated among AGYW between 15 to 24-this group accounts for over 25% of new in-country infections, three times the rate of young men in this age group [2] . Additionally, estimates suggest that in some areas of South Africa, AGYW have an HIV prevalence of 4%, which increases to 24% for young women aged 20 to 24 [2] . This highlights the high incidence of HIV in late adolescence and early adulthood and the critical need for prevention in this age group.",

However, structural-level stigma and discrimination (S&D) continues to be a critical barrier to reaching and retaining this key population for HIV prevention and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services [3] [4] [5] [6] . AGYW who engage in high-risk sex are aware of their risk and desire healthcare services, but service access is often impeded by poor treatment by clinic staff [6, 7] . In formative focus group discussions conducted in Tshwane for this study, AGYW expressed concerns about treatment by nurses when seeking SRH services and about confidentiality in clinics [6, 7] . S&D also prevents engagement and retention in HIV prevention services [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Anticipated and experienced HIV stigma extends to biomedical HIV prevention strategies, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and is also a barrier to HIV prevention efforts [13] [14] [15] [16] . Providing PrEP in clinics may not be effective if vulnerable AGYW are disinclined to visit clinics because of fear of S&D or patronizing treatment by clinic staff based on assumptions about their age and sexual activity. Consequently, S&D training for clinic staff is essential to reduce barriers for AGYW to access services.",

These AGYW may benefit from PrEP because it does not require partner involvement. Recent open-label demonstration projects that offered oral PrEP to young women [28] , including some in South Africa, have demonstrated that PrEP is feasible among this age group [29] . However, placebo-controlled efficacy trials, such as the Fem-PrEP and VOICE trials found low PrEP adherence rates [30] [31] [32] . Although oral PrEP offers a promising HIV prevention strategy for AGYW, its effectiveness depends on high adherence [33] . To support PrEP uptake and adherence, an integrated HIV prevention program is needed that addresses multiple barriers and risk behaviors, with a focus on the individual, interpersonal, and structural levels, that may impede PrEP readiness, uptake, adherence, and engagement in safer sexual behaviors among AGYW who are HIV-negative [34] .",

Aim 3 is to test the efficacy of a multilevel HIV prevention strategy that addresses structural (S&D reduction), interpersonal (peer social support), and individual (personal agency, substance use, and GBV) factors on PrEP readiness, uptake, and adherence; HIV status; and other risk-taking behaviors at 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up among vulnerable AGYW.

Given the staff turnover and availability and to ensure to anonymity, staff surveys are not linked across time points; consequently, changes at the clinic level are assessed. Clinic support staff surveys have been translated into a local language, Setswana, for easier comprehension. A clinical audit is also being conducted at baseline and 4month and 8-month follow-up by research study staff to collect information on service utilization, including the number of AGYW receiving health services (including HIV, birth control, and antenatal care) from clinical records; PrEP prescriptions from pharmacy and study nurse records; availability of birth control methods; presence of clinic guidelines and standards of practice for serving sexually active AGYW; working hours that are convenient for AGYW, as well as adequate staff to provide youth friendly services. This audit is conducted across all study clinics.",

The HPP S&D reduction curriculum encourages all staff at all levels to be involved in the training workshops [41] because they are likely to interact with AGYW.

Both workshops end with participants developing an individualized and personalized risk-reduction action plan with assistance from staff. Also, any relevant referrals are offered. Participants also receive toiletry kits and pill boxes with a colorful bag to discreetly store their PrEP.

Initial analyses will be descriptive and evaluate group differences comparing intervention and control clinics using unpaired t-tests with unequal variance or nonparametric tests, as appropriate. Using multilevel modeling approach, we will investigate and account for clustering at the clinic level. We will use difference-indifferences (DD) methods as done in another South African study to examine utilization of services by AGYW and staff attitudes and behaviors in the 8 months between intervention and control clinics [60] . The DD estimator reflects the average change in clinics that received S&D reduction training, after the average change in utilization in control clinics is subtracted, assuming parallel trends in clinics over time had the S&D reduction training not been implemented. DD estimates will be calculated for each outcome separately; models will include covariates for time (pre-vs. post-intervention), treatment (training vs. no training) and an interaction between the two. The clinics identified are similar in size, services, and populations served. Any clinic features for which we cannot achieve balance through the design will be included as covariates in the multivariable DD analyses. A stigma score will constitute one primary outcome for these analyses. To examine short-term changes between pre-intervention and 4-month follow-up, DD methods can be used to compare the average change in stigma scores in clinics that received S&D reduction training, removing any changes observed in control clinics. We will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) [61] to examine provider-level stigma scores measured at 4-and 8-month follow-up comparing trained and untrained clinics, accounting for clustering at the clinic-level.",

Models will include both intervention groups (i.e., S&D reduction training and YWHC) as covariates.

This is the first study of its kind in South Africa to attempt to address structural S&D in public health clinics as a way to improve PrEP readiness, uptake, and adherence among this population and in turn reduce HIV burden. The study comprises some notable innovations: (1) developing a partnership with the South African Department of Health to reduce S&D by clinic staff; (2) engaging the study's YAB and the CCB in the adaptation of the YWHC (YAB) and the S&D (CCB) interventions, study marketing materials (YAB), S&D reduction training (YAB) as stakeholders to share their voices, and the regular meetings. This is an important step towards involving community members in the dissemination and implementation of HIV-prevention structural interventions. Support for structural changes may increase when the people whom the intervention is likely to affect participate in the process [63] ; and (3) other contextual factors, such as GBV and substance use, and using an evidence-based, gender-focused approach are addressed. Additionally, partnering with the NDoH and the public health clinics is facilitating capacity building through the standardized PrEP provider training that will be required when PrEP provision is scaled up to a population level. Because this study is being conducted in collaboration with public health clinics, it may bring to light challenges that need to be addressed prior to integrating PrEP delivery into public health facilities, such as workload, the need for task shifting or sharing, and the need to enhance PrEP's general acceptance in usual care settings.",
