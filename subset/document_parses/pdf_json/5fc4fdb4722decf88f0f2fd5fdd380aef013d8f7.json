Coping with such an unprecedented situation may have stimulated creativity. However, the situation also restricted our liberties and triggered health or psychological difficulties. We carried out an online survey (n = 380) to examine whether and how the COVID-19 related first lockdown period was associated with creativity changes in French speaking population. Despite a global negative subjective experience of the situation, participants reported that they were more creative during the lockdown than before. Positive changes were linked with more time availability, more motivation, or the need to solve a problem while negative changes were related to negative affective feelings or a lack of resources or opportunities. This study documents the effects of the first lockdown period on creativity and the factors that influenced it.",

During spring 2020, 67 million French people entered the first strict lockdown, which dramatically changed our daily lives and wellbeing. These constraints implied a restriction of movement, the need to adapt working methods, a modification of daily life within households, and a decreased wellbeing (linked to health issues, restrictions of activities and social interactions, or economic consequences). Paradoxically, during this period, general and social media have reported that individuals and businesses seemed to show great adaptability to face the situation by finding innovative solutions and creative behaviors.",

Creative abilities are involved in many human activities, from solving everyday problems to the great discoveries of our civilization. Creativity is a key mental capacity to cope with change, invent and innovate, and face the challenges of our society. The situation related to the COVID-19 and its consequences on our daily life are at the forefront of the current challenges we had and still have to cope with. Understanding the conditions that foster (or hinder) our creativity is essential, and the COVID-19 situation provides a unique opportunity to study some of these factors.",

It is influenced by internal and external factors (Lubart et al., 2013) including our emotions, motivation, and environment. Intrinsic motivation is an essential component of creative behavior (Amabile, 1983 (Amabile, , 2018 Amabile and Pillemer, 2012; Mastria et al., 2018; Benedek et al., 2019; Fischer et al., 2019) and drives involvement, intensity, and perseverance in activities. Affective states influence creativity, as it has been demonstrated by several studies which have shown that creative thinking tasks are mood-sensitive (Davis, 2009) . Positive mood (such as joy) is often reported as facilitating creativity, and negative mood (such as stress, anxiety) as hindering creativity. However, whether positive or negative moods facilitate or inhibit creativity is still debated and may depend on contextual factors De Dreu et al., 2008; Davis, 2009 ). Finally, creative activities and achievements are influenced by our environment, at home or in the workspace (living conditions, cultural, and professional contexts), our social context (Amabile and Pillemer, 2012; Benedek et al., 2019) , and by the standards, needs, and values of the society (Lubart et al., 2015) .",

We assumed that the lockdown could have stimulated creativity for at least two reasons. First, the lockdown increased the availability of free time by reducing our usual daily outdoor activities and, in some cases, workload. Second, the new situation created a need or drive, pushing the individuals to adapt and invent new solutions to pursue their usual activities. However, the situation may have caused negative subjective experience and distress, with stress and anxiety, a feeling of pressure, a lower mood, which can alter creativity. Last, because the restrictive measures targeted social interactions, we hypothesized that social distancing could also have harmed creativity. We carried out an online survey to estimate the impact of these potential factors on self-perceived creativity changes and changes in concrete creative activities and achievements.",

We asked participants how much they think their creativity changed positively or negatively during the lockdown as compared to before. The participants responded using a continuous visual scale ranging from \u221250 (less creative during the lockdown) to 50 (more creative during the lockdown). Hence, SCC relies on a self-rating of one's own creativity. Similar self-report scales or ratings measuring creativity belief, selfconcept, and self-efficacy have been developed (Beghetto, 2006; Ng and Feldman, 2012; Karwowski and Barbot, 2016; Lebuda, 2016, 2017; Karwowski et al., 2019) and used in COVID-19-related studies (Hofreiter et al., 2021; Mercier et al., 2021; Patston et al., 2021) . In contrast to these previous measures, we asked participants to rate a change in their creativity related to a key event (i.e., the beginning of the lockdown). This allowed us to minimize recall bias and avoid the need of baseline measure that was difficult to obtain. To check our approach's validity, we compared this new creativity measure to more standard ones, including openness personality traits and several activity-based measures described below.",

They entered their responses directly in a text box without any time or word limit and with the possibility to leave empty boxes. An external panel of four experts independently rated the creativity of each of the top-productions using a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (\"not creative\") to 5 (\"highly creative\"). The number of four raters have been previously suggested as sufficient to reach high inter-rater reliability when raters are experts (interrater reliability higher than 0.6) (Ceh et al., 2021) . We estimated the interrater reliability by computing two-way random intra class correlations (ICC). A satisfying reliability was observed between judges. The average measure ICC was 0.95 [F(286, 858) = 19.84, p < 0.001, 95% CI (0.94.A200.96)]. Then, the ratings were averaged across judges for each top-production, and we computed for each participant a creativity rating score as the sum of averaged ratings of his/her productions. The creativity rating score aims to reflect the creativity of the activities achieved during the lockdown. Hence, it may both depend on the pre-existing creativity of the participants and on the effect of the lockdown situation on their creative thinking and behavior.",

The BFI-O scores, creativity rating score and SCC were all significantly pairwise correlated [r BFI \u2212O\u2212creativity rating score (378) = 0.46, p < 0.001, r BFI \u2212O\u2212SCC (378) = 0.21, p = 0.03, r SCC\u2212creativity rating score (378) = 0.15, p = 0.009]. Hence, as the creativity rating score might reflect both the creative personality traits and creativity changes during the lockdown, we tested whether BFI-O scores could be a hypothetical mediator of the correlation between SCC and creativity rating score.

Since our main aim was to assess the creativity change related to the lockdown, we decided to use the SCC score as our main variable of interest, as creativity rating score seems to reflect more the creative personality traits than the change in creativity during the lockdown period, and because baseline measurement of creativity rating score was not available.",

Lockdownrelated creativity changes using the activity-based questionnaire approach were also consistent with the SCC report. Notably, both the activity frequency score and the creative achievement score, correlated with SCC, indicating that SCC related to changes in creative activities and achievements. We also found a quadratic relationship between the amount of obstacles to overcome to achieve an activity assessed by activity-based questionnaire (obstacle score) and SCC: individuals who declared having a decrease in their creativity had to face too many obstacles while individuals experiencing an increase in their creativity might have been stimulated by the amount of obstacles. This result may suggest that creative behaviors differed according to the perception or the nature of an obstacle. Individual factors that influence our creative behavior in facing obstacles remain to be explored. As the SCC came early in the survey, before asking participants about the activities they engaged in during the lockdown, it is unlikely that activity-based questions influenced our SCC measure (Karwowski et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "We explored how several factors could be related to creativity changes. No demographic factors correlated with the SCC. However, using PCA, we found that the two first principal components of the lockdown conditions and subjective experience significantly correlated with SCC. The first component that we labeled \"affective change\" included anxiety and stress, motivation, psychological pressure, mood, and to a lower extent, loneliness and physical constraints. The relationship between this first component and SCC is consistent with a series of studies showing that affective states such as positive mood and motivation are associated with higher creativity (Collins and Amabile, 1999; Baas et al., 2008) and that intrinsic motives drive everyday creative activities (Benedek et al., 2019) . Conversely, negative affective states hindered creativity in some individuals. This result is also consistent with a recent studies showing a relationship between positive affective states during the lockdown and creativity (Elisondo, 2021; Hofreiter et al., 2021) . Our survey shows that overall, our participants reported more negative subjective and affective experiences during this period than before. This finding converges with other studies conducted worldwide during the lockdown of Spring 2020 that showed that people experienced an increase in stress and depression symptoms in Italy (Roma et al., 2020) , Spain (Ozamiz-Etxebarria et al., 2020) , New Zealand (Every-Palmer et al., 2020), Kuwait (Burhamah et al., 2020) , and Croatia (\u00d0oga\u0161 et al., 2020) . Interestingly, we found a significant mediation effect of SCC on the relationships between BFI-O and the first principal component (reflecting affective changes). This result suggests that higher openness may have facilitated creativity expression in during the lockdown, which in turn may have help to cope with difficult psychological situations (Wu et al., 2019) . Hence, creative traits and abilities may be essential to resilience. Note that significant mediation effects does not mean that we identified a true causal effect, instead, it places some variables as candidates for causal mediators, that should be experimentally addressed (Fiedler et al., 2011 (Fiedler et al., , 2018 .",

However, the coherence of our findings based on two different sets of measures is to be highlighted. In addition to a global subjective report of their self-perceived emotions, free time, and creativity, the participants indicated the reasons why they achieved or gave up specific creative activities during the lockdown. The reasons for carrying out an activity more frequently were dominated by more free time, while the reasons for carrying out an activity less frequently were mainly related to concerns and worries. The individual proportion of these reasons correlated with the individual component loadings of the two first principal components (reflecting affective state and free time) identified among the subjective experience factors that we collected.

Thus, the increase of creativity observed in this sample might not be replicable in other populations, such as individuals who could not work remotely or had no time to answer online surveys. In addition, the participants responded just after the end of the lockdown, their reports are thus retrospective and may lack accuracy or objectivity.

Our subjective report of self-rated creativity and activity-based questionnaire provide converging results supporting an overall positive change in creativity during the lockdown period, which was mainly related to having more free time or opportunities. However, the changes were heterogeneous across participants, and when negative changes in self-rated creativity or creative activities were reported, they were mainly related to negative affective factors. A creative personality may have partially helped to better express one's creativity, and to cope with the negative emotions induced by the crisis. Those factors have thus to be considered when trying to enhance creativity or well-being in individuals and society. Our observations may provide interesting hypothesis to explore in future studies for a better understanding of the affective, emotional, and wellbeing dimensions that modulate our creativity, which could inspire political, societal or management decisions.",
