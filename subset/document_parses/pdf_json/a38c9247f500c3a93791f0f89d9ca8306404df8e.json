Their anti-inflammatory and immune-potentiating effects result from the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3. Aims: To obtain pre-clinical evidence on the safety and therapeutic effects of lithium salts in the treatment of COVID-19. Results: Six different concentrations of lithium, ranging 2-12 mmol/L, were evaluated. Lithium inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a dose-dependent manner with an IC 50 value of 4 mmol/L. Lithium-treated wells showed a significantly higher percentage of monolayer conservation than viral control, particularly at concentrations higher than 6 mmol/L, verified through microscopic observation, the neutral red assay, and the determination of N protein in the supernatants of treated wells. Hamsters treated with lithium showed less intense disease with fewer signs. No lithium-related mortality or overt signs of toxicity were observed during the experiment. A trend of decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs and lungs was observed in treated hamsters compared to controls. Conclusions: These results provide pre-clinical evidence of the antiviral and immunotherapeutic effects of lithium against SARS-CoV-2, which supports an advance to clinical trials on COVID-19 \u2032 s patients.",

It shares about 80% genetic homology with SARS-CoV causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 [2] that began in the Chinese province of Guangdong [3] . Like other coronaviruses, its viral particles include genetic material of a single chain of positive sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) and structural proteins necessary for the invasion of host cells, which include the surface or spike glycoprotein (S), the membrane glycoprotein (M), the envelope glycoprotein (E), the nucleocapsid glycoprotein (N) and the dimeric glycohemagglutinin-esterase [4] . Once inside the cells, the infective RNA encodes structural and non-structural proteins that control assembly, transcription and viral replication [5] . The N protein supports the viral RNA and is involved in its packaging [6, 7] . The native hypo-phosphorylated form of this protein favors its binding to genetic material [8] , forming RNA-protein condensates.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses require a host's kinase termed glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity for its replication. This enzyme phosphorylates the N glycoprotein [9, 10] reducing RNA-protein interactions, forming a looser conglomerate [6] , which favors the genome transcription, an essential step in the generation of long sub-genomic and genomic mRNAs that code for structural proteins in the cell cytosol during viral replication [9] . GSK-3 is constitutively expressed in all mammalian cells [11] and is important in several biological processes [12] . At the immune level, inhibition of cytosolic and nuclear GSK-3 increases the transcription of TBX21 (also called T-box expressed in T cells, Tbet), which in turn suppresses the transcription and expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) in activated lymphocytes, in particular, TCD8 + lymphocytes [13] . PD-1 is a cell surface receptor expressed transiently in multiple cells of the immune system, including T and B lymphocytes [14] , macrophages [15] , natural killer (NK) cells [16] , and dendritic cells [17] . It functions as an immune checkpoint and plays an important role in the negative regulation of the immune system [18] . Blockade of PD-1 is known to increase self-renewal and proliferation of stem-like TCD8 in lymph nodes, increasing effector functions of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) against infections and cancer [19, 20] . The same inhibitory effect on the expression of another inhibitory receptor LAG3 has been seen [21] . GSK-3 inhibition down-regulates the inhibitory co-receptor LAG-3 on CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells to enhance anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity [21, 22] .",

A RT-PCR was also performed to compare the viral load in each animal. Between days 2 and 4 post-infection, there was a trend towards a lower viral load (higher Ct value including three with a value higher than 35, considering negative at day 4) in hamsters treated with lithium over viral controls. This was also observed in the analysis of the lungs of euthanized hamsters on the fifth day post-infection. However, an inconclusive dispersion was observed in terms of viral load of swabbing and nasopharyngeal lavages on the fifth day post-infection (Fig. 7) . In our study, the intensity of clinical signs of COVID-19 in Syrian hamsters did not directly correlate with the viral load detected in each animal. At 11 days, all animals became negative by RT-PCR (data not shown). Overall, the effects of lithium on SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters, particularly at signs and lungs histology levels (regarding signs and lung injure), were demonstrated. [1] . Any new therapeutic approaches will be of importance and potentially could save lives. In this paper, we provide evidence that lithium salts have ablative effects in vitro on the infection of cells and in a Syrian hamster model of infection. We found that lithium inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The Vero E6 monolayer was conserved as verified by microscopic observation and a NR uptake assay. Cell viability is directly proportional to NR absorption. Fig. 2 clearly shows a superior uptake of NR (expressed as OD) of lithium-treated wells compared to the viral control (infected-untreated). This is consistent with an important antiviral effect of lithium, as show in Fig. 3 . Further, using an ELISA we showed that lithium effectively reduced viral titers when comparing the OD of the supernatants of treated wells with the OD of the supernatants of viral control cells (p < 0.001).",

It was determined to use 100 TCID 50 as infective dose that is 20 times higher than the average infective dose of SARS-CoV-2 for this animal model [47] . This allowed us to observe the appearance of a moderate/severe disease in these animals. As the most frequent signs of COVID-19 described in Syrian hamsters are loss of weight, stooping, lethargy and polypnea [47, [49] [50] [51] , it was decided to evaluate them on a daily basis. Surprisingly, no significant loss of weight was observed in infected animals. This may be due to the low infective dose used compared to other studies [47, [49] [50] [51] . We hypothesized that the higher the infective dose, the greater the weight loss. We found that hamsters treated with lithium showed a less intense disease with fewer signs. Some animals treated with lithium did not show any signs of the disease. The presence of signs in the viral control group (infected untreated) was significantly higher than those treated with lithium. This is more evident in Fig. 5 , since although the n in the groups treated with lithium was significantly higher (n = 9) than in the untreated group (n = 4), the average number of signs of hamsters per day, was higher in the group of the infected-untreated animals. Even two animals of the viral control group showed polypnea, a sign that reflects the greater severity of the disease.",

This dosing regime is equivalent to the usual daily dose in humans, about 1000 mg/day [34] and it yielded a serum lithium level of 0.91 \u00b1 0.27 mmol/L, within the human therapeutic range. Hence, the data obtained from the current study could be extrapolated to clinical scenarios. For estimation of the toxicity of a drug, the mean lethal dose (LD50) is a commonly used pharmacological parameter and is determined in laboratory animals, preferably in mice and rats. For lithium carbonate the LD50 in rats is ~700 mg/kg after oral administration [67] . In our search we did not find the LD50 for Syrian hamsters and its determination is beyond the scope of this work. The lithium regimen used is markedly below the LD50 for lithium application in rats, and also below the usual doses in pre-clinical toxicology studies [68, 69] .",

This gains relevance as the inflammatory host response drives much of the pathology of the SARS CoV-2 infection. A reduced incidence of COVID-19 in patients taking lithium compared to the general population was demonstrated after the analysis of clinical data from four major health systems [10, 40] . Unfortunately, severity and mortality data were not obtained and compared between the two groups of infected patients, since modulation of the inflammatory response by lithium may also contribute to reduce the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality [70] .

The authors found that lithium carbonate reduced plasma C-reactive protein levels and increased lymphocyte numbers, reducing the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. All patients treated with lithium carbonate improved their clinical status and no side effects related to lithium carbonate treatment were reported. These preliminary data suggest that lithium treatment reduces the inflammatory state of patients with COVID-19, improving both inflammatory activity and the immune response. Because of the limitations of this study such as the small number of cases and the lack of randomization, these findings should be interpreted carefully and deeper investigation is required in a cohort with larger sample size.",
