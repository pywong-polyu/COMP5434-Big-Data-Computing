            "text": "Better adjuvants are needed for vaccines against seasonal influenza. TLR7 agonists are potent activators of innate immune responses and thereby may be promising adjuvants. Among the imidazoquinoline compounds, 1-benzyl-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine (BBIQ) was reported to be a highly active TLR7 agonist but has remained relatively unexplored because of its commercial unavailability. Indeed, in silico molecular modeling studies predicted that BBIQ had a higher TLR7 docking score and binding free energy than imiquimod, the gold standard TLR7 agonist. To circumvent the availability issue, we developed an improved and higher yield method to synthesize BBIQ. Testing BBIQ on human and mouse TLR7 reporter cell lines confirmed it to be TLR7 specific with significantly higher potency than imiquimod. To test its adjuvant potential, BBIQ or imiquimod were admixed with recombinant influenza hemagglutinin protein and administered to mice as two intramuscular immunizations 2 weeks apart. Serum anti-influenza IgG responses assessed by ELISA 2 weeks after the second immunization confirmed that the mice that received vaccine admixed with BBIQ had significantly higher anti-influenza IgG1 and IgG2c responses than mice immunized with antigen alone or admixed with imiquimod. This confirmed BBIQ to be a TLR7-specific adjuvant able to enhance humoral immune responses.",

            "text": "There is an ongoing need for new adjuvants to improve influenza vaccine efficacy in the young and elderly. 1 A promising class of adjuvants is the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) agonists. 2 These include a broad spectrum of pathogenderived compounds including nucleic acids, proteins, lipopeptides and glycolipids. 3 A variety of synthetic compounds that activate TLR7 and/or TLR8 have been shown to function as vaccine adjuvants. [4] [5] [6] Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed various chemotypes (1-14, Figure 1 ) with unique structural features able to activate TLR7 or TLR8. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Small structural modifications in these chemotypes result in varying levels of TLR7 or TLR8 activation and cytokine/ chemokine profiles. 3 Loxoribine, a pure TLR7 agonist, was shown to enhance anti-tetanus-specific IgG antibody secretion in a dosedependent manner in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells 12 and strongly activated NK cells in an IL-12-dependent manner. 13, 14 Similarly, 3M-052, a dual TLR7/8 agonist, was shown to enhance immunogenicity of influenza vaccine. 15 TLR7 agonists are known to be more potent than TLR8 agonists at inducing IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-regulated chemokines such as IFN-inducible protein and IFN-inducible T cell \u03b1 chemoattractant. 16 Given these differences between the effects of TLR7 and TLR8 agonists, 2,17,18 we wished to evaluate the adjuvant activity of a pure TLR7 agonist, 1-benzyl-2-butyl-1H-imidazo [4,5-c] quinolin-4-amine (BBIQ). As depicted in Figure 2 , BBIQ 15 was reported to be the most active TLR7 agonist, 7, [19] [20] [21] whereas the related derivative 17 was confirmed to be a dual TLR7/8 agonist. 22, 23 The other closely related imidazoquinoline 16 22 with additional aminomethyl functionality as well as the tricyclic oxazoloquinoline 18, 24 pyrazoquinoline 19 24 was dual TLR7/8 agonists. Conversely, the tricyclic furoquinoline 20 25 is a pure TLR8 agonist.",

            "text": "The low yielding synthetic methods for the preparation of appropriately substituted imidazoquinolines prompted us to improve its synthetic process. The poor cyclization of intermediate to substituted imidazole using valeroyl chloride and incomplete displacement of chloro functionality to yield 1-benzyl-2-butyl-1H-imidazo [4,5-c] quinolin-4-amine (BBIQ, compound 15) were the limiting factors of the existing described synthetic approach. 7, 26 In another approach, 27 the synthesis of imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline scaffold was achieved from anthranilic acid, Anthranilic acid is a drug precursor used to make the illicit drug methaqualone, 28 is listed in United State Drug Enforcement Administration list and is not commercially available for large-scale production. Lastly, benzoyl isocyanate, which is relatively expensive, was needed in the last described step to install C4 amino functionality requiring four steps and reducing the overall yield. Another synthetic route for the preparation of imidazo [4,5-c] quinoline was reported by Fergusson and coworkers 29 which involved the synthesis of appropriately functionalized tetra substituted imidazole through a multicomponent condensation of aminomalononitrile, various orthoesters, and a set of amines. However, the amino malonitrite p-toluene sulfonate, palladium acetate and 2-aminophenylboronic acid and its substituted analogs are relatively expensive. We, therefore, modified the second synthetic route as described by David and coworkers wherein synthesis of BBIQ 15 was achieved from commercially available phthalimide 21 with the complete process being optimized to improve the overall yield. Synthesis of BBIQ 15 began with the conversion of phthalimide to anthranilic acid (Scheme 1). Good yield in this reaction was obtained by maintaining a lower temperature (\u22125\u00b0C) and complete dissolution of compound throughout the reaction with dark brown precipitate and low yields being observed at higher temperatures. Reactions were carried out at up to 100 g scale and no column chromatographic purification or crystallization was required to purify the products. The cyclization of the intermediate was carried out in the presence of acetic anhydride. Maximum yield was obtained only when the reaction mixture was heated after the addition of potassium acetate for about 3-4 h at 55\u00b0C until the solid started appearing which was then kept at room temperature overnight to ensure complete solidification. A thorough washing with acetic acid as well as water was done to obtain compound as off-white solid. Treatment with POCl 3 resulted in the formation of the chloro derivative. A careful quenching of excess POCl 3 was the key to improve the yield in this reaction. The ipso-displacement of chloro functionality with benzylamine was carried out as reported earlier. 7 The nitro reduction in intermediate 26 was achieved using 1% palladium on activated charcoal (10% Pd basis) using rubber bladder filled with hydrogen gas. The crucial cyclization step was carried out using trimethyl orthovalerate to furnish the 1-benzyl-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline 28 in good yield. Further N-oxidation of quinoline nitrogen was carried out using 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in a solvent mixture of MeOH:dichloromethane for an hour. To improve costeffectiveness the benzoyl isocyanate was synthesized using benzamide and oxalyl chloride in situ and was treated with the intermediate N-oxide 29 for the C4-acetamido installation which on treatment with sodium methoxide resulted in the formation of desired BBIQ (1-benzyl-2-butyl-1H-imidazo [4,5-c] quinolin-4-amine). Additional information on the synthetic method and chemical characterization of the produced BBIQ is provided in the Online Supporting Information.",

            "text": "To predict BBIQ's specificity for human and mouse TLR7 we first used an in-silico structural modeling approach, as currently, no crystal structure is available of BBIQ bound to either human or mouse TLR7. We, therefore, used the known human (h)TLR7 crystal structure to construct structural model of mTLR7 and then performed docking studies using these structural models to characterize how BBIQ might bind hTLR7 and mTLR7, comparing this to the two well know TLR7 ligands, imiquimod and resiquimod. First, the structures of BBIQ, resiquimod and imiquimod were sketched in MarvinSketch and minimized using the MMFF94 force field. The crystal structure of human TLR7 (PDB ID-5GMG) was retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB). A crystal structure of mTLR7 was modeled using Modeler 9.21, using the crystal structure of hTLR7 as a template. Prior to performing the docking study, the missing Z-loop residues in the hTLR7 structure were constructed in UCSF Chimera 30 and then the Z-loop was cleaved off, followed by energy minimization by steepest descent, for 50,000 steps using OPLS-AA force field, in Gromacs-5.0.7. 31 The docking of ligands with hTLR7 and mTLR7 was then performed using PLANTS docking software with chemplp scoring function. 32 The binding site center was defined at 71.59, 9.92 and 42.56 with a radius of 15.23. The docking simulation was repeated twice for consistency and the docked structures were saved for binding free energy calculation. Molecular dynamics simulation of the complex of BBIQ with hTLR7 or mTLR7 was performed at 300 K using Langevin thermostat. Long-range Coulombic interactions were handled using particle mesh Edwald algorithm and the SHAKE algorithm was used on all atoms that were covalently bonded to hydrogen atoms. Further, g_mmpbsa scripts were used to calculate free binding energy. 33 The docked conformations of imiquimod and resiquimod on hTLR7 suggested that they form hydrogen bonds with both Asp555 and Thr586, while BBIQ was predicted to form a hydrogen bond with only Thr586 (Figure 3 ). The predicted docked conformations of both resiquimod and BBIQ on mTLR7 showed both forming hydrogen bonds with the same residues, namely Ile564 and Thr565 (Figure 4 ). The binding free energy for resiquimod for hTLR7 and mTLR7 was calculated as \u221219.28 kcal/mol and \u221213.24kcal/mol, respectively with the binding free energy for BBIQ with hTLR7 and mTLR7 being slightly lower at \u221216.67 kcal/mol and \u221211.25kcal/mol, respectively. This suggests that resiquimod has higher binding than BBIQ for both human and mouse TLR7. By contrast, the binding free energy for imiquimod was just \u221211.64 kcal/mol and \u22126.64kcal/mol, for hTLR7 and mTLR7, respectively. These modeling data suggested that BBIQ has a much higher affinity for both hTLR7 and mTLR7 than imiquimod. Overall, BBIQ was predicted to have ",

Assays using TLR7 or 8 expressing reporter cell line results confirmed that BBIQ was a specific TLR7 agonist with a higher potency than imiquimod but lower potency than resiquimod. The intermediate potency of BBIQ for both human and mouse TLR7 was confirmed using human Ramos and mouse Raw reporter cell lines that express both TLR7 and 8.

In addition to imiquimod's relatively low TLR7 potency, it is a small molecule drug and hence likely to diffuse rapidly away from the injection site, reducing its ability to provide local immune enhancement. The same might be expected for BBIQ that is a similar sized molecule. More recently, alternative TLR7/8 formulations have been developed to promote the transport of the TLR-agonist to the draining lymph node through conjugation to alum, 39 hyaluronic acid 40 or other polymers 41 . BBIQ's adjuvant activity might similarly be increased in this way. Notably, increased adjuvant activity of both BBIQ and imiquimod were seen when they were mixed with Advax adjuvant, reminiscent of the synergistic effects seen for Advax mixed with TLR9 agonists. The current data thereby extend the benefit of Advax combinations to TLR7 agonists.",

The full adjuvant activity of BBIQ will need to be confirmed in dose-response studies against established adjuvant comparators, such as squalene emulsion adjuvants. BBIQ 10 \u03bcg was not as potent in mice as Advax adjuvant, a known adjuvant that has advanced to human influenza vaccine trials. Future studies are also needed to determine BBIQ's effects on long-term immune memory responses and its ability to improve vaccine immunity in very young or old animals. It will be interesting to directly compare BBIQ's adjuvant activity as a pure TLR7 agonist with the activity of a pure TLR8 agonist or a dual TLR7/8 agonist. Pure TLR7 agonists might be relatively weak adjuvants, reflecting their bias to induction of IFN-regulated chemokines whereas TLR8 agonists induce more inflammatory cytokines that may be better at enhancing adaptive immune responses. 16 Given its apparent Th2 bias, future studies could be undertaken in Th2-biased BALB/c mice to assess the potential of BBIQ to induce an IgE response to exclude any allergy-driving potential. The improved synthetic method as described here should facilitate conduct of future studies to more fully characterize the adjuvant activity of BBIQ as a specific TLR7 agonist.",
