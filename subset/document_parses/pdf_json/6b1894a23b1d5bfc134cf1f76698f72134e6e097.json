Moreover, early evidence in the US identified unequal patterns in hospitalization and mortality from COVID-19 in dense urban environments with respect to race and ethnicity [6, 7] . Existing studies, however, are limited with respect to scope, data, and temporality. Early evidence largely comes from single, urban center studies or regional data during the first wave [8, 9] of the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequent waves, or surges, have not been examined. For example, it is unclear whether the same populations were impacted in fall versus the spring 2020. Furthermore, most studies examine patients after inpatient admission. There are limited studies on individuals with COVID-19 in community settings. For example, early data suggested that testing rates per capita were unequal in the US with respect to race and ethnicity [10] , yet it is unclear how these rates have changed over time. Early studies from April 2020 also identified unequal infections among racial groups [11, 12] . However, these studies used pre-pandemic, area-level indicators to associate the proportion of Black residents with overall cases reported for the same area. These studies did not use data at the individual level to examine infections, hospitalizations, or deaths.",

Nearly 1-in-5 Americans live in a rural county [13] , which are often labeled as medically underserved areas. Using data from CDC gathered two years before the pandemic, Kaufman et al. [14] estimate rural residents to be at increased risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. A similar analysis using data from 2018 by Peters [15] concluded many rural areas are vulnerable to COVID-19 given populations with advanced age and high rates of death due to conditions such as cardiovascular disease. In a single site study in rural Georgia, individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 from March to May 2020 found that, despite a higher burden of comorbid conditions, both critical care and in-hospital mortality was lower than in New York City, as well as China and Italy [16] . A national, population-based study similarly found lower rates of COVID-19 mortality in rural areas compared to urban areas using county-level data through June 12, 2020 [17] . Given limited data from rural communities through Spring 2020, additional analyses are warranted.",

The study examines a large, statewide cohort, including individuals tested by local and state health departments. It further examines care delivered at a wide array of settings, including critical access hospitals and rural county hospitals. Per capita rates, when stratified by age, race, sex, and geography, can shed light on changes in morbidity and mortality over time, as well as within and among sub-populations. Understanding patterns of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality beyond individual health systems and major metropolitan areas can inform national strategies to mitigate the ongoing spread of COVID-19, including vaccination strategies that seek to immunize based primarily on age.",

Hospitalizations before positive diagnosis were included due to delays in testing, especially at the start of the epidemic. During March and April 2020, most patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus were admitted with COVIDlike symptoms before testing positive. All positive cases were identified using RT-PCR tests recorded in medical records or reported to the public health department, including community-based testing efforts statewide by public health authorities. Individuals testing positive were only counted once, during the period of their first positive result. All patient addresses were geocoded using an established method [22] with rurality determined by a classification system developed by Purdue University for Indiana's geography based on ZIP Code [23] .",

Following the initial lockdown in the spring, the gap between White and African American morbidity and mortality narrowed, although burden remained significantly higher among African American populations. As summer turned into fall, burden among rural communities increased and surpassed urban communities through the end of the year. These trends reveal a synchronicity of disparities, or simultaneous set of inequities in outcomes among distinct populations impacted by COVID-19. In other words, Black and Brown populations as well as Rural populations experienced unequal burden and hospitalization due to COVID-19 at the same time.

Furthermore, our data source contains statewide hospitalization and death data from 38 distinct health systems. Second, the study measures burden of disease and outcomes during the fall surge, something few studies to date have reported. Stratification by phase is also unique, allowing comparison of burden and outcomes over time. These methods would not be possible without a robust electronic data infrastructure in Indiana aided by a 16+ year health information exchange [29] that partnered with the state health department, county health departments, and health care systems in response to the COVID-19 pandemic [20] .

Rates, adjusted for population size, clearly show significant burden on African American populations during each phase of the pandemic. Although deaths per capita were lower than other racial groups in the fall surge, the cumulative mortality is 50% higher than mortality among White populations. Moreover, burden among Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander populations, despite accounting for a small percentage of the population, is nearly 10 times that of Whites. Among those who did not disclose or reported their race as 'Other,' hospitalization and death rates are 2-4 times higher than Whites. It is not unreasonable to assume that many Hispanics may be in that group as they may not wish to disclose demographic details and this minority group has been shown to have higher rates of hospitalizations and mortality in national studies [32] . Therefore, we conclude that while racial disparities narrowed later in the pandemic, especially as burden shifted from urban to rural communities, cumulative burden on racial minorities from COVID-19 are severe. This burden exacerbates existing health disparities, necessitating action as the nation attempts to both mitigate further disease spread and protect vulnerable populations through vaccination.",

During the fall surge, several rural hospitals in Indiana reached capacity, necessitating transfers to urban centers, which can be more than 2 hours away from the resident's home. This placed additional burden on urban hospitals already managing increased workload and burden from local residents infected with COVID-19. The situation further caused a response from public health in which elective procedures were reduced by order of the Governor, placing financial strain on both rural and urban facilities. More attention is needed on the impact of COVID-19 in rural areas, combined with reasonable policies to support rural mitigation strategies and equitable distribution of vaccines to rural populations.

First, a significant number of race classifications were reported as Other or Unknown. Similarly, the dataset could not identify ethnicity, as these data are also missing for many patients. Medical records as well as other health information systems, must improve the capture rates for race and ethnicity to enable large scale measurement of health disparities so public health can work with health systems to ensure health for all persons [36, 37] . Second, these data represent hospitalization and mortality among individuals from one state.

First, trends demonstrate a flattening of the curve following the initial stay-at-home order from public health authorities.

This suggests aggressive mitigation for a longer period of time may be necessary for stronger disease control and prevention. Moreover, sub-population differences highlight the need for more nuanced mitigation policies, such as data-driven approaches that target high-risk groups, that can evolve over time.",

Testing increased per capita among racial minority groups in Indiana, enabling better detection of morbidity. Equitable testing was not sufficient for stemming hospitalization due to COVID-19. Mortality decreased among minority groups in the latter phases, yet this might be attributable to improved clinical management rather than contact tracing and isolation which our data did not measure. With respect to rural populations, morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality steadily increased over time, suggesting perhaps rural health departments struggled with mitigation strategies or rural populations ignored mask ordinances, restrictions on social gatherings, and/or other public health interventions. Anecdotally, we observed complaints from several rural county health officers that local authorities would not enforce ordinances and that residents overtly refused to comply with many policies. More research is necessary to confirm these observations and support the development of more robust mitigation policies.",

In a majority White state, we achieved equity in testing. This means we can achieve equity in vaccination. However, current policies focus on age and comorbid conditions to drive decisions about which populations should receive vaccines first. While age places individuals at higher risk of hospitalization and death, this study demonstrates that racial minorities and rural populations also should be prioritized given their higher morbidity and mortality. If health departments are serious about addressing social determinants and racial disparities, they must factor these phenomena into vaccination plans.",
