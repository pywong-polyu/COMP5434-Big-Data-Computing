First, based on the indicator system of overseas investment risks, five major types of investment risks are identified. Second, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) is introduced; a risk evaluation model is constructed for enterprise overseas investment. Finally, the investment attractiveness index in the Fraser risk assessment learning label is adopted as the evaluation results of the model. According to the classification of risks, the model is trained and its performance is tested. The results show that the major source of overseas investment risks includes basic resources, political systems, economic and financial development, and environmental protection. The corresponding risk score is high. North American country clusters and Oceanian country clusters have lower investment risks, while the investment risks in Africa, Latin America, and Asia are affected by multiple factors of the specific cities. This is closely related to the resources and legal systems possessed by the country clusters. This is of great significance for enterprises to conduct risk assessment in overseas investment.",

Especially, for mining enterprises, their overseas investment projects are affected by multiple factors such as long periods and various uncertainties. The impact on the ecological environment is large. Under the action of multiple factors, there is a greater degree of uncertainty between the investment expenditure of mining enterprises and the expected benefits. Therefore, the application of scientific and effective solutions to assess the investment risks has great significance in reducing losses of enterprises and ensuring the utilization of overseas resources and energy. The assessment of investment risks has been extensively discussed by researchers. researched the risk management strategy of chemical industry clusters and found that when unexpected losses increased, enterprises were more inclined to adopt high-level investment strategies [3] . For the difficulty in calculating the a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 weight of risk assessment indicators in traditional investment risk assessment models, Ren and Du (2018) constructed an industrial investment risk assessment indicator system from the levels of systemic risks and non-systematic risks; on this basis, they proposed a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based industrial investment risk assessment model for the marine foreign trade and economic zone; the results suggested that the model could assess risks through empirical analysis [4] . Liu and Zeng (2017) adopted the system dynamics method to analyze and discuss the investment risks of renewable energy projects,' the results revealed that policy risks, technical risks, and market risks had greater impacts [5] . Yao et al. (2017) proposed a tactical exploration framework that applied grammar-based genetic planning to the generation and evolution of tactics in combat-level simulations, which could effectively reduce investment risks [6] . Due to its unique advantages, deep learning has been widely used in many fields [7] . The applications of deep learning methods in the field of risk or investment have been researched extensively. Xie et al. (2020) analyzed and discussed the application of deep learning in financial data processing, investment model, and investment strategy establishment, which had reference value for improving investors' investment strategy and rate of return [8] . Sohangir et al. (2018) explored the application of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in stock market investment forecasting; they found that deep learning models could be effectively applied to financial analysis, and CNN had the best effect [9] . Liu (2019) believed that the prediction accuracy and portfolio optimization of financial risks were very important and compared the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNNs) in classification; the results suggested that the latter had better performance, which was of great significance for maximizing investment profits [10] . Kim and Won (2018) proposed a new hybrid LSTM model and found that the model could be applied to the prediction of stock market volatility [11] .",

On this basis, the review of literature, on-site inspections, and expert consultation are the means of model construction; in the meantime, the construction principles of scientificity, reliability, and comparability are persisted. The assessment system is divided into risk categories, project components, and risk factors. For the evaluation of venture capital, common methods include variance method [12] , coefficient and capital asset pricing model [13] , \"A\" scoring method [14] , value-at-risk evaluation model [15] , and comprehensive risk index model [16] .

The investment goal of this category is to promote the optimization of enterprise profits. The risk can be evaluated by the inflation rate and GDP. Here, this risk category is refined into economic growth, financing, changes in interest rates and exchange rates, inflation, credit systems, and total tax rates [18] . The risk category of political systems mainly characterizes the degree of political influences, as well as the stability of a particular country. This is a key factor in assessing the diplomatic situation, which also includes the level of rule of law and policy support. In particular, the major risk factors of the political system include regime alternation, contradictions and conflicts among surrounding powers, law system, social credit, foreign shareholding, and partners [19] .
