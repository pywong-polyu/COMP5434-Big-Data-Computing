Aims This study explored patients' experiences of autoimmune hepatitis and its treatments; key aspects for developing safe and effective new approaches to therapy. Methods An anonymised, internet-based survey collected data including patient demographics, treatments, side-effects, impact on day-to-day life, sources of support and attitudes towards autoimmune hepatitis between December 2019-January 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 patients to further explore their support networks, treatment experiences and health priorities. Descriptive and quantitative analyses were undertaken using R and free text responses were subject to thematic analysis. Results In total, 270 survey responses were received (median age 55 years and 94% female). Perceived medication sideeffects were reported by 66% (169/257) and 73% responded negatively about their experience of corticosteroids. The majority (62\u00b73% [(109/175]) would 'definitely' or 'probably' consider clinical trial participation to improve their care. Only 18\u00b77% (31/166) reported access to a specialist liver nurse and nearly half were involved in support groups. Interview and survey data suggested that major issues were stigma, loss of control and fatigue. Conclusions This study provides insights into the realities of living with autoimmune hepatitis with clear issues around lack of support networks, need for patient empowerment and stigma surrounding liver disease. Patient priorities are better therapies to slow disease progression, avoiding corticosteroids and minimising side-effects. Patient willingness to participate in trials suggests that they are achievable provided they have the right design and clinical endpoints.",

Both prednisolone and azathioprine are associated with significant side effects with studies reporting 20-30% of patients have corticosteroid-related side effects with approximately 25% developing side effects related to azathioprine, with 10% necessitating drug withdrawal [13, 14, 15, 16] . Budesonide, an alternative corticosteroid that undergoes first pass metabolism (precluding its use in cirrhotic patients), may cause fewer systemic side effects than prednisolone but it remains unclear as to where this agent should sit in the treatment algorithm [17] . Alternative agents (mycophenolate mofetil, mercaptopurine, calcineurin inhibitors) are used in patients who are intolerant of or non-responsive to azathioprine. However, efficacy data is restricted to smaller, noncontrolled trials with little evidence regarding the symptom burden associated with these agents [18, 19, 20] .",

The weblink was disseminated by patient support groups: AIH Support (2203 members in January 2020), LiverNorth (approximately 3000 members-not specific to autoimmune hepatitis) and the British Liver Trust. The survey was available in English only, but accessible by autoimmune hepatitis patients in any country. It consisted of 29 questions relating to demographics, co-morbidities, treatments (both current and previous), side effects, reasons for omitting medications, attitudes to research and routes of drug administration, sources of support and attitudes to autoimmune hepatitis (see Supplementary Data for full survey). Respondents were asked about perceived drug side effects, how they felt about their current autoimmune hepatitis treatment as a whole and specifically in relation to corticosteroids on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being 'very unhappy' and 10 being 'very happy' and how helpful they found support groups on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 representing the most helpful. There were three free text questions about the most difficult and frustrating aspects of having autoimmune hepatitis and how care could be improved. Participants were asked to rank 5 statements regarding the importance of features in potential future treatments with 1 being the 'most important' to 5 being the 'least important'. The survey was conducted as a service evaluation project with approvals from Newcastle University and Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. All participation was voluntary and no patient identifiable information was collected. As such, Caldicott Approval was obtained but no formal consent or ethical approval were required.",

The median time since diagnosis was 2 (0-67) years and median age of respondents was 54 years (compared to 7 [1-57] and 59 years, respectively, in UK-AIH) [23] . There was no significant difference between the number who did or did not report side effects according to time since diagnosis (p = 0.728). The majority of respondents (76\u00b74%, 120/157) lived in the UK (Supplementary Table 1 provides full breakdown) and 96\u00b72% (152/159) described their ethnicity as 'white'. Patient-reported co-existent autoimmune conditions (summarised in Supplementary Table 2 ) were similar to those reported in previous autoimmune hepatitis studies [6] . Table 1 summarises current treatment regimens at the time of survey completion, with 91% (235/257) receiving immune suppression. The use of immune suppressants was very similar in this study as compared to data published by UK-AIH: azathioprine/mercaptopurine (62% vs 59%), mycophenolate mofetil (14% in both) and corticosteroids (54.5 vs 55%) [23] . When asked about side effects, 66% (169/257) reported perceived problems with their medications but only 64% (107/167) reported their clinician discussing potential side effects with them before commencing therapies (full responses in Supplementary Table 3 ). The most commonly described side effects (grouped into overarching categories, Supplementary Table 4 ) are summarised in Table 2 . For prednisolone, 110 respondents reported a total of 222 side effects from current or previous treatment, of which 34\u00b77% were cosmetic and 21\u00b76% were cognitive symptoms. Cosmetic and gastrointestinal side effects and cognitive symptoms were a significant burden across multiple drugs. Table 3 summarises previous medications alongside the 2 most cited reasons for stopping therapy. The commonest reason for stopping prednisolone was normalisation of liver blood tests but perceived side effects led to cessation of prednisolone in 29% and were the commonest reason for cessation of azathioprine, budesonide, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus.",

Current guidelines [6, 7] advocate aiming for azathioprine monotherapy and avoiding long-term corticosteroids but only 58% of respondents were receiving azathioprine with 39% still receiving prednisolone (as compared to 58% on azathioprine and 55% on prednisolone in UK-AIH) [23] . Corticosteroids are a major concern to patients and a key priority when thinking about future care and the need for better treatment options to reduce our overreliance on corticosteroids. Despite the majority of patients feeling their disease was under control, most were still keen to participate in research to find better treatments with fewer side effects. In keeping with data from the UK-AIH national cohort study, [24] many patients experienced marked side effects from the treatments they receive and these impact on life quality. Nearly a third of patients recalled stopping prednisolone due to its perceived side effects rather than achieving disease control. Although the most notable side effect profile was with prednisolone, problems were also reported with other drug therapies, leading to cessation of treatment in some patients. Clinicians need to improve the pre-treatment counselling provided to ensure that patients receive appropriate information regarding the benefits, risks and potential side effects of treatments, enabling them to actively engage with the decision-making processes guiding their management and retain control.",

This issue has also been explored in primary biliary cholangitis with poorer health-related quality of life being associated with stigma [25] and patient-reported stigma was a key driver in the name change from primary biliary cirrhosis to primary biliary cholangitis in 2017.

These factors may have led to reporting bias. Most patients were on prednisolone and/or azathioprine so the results mainly concern these two agents but this reflects the commonest treatments used in clinical practice. It seems surprising that less than half of participants considered themselves 'involved' with patient support groups given how the survey was distributed. The majority described their interaction with these groups as a positive experience but those that find such groups unhelpful are likely to withdraw from participation. The survey responses were predominantly female (more than the preponderance seen in the demographic distribution of autoimmune hepatitis). This raises the possibility that females find support groups more helpful or more accessible than males. Due to the method of data collection, this study used entirely patient-reported data pertaining to treatments received, reasons for stopping therapy and treatment adherence. It is not clear how accurate patients are when ascribing perceived side effects to a specific drug. It is, however, key to understand patients' experiences of treatment so that we can improve pre-treatment counselling, learn from them about the impact of medications and minimise poor adherence if this is driven by side effects. For the interview section of the study, all participants received their care in one NHS hospital trust. Participants may not be representative of the autoimmune hepatitis community as a whole although the clinician identifying patients tried to include patients with a range of treatment experiences, ages and stage of disease. Despite this, given that the interviews were intended to explore patients' experiences in more depth than can be achieved by a wider survey, we believe that the data provide important learning for clinicians and future research.",

This emphasises that clinical trials in autoimmune hepatitis should be deliverable and the challenges are trial design with identification of appropriate endpoints rather than patients' willingness to participate.
