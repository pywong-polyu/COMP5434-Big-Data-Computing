Patients critically ill at screening were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to dapagliflozin (10 mg daily orally) or matched placebo for 30 days. Dual primary outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat population: the outcome of prevention (time to new or worsened organ dysfunction or death), and the hierarchial composite outcome of recovery (change in clinical status by day 30). Safety outcomes, in patients who received at least one study medication dose, included serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, and adverse events of interest.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Given the dearth of efficacious therapies that reduce the risk of disease progression and major clinical events (currently limited only to dexamethasone in critically ill patients), 8 there is a large unmet need for additional treatment options. 9, 10 SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiovascular and kidney events in large trials of predominantly ambulatory patients with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or kidney disease. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Although the mechanisms underlying these benefits remain a subject of investigation, previous studies (including those of ambulatory patients with diabetes) have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors favourably affect various pathways that are dysregulated in the setting of acute illness (including COVID-19) such as inhibition of glycolysis (a pathway that can be used by respiratory pathogens) and stimulation of lipolysis, reduction in oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as improved endothelial function and oxygen carrying capacity. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] These effects might help to prevent multiorgan damage and improve recovery in patients with COVID- 19. In the dapagliflozin in respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 (DARE-19) trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients who had cardiometabolic risk factors and who were hospitalised with COVID-19.",

Previous trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease showed substantial protective effects on the cardiovascular system and the kidneys, and these agents might provide organ protection in the setting of acute illness, such as COVID-19, by affecting processes that are dysregulated during acute illness. However, the paucity of reliable data has also led to concerns that SGLT2 inhibitors could increase the risk of acute kidney injury and ketoacidosis in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. We searched PubMed between Jan 1, 2010, and March 1, 2020 for clinical trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with acute illness (including COVID-19) using the search terms: \"SGLT2 inhibitor\", \"dapagliflozin\", \"canagliflozin\", \"empagliflozin\", \"sotagliflozin\", and \"hospitalised\". Except for trials in patients with heart failure, we were unable to identify any trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in an acute setting.",

Dapagliflozin did not significantly reduce the proportion of patients with organ dysfunction or death or who experienced improved recovery. Although we observed numerically fewer events of organ dysfunction or death in patients who received dapagliflozin as compared with placebo, this difference was not statistically significant, and might not be generalisable to other populations. Importantly, dapagliflozin was well tolerated in one of the highest risk (with respect to organ failure and death) patient populations ever to be treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.",

After the original protocol was designed, changes in the standard of care for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 resulted in substantially lower event rates than originally projected. 27, 28 Consequently, faster and more complete recovery became an important treatment goal in addition to the prevention of complications and death, prompting the addition of recovery to the primary objectives on Nov 20, 2020. The primary outcome of prevention was a composite of time to new or worsened respiratory, cardiovascular, or kidney organ dysfunction during the index hospitalisation, or death from any cause at any time during the 30 day treatment period (appendix 1, pp 7-8). Respiratory decompen sation is defined as requiring initiation of mechanical ventilation (includes invasive or non-invasive ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, or bilevel positive airway pressure), or initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or both. Cardiovascular dysfunction is defined as new or worsening congestive heart failure during hospitalisation, with heart failure defined as at least one of the following: (1) initiation of new intravenous therapy for heart failure, (2) reinstitution of previous intravenous therapy for heart failure, (3) increase in current intravenous therapy for heart failure. This definition is based on modification of previous definition of in-hospital worsening of heart failure; 29 requirement for vasopressor therapy; or inotropic or mechanical circulatory support, sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. 30 Kidney organ dysfunction is defined as doubling of serum creatinine or initiation of renal-replacement therapy. The primary outcome of recovery was as a hierarchical composite that ranked patients into categories using the severity and timing of events experienced during the 30 day treatment period: death, organ dysfunction during the index hospitalisation, supplemental oxygen requirement for patients hospitalised at day 30 without organ dysfunction, and hospital discharge before day 30 (appendix 1, pp 7-8; appendix 2).",

The p value for this analysis was calculated using a country stratified log-rank test. Time-to-event secondary outcomes were analysed similar to the primary outcome of prevention (except for the composite kidney outcome, which was adjusted for baseline eGFR, while the Cox regression analysis for the hospital discharge resulted in a RR). Outcomes based on the total number of days were compared using a WR, similar to the primary outcome of recovery. Prespecified subgroups were assessed with the use of the same stratified Cox regression models without adjustment for multiple comparisons. We did several prespecified sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint of prevention: these involved excluding patients that tested negative at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 and evaluating the results within subgroups of patients who did and did not receive remdesivir at baseline. In addition, we did a post-hoc sensitivity analysis evaluating the results for the primary endpoint of prevention within subgroups of patients who did and did not receive systemic corticosteroids at baseline. Safety analyses were done in the safety population (randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study medication). All analyses used SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

Although numerically fewer patients treated with dapagliflozin had organ failure or died, these differences were not statistically significant. The results were similar for the key secondary endpoints of worsening kidney function or death from any cause. Dapagliflozin was well tolerated and no new safety signals were identified. Previous trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease showed substantial and consistent protective effects of these treatments for the heart and kidney. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Further more, mechanistic studies indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors have favourable effects on pathways that are dysregulated in a setting of acute illness (such as COVID-19) including inflammation, oxidative stress, glycolysis, lipogenesis, endothelial function, and oxygen carrying capacity. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Accordingly, the hypothesis tested in our trial was that dapagliflozin might reduce the risk of major clinical events in a population with acute illness that was superimposed on top of pre-existing cardiovascular, metabolic disease, or kidney disease.",

These observations might be of interest for patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and are in line with what was observed in previous trials of dapagliflozin in ambulatory patients with type 2 diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, which showed lower risks of cardiovascular and kidney events with dapagliflozin versus placebo. 12, 14, 17 Furthermore, although statistically non-significant, the numerically lower rates of death with dapagliflozin in our trial (with most deaths being non-cardiovascular) appear to be in line with findings from another trial of dapagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease, which also suggested a lower risk of non-cardiovascular deaths (including deaths from infections), 35 and with observational data published in 2021. 36 However, we acknowledge that because the differences were not statistically significant, the lower event rates observed in the dapagliflozin group compared with placebo might also represent a chance finding. The heterogeneity within the subgroup analysis for the primary outcome of prevention by sex should be interpreted with caution, given the small number of events within these subgroups and their exploratory nature. The lower risk of organ failure or death with dapagliflozin versus placebo in men, but not women, could be due to the higher absolute risk of these events in men, a finding that has been well documented during the COVID-19 pandemic, or could be a chance finding. Previous trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease have not shown significant heterogeneity of treatment effects based on sex. We did not observe a significant difference between groups in the number of patients that had an improvement in clinical status by day 30; a possible explanation for this (among others) might be the small and non-significant effect of dapagliflozin on time to hospital discharge, which was the main driver for this recovery outcome.",

            "text": "Our findings have implications for clinical practice. To the best of our knowledge, DARE-19 is the first trial that evaluated SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with acute infectious illness, one of the highest risk groups ever tested with this class of agents. Given the paucity of reliable data, there were concerns that SGLT2 inhibitors could increase the risk of volume depletion, acute kidney injury, and ketoacidosis in this patient group. These concerns fuelled recommendations from expert groups to discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors in patients hospitalised with COVID-19, even if they had conditions in which this class has been proven to produce substantial benefits. 29, 37 In our trial, dapagliflozin was well tolerated, with rates of serious adverse events (including acute kidney injury) being numerically lower in patients that received dapagliflozin versus placebo; and despite active protocolrequired surveillance, only two non-severe events of diabetic ketoacidosis were reported. Therefore, our results do not support routine discontinuation of dapagliflozin in a setting of COVID-19 as long as patients are monitored. Additionally, our results also have implications for future research. Because SGLT2 inhibitors do not have a direct antiviral effect on SARS-CoV2, our findings (although not conclusive) suggest a need for future trials to determine whether dapagliflozin might provide organ protection in hospitalised patients at high risk for progressing to critical illness (eg, sepsis). This might be especially relevant for prevention of major kidney outcomes in hospitalised patients, common and morbid complications for which few efficacious treatments currently exist. Considering our findings, any such future trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (or other types of acute illness) might need to focus on prevention of organ failure or death, and recruit patient populations that would allow accruing a sufficient number of these events to detect a similar HR to that suggested by DARE-19.",

The rates of organ dysfunction and death were lower than initially anticipated due to improvement in standard of care for treatment of COVID-19. 27, 28, 38 Consequently, the accrued number of events would not allow detection of statistically significant treatment effects with a HR exceeding 0\u00b772 (which is a possible explanation for the observed lack of statistical significance for the primary endpoint of prevention, given the observed HR of 0\u00b780). Accordingly, we amended the protocol to elevate recovery from a secondary endpoint to be included as a dual primary outcome, as faster and more complete recovery had become an important treatment goal and a frequently used trial endpoint in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Confirmation of COVID-19 positive test at baseline was not available in a small number (fewer than 8%) of patients due to the widespread unavailability of testing supplies at the start of the trial; however, this issue did not affect the overall findings. The proportion of patients receiving remdesivir and systemic corticosteroids was relatively modest; however, neither of these therapies were established as standard of care for COVID-19 at the time our trial was initiated, and patients that derive the greatest benefit from systemic corticosteroids (ie, patients who are critically ill and on mechanical ventilation at baseline) were not included. Furthermore, our results were consistent between patients who did and did not receive remdesivir or systemic corticosteroids at baseline. Finally, we used specific eligibility criteria that might limit generalisability.",
