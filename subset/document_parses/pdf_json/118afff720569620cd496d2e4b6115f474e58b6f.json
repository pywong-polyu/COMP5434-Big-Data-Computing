The purpose of this study is to evaluate differences in abdominal pelvic CT findings in the emergency department by COVID-19 test result. Methods This retrospective study identified patients tested by PCR for COVID-19 infection who underwent abdominal pelvic CT scan in the ED across an academic health system from March 15 to April 15, 2020. Radiology reports were reviewed for the presence of ground glass opacity in the lungs and acute abdominal pathology. A subset of patients with acute abdominal pathology were identified with inflammatory pathology in organs with high ACE2 receptor expression including bowel, pancreas, urinary bladder, and kidney. CT findings for COVID positive versus negative patients were compared with Chisquare test. Results 597 patients tested by PCR for COVID-19 infection underwent abdominal pelvic CT scan, 44% were COVID-19 positive. COVID-19 positive patients demonstrated significantly more ground glass opacity at the lung bases, 65.1%, (222/341) versus 12.4% (33/266), p < 0.001), and significantly less acute abdominal findings, 23.8% (81/341) versus 45.5% (121/266), p \u2264 0.001). When abdominal pathology was present, COVID-19 positive patients had higher rate of inflammatory pathology 58% (47/81) versus 29.8% (36/121). Conclusions In patients undergoing abdominopelvic CT from the ED, COVID-19 positive patients are more likely to have ground glass opacities at the lung bases and less likely to have acute abdominal pathology compared with COVID-19 negative patients. Further, COVID-19 positive patients are more likely to have inflammation of organs with high expression of ACE2 receptors than other types of acute abdominal pathology.",

Hossain et al. reported no acute abdominal findings in (68%) 69/101 patients of COVID-19 patients on abdominal pelvic CT scan. When abdominal pathology is present, the bowel is often affected. Goldberg-Stein et al. reported abdominal pelvic pathology in 57% of COVID-19 positive patients with 31% showing GI tract abnormalities [12] . Bhayana et al. found 31% of CT scans had bowel pathology in patients with COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 is known to enter the host cell via these receptors. While these were initially described in the lung, organs elsewhere in the body are now known to have high expression. In addition to bowel, organs in the abdomen described to have high expression of ACE2 receptors include the pancreas, kidneys, and bladder [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

In some cases, patients presenting with abdominal symptoms may not undergo PCR testing prior to imaging. Radiologists have been the first to suggest the diagnoses of COVID-19 infection based on the presence of ground glass opacities at the lung bases in patients presenting with abdominal symptoms [21] . In addition, we postulated that COVID-19 positive patients might demonstrate acute pathology in the abdomen that differs from COVID-19 negative patients, possibly due to the presence of high ACE2 receptor expression in certain organs. Therefore, patients presenting with significant abdominal symptoms warranting abdominal pelvic CT scan during the COVID-19 pandemic are an important cohort to evaluate. To our knowledge, no study has directly compared abdominal pelvic CT scan findings for COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Our goal was to determine if patients who ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 infection had different rates and types of abdominal pathology reported on abdominal pelvic CT scans.",

            "text": "Ground glass opacities are the most common lung finding in COVID-19 seen in 56.4% of chest CT scans [6] . In our study, we found 65.4% of COVID-19 positive patients had ground glass opacities at the lung bases on abdominal pelvic CT scan which was a significant difference from COVID-19 negative patients (12.7%). This prevalence of ground glass opacity in COVID-19 positive patients has been corroborated elsewhere. In a recent paper by Hossain et al., the authors found that 63.9% of patents presenting to the ED with neurologic or abdominal symptoms had GG opacities in the lungs [4] . In our experience, especially at the onset of the pandemic before gastrointestinal manifestations were widely recognized as a presenting symptom, the radiologist was often first to suggest the diagnosis of COVID-19 when ground glass opacities were visualized on abdominal pelvic CT. Another significant finding in this study is that COVID-19 negative patients had more acute pathologic findings on abdominopelvic CT scan than COVID-19 positive patients. We theorize that patients who were COVID positive who underwent CT were more likely to have milder disease due to generalized COVID infection. However, patients without COVID infection with milder symptoms did not seek medical care and were not included in this study. Thus, the positive rate in COVID-19 negative patients who did seek medical care increased. Another possible explanation for this finding is the welldocumented communication between the lung and the gut called the \"gut-lung\" axis [10, 22, 23] . In this bidirectional system, microbial metabolites and endotoxins released into the blood from lung inflammation can alter the microbiome of the gut leading to abdominal symptoms in the absence of intraabdominal pathology. In our study, we also found that patients without ground glass opacities at the lung bases had less acute intraabdominal pathology, if they were COVID-19 positive. This may be due to non-visualized infection in the mid and upper lungs also affecting the gut via the gut-lung axis producing secondary abdominal symptoms. Alternatively, this may be due to the limited ability of abdominal pelvic CT scan to detect mild inflammation or be compounded by the lack of IV contrast in 23.5% of studies. We Fig. 6 A 75-year-old female, COVID-19 PCR negative, presented with abdominal pain, with mesenteric edema (short arrows), dilated ileum (arrows), and decompressed terminal ileum (arrow heads) consistent with small bowel obstruction did not find a statistical difference between COVID-19 negative and positive patients' rate of abdominal pathology when ground glass opacities were present. This might be explained by possible lung inflammation in the COVID-19 negative group from causes other than COVID-19 also affecting the gut via the same axis.",

In the subset of patients that had acute pathology, COVID-19 positive patients had bowel inflammation, pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, or cystitis more often than COVID-19 negative patients. Of those with acute abdominal pathology, our most common diagnosis was bowel inflammation seen in (23/80) 28.8% of COVID-19 positive cases. This is similar to the 31% reported by Bhayana et al. This trend was not seen when we looked at COVID-19 negative patients. One possible explanation is that organs with high ACE 2 receptor expression may be at increased risk for tissue injury and inflammation by SARS-CoV-2. This virus is also known to cause liver injury [24] , although periportal edema or heterogeneously enhancing parenchyma was not documented in any report impressions in our study. There is also increased ACE 2 receptor expression in the biliary tree [25] , although we did not have any cases of cholangitis. This may be due to the poor sensitivity of CT for this diagnosis.",

Additionally, the radiology reports were analyzed by a single reader. In addition, we did not analyze our results with respect to IV or oral contrast. Nonetheless, we had the same limitations in both of our groups. Another limitation is the variability of the RT-PCR test results which includes the possibility of false-positive and false-negative results. An additional limitation was the inability to account for hepatic steatosis. This was because of the variability in reporting and variability in use of IV contrast. This is an important area for future research. Inclusion of only ED patients who underwent abdominal imaging excluded patients who underwent imaging in the outpatient setting. Further, the etiology of the underlying process of the inflammatory process was not determined in this study. As such, we did not attempt to differentiate between inflammation secondary to bacterial infection, viral infection, or other non-infectious etiology. Finally, this study determines correlation and not causality between COVID-19 and organ involvement of disease.",
