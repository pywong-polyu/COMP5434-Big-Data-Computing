            "text": "e liver, as an important organ of the body, is the key to regulating lipid metabolism in the body. When the body's lipid metabolism is abnormal, it will lead to lipid accumulation in the liver and liver steatosis. Severe liver steatosis is irreversible and threatens human life and health, while milder liver steatosis can be completely cured by treatment. erefore, early screening for hepatic steatosis is of clinical importance. At present, the degree of hepatic steatosis is mainly determined by manual grading, in which the imaging physician analyzes the patient's imaging data to score the grade of hepatic steatosis. is approach suffers from subjective grading bias and low efficiency. In recent years, with the widespread use of deep learning in medicine, new opportunities for intelligent grading of hepatic steatosis have been presented. For example, Qiblawey Yazan and Montalbo Francis Jesmar P. proposed a cascade system to detect, localize, and quantify COVID-19 infection from CT images using encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks (ED-CNNs), UNet, and feature pyramid network (FPN) [1, 2] . Ben Jabra Marwa used 16 deep learning classifiers to diagnose the validity of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images and found that the combination of deep learning models and integrated classification techniques resulted in the highest confidence level for class 3 classification [3] . Liu Zhenguo et al. identified patients with myasthenia gravis effectively based on the 3D DenseNet deep learning (DL) model of preoperative CT of patients as a complement to the conventional diagnostic criteria for identifying thymoma-associated MG [4] . Riasatian Abtin et al. used a DenseNet topology with four dense blocks, fine tuned and trained with different structures to propose a KimiaNet histopathology image recognition model, and tested KimiaNet using three publicly available datasets of TCGA, endometrial cancer images, and colorectal cancer images to verify the effectiveness of the model [5] . e model has certain search and classification performance when used for image representation. Considering the correlation of multilead ECG, systematically mining the correlation of interlead signals, and enhancing the multiplexing of feature information between interlead and intralead signals by using the dense connection of DenseNet, Xiong Peng et al. proposed a novel multilead myocardial infarction localization method based on a densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet), which automatically captures valid myocardial infarction, improves its recognition rate, and can be introduced into clinical practice to assist in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction [6] . Albahli Saleh et al. proposed three different BiT models: the DenseNet, InceptionV3, and Inception-ReNetV4 for the diagnosis of coronavirus pneumonia patients by X-ray chest radiographs, and the results showed that the pretrained DenseNet model had the highest classification efficiency of 92%, the accuracy of Inception V3 was 83.47% and that of Inception-ResNetV4 was 85.57%. is is sufficient to show the advantages of the DenseNet algorithm [7] . Wang Gaihua et al. proposed an image classification model with a residual attention mechanism based on the improved DenseNet, extracting image features from the training set, which can improve the accuracy of DenseNet algorithm by 8.89% [8] . It can be seen that deep learning has been effective in identifying various diseases in medicine, and it has certain auxiliary functions for physicians to diagnose diseases. erefore, based on the above research studies, this paper combines the DenseNet algorithm of deep learning with transfer learning to propose a migration learning-based method for grading hepatic steatosis with the improved DenseNet model.",

In addition, to obtain the best prediction, the model often needs a large amount of data support, which leads to a deepening network, and a too deep network will reduce the learning ability of the model, which in turn is prone to overfitting. At the same time, the radio image used for liver steatosis grading is usually small compared to conventional image datasets so that the model is less effective in classification recognition. To solve the above problems, the DenseNet model is improved in this paper. According to the literature [10, 11] , if two domains have commonality, their \"knowledge\" can be transferred; i.e., the knowledge learned from one domain can be used in the other domain. erefore, this paper improves the DenseNet model by combining transfer learning. In this paper, we improve the training accuracy of the model by transferring the pretrained model from the world's largest image recognition library (ImageNet dataset) into the DenseNet model [12] .",

Among them, hepatic fat grade grading was done independently by two professional imaging physicians based on patient imaging data, and hepatocellular steatosis was divided into four degree scores, noting hepatocellular adipocyte deformation 0-5% as 0, 5-33% as 1, 34%-66% as 2, and more than 66% as 3, respectively [19] . e statistics of patients' hepatic steatosis grade shows that there were 38 patients with grade 0, 24 male patients and 14 female patients; 12 patients with grade 1, 6 male patients and 1 female patient; there were no patients with grade 2 or 3. Figure 2 shows an example of an MR abdominal mDixon imaging slice of a patient. Six square ROI regions were set for each MR sequence of DICOM images under the premise of avoiding large blood vessels, focal liver lesions, and significant liver artifacts [20] . Four of the ROIs were located in the parenchyma of the right lobe of the patient's liver, i.e., segments V, VI, VII, and VIII of the liver, and the other two ROIs were located in the parenchyma of the left lobe of the patient's liver, i.e., segments II and III of the liver. Each region of the liver parenchyma has 16 * 16 pixels.",

In addition, since the difference in the number of data between samples with liver fat deformation as grade 0 (38 cases) and grade 1 (12 cases) is more obvious, if directly input into the depth model, it will easily lead to the neglect of the minority class samples, which are of important research value in medical image analysis. erefore, to avoid the effect of unbalanced data samples on the results, the experiments combined the actual number of minority class samples and majority class samples and used the method of oversampling minority class samples to deal with unbalanced data samples [22, 23] . e 648 ROIs with grade 1 hepatic steatosis were amplified twice with 2-fold data to obtain a total of 2,592 cases of grade 1 hepatic steatosis ROI data. Finally, 2,052 cases of grade 0 ROI data and 2,592 cases of grade 1 ROI data of hepatic steatosis were obtained in this experiment, where 3,766 and 878 ROIs were used for model training and testing, respectively, and Adam was selected as the optimization algorithm during the modeling process.",

Statistical correlation analysis shows that hepatic steatosis correlates significantly with pancreatic steatosis and has some correlation with metabolic syndrome; hepatic steatosis was correlated with age and metabolic syndrome in women only. However, due to the limitations, there are still some shortcomings in this paper; the amount of patient data is too small, the preliminary results obtained need to be further validated, and among the 50 patients with hepatic steatosis, there are no patients with grade 1 or higher, which leads to the accuracy and generalization ability of the model to be demonstrated. erefore, the amount of hepatic steatosis imaging data will be further collected and expanded in the next study.",
