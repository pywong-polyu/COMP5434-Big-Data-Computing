Oleanolic acid and its derivatives have been reported for various types of pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, hepatoprotective, anti-HIV and anti-HCV activity. Methods: L.cephalotes plant extracts were prepared by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method and oleanolic acid was isolated by preparatory thin-layer chromatography. The compound was identified and characterize by using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS), Fourier transform infra-Red spectroscopy (FT-IR) and high-performance thinlayer chromatography (HPTLC). The structure of the compound was elucidated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 HNMR) and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 CNMR) and the purity checked by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The MTT assay was used to determine the toxicity of plant extract and oleanolic acid using a microplate reader at 595 nm. The anti-dengue activity of plant extract and oleanolic acid was tested in vitro and in silico using real-time RT-PCR.",

The medicinal plants can play a vital role against these viruses [19] [20] [21] [22] . Thus, the researcher's curiosity in the study of medicinal plants and isolation of secondary metabolites is growing rapidly in recent times. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that over 80% of the people in emerging countries rely on traditional drugs and about 855 traditional medicines used in the world obtained from crude plant extracts [23] . There are many extraction techniques. In present study Supercritical Fluid Extraction (Applied Separation Inc. U.S.) method was used. SFE is an analytical method which is capable of separating the specific compounds from the unknown mixture of plants at a definite temperature and pressure. Considering L. cephalotes antipyretic, antimalarial, and anti-HIV activity, the current study was undertaken to test the anti-dengue activity of L. cephalotes supercritical extract and isolated oleanolic acid in vitro and in silico and to identify and characterize the isolated compound by different techniques.",

The experiment was carried out by mixing the 100 copis of the virus suspension. Virus suspension was pre-treated with non-toxic concentration of plant extract (Leucas cephalotes) / test compound (oleanolic acid) for 55 min with the gentle shaking after every 10 min in replica plates. The pretreated virus were transferred to respective wells of C6/36 cell lines and incubated for 55 min., shaking gently every 10 min. The medium was aspirated from the wells after the inoculums had adsorption. Then 100 \u03bcl virus growth medium was added without disturbing the cells layer. Further, the culture plates were incubated at 28\u00b0C in a CO 2 incubator for 7 days without disturbing the cells. The plate was frozen at \u2212 70\u00b0C after proper incubation, and the lysates were harvested and stocked into 2 ml vials. Following that, RNA was extracted from each vial [28, 29] .

Anti-dengue virucidal activity of methanol extracts of Andrographis paniculata; essential oils of Santalum album; petroleum ether extract of Alternanthera philoxeroides; ethanol and water extracts of Hippophae rhamnoides; dichloromethane and ethanol extracts of Cladogynos orientalis, Rhizophora apiculata, Flagellaria indica, Houttuynia cordata, and methanolic seed extracts of Quercus lusitanica have already been reported [22, 30] . In quantitative term few plants showed anti-dengue activity viz., Kaushik et al. study demonstrated that andrographolide extracted from A. paniculata showed 97.23% anti-dengue activity against the dengue-2 virus in C6/36 cell lines [31] . Cyamopsis tetragonoloba SFE extract showed the 99.9% inhibition against the dengue-2 virus [32] . In the present study L. cephalotes SFE extract inhibit 100% and test compound inhibit 99.17% dengue-2 virus in C6/36 cells line. The antiviral studies have not been performed on Leucas cephalotes plant and its SFE extract. In the present work we have chosen SFE extraction method. None of study was reported on SFE extract of L. cephalotes. The optimum yield of the extract was obtained at 40\u00b0C temperature and 15Mpa pressure. Sofi et al. study reported 11% w/w yield of L. cephalotes by Soxhlet method [33] . Rahman et al., reported 3.16% yield in ethanolic extract of L. cephalotes leaves by cold extraction method [34] . In present study SFE extraction yield was 1.3%. The SFE extract were found to contain oleanolic acid. The present work provides us with a cost-effective, reliable and safer option to treat dengue virus infection. The SFE extract of L. cephalotes found rich in oleanolic acid. Oleanolic acid and its derivatives have been reported for various types of pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, hepatoprotective, weak anti-HIV and weak anti-HCV activity [35] [36] [37] . Triterpenoids have been reported to possess antioxidant properties since they prevent lipid peroxidation and suppress superoxide anion generation. The oleanolic acid was characterised by its spectral data (UV, FT-IR, TLC, NMR, DSC) and found that it matched well with that of standard oleanolic acid. The triterpenes have a history of medicinal use in many Asian countries. Like oleanolic acid, the other phytochemicals such as quercetin, sulfated galactomannans, 7-Omethyl-glabranine, flavonoids, glabranine, eugenol, ursolic acid, azadirachtin, D-galactose, carrageenan, chalcone 4-hydroxypanduratin A and panduratin isolated from different plants have been reported for anti-dengue virucidal activity [22, 30] . Some already reported compounds possess anti-dengue activities are given in Table 3 [38] [39] [40] [41] . The oleanolic acid isolated in the present study revealed the 99.17% activity against dengue-2 virus while the SFE extract revealed the 100% anti-dengue activity. The differences in the antidegue activity of plant SFE extarct and oleanolic acid may be due to the presence of some other metabolites present in minor quantity of SFE extract of L. cephalotes. Researchers are particularly interested in discovering natural compounds that can be used as anti-dengue medicines [42] . The molecular docking in silico method is used in drug development. In this method, phytochemicals are matched with viral targets to find interactions between the drug and disease-producing agents by using the computational method. The RNA genome of the dengue virus encodes 7 nonstructural proteins that are essential for viral replication (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5). NS1 and NS5 are essential for viral replication. NS1 is the only protein that is continuously secreted by infected host cells. The pathogenic roles of NS1 are vascular leakage and severe dengue by disrupting coagulation. NS5 is the largest protein found in the genome of flavivirus. NS1 detected very earlier stage during the infection of the dengue virus. NS5 is Flavivirus's largest and most drug-targeted region, and it contains methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). NS5 down-regulates the host immune interferon 4-hydroxypanduratin A DENV-2 -Virucidal activity [22, 39] Ursolic acid DENV-2 Huh-7, BHK-21, A549 HEK-293 T Virucidal activity [40] luteolin DENV-2 Huh-7, BHK-21, A549 HEK-293 T Virucidal activity [40] Indirubin DENV-2 Huh-7, BHK-21, A549 HEK-293 T Virucidal activity [40] Apigenin DENV-2 Huh-7, BHK-21, A549 HEK-293 T Virucidal activity [40] Esculetin DENV-2 Huh-7, BHK-21, A549 HEK-293 T Virucidal activity [40] Oleanolic acid DENV-2 C6/36 Virucidal activity Present study response and modulating RNA splicing at the 5'UTR within the host cell [43, 44] . Excellent drug targets can be identified with the help of bioinformatics. The researchers have put great effort in search of effective molecules for targeting different structural or nonstructural proteins of the dengue virus. In the present study oleanolic acid shows maximum binding with both dengue virus protein NS1 and NS5 (\u2212 9.42Kcal/ mol and \u2212 8.32Kcal/mol), respectively. In the molecular docking study, the least binding energy revealed the stronger docking between ligands and viral targets. The inhibitory mechanisms of SFE extract of L. cephalotes and oleanolic acid can be used to manage dengue. Two possible mechanistic pathways could be the mode of antiviral action i.e. interference with viral adsorption on the target cells and inhibition of virus replication [31, 45] . The present study revealed that L. cephalotes extract and its compound showed virucidal activity against dengue virus, DENV-2 strain. It may be due to the presence of oleanolic acid in the plant extract that inactivates certain important structural and non-structural protein of the dengue virus and the enzymes involved in the replication. The molecular docking results also showed that the nonstructural proteins; NS1 and NS5 are potential targets of inhibition. Further, molecular docking of NS1 and NS5 with standard known ligands, like lectin and valporic acid (VPA) gave good Gold score and comparable to our test molecule oleanolic acid. This indicates that oleanolic acid can be used as a new molecule to block the binding site of dengue virus non-structural proteins. Earlier, it has been reported that NS1 competitively bind to lectin and neutralize the viral infection [46] . Also, V\u00e1zquez-Calvo and coworkers reported the probable use of VPA in understanding the crucial steps of viral maturation and for developing potent inhibitor for enveloped viruses [47] .",
