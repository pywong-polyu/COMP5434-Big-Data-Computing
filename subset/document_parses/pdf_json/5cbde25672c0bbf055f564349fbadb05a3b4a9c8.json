In the last twenty years, the shift toward new forms of expressing public interest as a responsibility of government through the engagement of civil society has been a key topic for international and transnational agencies [6] [7] [8] . As Arnstein [9] put it, citizen participation should help progress toward real power of decision through the redistribution of information and resources, and the possibility effectively to influence policy-making.",

            "text": "Scholarly debate has explored the positives and negatives of constituting wider policy networks with social actors and stakeholders. The mainstreaming of citizen participation led by international and transnational agencies resulted in debates on how to strengthen competences are also good predictors of participation [47] , while limited access to resources, such as time, money, language barriers, perceptions of powerlessness, lack of stamina and persistence, alongside barriers to institutional accessibility [40, 41] , adversely affect opportunities for participation in all policy fields. Further exacerbating conditions may be environmental factors, from adverse climatic conditions and pollution to inadequate street lighting or pedestrian infrastructures, which together limit the scope for safe participation in community activities [48] . Studies have also shown that participation in public activities can differ according to the health status of senior citizens. For instance, people with mild or severe health problems, or depressive symptoms are less likely to be involved in volunteering, while high income is associated with a higher propensity to volunteering in the case of mild health problems [33] . Principi et al. [33] also find that being widowed and suffering from health issues are positively associated with volunteering. In contrast, other scholars find that older people who are married often perform more social activities than those living alone [49] . Bukov [45] notes that participation is highly gendered-with men more likely to be engaged in political activities and clubs, and women in volunteering and caregiving-and biased toward higher socioeconomic status. Pinto and Neri [43] add that men tend to disengage from political and organisational activities, while women discontinue community activities and volunteering, especially due to widowhood, retirement, health problems, and functional decline. To avoid social exclusion and the civic discontent it may entail, scholars agree on the need to train public staff in participatory policy-making and improve communication with older populations [22, 36, 44, 50, 51] .",

In tandem with informal initiatives, the growth of participatory initiatives with senior citizens at different levels of governance has also captured political authorities and corporate bodies at the international level [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . The Vienna International Plan of Action on Aging [57] , one of the most relevant plans in this field endorsed by the United Nations (UN), underpins the need for participation in community organisations and political processes. Likewise, the Principles for Older Persons issued by UN in 1991 argue the necessity to participate actively in the formulation and implementation of policies that directly affect seniors' well-being [58] and share their knowledge and skills with younger generations. More recently, the Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging advanced the idea that measures should be taken to enable the full and equal participation of older persons in decision-making processes at all levels [35] .",

Yet the call for action against poverty, economic decline, or rural remoteness [61] can persuade governments to seek support from organisations representing senior citizens' interests in a range of policy domains. This presents these organisations with new opportunities for advocating for senior citizens' needs, promoting measures and initiatives in support of active, participatory aging, as well as organizing participatory settings, such as forums, networks, user panels, day centers or care home user groups, or services planning groups [62, 63] . According to the UN [64] , organisations of older persons provide an important means of participation through advocacy, particularly for otherwise voiceless senior people, and of influence over decision-making processes at all levels of government. At the same time, scholars alert to the need for representativeness of seniors' voice to avoid reinforcing social biases. Com-municatively competent senior citizens, who are more frequently engaged in participatory initiatives, may not speak for or on behalf of other seniors, but rather represent personal or sectarian agendas [44, 65] . Studying the relationship between senior citizen organisations and governmental agencies, Carter and Beresford [66] note that processes that are led by agencies and representative organisations may be more likely to gain official credibility and funding, although they may also be more likely accountable to, and constrained by, their own agendas. In contrast, initiatives that are led by individuals who do not identify themselves with any specific organisation can have more credibility, even if they often face greater obstacles in raising funding [21, 46, 67] .",

The latter range from individualized initiatives led by senior citizens (e.g., direct payment-based schemes), to social groups, networking, campaigning and direct action (e.g., civic forms, community councils, local area forums, committees and citizens' panels) [63, 67, 68] .

Scholars tend to agree that participation should not be limited to isolated instances or individual stages of policy-making, but rather be embedded from the policy design to the end stage of implementation. According to Cooper et al. [72] , citizen participation can be developed in either stage of the policy cycle, but that holds different potential for achieving public involvement. Whereas participation in the design of policies is expected to shape citizen opinions on policy topics and develop a common language for discussing problem definitions, policy implementation is likely to provide shared resources to co-produce the services to be delivered [73] . The distinction between the two stages builds on a longer debate among policy analysts on definitions of goal setting and their realization in action. Scholars have recently highlighted the pathdependent character of policymaking and the decisive impact of citizen participation in both stages, as policy design and implementation equally concern the generation of inputs through debate and activity [74] .",

To validate the data, we consulted experts who had previously acted as National Coordinators of the 2012 European Year of Active Aging and Intergenerational Solidarity (EYAA), appointed by each of the 27 EU member states at the time and three associated countries (Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein), and typically representing national umbrella organisations concerned with aging issues and supporting senior citizens. During the 2012 EYAA, the European Commission promoted active aging initiatives coordinated by National Coordinators in each member state. The Coordinators and the persons/organisations directly involved in identified initiatives were approached via email, and invited to verify initiatives and provide any additional information about practices in their respective countries. They were thus well positioned to be familiar with the types of initiatives our study sought to identify. These consultations helped to identify new, and to confirm the nature and ambitions of known, initiatives. Additionally, we approached researchers from across Europe to help us identify senior participation initiatives.",

Most initiatives are permanent, anticipated to continue their work for the foreseeable future, often with funding formally secured-or confident of securing it-for some years ahead. Two of the three temporary initiatives (\"Streets are ours also\" in Lisbon, Portugal; and \"Mobility and safe streets: older generations in movement\" in Rome, Italy) share a narrow policy agenda with a focus on urban interventions in streets and public spaces. The third temporary initiative, involving Black and Minority Ethnic seniors in the United Kingdom, was set up to trial participation of socially and politically excluded minority populations in 2009, but did not progress to full implementation. Table 5 lists the 37 initiatives according to the above coordinates. Web links to these initiatives, as retrieved at the time of the study, can be found in Appendix A. ",

In the Danish case, for instance, inclusion of women is encouraged via expense allowances supported by the municipality via an expense allowance that can reach \u20ac73 per month for older women, plus a budget of \u20ac6000 a year to use for the organisation of the councils' activities. In the Irish case, Councils are committed to preventing socioeconomic bias in the representation of senior citizens' needs and interests by including the most vulnerable groups [40, 41, 61] . Moreover, the direct election of senior citizens' representatives in the Danish and the German cases, is understood locally to contribute to their status and their capacity to shape public policy.",

Members are prevented from assuming political functions other than advising on policy matters that most directly concern senior citizens (e.g., primary health care, social policies, local infrastructure). At the end of the 1990s, the SCCs gave impetus to the creation of the National Association of Senior Citizens' Councils (Danske AEldrer\u00e5d). The SCC comprise about 1000 members in total throughout Denmark, with each SCC composed on average of 10 members. Senior citizens can run as candidates to represent senior citizens' interests and, to-date, the elections have returned about half of the existing SCC membership with the other half being newly elected.",

Like the SCC in Denmark, senior citizens' representatives of the DSCC, 27 in total, are now also directly elected by city residents aged 60 and older.

Toward this aim, consultative approaches are adopted through the local Primary Care Trust (responsible for delivering health service and care in the area), and a set of other initiatives. The POPP Strategic Board is composed of four senior citizens sitting alongside three representatives from Dorset County Council and the National Health Services. It decides on funding proposals, while encouraging Council bodies to respond quickly to community needs. Evaluations suggest that the initiative has been cost-effective and has helped to improve service delivery by facilitating dialogue between senior citizens and professional service providers. Participation in the process of designing and implementing projects is via the Community Initiatives Commissioning Fund (open to not-for-profit local groups) and the Dementia Innovation Fund (open also to professionals).

The SCPB adopted a representative rather than electoral model of engagement with senior citizens, with those aged 65 and older eligible to propose local initiatives. Given high levels of illiteracy among the local population, and the territorial dispersion and isolation in rural villages, the municipality decided to provide the Senior Citizens' Council, which had been created in 2013, with power to select senior citizens' proposals that should be funded through the SCPB.",

In early 2015, APC serve about half a million members aged over 60. Besides providing dining services to its members, APCs organize social, cultural and leisure activities, offer training (e.g., in computing) and legal advice to senior citizens. APC members can take part in the General Assembly, which decides on these activities in consultation with the regional authority and local Senior Citizens' Councils (which can also participate in the assembly, but without the right to vote).",

It found a diversity of initiatives promoting senior participation in policymaking, adopting consultative and co-decisional approaches [66] at different stages in the policy cycle [24, 70] . These primary approaches intersected with different implementation scales, actor configurations, and degrees of institutionalization. Local initiatives benefiting from permanent legal frameworks were more prominent than other types of participation.

Only a few initiatives had adopted co-decisional approaches, which limits our understanding on what can be considered the highest level of direct democratic involvement in the early policy stages, and whether there is political interest in breaking the ceiling of consultation. Nonbinding consultation is often enshrined by law and/or framed within specific regulatory requirements or strategies, which may narrow discussion whenever norms create obstacles to more informal expressions of participation, but can make the initiatives more credible and durable [66] . In fact, we did not find evidence in Denmark or Germany that local governments were opposed to sharing decision-making processes with seniors [60, 62, 63] . Rather the intermediation of collective bodies was typically understood as a necessary mechanism for representing senior citizens' interests, being aware of the risk of failing to represent seniors and reinforcing social and community barriers [44, 65] . In some cases, as in Denmark, the direct election of members to statutory bodies proved an effective mechanism for engaging senior citizens through consultative approaches.",

Cost-effectiveness is crucial when considering the different types of funding (e.g., state-funded, crowdfunded, etc.) of the initiatives, which influence the forms of accountability to members or electors. As Carter and Beresford [66] put it, credibility is associated with funding of representative organisations and increases the need for accountability. An organisation's capacity to operate efficiently, especially if independently funded, enhances their capacity to advocate for members, as shown in Dorset. State-dependency for funding, at least in the perception of our case study informants, potentially risks undermining an organisation's capacity to influence public policy agendas. Complex initiatives and networks, moreover, may require formal channels of collaboration with public authorities, which may limit their capacity to promote and scale up grassroots campaigns as emerged in Slovakia. That said, it is worth acknowledging that self-organized initiatives by individuals have been shown to face similar issues of credibility and fund raising [21, 46, 67] .",

The cases presented suggest that city councils often privilege the direct engagement of individuals as a way to promote participation for and with people. Senior citizens can be encouraged to propose their ideas for public funding associated with other statutory bodies representing senior citizens' interests, as in the cases of Alf\u00e2ndega da F\u00e9 (Bragan\u00e7a, Portugal) and Gdynia (Poland). This type of participation can build on specific needs of seniors' engagement and aim to find solutions to disadvantaged living conditions, such as those linked to rural remoteness [61] . In a similar vein, the creation of initiatives that boost a critical mass of senior citizens to be channeled into participatory initiatives as the participatory budget, can equally proportionate sound results.

Moreover, the study did not cover examples of failed, abandoned, or discontinued approaches to senior citizen participation.

Moreover, we have described different modes of engagement with, as far as we can ascertain in the absence of robust comparative evaluation evidence, initiatives based on direct election by senior citizens arguably in the strongest position of influence. Last, initiatives are subject to change, some institutionalized and intended to last, others not.
