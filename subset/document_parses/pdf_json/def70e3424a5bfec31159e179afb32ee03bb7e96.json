[1] [2] [3] [4] Vaccination is a crucial measure in breaking the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Among several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, 13 in clinical development are inactivated vaccines, two of which are already in phase 4 trials. Although the basic cultivation techniques using Vero cells and inactivation strategies are similar, inactivated vaccines differ in the isolated virion strains and the adjuvants used. 5, 6 The potential advantages of inactivated vaccines are non-replicability in the host, non-transmissibility, and the induction of a broad range of humoral and cellular responses against different epitopes. Their production and scale-up are relatively easy in the context of good yield production systems and the availability of bio safety level 3 facilities. 7 Disadvantages include limited immunogenicity requiring adjuvants to enhance the immune response, large quantities of live virus to be handled, and the integrity of antigens or epitopes that should be verified. 8 CoronaVac, an inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate developed by Sinovac Life Sciences (Beijing, China), has been in phase 3 trials since mid-2020 in Brazil, Indonesia, Chile, and Turkey. As of April 28, 2021 , it has been approved in 22 countries for emergency use. 9 In this Article, we present the interim safety and efficacy results of a phase 3 trial in Turkey investigating the use of CoronaVac in adults.",

In the world's first publicly reported animal trial of a SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine PiCoVacc, thereafter named CoronaVac in clinical trials, Gao and colleagues showed that the vaccine induced the production of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralising antibodies in animals and provided complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in non-human primates. Phase 1/2 studies of CoronaVac showed a good safety and tolerability profile, and a dosage of 3 \u03bcg produced seroconversion rates of 92\u00b70% with a 14-day immunisation schedule and 97\u00b70% with a 28-day schedule in participants aged 18-59 years, and 98\u00b70% with a 28-day schedule in participants aged 60 years and older in phase 2 trials.",

As the immunogenicity and T-cell response analyses are ongoing, we only report the initial results of the anti-RBD antibody tests and neutralising antibody assays gathered at least 14 days after the second dose of vaccine or placebo. Virus neutralisation assays were done in an in-house microtitre plate, as described by Hanifehnezhad and colleagues. 12 Five-fold diluted serum samples, starting from 1:5, were mixed with an equal volume of 100 median tissue culture infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 Ank1 isolate (1:10 000) in quadruplicate and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C for neutralisation. The serum-virus mixtures were subsequently inoculated onto 90% confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well plates. The assay was evaluated via inverted microscope when a 100% cytopathic effect was observed in the virus control wells. Reciprocals of serum dilutions inhibiting at least 50% of virus infectivity were expressed as mean antibody titre (SN 50 ).",

Anti-RBD antibodies developed in 89\u00b77% of volunteers in a subset of our study sample, and 92\u00b70% of those who were seropositive also produced protective levels of neutralising antibodies at least 14 days after the second dose of vaccine.

This finding indicates that non-RBD-directed antibodies might have a role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In a subset of participants, neutralising antibody assays showed that there were no significant differences in the frequency of seroconversion or geometric mean titres of neutralising antibodies against the B.1.128 variant compared with those against the P.1 and P.2 variants. The study cohort only included health-care workers actively working with COVID-19 patients, and a PCR-positive case with local symptoms (such as sore throat, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhoea) was considered as a failure of the vaccine, thus indicating that the vaccine might confer lower protection against asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. The interim report of the phase 3 trial in Chile with a subset of 434 health-care workers, including those aged 60 years or older, revealed high seroconversion rates for specific anti-S1-RBD IgG and neutralising antibodies, along with a robust T-cell response. 23 The interim phase 3 results of other COVID-19 vaccines have shown efficacies ranging from 62\u00b71% to 95%. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Higher and more rapidly established efficacies were observed with mRNA-based vaccines. 25, 26 Considering the immunogenic mechanisms of inactivated vaccines, because one dose is not expected to be as efficacious as two doses, we did not expect to and could not show an early protective effect after the first dose, in contrast to findings with mRNA vaccines. The tolerability of CoronaVac in this study was excellent and the incidence of adverse events, most of which were solicited systemic events, was low. The majority of the adverse events were grade 1 and occurred within 7 days after the injection. No grade 4 adverse events were observed and there was only one adverse event (an allergic reaction) that required hospitalisation.",

            "text": "Third, the study used a 14-day interval immunisation scheme, whereas the community immunisation was with a 28-day interval. It has been claimed that, although 28-day immunisation schemes elucidated better immunogenicity after the second dose, longer intervals between the two doses are correlated with a higher probability of contracting COVID-19 before getting fully immunised and a great chance of emergence of mutant variants that can replicate in the setting of suboptimal levels of neutralising antibodies. 29 As our results pertain to the data before the emergence of variants of concern, we cannot comment on the efficacy of CoronaVac on the prevention of infection with mutant viruses. Although one of the prespecified outcomes was seroconversion, we have avoided using this term in our reporting of the results because the immunoassay we used was a semiquantitative assay. In fact, all of the participants were seronegative at the time of screening; therefore, the seropositivity 14 days after the second dose of vaccine would indicate seroconversion. However, we could not exclude the possibility that some samples with antibody levels below a sample-to-cutoff ratio of 1 might have very low concentrations of established antibodies. The current report neither involves data on the sequential serum neutralising antibody titres nor the magnitude of T-cell responses or the duration of protectivity. However, a study setting has been established to analyse the proliferation and functional capacity of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and the results of an initial study in a group of COVID-19 survivors have been reported by Tavukcuoglu and colleagues. 30 This setting is now being used to analyse the samples from selected participants of this trial to show the functional capacity of T cells induced by CoronaVac to reinvigorate antiviral immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",
