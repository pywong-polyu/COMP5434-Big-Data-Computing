A key feature of COVID-19 is dysregulated interferon-response. Type-I interferon (IFN-I) is one of the earliest antiviral innate immune responses following viral infection and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, using a proteomics-based approach, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces delayed and dysregulated IFN-I signaling in Huh7 cells. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is able to inhibit RIG-I mediated IFN-\u03b2 production. Our results also confirm the recent findings that IFN-I pretreatment is able to reduce the susceptibility of Huh7 cells to SARS-CoV-2, but not post-treatment. Moreover, senescent Huh7 cells, in spite of showing accentuated IFN-I response were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the virus effectively inhibited IFIT1 in these cells. Finally, proteomic comparison between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV revealed a distinct differential regulatory signature of interferon-related proteins emphasizing that therapeutic strategies based on observations in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should be used with caution. Our findings provide a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 regulation of cellular interferon response and a perspective on its use as a treatment. Investigation of different interferon-stimulated genes and their role in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may direct novel antiviral strategies.",

            "text": "IFN-I response, majorly IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, is one of the first lines of defense against viruses 5 . The early activation of IFN responses against coronaviruses is initiated by recognition of viral products by the host pattern recognition receptors like Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). RLRs can recognize the viral RNA that promotes their oligomerization and subsequent activation of a signaling cascade leading to the production of IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 6 . Through autocrine and paracrine signaling, the secreted IFN binds to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 membrane receptors, activating the JAK-STAT signaling cascade that triggers the transcription of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) with diverse antiviral properties 7 . Coronaviruses have evolved mechanisms to evade the host's antiviral immune response. Several structural and nonstructural proteins in SARS-CoV 8 , in MERS-CoV 8, 9 , and in SARS-CoV-2 10, 11 have been shown to be strong IFNantagonists. The dynamics of the IFN response varies between these three coronaviruses [12] [13] [14] . Distinct virusspecific patterns in host cell response were also noted in transcriptomics analysis 15 . Thus, a deeper understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated regulation of IFN response is necessary to develop rationale and novel therapeutic approaches for SARS-CoV-2.",

We first analyzed the quantitative proteomics data on Huh7 cells that were either mock-infected or infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, over a period of 24 and 48 h post infection (hpi). Genes associated with the interferon response, including the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling (Pathway:R-HSA-909733), IFN-\u03b3 signaling (Pathway:R-HSA-877300), and the antiviral mechanism by ISGs (Pathway:R-HSA-1169410) were extracted from the data. For mock-infected, we considered the data for two replicates as the third one was a major outlier as shown in the PCA plot (Fig. S1 ). No major changes were observed in the ISGs at 24 hpi and significant modulation was only observed at 48 hpi after infection as represented in the heatmap (Fig. 1A) . Of the 94 proteins studied, a number of proteins showed a significant reduction in abundance (n = 20), while a major cluster of proteins showed an increase (n = 26) (LIMMA, false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). The log2fold change of the significantly regulated genes is represented as a volcano plot (Fig. 1B) . The protein-protein interaction network of the significantly changed genes showed two definite clusters: cluster-1 involved proteins associated with the RIG-I/DDX58 and IFN-I signaling, while cluster-2 consisted of transporter proteins belonging to the components of nucleoporin complex and karyopherin family (Fig. 1C) .",

In order to evaluate the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN-I, we either presensitized cells (16 h) with IFN-\u03b12a (5000 IU) and IFN-\u03b2 (100 IU) or treated the cells with the same concentrations of IFNs starting 1 hpi and continued for 24 h. Huh7 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1 and at 24 hpi the supernatant was collected to determine the virus production in the presence or absence of different IFN-I treatments. As shown in Fig. 4F , IFN pre-sensitization lead to a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 production in the supernatant as compared to levels in supernatant from untreated cells at 24 hpi. However, IFN-I treatment after infection did not suppress virus production (Fig. 4H ). This observation suggests firstly that the presence of a high level of IFN-response can suppress the incoming virus and secondly that the virus has also developed measures to counteract these responses when it has already established infection. Then, we further looked into the effect of IFN-I treatment and infection in transcriptional activation of a few of the ISGs that were modulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this, we selected MX2, IFIT1, and ISG15. While SARS-CoV-2 suppressed MX2 mRNA in untreated cells, MX2 did not show any activation following IFN-treatment (not shown). Both ISG15 and IFIT1 were significantly induced following IFN-I treatment, however, SARS-CoV-2 did not cause any significant alterations to the mRNA levels ( Fig. 4G , I).",

Cellular senescence has been observed to play a different role in either promoting infection for some viruses or inhibiting infection for others. To this end, we aimed to examine the susceptibility of senescent Huh7 cells to SARS-CoV-2 and associated IFN-I response. To induce cellular senescence Huh7 cells were treated with 0.5 \u03bcM of etoposide for 6 days followed by 2 days without any treatment and then infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h and cells and supernatants were harvested 24 hpi. Etoposide treatment resulted in massive cell death and surviving cells were large in size. Cellular senescence was determined by detecting p21 mRNA levels (Fig. 5B ). Senescent Huh7 cells showed a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 production in cell supernatant of senescent Huh7 cells compared to the untreated control cells (Fig. 5A ). We next investigated the IFN-response in senescence-induced and non-induced cells by detecting mRNA transcripts of IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs such as ISG15, IFIT1, MX2, and RIG-I. Cellular senescence induced an increase in the IFNresponse with a significant increase in the levels of IFN-\u03b2 and other ISGs tested (Fig. 5B ). SARS-CoV-2 failed to significantly alter the levels of any tested genes except for IFIT1, where a significant decrease in the mRNA levels was noted upon infection (Fig. 5B ). To determine if the enhanced infectivity of senescent cells is specific to Huh7, we tried to replicate the same experiment in Caco2 cells. However, Caco2 cells were more resistant to 0.5 \u03bcM etoposide treatment and did not show observable induction of senescence determined by qPCR of the p21 gene (Fig. S2B ). Most interestingly, in contrast to Huh7, even a very low-level induction of p21 was sufficient to significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility (Fig. S2A ) and among the ISGs IFIT1 showed an observable increase upon infection (Fig. S2B) . The results suggest that there is a cell-type-specific regulation of SARS-CoV-2 and the importance of IFIT1 as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 ISGs.",

In our proteomics data, we observed several components of this signaling pathway to be dysregulated and the proteomic changes are delayed by 48 h after infection in Huh7 cells (Fig. 1 ). In concordance with the delay in induction of ISGs, we have observed that SARS-CoV-2 can inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production (Fig. 3F, H) . However, it needs to be noted that while SARS-CoV-2 induced several ISGs, many of them like MX2, GBP2, IFI30, IFI35, etc. were suppressed. Most interestingly, JAK1 levels were suppressed, which can make the infected cells resistant toward IFN-treatment at later stages 22 . Other than the ISG's several nuclear transporter complexes were also differentially modulated.",

            "text": "Like any other pathogenic virus, SARS-CoV-2 has developed mechanisms to suppress IFN-response. For example, by SARS-CoV-2 proteins interacting with various components of the host innate immune responses 23 . ORF6, nsp6, nsp13, nsp1, and M proteins have been shown to inhibit the IFN-I signaling pathway at different levels 10, 24, 25 . On the other hand, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins like nsp2 and S proteins were found to stimulate IFN response 24 . Thus, SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to modulate the IFN signaling in both positive and negative ways. This is represented in our findings of both increased expression and suppression of many ISGs in the infected Huh7. Not only ISGs but also the expression of several nuclear pore complexes (involved in STAT translocation to the nucleus and subsequent ISRE-dependent gene activation) was altered in our infection model. Among the nuclear transporters, Nup98 is the most studied with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection as the ORF6 protein interacts with it and blocks the translocation of STAT-1 to the nucleus to inhibit ISGs 25 . However, we did not observe any change in Nup98 expression levels. Interestingly we detected another family of nuclear transporter KPNA1, KPNA2, and KPNA4 to be significantly decreased at the later time point of infection (Fig. 1) . KPNA1 forms a complex with pSTAT1 and aids in its translocation to the nucleus 26 and thus serves a major purpose in the transcription of ISGs. Reduced expression of KPNA's could result in insufficient nuclear translocation of p-STATs and thus suppress the expression of many of the ISGs. Several viruses, like the foot-and-mouth disease virus, can degrade KPNA1 to block ISGs by their 3C-like protease activity 27 that is also encoded in ORF1a of coronaviruses and was detected in proteomics 16 . SARS-CoV-2 also encodes another protease, papain-like protease (PLpro) that has de-ubiquitinase and de-ISGylase activity. PLpro can hydrolyze ubiquitin and ISG15 conjugation and has been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion strategies. Based on our observation of a dose-dependent decrease in conjugated-ISG15 levels at 24 hpi and thereafter increase at later stages (48 h) of infection, it is tempting to speculate that PLpro may play a significant role in early infection, that requires further validation.",

Furthermore, in severe COVID-19 patients and Ferret models in spite of a cytokine storm and induction of ISGs, a very low-level of circulating IFN-I was noted 29, 30 . This was particularly interesting since in our infection model we did not observe any significant transcriptional activation of IFN-\u03b2 in qPCR, despite observing changes in the levels of proteins related to RIG-I signaling and ISGs (Fig. 1) . A recurrent observation was the absence of correlation between transcript levels and protein levels, as both in qPCR and in transcriptomics data, we did not observe any significant changes in ISG15, IFIT1, MX2, DDX58 mRNAs between the mock-infected and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells after 48 h (Figs. 2 and 4) . In our previous paper, we observed significant changes in the level of global transcripts only after 72 h of infection 4, 16 . This was true for many of the genes related to interferon signaling pathways (data not shown). Many studies performing proteomics and transcriptomics have observed poor correlation between mRNA levels and protein abundances 31 . While majority of the studies show high mRNA expression compared to the protein expression, here we observed an opposite effect. The regulation of mRNA levels and protein abundances is a dynamic process and may have different temporal behavior under stress condition 32 . Coronaviruses have host mRNA cleavage-degradation mechanism, where the host mRNA is degraded soon after the viral proteins are synthesized 33 . Thus, it is possible that during SARS-CoV-2 infection the protein levels remained stable following synthesis while mRNA undergoes a rapid turnover. In order to understand these discrepancies a more detailed time-series experiments are required.",

However, it was interesting to note that neither in pre-sensitized cells or in post-treated cells SARS-CoV-2 altered the ISG15 and IFIT1 mRNA levels significantly. Thus, the role of anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of other ISGs upon induction needs to be explored. Overall, these results suggest that IFNtreatment may be effective in curbing SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was also observed in a phase-2 trial with nebulized IFN-\u03b2-1a showing better recovery in COVID-19 patients 35 . However, it needs to be used with caution since it may be effective when administered in the early phases of the disease, while a late administration could induce ISGs that might contribute to the progression of the pathology. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that people with naturally high level of IFN might better control the virus during early stages of infection and thus progressing towards better disease outcome and recovery.",

DNA damage induced cellular senescence is driven by complex signal transduction cascades that includes p16 and p53/ p21 pathways 40 . To determine the senescent phenotype of the viable cells after treatment with low dose of etoposide we have used the mRNA expression of p21 as a marker that leads to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases that regulate progression of cell cycle 41 . In cancer cell lines, p21 plays an important role in driving topoisomerase poison induced senescence 42 and maintains the cell viability 43 . In our Huh7 senescent cell model even though there was a significant increase in IFN-response compared to healthy cells, the virus production was significantly increased (Fig. 5) , suggesting that the virus is able to escape the antiviral response in senescent cells. In particular, among the ISGs tested we observed a significant suppression of IFIT1. However, this effect may be celltype dependent, since Caco2 cells showed more resistance to etoposide with a very low-level induction of p21 (Fig.  S2 ). However, we observed an inhibition of viral replication with visible upregulation of IFIT1. This indicates that IFIT1 might be an important antiviral-factor that needs further attention. Also, the differences observed among the two cell lines underscores the drawback of studying a single cell line (Huh7 in this case) as it may not be reflective of other cell populations where there could be differential regulation of IFN-response 44 .",

In the Huh7 infection model, we have observed the MERS-CoV to be highly cytopathic, a delayed cytopathic effect in SARS-CoV and no cytopathic effect with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the same infective dose. This points toward a differential regulation of immune-signaling pathways by these viruses. Using proteomics, we attempted to delineate the immunological features of the cells during infection with these three viruses. We were restricted with our analysis of MERS-CoV to 24 hpi and we observed a large number of proteins expression to be significantly altered when compared to the mock. While in case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 the major changes were observed at 48 hpi. While we observed a variety of cellular processes to be commonly regulated by these viruses (Fig. S5) , we focused our analysis to IFN-I signaling. All the three viruses had unique signatures in induction of IFN-response in Huh7 cells, with very limited overlap among them. While SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV had many similar signatures, SARS-CoV showed very little induction of ISG's and there was no similarity to MERS-CoV at all (Fig. 6 ). This probably explains the resistance to IFN-treatment observed in SARS-CoV in other studies 14 , as it may have a stronger mechanism to inhibit IFN-I response. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV had 13 common proteins that were significantly altered. However, while the nuclear transporter complex proteins KPNA1, KPNA2, and RAE1 were suppressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, they were upregulated in MERS-CoV infected cells. Earlier we have discussed the possible role of 3C-like protease encoded in ORF3a in degradation of KPNA isoforms. The absence of visible detection of ORF1a or 3CL-pro peptides in MERS-CoV infected cells further strengthens the role of these viral proteins in regulation of transport of cellular transcription factors to the nucleus.",

Proteomics raw data was first filtered for empty rows and quantile normalized with R package NormalizerDE. Histogram was used to display the distribution of data and assess that the distribution follows a normal law. Principal component analysis was performed using ggplot2. Viral protein abundances were retrieved and baseline subtraction (Infected-Mock) was performed for each time point and represented using barplots made with ggplot2. In order to identify proteins changing after infection, differential abundance analysis was performed using R package LIMMA between Mock and infected cells as described from Huh7 cells with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As described previously, results were filtered for interferon related libraries. Ninety-nine interferon-related proteins were detected for SARS-CoV, only 1 significant at 24 h and 5 at 48 h. For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 96 interferon proteins were detected and 28 were differentially expressed. for Results from each comparison were retrieved and represented as volcano plot using ggplot2, Venn diagram using interactivenn (http://www.interactivenn.net/) and heatmap of fold changes using R package complex-Heatmap. Significant proteins identified in Huh7 infected with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV were extracted from proteomic data and represented as a network. All the codes generated in analyzing the data are available at GitHub (https://github.com/neogilab/ COVID_IFN).",
