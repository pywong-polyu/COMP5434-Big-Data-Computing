Along with the cost of isolation, we define an overburden healthcare cost and a total cost. We explore these costs by adjusting parameters that could change with policy decisions. We observe that two disease prevention practices, namely increasing isolation activity and increasing incentive to isolate do not always lead to optimal health outcomes. We demonstrate that this is due to the fatigue and cost of isolation. We further demonstrate that an increase in the number of lock-downs, each of shorter duration can lead to minimal costs. Our results are compared with case data in Ontario, Canada from March to August 2020 and details of expanding the results to other regions are presented.",

The majority of these models focus on fixed policy implementations such as reducing contacts on a given date and reinstating them on another. There are two main issues with this, the first is that it requires knowledge of the implementation and relaxation times. While this can be explored in model simulations and optimized for best results, its independence from the model itself can make it hard to adapt to other diseases, strains, or important factors. A second problematic issue is that it assumes an instantaneous policy compliance, i.e. that people will immediately reduce contacts upon implementation and stop upon relaxation. While this can be impacted by an adherence parameter, it does not allow for a dynamic response which is more realistic of human choice. Therefore, a dynamical social distancing model that reacts to the disease dynamics is more realistic.",

However, modelling the dynamics of intervention entirely on the disease progression assumes that people will immediately distance or relax at some threshold. This suggests that a periodic solution will emerge centred around the critical disease threshold and this appears to happen in [8] . While it is quite realistic that disease dynamics drive people into isolation, it is a separate mechanism, namely the cost of staying home, that people consider when relaxing their isolation habits. Cost is seldom considered in models, with most of the focus on larger economic influence [9, 10] . These economic factors certainly play a role in individual cost but psychological factors such as loneliness and habit displacement are important as well.",

The disease progression information typically comes from media reports and has been investigated in the context of infectious diseases such as influenza (cf. [11] [12] [13] [14] ) and is usually used to reduce the susceptibility of individuals who are positively influenced by media. The relaxation cost is less often considered and its inclusion recognizes that repeated lock-downs would have diminishing returns as the cost to stay home becomes too overwhelming. A dynamic response model allows for more realistic policy strategies for disease mitigation and mortality prevention. Our model focuses on the spread of the disease in Ontario, Canada, but could be adapted with other parameters to other regions.",

The health cost is based on overloading existing healthcare resources while the economic cost is the personal or societal cost of social distancing. We show the excellence of fit to our data in \u00a73 and present a series of results based on different scenarios where policy parameters that control distancing and relaxing are varied. We consider scenarios where both health and relaxation costs are equally weighted or where health cost is much more strongly influencing the total cost. We consider a modification to the relaxation rate so that it depends on both cost and cases and see that multiple outbreak peaks can occur.

We introduce a further subscript, M which represents the mitigation of spread due to individuals who have tested positive and are isolated.

Furthermore, this means that someone already social distancing in state 1 or 2 who becomes symptomatic remains in that social distance class.

Asymptomatic people are likely to only seek a test out if they believe, through contact tracing or otherwise, they have come into contact with someone who has the virus, or through targeted testing initiatives. Despite the fact that testing numbers fluctuate with the progression of the disease, we take the testing rates to be constant which makes them an effective testing rate. This is consistent with studies estimating global infections per symptomatic test case (cf. [23, 24] ).

For example, if \u03b4 = 1 then the 1 and 2 states are both fully isolated and contribute an equal maximal cost. The parameter N crit appears in (2.4) because of the scaling on the populations. We only include susceptible and exposed classes in (2.4) because we assume there is a greater benefit to having transmitting classes (P i , I i ) stay home. Arguably, exposed people who will soon become infectious should stay home too, but as they would test negative, they would think they are healthy and therefore we assume they contribute to the cost. For simplicity, we ignore the cost of recovered people social distancing which will be invalid if many people have recovered but policy prevents them from returning to their workplaces etc. As written, the cost accumulates with time. We could remedy this by including a decay factor \u2212\u03bc c c in (2.5) but we assume that the time scale of recovery is much longer than that of the pandemic.

We took 10 March 2020 as the initial time with an initial condition that 0.02% of the population was infected with symptoms and placed the remaining 99.98% of the population in the susceptible class. We demonstrate the results from data-fitting the parameters k c , M c and \u03c1 A in figure 2a,b. Comparing data with simulation, we observe a difference in the early peak-time of 4.7 days and a difference in peak active cases of 359 people. We extend our simulation beyond 18 August 2020 and compare with data up to 6 January 2021 in figure 2c,d. We see that the fit is good until around the end of September 2020. We discuss how to improve this fit in appendix B where we also discuss comparisons with social mobility data. We observe the impact of the disease on total cost (2.8) by simulating the full model (A 1) and varying the critical threshold at which people social distance (M c ) and the critical cost before social relaxation begins (C c ). We consider 1/4, 1/2, 2 and 4 times the base values given in table 1. The value for k c from data fitting is already quite extreme and we do not vary this. We plot heat maps for the total cost C T in figure 3 for different weights \u03c9 with the maps coloured relative to the maximal and minimal costs. We compute H \u221e by simulating the model with parameters in table 1 and taking \u03bc max = 0. We take C \u221e as the highest cost that emerges from all of the simulations. We note that \u03c9 = 0 is just the relaxation cost C given by (2.5) scaled by C \u221e while \u03c9 = 1 is just the overburden health cost H given by (2.7) scaled by H \u221e . Reducing M c means that people require less active cases before triggering their social distance behaviour. If we denote this behaviour as vigilance then smaller values of M c lead to increased vigilance. Therefore, in figure 3, vigilance increases from bottom to top as M c decreases. C c increases from left to right, which corresponds to a higher tolerance for social distancing meaning that people delay their relaxation behaviour. We associate this to increased spending as people can absorb more cost.",

This changes when \u03c9 approaches 1, where increasing C c can decrease total cost. This is also intuitive because when \u03c9 = 1 there is no contribution of social distancing to the total cost, but the advantage that people are staying home and not getting sick. Therefore, encouraging that behaviour only leads to better outcomes. These two different behaviours suggest that there is a value of \u03c9 where both increasing and decreasing C c may lead to increased total costs. Indeed this phenomenon can be observed in figure 3a where the optimal spending occurs at figure 3 which is that increasing vigilance (smaller M c ) increases total cost. The only exception to this is in figure 3f when C c \u00bc 4C \u00c3 c and the minimum total cost occurs when M c \u00bc M \u00c3 c . To understand this result, we focus on the case \u03c9 = 1 where only the overburden health cost is considered. First consider C c \u00bc C \u00c3 c =4 and M c \u00bc M \u00c3 c . As vigilance increases, we expect that maximum active case load to decrease as people are social distancing with greater frequency. We see that this is indeed the case in figure 4a as we change from M \u00c3 c to M \u00c3 c =2. However, we also see that the duration of the epidemic straining healthcare resources is longer and the small decrease in peak is not enough to overcome this duration. We contrast this case to when C c \u00bc 4C \u00c3 c and a minimum overburden healthcare cost is observed at M c \u00bc M \u00c3 c . The active case load is plotted in figure 4b for 2M \u00c3 c , M \u00c3 c , and M \u00c3 c =2. Increasing vigilance from 2M \u00c3 c to M \u00c3 c decreases the peak and increases the duration. However, unlike the case in figure 4b , the depression is significant enough to cause an overall decrease in total cost. However, as vigilance is increased further to M \u00c3 c =2, the peak increases and duration decreases leading to an increase in cost. The non-intuitive result that higher vigilance leads to worse outcomes can be explained by isolation fatigue. A higher vigilance causes people to royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos R. Soc. Open Sci. 8: 201770 enter isolation too early. Once they hit a certain cost threshold they relax back to their regular social habits and then cannot sustain further isolation when the second wave of the pandemic arrives.",

However, as demonstrated in figure 3 , increasing vigilance can also lead to H/H \u221e tending to 1. This suggests that for every spending level, C c , there is an optimal social distancing M c to minimize the overburden health cost. Indeed, this is the case as demonstrated in figure 5 for the case \u03c9 = 1 and C c \u00bc C \u00c3 c =4 where we report the critical number of active cases to isolate, M c as a percentage of the population N. The value M \u00c3 c is indicated by the black line and demonstrates that based on the data from Ontario, social distancing vigilance was initially too severe. This is a very important policy result since if isolation is too vigilant then the fatigue from isolation cost has a very negative impact long term. This result can easily be extended to other regions by using different parameters.",

It can be seen that decreasing vigilance causes a more uniform accumulation of cases while increasing relaxation cost delays the peak of infection.

This model is likely to be appropriate for regions that have a strong aversion to social distancing. For other regions, it is likely that relaxation will be a function of cost and active cases as people will prioritize their health in a sustained outbreak and thus not want to relax if case numbers are sufficiently large. If we refer to the rate in (2.6) as \u03bd 0 then we propose modifying \u03bd to where \u03b7 is a concern factor and is the number of critical cases M c that stops social relaxation regardless of cost. Implementing this change allows for secondary infection peaks as evidenced in figure 7 where we use parameters in table 1 and arbitrarily take \u03b7 = 1/2 for figure 7a and \u03b7 = 1/5 for figure 7b. It is important to note that these changes do not impact the initial peak fitted to data in figure 2 and only alter future projections. Furthermore, as of January 2021, Ontario is still in the midst of its first secondary peak. For these reasons, it is difficult to estimate \u03b7 as several peaks will need to have occurred.",

This is because the multi-secondary outbreaks caused by reducing relaxation with high active cases extends the duration of the epidemic which only increases the cumulative cost. The high impact of this is noticed as well with C \u221e = 230 days for figure 3, while C \u221e = 614 days for figure 8 .

We use data from [15] for the 161 days between 10 March and 18 August 2020 on active and total cases to elucidate some key parameters. To do this, we solve our model (A 1) with the parameters in table 1 excluding k c , k 0 , M c , M 0 , \u03c1 A and \u03c1 S which we fit to the data. We run our model for 161 days using an initial condition that 0.02% of the population was initially infected with the remaining 99.98% being symptomatic. The actual number of people with COVID-19 is a matter of speculation and the arbitrary choice of the initial value will affect the fitting parameters, particularly the testing rates which are intimately linked. We do not partition any of the initial infected population into symptomatic or asymptomatic also due to the lack of clarity on true numbers. To help constrain the model, we take k 0 = 4k c so that the doubling rate has to double twice to trigger the half-maximal social distancing. We also take M 0 = 2M c so that the number of active cases need to double to trigger the half-maximal social distancing rate. Finally, since we assume that symptomatic people are more likely to get tested than asymptomatic people we take \u03c1 S = 4\u03c1 A . These constraints should not be too restricting, probably impacting the fitted values of the remaining free variables k c , M c and \u03c1 A .",

One possible explanation for slower growth than we initially anticipated is that we have assumed a static parameter set.

We used table 1 for the fixed parameters and as mean values for the varying parameters, each distributed uniformly between maximum and minimum values. We used the Latin hypercube sampling technique with 10 000 iterations and a Spearman partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) to measure monotonicity. We tested the sensitivity to the cumulative infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic), susceptibles, peak time for the outbreak, and the value at the peak of the outbreak. We plot the results in figure 12 The most significant parameter is the recovery rate \u03b3 (assumed the same for both classes) which seemingly has inverse behaviour to what is expected. That is, an increase in the recovery rate seems to cause more people to become sick. This is because the basic reproduction number is fixed at 2.4 and therefore changing \u03b3 effectively changes the transmission \u03b2 making a higher recovery rate lead to a more transmissible disease. Aside from this, the most significant parameters unsurprisingly are the testing rates \u03c1 S and \u03c1 A as well as the symptomatic proportion q. This supports the importance of testing and social distancing. Interestingly, there is not much sensitivity to the peak time and value of the outbreak confirming the need for longterm planning regarding vaccination and hospital resource management.",
