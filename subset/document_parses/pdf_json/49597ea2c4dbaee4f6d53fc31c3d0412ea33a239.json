Mortality was assessed using binomial logistic regression, controlling for three subsets of demographic variables. Including all available variables resulted in overfitting due to collinearity as determined by variance inflation factors (\"vif\" function from the car package in R). Univariate logistic regression (Table 1 ) was then performed on each independent variable, and variables with a p value of less than 0.25 (Hosmer DW, Lemeshow S, Sturdivant) were selected for inclusion in a multinomial logistic regression termed Model 1a. Patients with missing data were omitted from the models. Multicollinearity was evaluated using the \"alias\" function from the stats package in R. Given that many patients did not have labs drawn for CRP, Ferritin, or D-Dimer, Model 1b was a multinomial logistic regression which omitted these variables from the model to increase patient sample size. Our team also wanted to evaluate mortality within 96 hours of admission. This stemmed from the belief that laboratory values and SIRS criteria in the ED may better control for severity of disease as it related to mortality earlier in the hospitalization. Model 2a was a multiple binomial logistic regression which evaluated mortality within 96 hours of admission. Variables were selected on a basis of univariate analysis again, and patients with missing observations were omitted from the final model. Model 2b was also a multiple binomial logistic regression which evaluated mortality within 96 hours, but omitted ferritin and d-dimer to increase sample size.",

When propensity score matching using the demographic variables from Model 1a and subsequent binomial logistic regression was repeated for all patients who presented with a low SIRS score (0-1), those treated with hydroxychloroquine had an increased risk of mortality compared to those who were not given hydroxychloroquine (OR 4.23, CI 1.633 to 12.07, n = 94).

Initially during the crisis, intubation was used readily to manage severely hypoxic patients along with those in rapid respiratory decline. In April, the hospital developed and trained through medical simulation a highly skilled Critical Airway Team consisting of Anesthesiologists, Emergency Physicians, ICU Physicians and Respiratory Therapists [13] . This team managed over 80% of the intubations in the hospital and developed a higher threshold for intubation across the institution with the goal of increased utilization of other modalities for hypoxic patients including high flow nasal cannula and BiPAP. Over time, we were able to introduce less invasive methods for respiration [14] [15] [16] , leading to fewer intubations which may have led to an improved chance for survival. For patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, we observed that converting to tracheostomy when feasible, was associated with improved clinical outcomes, such as decreased sedative use, earlier participation in physical therapy, improved odds of ventilator liberation, and better allocation of resources [17, 18] . The formation of specialized proning teams and tracheostomy teams was developed over the course of the surge, leading to more efficient procedural care.",
