Pulsatile flow impacts greatly on organ function and microcirculation, however, the effects of pulsatile flow on hemodynamics and inflammatory responses during ECMO are unknown. An in vivo study was launched aiming at comparing the two perfusion modes in ECMO. Methods: Fourteen beagles were randomly allocated into two groups: the pulsatile group (n=7) and the non-pulsatile group (n=7). ECMO was conducted using the i-Cor system for 24 hours. Hemodynamic parameters including surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE), energy equivalent pressure (EEP), oxygenator pressure drop (OPD), and circuit pressure drop (CPD) were monitored. To assess inflammatory responses during ECMO, levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, IL-8, and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) were measured. Results: EEP and SHE were markedly higher in pulsatile circuits when compared with the conventional circuits. Between-group differences in both OPD and CPD reached statistical significance. Significant decreases in TNF-\u03b1 were seen in animals treated with pulsatile flows at 2 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours as well as a decrease in IL-1\u03b2 at 24 hours during ECMO. The TGF-\u03b21 levels were significantly higher in pulsatile circuits from 2 hours to 24 hours. The changes in IL-6 and IL-8 levels were insignificant. Conclusion: The modification of pulsatility in ECMO generates more hemodynamic energies and attenuates inflammatory responses as compared to the conventional non-pulsatile ECMO.",

            "text": "COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the end of 2019, is still a worldwide pandemic and has infected more than 11 billion people. Most COVID-19 patients manifest moderate symptoms and recover rapidly, however, approximately 14% of COVID-19 patients develop severe respiratory failure, 1 which requires mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, with relatively high mortality. 2 ECMO serves as a life-supporting method and is essentially important in managing those lethal COVID-19 cases, 3 yet the overall survival rate for extracorporeal life support progresses slowly over the years. 4 One important reason for this tardiness is the imperfection of ECMO components, for which technical optimization is imperative. Flow pattern (pulsatile or non-pulsatile) may influence greatly on vital organ function during mechanical circulatory support. 5, 6 It has been reported that pulsatile perfusion during extracorporeal circulation lowers the rate of in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing open-heart surgeries as compared with non-pulsatile perfusion. 7 It has been broadly acknowledged that pulsatile flow in mechanical circulatory support offers biomimetic hemodynamic energy to more effectively maintain microcirculation, 8 like energy equivalent pressure (EEP) and surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE). 9 Moreover, studies on tissue microcirculation have confirmed that pulsatile flow alleviates systemic inflammatory responses, 5 and we had proved previously that pulsatile perfusion also improves vascular oxidative status as it upregulates the expression of nitric oxide. 9 However, there is no pulsatile ECMO device feasible for patients and how pulsatile flow affects inflammatory responses during ECMO remains unknown.",

Switching of pulsatile or non-pulsatile flow can be done by the i-Cor system with a fixed blood flow rate. Adjustment of the pump rotation speed can be triggered by the electrocardiogram (ECG), according to which pulsatile flows were running in a parallel manner (1:1) on condition that heart rates stayed below 100 beats/min.

A cervical incision was made, with the right internal jugular vein (RIJV) and right common carotid artery (RCCA) carefully dissected. An initial bolus (100 U/kg) of unfractionated heparin was used before cannulation. An activated clotting time (ACT) from 180 to 240 seconds was held and regularly supervised in each experimental circuit. The maintenance dose of heparin was 10 to 50 U/kg/hour. We smoothly cannulated the RCCA and RIJV with the 6-French (Fr) and 8-Fr cannulas (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), respectively. To achieve a cardiac output above 80 mL/kg/min, all venous-arterial (V-A) ECMO circuits were maintained with a pump flow rate ranging from 80 to 100 mL/kg/min and with a pump speed from 2500 to 3000 RPM during the experiment.

We have shown that pulsatility generates more hemodynamic energies and alleviates inflammatory responses during ECMO. The pulsatile ECMO has apparent benefits in hemodynamics in that pulsatility provides extra-energy effects and pulse stimulus. The initiation of ECMO is relevant to prompt activation of inflammatory responses. Hence, the establishment of ECMO in critically ill COVID-19 patients may complicate the situation of septic shock and multiple organ failure, for which hyperinflammatory state and evident elevation of cytokines are common. [14] [15] [16] The mechanisms for ECMOinduced inflammation involve the blood-device interaction, triggering the immune system. Cytokines and chemokines are all crucial to this pathophysiology and are associated with clinical outcomes during ECMO. 17, 18 On the other hand, microcirculatory malperfusion by the non-physiologic flow also results in the accumulation of inflammatory mediators. Our findings are consistent with other studies, 19, 20 and the pulsatile circuits had constantly higher EEPs and SHEs, which are vital to the microcirculatory perfusion. With the augmentation for microcirculation perfusion, the hyperinflammatory state is thus improved. Using an ex-vivo model, Wang et al 21 found no alterations were presented regarding pro-inflammatory cytokines among the investigated group. An explanation for these conflicting results is the huge disparities between interactions on the \"silent\" blood components and impacts on the \"active\" immune system in different investigated models.",

Focusing on inflammatory responses related to ECMO, we used relatively healthy animals rather than animals with compromised heart or lung function, which might introduce biases. Other investigators also revealed that ECMO under pulsatile mode reduces priming volume and is associated with lower risks for tubing rupture, spallation, leakage, and embolization. 10 The provision of pulsatility in the centrifugal pump and roller pump is typically difficult. Relatively few diagonal pumps are available. The i-Cor system was overall friendly to use. It had no difficulty in priming and switched conveniently between the continuous and pulsatile flow. Of note, a constant flow rate is recommended to keep the same flow rate if you switch continuous flow to pulsatile flow. Pressures at the outlet should be supervised and alerts should be taken for clots, leakage, and cannula kinking or migration. Cannulas must be secured to avoid bleeding around the insertion site, particularly in the pulsatile flow which slight shaking of the cannula will frequently take place. If tachycardia (heart rate above 150 beats/minute) is confronted, switching the 1:1 assisting mode to 1:2 will bring about better pulsatility, similar to the IABP protocols. Other recent examples that generate pulsatility for ECMO were the Medos Deltastream DP3 system (Medos Medizintechnik AG, USA) 10 and the K-Beat system designed by Inamori's group. 22 The in vivo nature of our work surely presents certain limitations. Only healthy animals on ECMO for a relatively short duration were investigated. Hence, neither changes in cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage, nor lung histological injuries were evaluated. Given the relatively small body weight of the experimental animals to model the pathophysiology of ECMO in infants, our data should still be validated in larger animal models. The pathophysiology of inflammation is a complicated process, involving an army of cytokines and chemokines, however, only a limited number of these biomarkers were measured in the present study. The investigators were non-blinded to the presence of pulsatility in this study. All these limitations prevent us from modeling inflammatory changes in real-world practice. Nevertheless, the hemodynamics, as well as ECMO-induced inflammation is easily neglected by clinicians, hence, translational investigations from bench to bedside are required.",

The inflammation activation is also closely interrelated with other pathophysiological processes like endothelial activation, coagulation, trauma, and so on. How pulsatility impacts these pathophysiological processes is still unclear and merits further investigations. Overall, future ECMO design will require an option of pulsatility. Either patients with cardiogenic shock or patients with severe COVID-19 usually receive ECMO for weeks or even months, a device allowing for more effective microcirculatory perfusion with less inflammatory responses is therefore optimal. These are crucial as ECMO techniques progress and become especially imperative amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",
