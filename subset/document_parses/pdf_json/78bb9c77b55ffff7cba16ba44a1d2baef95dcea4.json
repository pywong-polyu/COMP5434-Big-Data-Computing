However, no research has focused on the geodemographic classification of the most susceptible communities to COVID-19. In this cross-sectional ecological study, we used local fuzzy geographically-weighted clustering to create the socioeconomic profile of the US counties in relation to COVID-19 death rates. We demonstrate that living in a county which has households with lower income, people with a lack of health insurance, a high African-American percentage, and lower education level, lead to 27.12% higher COVID-19 death rates than the national median, and 72.56% higher compared to the least vulnerable counties. Compared to counties with a high COVID-19 death rate, counties with a low COVID-19 death rate have 44.90% higher annual median household income and nearly double house worth (89.51% more). Results show that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not universal and that the minoritised and impoverished populations suffer more. Our analysis can effectively pinpoint the most vulnerable counties and importantly allows for understanding the socioeconomic context in which tailored interventions can be applied to mitigate COVID-19 deaths.",

The weathering hypothesis states that chronic exposure to social and economic disadvantage leads to a decline in physical health outcomes (Forde et al., 2019) . The mortality of COVID-19 depends on the social determinants of health, such as age, race, occupation, poverty, air quality, lack of education, or unequal access to health facilities (Quan et al., 2021) . For example, Hispanic and Black population (Saini et al., 2021; , high population density (Desmet et al., 2020) , median household income (Mollalo et al., 2020) , low education level, poverty level (Hawkins et al., 2020) , number of intensive unit care beds (Andersen et al., 2021) and air quality (Coccia, 2020c) are associated with higher COVID-19 fatalities. A large number of studies adopt mainly regression analysis and spatial regression modelling to understand the structural drivers behind COVID-19 deaths variances and the observed socioeconomic disparities. However, understanding inequalities in the context of COVID-19 requires not only modelling studies that identify the socioeconomic drivers of COVID-19 deaths, but also the geodemographic characteristics of the most susceptible communities. Such understanding is essential for analysing the complex interplay of space, demographics, socioeconomic and health factors on COVID-19 mortality.",

Geodemographic analysis explores over-, or under-represented demographic, consumption, behavioural, or health patterns across the various neighbourhood types, based on the hypothesis that people residing close together are more likely to be similar than those living further away (Grekousis and Fotis, 2012; Singleton et al., 2016; Long et al., 2019 , p. 2019 , Grubesic and Durbin, 2020 . Thereupon, policies applied can be more beneficial if targeted to specific subgroups instead of a general implementation at a more regional scale. For example, policies against epidemic spread, smoking, chronic lack of nutritious food, education inequality, or unemployment would be more efficient if applied targeted, through geodemographic analysis, to the subdistricts where people residing are more in need (Grekousis et al., 2018; Grekousis, 2018; Xiang et al., 2018) .",

This study fills this gap and proposes a local-level analysis of COVID-19 through geodemographic segmentation for the conterminous US during the first year of the pandemic (February 6, 2020 to February 5, 2021). Instead of building predictive models, or calculating vulnerability indices, as most previous studies do, we follow a different approach. We conduct geodemographic segmentation (through Local Fuzzy Geographically Weighted Clustering method), which groups US counties based on their health, socioeconomic, and demographic compositions. Counties with similar traits are grouped together and share a common profile, while counties with divergent characteristics are separated. The research assumption is that socioeconomic and health inequalities may exist in the context of the COVID-19 burden. For this reason, we statistically test (through the Mann-Whitney U test) whether community structure may underlie county-level variations of COVID-19 mortality across the US.",

On the contrary, due to complexity and statistical constraints (i.e. multicollinearity), regression analysis and spatial regression modelling studies tend to finally retain only a small fraction of the original dataset and report results, most of the time for a handful of independent variables (Andersen et al., 2021; Mollalo et al., 2020) .

It allows each spatial entity to belong to every cluster with a varying membership value (Grekousis et al., 2011; Betti et al., 2018) , avoiding the binary assignment of an object to a single group (when using non-fuzzy clustering methods). In crisp clustering, there is information loss because a binary assignment does not accurately reflect reality. For example, in geodemographic analysis, a spatial entity such as a census tract or a zip code would belong to one, and only one, cluster. In practice, this would mean that the entire population of this spatial entity should be described in a single way (i.e., affluent), which is an exaggeration. For spatial entities having a large population size, as in counties, fuzzy clustering is more detailed than non-fuzzy methods. The reason is that we do not aggregate our results on the basis of only one label, thus avoiding the statistical problem of ecological fallacy, and we delineate a better profile of each spatial entity.",

However, the fuzzy c-means algorithm does not take into account any geographical aspects, which is an important drawback when segmenting spatial data. The LFGWC overcomes the absence of a spatial framework by integrating geography into the fuzzy c-means algorithm. To do so, the LFGWC updates the membership value of each spatial entity for the assigned cluster, according to the membership values of the entities within its neighbourhood. Spatial weights are created using either a spatial interaction model or distance decay functions.",

Three significance levels for \u03b1 (0.05, 0.01, and 0.001) were selected and if the p-values resulting from the test were to be less than \u03b1, then there would be compelling evidence to reject the hypothesis and conclude that the distributions compared are statistically significant different. For the above example, this would conclude that clusters with high COVID-19 death rates do not share common characteristics (at least for some variables) with clusters with low or average death rates.

To depict fuzzy clustering results, we used two methods. First, we created a map where each county is assigned to the cluster with the highest membership value. From the policy perspective this is a straight-forward way to communicate the clustering results. Second, we depicted the maximum membership value per county. Counties with high maximum values are typical for their clusters. On the other hand, areas with low maximum values are not that typical for their cluster and share common characteristics with one or more other clusters, something that allows for a deeper analysis. More importantly, by depicting the varying membership values in GIS maps and by applying spatial autocorrelation statistical methods, spatial heterogeneity or spatial dependence can be traced (Grekousis and Gialis, 2019) .",

To compare the groups, we plotted the standardised cluster centres over the boxplots. The coloured dots refer to the standardised cluster centres of each group per variable. Dots of the same colour belong to the same group/ cluster. The further apart the groups' standardised centres lie, the more the separation among the clusters and the better the clustering scheme. We observe that the three groups are well separated for all variables. The only exception is for the population density variable which does not differentiate across the three groups. We notice that Group 1 (High) has higher cluster centres than the 75th quartile (Q3) for most of the variables, Group 2 (Moderate) cluster centres fluctuate around the median values, and Group 3 (Low) cluster centres lie below the median values for the majority of the variables (Fig. 1) .",

Annual median household income is 30.99% lower in High group counties (42,216 US dollars) compared to Low group counties (61,173 US dollars). This potentially indicates that income inequality has an impact on COVID-19 death rates as those with lower income are likely to suffer from higher COVID-19 death rates. An even larger inequality is observed for housing value, with the Low group having houses worth on median values 186,100 US dollars, almost double (89.51% more) the value of houses in the High group counties (98,200 US dollars).

For example, if an intervention should be implemented to those more vulnerable then we could start with populations in the High group that have the highest membership values, indicating counties more typical to High groups and thus more prone to higher COVID-19 death rates. For counties that may share characteristics from two groups, policy implementations can be also adjusted to reflect this case.",

High and Low groups have statistically significant different median values and evident inequalities across all variables. Compared to the national median, the High group counties have on median values 3.3 times higher percentage of African-American population which is consistent with studies showing that COVID-19 mortality disproportionately affects the Black population in the US (Golestaneh et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020; Prata et al., 2021; Rogers et al., 2020) . Moreover, the High group counties have on median values 12.17% higher percentage of people with a lower education level, and 24.28% higher percentage of people working in the manufacturing sector. Households in counties of the High group get 22.80% less annual income than the national median, and 30.99% less than Low group. A more striking inequality is that the percentage of the population with a lack of health insurance is nearly 50% higher in the High group than the Low group. This finding is potentially related to the population's deteriorated health condition in this group compared to the other groups. People living in High group counties have 20%-58% higher population percentages with underlying health conditions than the Low group. This inequality in comorbidities may explain the large difference in COVID-19 death rates compared to the Low group. Air pollution is higher in High group with a nearly 30% higher PM2.5 value. A significant finding is that High group counties are concentrated in the South region, with a 60.77% of the region's counties being labelled as High. This is consistent with other works who showed that the Southeast is marked by high levels of pre-existing health conditions and socio-ecological vulnerability to COVID-19 (Snyder et al., 2020) .",

This finding should not drive us to the wrong conclusion that social and economic interaction lead to lower COVID-19 death rates. On the contrary, COVID-19 is highly contagious and for this reason, social distancing is implemented as a first hinder to its spread. The reason that the non-MSAs counties have higher COVID-19 death rates, although interactions are less, can be partially attributed to the fact that 40.04% of them belong to the High group which has on median values nearly 50% higher percentage of people lacking health insurance than the Low group, and in general, population with deteriorated health (higher values in underlying health conditions) than the Moderate and the Low group.

These population groups cannot easily adapt to preventive measures such as isolation. Due to socioeconomic status (i.e. having lower income and higher unemployment), and working environment (i.e. working in the manufacturing sector), they are more exposed to infection. Moreover, comorbidities often associated with specific population groups create a complex, dynamic context that urges special attention from governments (Qeadan et al., 2021) . For instance, systematic inequalities and discrepancies in socioeconomic status are linked to higher incidence of asthma, hypertension, and obesity, which have been linked in turn to higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (Singu et al., 2020) . Here, we show that counties of the High group have up to nearly 60% higher population percentages with comorbidities than the Low group (i.e. pulmonary disease 58.33% higher, diabetes 47.13% higher, heart disease mortality 45.45% higher, high blood pressure 31.56% higher, than the Low group). Because the above conditions exert a disproportionate burden on disadvantaged populations and heighten the risk for individuals being infected with SARS-CoV-2, there is a growing need for governments to effectively allocate resources to the most vulnerable communities.",

Another problem is that COIVD-19 deaths may be underreported due to a missed COVID-19 death diagnosis (for example, people dying at home and not tested for COVID-19). On the other hand, presumed COVID-19 diagnosis for individuals who actually died from other causes may inflate COVID-19 deaths (Fineberg, 2020) . Instead of the confirmed COVID-19 deaths data, excess mortality could be used to assess the pandemic's total impact on mortality (Roser et al., 2020) . However, by the time this research was conducted (February 2021), no official estimation of excess deaths for 2020 existed at the county level for the US. In the absence of excess deaths data at the county level, and similar to others (Andersen et al., 2020; Stokes et al., 2020) , we rely on the confirmed COVID-19 deaths registered by each county.",

Future research should focus on smaller geographical areas allowing for better assessing the community traits related to increased risk for COVID-19 death. Similar to others (Snyder et al., 2020) , we did not take into account the different statewide shelter-in-place or lockdown policies or other political factors. Such policies/factors may positively or negatively affect COVID-19 deaths depending on their duration and the epidemic stage that they were implemented, something that has been already reported at the country level in many studies (Askitas et al., 2021) . However, isolating these effects at the county level would be laborious and beyond the scope of this research. To address this limitation, we aggregate results to refer to the end of the first year of the pandemic, a time when most of the citizens were well informed about COVID-19 health threats. Even though non-pharmaceutical interventions varied a lot across states (Mollalo et al., 2020) , we anticipate that people practiced social distancing not only because they were ordered but mainly because they were influenced by the public sentiment of protection against the virus. Future research should further study this aspect.",

As such, communities are vulnerable for different reasons, and therefore tailor-made interventions should be prioritised based on the specific profile of each area. The use of geodemographic profiles in COVID-19 analysis, as proposed in this study, enhances our understanding of higher COVID-19 fatality when socioeconomic and health inequalities are evident across counties. Policy-wise, the take-home message of this study is that the COVID-19 death rates depend on a complex interplay of demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors. For this reason, policymakers and health professionals need to exercise considerable caution when they design public interventions so that they integrate these discrepancies in their policies. Our findings convey and confirm an important message that the most socially vulnerable bear a disproportionate burden on deaths and this should be of interest to those that draw health-related policies worldwide.",
