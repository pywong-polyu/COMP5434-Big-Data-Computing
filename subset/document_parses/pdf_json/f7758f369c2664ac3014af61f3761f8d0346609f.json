Additional data support the concept that diabetes and other related diseases (hypertension and cardiovascular diseases) are the most common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients [3, 4] . It has also been proposed that COVID-19 is likely associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes [5] . This motivated us to conduct a study to explore the incidence of diabetes in hospitalized COVID-19 cases.",

Consistent with our observation, it has been reported that hyperglycemia occurred in 33.2% of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization, and the proportion was higher in severe cases compared to nonsevere cases (45.4 vs. 21.5%) [5] . Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may reduce insulin secretion through its effects on pancreatic \u03b2-cell function [7, 8] . The SARS-CoV-2 receptor (ACE2: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) has been shown to be expressed by pancreatic cells, as well as other metabolic organs and tissues (for instance, adipose tissue, intestine and kidneys). Therefore, the virus may cause multidirectional changes in glucose metabolism that could complicate pre-existing diabetes or lead to the development of hyperglycemia in non-diabetic patients [9] . Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that COVID-19 patients are markedly characterized by elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines; for instance, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, interferongamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) [10, 11] . Inflammation due to high production of cytokines may lead to insulin resistance and may impair insulin production by pancreatic \u03b2-cell [8] .",

More importantly, a global estimate revealed that 45.8% of all adult diabetes cases were undiagnosed, and almost a similar proportion was reported in Iraq (47.05%) [13] . Therefore, although the patients of this study did not have a clinical history of diabetes, they may represent undiagnosed cases especially if we consider their overweight/obese status. Taken together, these data suggest that diabetes may be considered a risk factor for COVID-19, or the infection may put non-diabetic patients at risk for developing diabetes.
