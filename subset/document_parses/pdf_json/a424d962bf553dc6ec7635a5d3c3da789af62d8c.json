Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seems to have an affinity for the pancreas as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is expressed in the pancreas, both in the exocrine glands and islet cells [8] . Such expression has been shown to be higher in the pancreas than in the lungs [8] . Thus, pancreatic injury can result from the direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 mediated by its local replication [3] . Another putative mechanism involves dysregulated immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 that targets pancreas in addition to the lungs and kidneys causing AP besides organ failure [3] . However, organ failure can also occur in AP secondary to other causes (e.g. biliary pancreatitis) in a patient with COVID-19 who might otherwise be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Such presentation can be encountered more commonly in near future with the increasing prevalence of COVID-19. Lastly, AP can also result from drug-induced injury either directly (e.g. use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) or glucocorticoids) [3, 8] or indirectly (through tocilizumab-induced hypertriglyceridemia) [9] .",

Although the possibility of viral load in pancreatic necrotic tissue and fluid is uncertain, interventions required to manage local complications (acute necrotic collections or walled off necrosis), whether percutaneous, endoscopic, or minimally invasive (retroperitoneal/transperitoneal), might expose the health care workers to SARS-CoV-2, more so with high-risk aerosol generating procedures like endoscopic or minimally invasive drainage / necrosectomy including video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement (VARD).
