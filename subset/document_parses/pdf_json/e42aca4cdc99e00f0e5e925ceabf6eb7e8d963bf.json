Cytokine storm is a major cause of new coronavirus death. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of antiviral drug arbidol on cytokine storm and pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we use a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and a mouse model of fecal dilution-induced sepsis to evaluate the effects of arbidol on pulmonary fibrosis and cytokine storm. The results showed that arbidol significantly reduced the area of pulmonary fibrosis and improved lung function (reduced inspiratory resistance, lung dynamic compliance and forced vital capacity increased). Treatment with arbidol promoted reduced sepsis severity 48 h after sepsis induction, based on weight, murine sepsis score and survival rate. Arbidol observably alleviates inflammatory infiltrates and injury in the lungs and liver. Finally, we also found that arbidol reduced serum levels of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 induced by fecal dilution. In conclusion, our results indicate that arbidol can alleviate the severity of pulmonary fibrosis and sepsis, and provide some reference for the treatment of cytokine storm and sequelae of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Many critically ill patients and deceased patients have no serious clinical manifestations in the early stage of the virus infection, and only show mild fever, cough and other physical discomfort, but their bodily condition suddenly deteriorated during the treatment and turned into severe patients. Numerous severe COVID-19 patients will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure, which will eventually lead to death (Azkur et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . Dina Ragab and Harapan et al. (Harapan et al., 2020; Ragab et al., 2020) suggest that mortality in patients is related to the \"cytokine storm\" caused by the virus. Excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines lead to ARDS aggravation and extensive tissue damage, leading to multiple organ failure and death. In the case of COVID-19, clinical studies have concluded that the rapid deterioration of COVID-19 patients is closely related to the outbreak of cytokine storms in the body. Cytokine storm is an important cause of death. In addition, cytokine storms are a major cause of death in patients with SARS, MERS, and influenza (Liu et al., 2016; Channappanavar and Perlman, 2017; Rat et al., 2020) . Therefore, inhibiting cytokine storms can effectively prevent death in COVID-19 patients. Sepsis refers to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection (Butler, 2015; Schlapbach et al., 2015) . Sepsis, with its rapid development and high fatality rate, has always been one of the major difficulties in the study of acute illness . The severity of sepsis infection is caused by a cascade reaction, which makes the automatic amplification of cytokines, and finally leads to a cytokine storm (Chousterman et al., 2017) . Mouse models of sepsis are usually study cytokine storms. Song et al. (Qiu et al., 2019) found that regulatory T cells lacking Gpr174 reduced cytokine storms in septic mice. Tang et al. (Yao et al., 2017) revealed that \u03b1-lactose can reduce the cytokine storm by preventing TIM-3 signal transduction, thereby improving the survival rate of septic mice. Therefore, exploring the cytokine storm in sepsis mice has partial reference significance for the clinical cytokine storm.",

At present, the familiar coronaviruses include SARS coronavirus, MERS and Novel Coronavirus. The study found that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (PF) was the most important cause of high mortality and low quality of life in patients infected with SARS coronavirus (Venkataraman and Frieman, 2017) . Recently, through retrospective analysis of lung computed tomography imaging of 50 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. It was found that the formation of fibrous streaks during rehabilitation . A metaanalysis found that viral infections increase the risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and COVID-19 patients in the recovery period may cause additional complications due to PF (Sheng et al., 2020; Taz et al., 2020) . Therefore, pulmonary fibrosis is likely to be one of the major complications in COVID-19 patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nintedanib and pirfenidone to inhibit the progression of PF (Raghu et al., 2015) . They can only alleviate the decline in lung function and cannot reverse the fibrosis that has formed (Holtze et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is very necessary to develop novel therapies for the treatment of PF and pay attention to the sequelae of SARS-COV-2 pulmonary fibrosis.",

However, a retrospective study in a clinical trial found that in 220 non-emergency COVID 19 patients in Wuhan Dongxihu Hospital, China, arbidol could accelerate the fever recovery and virus clearance of respiratory specimens, especially in men, and also help shorten the length of hospital stay, And no obvious adverse reactions (Gao et al., 2020) . However, the effect of arbidol on the cytokine storm and PF produced in patients with COVID-19 has not been reported.",

            "text": "A single tracheal instillation of bleomycin in rodents is a widely used model for studying the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis and evaluating the effects of anti-fibrosis treatments (Kolb et al., 2020) . Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model was in the early inflammatory stage from 0 to 7 days, and changed to fibrosis after 7 days (Plantier et al., 2018) . This induction mode makes the timing of anti-pulmonary fibrosis treatment very important. Therefore, in order to accurately evaluate the anti-fibrosis effect of the drug, the intervention should be after 7 days without affecting the early inflammation. In this study, seven days after bleomycininduced mice, arbidol treatment was started. Hydroxyproline (HYP) is mainly found in animal collagen and can enhance the elasticity of connective tissue. The content of hydroxyproline in the tissue reflects the catabolism of collagen. Therefore, accurate determination of the content of hydroxyproline in lung tissue can be directly and effectively determine the degree of development of pulmonary fibrosis (Srivastava et al., 2016) . The results showed that arbidol could significantly reduce the area of fibrosis and the level of hydroxyproline in mouse lung tissue. Many types of lung function decline can affect the lower respiratory system, from the conducting trachea to the pulmonary vascular system. The clinical expression of pulmonary fibrosis is directly related to changes in lung function (Plantier et al., 2018) . By testing the lung function of mice, it was found that arbidol could reduce the Ri of mice and increase Cldyn and FVC, but had no obvious effect on Re. Of course, we will continue to conduct in-depth research on the efficacy and mechanism of arbidol against pulmonary fibrosis.",

            "text": "Harapan et al. pointed out that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an extremely active inflammatory response called cytokine storm, which subsequently leads to uncontrolled lung inflammation (Harapan et al., 2020) . Another study also pointed out that COVID-19 infection is accompanied by an aggressive inflammatory response that releases a large amount of proinflammatory cytokines. This event is called a \"cytokine storm\" and is closely related to the mortality of patients with COVID-19 (Ragab et al., 2020) . Sepsis, a complex disease, characterized by a host's dysfunctional response to infection that leads to lifethreatening multiorgan dysfunction (Dugar et al., 2020) . Studies have found that the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukins (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) increases, and promotes many immunopathological processes in sepsis, which are often referred to as \"cytokines storm\" (Ono et al., 2018; Hwang et al., 2020) . As the most common source of infection in patients with sepsis comes from the abdominal cavity, in recent years, the abdominal infection model has been gradually used as a commonly used animal model of sepsis. Animal models of fecal peritonitis have been widely used in sepsis research (Dyson et al., 2011; Rudiger et al., 2013; Jeger et al., 2017; Sulzbacher et al., 2020) . Since our laboratory cannot perform virus tests, in this study, we used fecal diluentinduced sepsis mice to simulate the cytokine storm symptoms of COVID-19 to a certain extent. The result revealed that arbidol notably attenuates fecal dilution -induced sepsis in mice. ELISA assay revealed that arbidol inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) in serum. Taken together, these data indicated that arbidol could inhibit the cytokine storm induced by fecal diluent in septic mice, and we hypothesized that arbidol may have a better inhibitory effect on cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.",
