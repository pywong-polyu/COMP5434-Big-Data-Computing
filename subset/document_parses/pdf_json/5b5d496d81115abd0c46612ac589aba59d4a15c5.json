            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that emerged in 2019 and rapidly spread across the world causing a deadly pandemic with tremendous social and economic costs. Healthcare systems worldwide are under great pressure, and there is urgent need for effective antiviral treatments. The only currently approved antiviral treatment for COVID-19 is remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral genome replication. SARS-CoV-2 proliferation relies on the enzymatic activities of the non-structural proteins (nsp), which makes them interesting targets for the development of new antiviral treatments. With the aim to identify novel SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we have purified the exoribonuclease/methyltransferase (nsp14) and its cofactor (nsp10) and developed biochemical assays compatible with high-throughput approaches to screen for exoribonuclease inhibitors. We have screened a library of over 5000 commercial compounds and identified patulin and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) as inhibitors of nsp14 exoribonuclease in vitro. We found that patulin and ATA inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a VERO E6 cell-culture model. These two new antiviral compounds will be valuable tools for further coronavirus research as well as potentially contributing to new therapeutic opportunities for COVID-19. genome of approximately 30 Kb that encodes multiple open reading frames (ORF) [17, 18]. However, ORF1a and ORF1b represent two-thirds of the genome alone, and encode the 16 non-structural proteins of the virus (nsp1 -nsp16) [17]. The nsps include the 9 known viral enzymatic activities, which are highly conserved among coronaviruses and of special interest for the development of novel antiviral treatments, because of their important roles in viral replication and lifecycle [19]. Among them, nsp14 protein is a bifunctional enzyme with an N-terminal 3' to 5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain and a C-terminal S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent N7-methyltransferase (MTase) domain [20-22]. The ExoN domain belongs to the DEDD superfamily, which contains RNA and DNA exonucleases from all kingdoms of life, including the proofreading domains of some E. coli DNA polymerases [23-25]. While the MTase activity of nsp14 does not require a cofactor, the exonuclease activity of nsp14 is stimulated by the cofactor nsp10 [23, 26].",

            "text": "It has been suggested that the exonuclease activity of nsp14 may act as a proofreader to reduce the mutation rate of the virus [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Considering that most RNA viruses possess small genomes and have high mutation rates, proofreading activity could be important to maintain the integrity of the unusually large RNA genomes of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with the hypothesis that nsp14 plays a role in proofreading during replication, it associates with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex formed by nsp12 and its cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 [34, 35] . Also, mutation of the ExoN domain of nsp14 in SARS-CoV-1 viruses resulted in viable viral progenies with high mutation rates [28, 33] . However, similar ExoN mutations led to inviable virus progenies in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the exonuclease activity of nsp14 could have other essential roles in viral replication in these viruses [36] . Furthermore, coronavirus nsp14 exonuclease activity has been proposed to reduce the host innate antiviral immune response by cleaving viral-associated double-stranded RNAs [37, 38] as well as to regulate viral genome recombination [39] . Thus, the exonuclease activity of nsp14 might be required for different aspects of viral genome replication and integrity and in other aspects of virus proliferation, making it an attractive target for the development of new antiviral treatments of COVID-19. Repurposing of previously characterised compounds for the treatment of novel diseases is a fast and efficient approach [40, 41] . Here, we have purified the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14/nsp10 exonuclease and screened a custom collection of previously characterised compounds with the aim to identify novel COVID-19 antivirals.",

To evaluate nsp14/10 exonuclease activity with the RiboGreen assay, we took the samples shown in Figure 1F and incubated them with RiboGreen.

We therefore wondered if direct fusion of nsp10 to nsp14 would generate a more active enzyme. A similar strategy was successful with the SARS-CoV-1 proteins nsp12/7/8, which purify as a more active polymerase complex when nsp7 and nsp8 are fused together with a short linker [34] . To test this, we expressed nsp14-linker-nsp10 (nsp14-10) and nsp10-linker-nsp14 (nsp10-14) fusion proteins in E. coli ( Figure 3A and 3B). The nsp10-14 fusion cleaved the Cy5-dsRNA substrate in both the gel and RiboGreen assays ( Figure 3C ). Titration of nsp10-14 fusion protein showed high exonuclease activity with as little as 1-3 nM of protein compared to about 200 nM needed for the nsp14/10 co-expressed complex ( Figure 3D ). The nsp14-10 fusion protein also showed high exonuclease activity ( Figure 3D ). To avoid any interference between Cy5 and RiboGreen, we then titrated the nsp10-14 fusion in the presence of an unlabelled version of the Cy5-dsRNA substrate (Figure 2A and Supplementary Table S4) , which resulted in exonuclease activity ( Figure 3E ) comparable to that observed with the Cy5 substrate ( Figure 3D ). Nsp14 is also an N7-guanine cap methyltransferase and the nsp10-14 fusion retains this methyltransferase activity (Supplementary Figure S2) .",

We then carried out a high-throughput screen to identify nsp14/10 exonuclease inhibitors from a custom library of over 5000 commercial compounds. The screen had a robust signal to noise ratio between positive and negative controls, and a mean Z' factor of 0.72, and we detected many compounds apparently able to reduce nsp14/10 exonuclease activity at both concentrations screened (Supplementary Figure S3C ). In the RiboGreen assay, fluorescence is highest at time zero of the exonuclease reaction, and cleavage of the substrate leads to reduced fluorescence signals ( Figure 2D or 3D as examples) . Thus, inhibition of exonuclease activity is expected to decrease the cleavage-dependent reduction in RiboGreen fluorescence. Based on this, to identify putative inhibitors of nsp14/10 exonuclease, we selected compounds that led to higher final fluorescence signals than control reactions. However, when we were validating these compounds, we found that many were auto-fluorescent in the wavelength range of RiboGreen fluorescence (Supplementary Figure S3D) . Because of this, we could not feasibly distinguish true hit compounds from auto-fluorescent false hits using this approach.",

For the new assay, we used an RNA duplex substrate with a 20-nucleotide 5' dU overhang, conjugated to a Cy3-quencher pair ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Table S4 ). Using this substrate, nucleolytic cleavage by nsp10-14 fusion protein released the Cy3 fluorophore strand from the quencher strand and produced fluorescent signal ( Figure 4A and 4B). When a DNA version of this substrate was used, only background levels of fluorescence were detected ( Figure 4B ). This indicated that, as expected, nsp10-14 is unable to cleave DNA substrates and that the fluorescence in reactions with the Cy3-dsRNA substrate is not due to unspecific factors such as temperature-dependent unwinding. When using this substrate, we were able to obtain kinetic data of the enzyme compared to the end-point information obtained when using our previous RiboGreen approach. We, thus, monitored fluorescence over time and titrated the substrate, which gave an estimated KM of 40 nM ( Figure 4C and 4D). The estimated KM was similar to our previous estimation using the RiboGreen assay (66 nM) (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B), and therefore we decided to perform this second screen using 50 nM of substrate, as we did in the first screen. At 50 nM of substrate, we assessed nuclease activity over a range of enzyme concentrations and chose to do the reactions in the screen for 10 minutes with 0.5 nM of nsp10-14 fusion protein ( Figure 4E ).",

We returned to the gel-based assay with the Cy5-dsRNA substrate for validation. The nsp10-14 fusion protein was incubated with the hit compounds for 10 minutes prior to substrate addition as in the screens, and the reactions were stopped at 5 min instead of the usual 30 min reactions, to allow for the visualization of both the full-length RNA strand and the cleaved products. Two compounds inhibited nsp10-14 exonuclease activity in a concentration-dependent manner at both 5 \u00b5M and 25 \u00b5M: patulin and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) ( Figure 5A ). We also tested whether patulin To determine how specific patulin and ATA are to nsp10-14, we tested whether they inhibited other nucleases such as RNase A and benzonase. We titrated RNase A and benzonase to select enzyme concentrations that allowed us to visualise both full-length RNA and cleaved products in gel-based assays after 5 min (Supplementary Figure S4B) . Patulin did not inhibit RNase A or benzonase up to 50 \u00b5M, suggesting that it is not a general nuclease inhibitor ( Figure 5C ). Despite the fact that ATA has been described as a general inhibitor of nucleases and other DNA binding enzymes [43] , we observed only minor inhibition of RNase A and benzonase at 50 \u00b5M ATA ( Figure 5D ). In contrast, we observed inhibition of nsp10-14 from 5 \u00b5M ATA, indicating that it inhibits nsp10-14 at lower concentrations than it inhibits RNase A and benzonase ( Figure 5D ). Patulin showed an IC50 of 1.8 \u00b5M (95% CI 1.6 -2.1 \u00b5M) and ATA showed an IC50 of 10.3 \u00b5M (95% CI 8.6 -12.1 \u00b5M) ( Figure 5E and 5F and Supplementary Figures S4E and S4F) .",

ExoN is essential in SARS-CoV-2 [36] , so patulin and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), the new inhibitors of nsp14/10 exonuclease activity identified here, represent new tools to acutely inhibit ExoN activity during viral growth, which should be valuable for understanding the role of nsp14/10 ExoN during the viral life cycle.

However, our results show that ATA inhibits nsp14/nsp10 exoribonuclease activity at much lower concentrations than the concentration needed to inhibit other nucleases such as RNase A and benzonase ( Figure 5D ), suggesting that ATA has specific activity towards SARS-CoV-2 nsp14/nsp10 compared to other nucleases. We cannot rule out the possibility that some of the antiviral activity of ATA is due to inhibition of other nucleases besides nsp14/10. ATA has been shown to inhibit replication of several other viruses including SARS-CoV-1 and Zika [52, 53] , and studies using cell culture and animal models have shown limited toxicity of ATA [53] [54] [55] . Further studies will be needed to understand the putative use of ATA for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment of COVID-19.",

            "text": "Patulin is a lactone mycotoxin produced by several species of Penicillium and Aspergillus, commonly found in foodstuffs such as rotting apples [56] . Patulin has antimicrobial effects and it has been shown to have cytotoxic, apoptotic and genotoxic effects in mammalian cells, including cancer cells [56-59]. While patulin does show some cellular toxicity in our assays, structural analogues of patulin were shown to have reduced toxicity compared to patulin in cell culture models [60], providing an opportunity to study alternative patulin-like molecules for the development of novel antiviral agents against coronaviruses. Also, considering that even mild inhibition of nsp14/10 exonuclease could have an effect on host immune responses, low and transient doses of patulin could also be considered. After some initially promising results in the early 20 th century, patulin was tested in a clinical trial for its ability to treat the common cold but found to be ineffective [61] . Since the time of this MRC trial, it has been shown that many viruses in addition to coronaviruses can cause the common cold, so it is likely that if patulin was effective only in treating coronavirus-based colds, the trial would not have uncovered it. It will be interesting for future studies to test patulin in the treatment of both COVID-19 and other coronavirus diseases.",

Untagged individual nsp14 (nsp14) was expressed from plasmid DU70487 that contains non-codon optimised nsp14 gene cloned into plasmid pK27SUMO (gene synthesis at MRC PPU available from https://mrcppu-covid.bio). To coexpress nsp14/10 complex, we co-transformed plasmids SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 (Addgene ID 169158) and SARS-CoV-2 3xFlag-nsp5CS-nsp14 (Addgene ID 169159).

Baculoviruses were generated and amplified in Sf9 insect cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the EMBacY baculoviral genome [64]. For protein expression, Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculovirus and collected 48 h after infection, flash-frozen and stored at -70 \u00b0C. Pellets were lysed with a Dounce homogeniser, 3 x 10 strokes on ice and cell debris cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 30 min.Protein purificationFor the purification of the nsp10-14 fusion protein, 1 ml slurry of HisPur TM Ni-NTA resin equilibrated in lysis buffer was added to the cleared lysate and rotated for 2 h. Resin was collected by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 2 min, washed with 100 ml lysis buffer and incubated for 20 min in 10 ml elution buffer (lysis buffer with 400 mM imidazole).

Peak fractions were pooled, aliquoted and frozen in liquid nitrogen to be stored at -80\u00baC. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford and by comparing to a BSA standard curve on a Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gel. The nsp10-14 fusion protein concentration was at 1.1 mg/ml (yield ~ 0.4 mg protein / L cell culture). Modifications of this protocol were used to purify the other recombinant proteins (Supplementary Table S3).
