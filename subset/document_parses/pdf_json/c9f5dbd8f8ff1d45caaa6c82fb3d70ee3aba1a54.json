To develop their attitude and acceptance, the implementation of learning media is required. Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the effectiveness of e-learning for developing the community's attitude toward dengue prevention and its acceptance of dengue vaccine and vaccination. Methods: This study employed a quasi-experimental method with pre-and post-test design by involving 85 subjects that were purposively selected from the low-prevalence area of dengue infection in the City of Bandung, West Java Province, Indonesia. A valid and reliable questionnaire was delivered during pre-(day 1) and post-test (day 7). For the e-learning, it was given on day 1 after completing the pre-test. A descriptive statistical method was applied to describe the research variables, to analyze the correlation between the subjects' attitude and acceptance, and to examine the significant differences (pre-and post-test) between the subjects' attitude toward dengue prevention and their acceptance of dengue vaccine and vaccination. Results: Approximately 88.24% and 11.76% of subjects have good and fair knowledge about dengue disease, respectively. Concerning knowledge about dengue vaccine, 44.71% and 55.29% of them them have good and fair knowledge, respectively. In particular, there is an increase in their attitude toward dengue prevention (p-value <0.05), their acceptance of dengue vaccine (p-value <0.05) and their acceptance of dengue vaccination program (p-value <0.05) after they got information from e-learning. Conclusion: E-learning could have significant effects to increase the community's attitude toward dengue prevention and their acceptance of dengue vaccine and vaccination.",

The manifestation of dengue infection ranges from dengue fever (DF) to the more severe forms, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). 1 Indonesia is one of the vulnerable tropical countries that may suffer endemic dengue disease. According to data from the Ministry of Health (MoH), there are 23 among 100,000 in the Indonesian population suffering from dengue disease and an annual fatality rate is reported to be 0.75%. 2 In 2015, there were approximately 129,650 dengue cases in 34 provinces in Indonesia, and 1071 of them were fatal cases. 2 Another data set in 2017 reported 201,885 dengue cases and 1585 deaths. 3 This increasing number was caused by climate change and low community awareness about the importance of keeping their environment clean. 2 In the most populous province in Indonesia, West Java Province, the number of dengue infections was reported to be 36,631 cases (77.31 cases per 100,000 population) and the fatality rate was estimated to be 0.74%. 4 The number of dengue cases is consistently increasing, indicating the need of comprehensive disease prevention strategies. To deal with this problem, the government has spent a budget of approximately USD 381 million on dengue prevention, which was reported to be the highest amount among Southeast Asian countries. 1 Nevertheless, the attempt to prevent dengue infection is constrained due to its borderless spread. In a comparison with other prevention strategies, dengue vaccination is considered to be the most costeffective intervention to decrease the number of dengue infections since the human immune response plays an essential role in pathogenic infectious disease. 5 In 2016, the Indonesian Food and Drug Authority issued an official license for the use of dengue vaccine in Indonesia. 6 Due to limited data on its economic aspect and the community's acceptance of this particular vaccine, this vaccine has not been included in the national immunization program. 7 The implementation of dengue vaccination in Indonesia needs support from the community. Effective learning media are required to enhance the community's attitude toward dengue prevention and the acceptance of dengue vaccination program.",

            "text": "The government of Indonesia has attempted several strategies, such as vector control and environment management by involving communities, to prevent dengue infection and to decrease the rate of virus infection in the population. Nevertheless, the number of dengue cases tends to increase annually. It might be caused by poor participation of the local community in the prevention strategies. In addition, the heterogeneity of their education and attitude is responsible for the program achieved an optimum result. 2 On the other hand, dengue vaccination is potentially considered to decrease the number of dengue infections and to save treatment cost. 14-16 Vaccination has been known as the most effective strategy to prevent infectious diseases, including dengue infection, in Indonesia. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Theoretically, the dengue vaccination program in Indonesia is able to control the spread of dengue disease, as MoH aimed to achieve a vaccination coverage of at least 69%. 2 However, this program needs support from the community. A study in some developing countries indicated that a community's acceptance of dengue vaccine and vaccination was associated with the successful implementation of a vaccination program. 7 Learning from There is an increase in their acceptance of dengue vaccine after they got information from e-learning. The increase in their acceptance (22.35%) and the decrease in their rejection (22.45%) are significant, as indicated by asymptotic significance (2-tailed) of p-value <0.05. In particular, pretest results of the subjects' acceptance of dengue vaccination program indicate 44.71% and 55.29% of them accept and reject it, respectively. Post-test results indicate 82.35% and 17.65% of them accept and reject it, respectively. There is an increase in their acceptance after they got information from e-learning. The increase in their acceptance (37.61%) and the decrease in their rejection (37.64%) are significant, as indicated by asymptotic significance (2-tailed) of p-value <0.05.",

Based on the correlation analysis, the only significant correlation is between education background and attitude toward dengue prevention on pretest.

There are 8 subjects with negative rank (the result of post-is lower than pretest), 27 subjects with positive rank (the result of post-is higher than pre-test result), and 50 subjects neither negative nor positive (the result of pre-and post-test is equal) Despite the fact that the study has a major limitation in the sample size, it has significant implication on the effectiveness of e-learning application as one of efforts to prevent dengue infection. To our knowledge, this e-learning program for dengue prevention by using the Moodle platform is the first to be implemented in Indonesia. Following the results of this study, we encourage stakeholders to enhance the use of e-learning, for instance with the Moodle platform, to improve the community's attitude toward dengue prevention and the community's acceptance of dengue vaccine and vaccination. To make an effective utilization of e-learning, there are several factors to be considered, such as learner, learning materials, learning atmosphere and technology. 23 For the application in formal and non-formal education, e-learning can be applied as a supplement, a complement or a substitute. 24 As a supplement, the learners undertake regular teachinglearning processes, and they are free to decide whether or not to take the e-learning program for enrichment. As a complement, the learners undertake regular teachinglearning processes, and the teacher assigns them to take an e-learning program as a reinforcement. As a substitute, the teacher undertakes the teaching-learning process through the internet, which means the function of e-learning is as a substitute for the regular teaching-learning process. To accelerate the implementation of e-learning, Clark et al highlighted three valuable instructional methods, such as practice with tailored feedback, integration of collaboration with self-study and use of simulation. 25 In the context of sustainability factors for e-learning initiatives in the health sector, these approaches can be implemented by the government of Indonesia to enhance interactivity, increase flexibility, reach more learners and keep the content updated.",

Taking McNemar test into account, the results indicate that the subjects' acceptance of dengue vaccine and vaccination increases from 16.47% to 38.82% after e-learning application. In contrast, the percentage of those who responded no (reject) also decreases from 83.53% to 61.18%.
