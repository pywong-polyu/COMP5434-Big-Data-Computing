Revealing universal collective patterns behind spatio-temporal interactions between residents is crucial for various urban studies, of which we are still lacking a comprehensive understanding. Massive cellphone data enable us to construct interaction networks based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence of individuals. The rank-size distributions of hourly dynamic population of locations are stable, although people are almost constantly moving in cities and hotspots that attract people are changing over time in a day. A larger city is of a stronger heterogeneity as indicated by a larger scaling exponent. After aggregating spatio-temporal interaction networks over consecutive time windows, we reveal a switching behavior of cities between two states. During the \"active\" state, the whole city is concentrated in fewer larger communities; while in the \"sleeping\" state, people are scattered in more smaller communities. Above discoveries are universal over diversified cities across continents. In addition, a city sleeps less, when its population grows larger. And spatio-temporal interaction segregation can be well approximated by residential segregation in smaller cities, but not in larger ones. We propose a temporal-population-weighted-opportunity model by integrating time-dependent departure probability to make dynamic predictions on human mobility, which can reasonably well explain observed patterns of spatio-temporal interactions in cities.",

Nonlinear and diversified interactions induced by agglomeration effect with supports from more efficiently utilized infrastructures in cities 3, 4 give rise to the increasing return to scale, which can be depicted as a superlinear urban scaling relation between socioeconomic output and urban population 5 . Diverse interactions from different social groups are critical for improving social cohesion 6 , overall safety level 7 , well-beings of residents 8, 9 , and the prosperity of the city 10 . Urban geography, social networks, and mobility of residents are crucial for increasing the diversity of interactions 9 . In addition, human interaction activities also exhibit regular patterns [11] [12] [13] and strong rhythms that one generally wake up, go to work, back home to rest and eat, or go for entertainments 2 . The city is composed of people and shaped by collective human interactions, we are still lacking a clear picture of interaction patterns at urban scale with a high spatio-temporal resolution. New York, Hong Kong, and Shanghai are among the first a few \"sleepless\" cities in the world, where interactions are seemingly happening everywhere and every moment. Behind almost non-stop traffic flows, are there any stable and universal patterns of human concentration and interactions in cities? Is a city really sleepless? Is the city center an exceptional aggregator of diversity 14 ? Gaining a deeper understanding of spatio-temporal patterns of human interactions in cities is crucial for answering above questions and benefiting various urban studies, including intervening epidemic spreading [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , assisting better urban planning 22 , evaluating segregation [23] [24] [25] [26] , traffic engineering [27] [28] [29] [30] , resources allocation 31 , emergency management 32, 33 .",

For example, in some megacities, the spatial resolution of CDDR can be around two hundred meters, and down to tens of meters in the downtown area even around ten years ago 36, 37 . After fully upgrading to 4G or 5G networks, the spatio-temporal resolutions of CDDR can be much higher. Therefore, CDDR can be used to infer potential spatio-temporal interactions and mobility patterns of individuals at a fine scale.",

Individuals who appeared at the same place at the same time will have a high probability to interact with each other and thus be connected in the spatio-temporal interaction networks. The connection patterns of such networks are dynamic due to human mobility. Though people are almost constantly moving in cities and hotspots that attract people are changing over time in a day, at each snapshot, Zipfian rank-size distributions of hourly dynamic population of locations is stable. After aggregating spatio-temporal interaction networks of two or more consecutive time windows, we observe that cities are switching between \"active\" and \"sleeping\" states. During the \"active\" state, the whole city is largely concentrated in fewer larger communities; while in the \"sleeping\" state, the whole city is scattered in more smaller communities. The above discoveries are universal over diversified cities across continents. When a city grows larger in terms of population, its sleeping state shortens. For Dakar in Senegal, it sleeps from 0 am to 8 am, Abidjan in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sleeps from 0 am to 6 am, while Beijing only sleeps from 2 am to 6 am. Such discoveries can be informative on assisting urban management. For example, if a city sleeps at 10 pm, then, during a pandemic, setting a curfew from 11 pm will be less effective. In addition, we discover that spatio-temporal interaction segregation can be well approximated by residential segregation in smaller cities, but not in larger cities. We propose a temporal population-weighted opportunity (TPWO) model by incorporating time-dependent departure probability, and it can reasonably well explain observed patterns of spatio-temporal interactions in cities.",

The obtained trajectory tells us when and where the user is, thus individual interaction networks can be inferred based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence. If some users appear at the same place at the same time, then they will be connected in a specific spatio-temporal interaction network (see illustration in Fig. 1 ). The real spatio-temporal interaction probability between people is affected by the land use type of the location. For simplicity and without losing generality, we make a homogeneous assumption that the chance of interaction between individuals at all locations are the same, which can be suitable for COVID-19 pandemic spreading modeling 20, 42 . The highest c Figure 1 . Schematic diagram of constructing spatial-temporal interaction networks from cellphone data and network aggregation process. a A interaction network is created for each hour based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence. Individuals who appear at the same location at the same t form a clique, as, for simplicity, we assume the interacting probability is equal to one. b The mobility trajectory of individuals. Locations are obtained from Voronoi tessellation based on the spatial distribution of cellphone towers (see Supplementary Fig. 1 ). In each time window t, the individual is associated with the location with the longest stay duration (see Supplementary Note 1 for more details). c Spatio-temporal interaction networks obtained from b at each snapshot (i.e., time window size \u03c9 = 1) and the aggregation of spatio-temporal networks over consecutive time windows with \u03c9 = 2. When aggregating network of snapshots (e.g., t 1 and t 2 ), links accumulate. spatial resolution we can obtain is at the location level partitioned according to the spatial distribution of cellphone towers by Voronoi tessellation (see illustration in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The temporal resolution depends on the frequency of cellphone usage, which can be quite high in the era of 4G and 5G communication. Here, we set it as one hour and associate the location with the longest stay duration to the user in each hour, and the full individual mobility trajectory consists of twenty-four locations (see Fig. 1b ). Due to mobility of individuals (see Fig. 1b ), the spatio-temporal network in each time window can be varying (see the left side of Fig. 1c ). Aggregating interaction networks over consecutive time windows connects the separated cliques in each snapshot forming more complex structures (see the right side of Fig. 1c) . A prominent one is the community structure with more internal connections than external ones, which corresponds to groups of individuals who have more spatio-temporal overlaps with each other. Thus the community structure is a natural way to measure the collective interaction patterns at the urban scale. The mathematical definition of spatio-temporal networks is detailed in Methods.",

The size of cliques in each location can be interpreted as the dynamic population of that place at that time. To earn their livelihood and meet various needs, people are almost constantly moving in cities 2, 44 . Hotspots that attract people evolve over time in a day 45 , for instance, during lunch time, hotpots would move to restaurants, while, during working time, the hotspots might move to CBD and working zones. Thus, it is intriguing that the distribution of hourly dynamic population are fairly stable over time in diversified cities (see Fig. 2a ), which might be induced by heterogeneous population distribution and temporal heterogeneity of mobility. Communities are ranked according to their sizes, where the largest one is ranked first and the smallest ranked the last. We find that such Zipfian rank-size distributions of community size of each hour almost collapse together and follow a truncated power-law s \u221d r(s) \u2212\u03b1 e \u2212r(s)/\u03ba , where s is the community size, \u03b1 is the scaling exponent, r(s) is the rank of the community, and \u03ba is the exponential cut-off (see Supplementary Fig. 2) . The scaling exponent \u03b1 is larger for cities with more population, which indicates that a larger city has a stronger heterogeneity and diversity that population concentrate in fewer largeer communities and the size of communities decays faster (see Supplementary Fig. 2 ). When \u03c9 = 2, a switching between active and inactive states is observed across cities, which is depicted by two distinguished distributions. This can be easily identified via visual inspections, and more quantitative evaluation can be found in Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6 . In the active state, the city concentrates in fewer larger communities, while in the sleeping state, it scatters in more smaller communities. In addition, when a city grows larger, it \"sleeps\" for a shorter time. The community structure is detected by the Louvain algorithm 43 . The color of the line corresponds to different time periods as indicated in the color bar. There are 24 lines in a that correspond to networks in each hour, and 12 lines in b, each of which aggregates two consecutive networks in a.",

Though the rank distributions of hourly dynamic population are stable, cities manifest a switching behavior between \"active\" and \"sleeping\" states, which are depicted by two distinguished rank distributions of community size (see Fig. 2b and Methods for more details). In the active state, people in the whole city are concentrated in fewer larger communities, which indicate that stronger interactions are happening between people. While in the sleeping state, the city is scattered in more smaller communities (see Fig. 2b ). Such discoveries are universal across cities and are stable over different time window sizes \u03c9 (see Supplementary Figs. 2-4 and Supplementary Note 2 for more details). In addition, when a city grows larger (e.g., from Dakar to Abidjan to Beijing), the city sleeps for a shorter time. This is consistent with the observation that the pace of life is faster in larger cities 5 . For instance, Beijing sleeps from 2 am to 6 am, Abidjan from 0 am to 6 am, and Dakar from 0 am to 8 am. We find that the population is the most deciding factor compared to other geographical, climatic factors, daylight length, temperature, and so on (see Table 1 ). Although the average temperature of Beijing is much lower than the other two, it is still the most active city among them.",

Such a pattern is less clear in Abidjan and Dakar (see Fig. 3b ) due to possible impacts from various factors, including urban geography, socioeconomic development level, and population heterogeneity. To better understand possible factors influencing spatio-temporal interaction patterns in cities, we model mobility trajectory of individuals based on the well-known population-weighted opportunity (PWO) model 48 . Compared to other parameter-free mobility models 49 , PWO is more suitable for predictions at the intra-urban scale 48 . However, PWO neglects the temporal evolution of mobility and is only able to make static predictions for one step. When applied to model human mobility for multiple steps, it does not work well on reproducing observed spatio-temporal interaction patterns (see Supplementary Figs. 7-9). we propose a temporal population-weighted opportunity (TPWO) model by incorporating time-dependent departure probability p m (h), which is generally of two peaks (see Fig. 4 ). And p m (h) is subject to the normalization condition that \u2211 24 h=1 p m (h) = 1. At each time step, the probability of movement of an individual is first determined by p m (h).

When the time window size \u03c9 = 1, the rank distributions almost collapse together as observed in reality. As \u03c9 increases, the switching behavior between two interaction modes emerges. As for the segregation patterns, smaller cities (Abidjan and Dakar) can be well reproduced in most regions (see Fig. 5c,d) .

The commonly used one is the residential population, which is biased to working and business zones where the residential population (RP) is usually small but those regions are of high attractions. The active population (AP) that measures the number of individuals who have visited the location in a day 3 can be a much better proxy for the attraction of a location. We implement two versions of TPWO models, one is using RP, and the other is using AP of locations. TPWO model using AP has a better performance (see Supplementary Figs. 7-9 and Supplementary Note 3 for more details).",

            "text": "As rapid urbanization will continue in the next a few decades, gaining a deeper understanding of collective interaction patterns at the urban scale is crucial for inventing more livable, diversified, and prosperous future cities. In this context, our work has three useful findings. First, although people are almost constantly moving in the city, the rank distribution of the hourly dynamic population is not altered by the movements of individuals between locations. Human mobility can be regarded as perturbations to the system, the discovered stable rank distributions (see Fig. 2 ) imply that city can be regarded as a self-organized system 50, 51 . And bigger cities are of a higher heterogeneity on dynamic population distribution, which is urban characteristic. Second, the observed switching behavior between active and sleeping states of cities is intriguing. In active states, individuals concentrate in fewer larger communities, which is similar to a reaction process that concentrates more energy and materials. While in sleeping states, the city is scattered into more smaller communities. In addition, when a city grows larger, it sleeps less. This is consistent with insights from urban scaling laws that the pace of life is faster in larger cities, and it would be interesting to investigate whether a city can be really sleepless if the population concentration continues. Third, residential segregation can be a good proxy of interaction segregation in smaller cities, but not in larger cities. To our best knowledge, such a relation is not well studied previously. And in Beijing, there is a clear spatial gradient of segregation index from the city center to the suburbs. The city center is shared by people from different groups and is an aggregator of diversity (see Supplementary Note 4 for more discussions). It is worth noting that now we are assuming local interactions between people who live closely still exist, if this is not the case in the future, then the spatial patterns of interaction communities in Beijing (see Fig. 3 ) might be the most segregated one: as people who live spatially close may not have strong interactions at all. Such a trend has already emerged in megacities, one may highly probably do not know the people who live above or below your apartment, or even just the next door. If the trend continues in the future, the city would separate people and local space meanwhile agglomerating the population.",

For example, identifying close contacts of the infected patient based on community structures in spatio-temporal interaction networks, predicting the spreading paths, and intervening the spreading of COVID-19 in cities while preserving more interactions via dismantling the spatio-temporal interaction networks. The heterogeneous distribution of population and departure probability might be two key factors influencing the collective spatio-temporal interaction patterns of cities, which is revealed by our TPWO model. The deeper mechanics behind them are worth closer investigations in the future.",

The PWO model is a collective mobility model that is applied to predict the volume of flows between locations but not to predict individual mobility trajectories. By incorporating heterogeneous departure probability and making a partial homogeneous assumption, which assumes that individuals at a certain place will follow the ensemble mobility probability p i j in Eq. 2 and the differences between individuals are only their home locations, the TPWO model can reasonably well reproduce collective spatio-temporal interaction patterns of cities. The TPWO model does not require detailed individual trajectory and other information, and only needs simple population-level inputs -departure probability and distribution of population, which can be easily obtained. Thus our framework provides a trade-off between privacy-preserving and studying spatio-temporal individual interaction patterns at the urban scale.",

For higher accuracy, the resolution of the time window can be set quite small when the temporal resolution of the raw data is high. In this paper, for simplicity and without losing generality, we set the resolution of the time window as one hour. A specific spatio-temporal interaction network at time window t is then formulated as10/11 G (t) is an undirected network. For simplicity, we assume that G (t) is unweighted, where a non-zero A uv (t) represents the spatio-temporal co-occurrence of u and v in the time windows t. The aggregation of co-occurrence events of consecutive time windows is formulated aswhere t \u2208 [t,t + \u2206t]. The aggregated spatio-temporal interaction network is defined asThe spatio-temporal co-occurrence events of individuals in G (t,t + \u2206t) accumulate. For example, if (u, v,t = 1) and (u, v,t = 2), then A uv (1, 2) = 2 in G (1, 2) (i.e., \u2206t = 1, which means the time windows size \u03c9 = 2, see more details of the aggregation process in Fig. 1c ). An aggregation of networks in more consecutive time windows (i.e., \u03c9 > 1) generally increases overall connectivity of the graph, due to movements of individuals.",
