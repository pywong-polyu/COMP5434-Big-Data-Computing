The role of Africa throughout the pandemic has been puzzling, since the African continent seems to have gone through the pandemic better than other continents; clearly better than predicted by the public during the emergence of COVID-19 one year ago. While several factors have been proposed in the literature to explain the unexpected role of Africa, including a relatively young population, more historicaldriven preparedness to other types of coronavirus and diseases, and a limited amount of testing, the puzzle is not considered to be solved. In this study, we aim to answer the question whether air transportation indicators can support us in explaining the evolution of COVID-19 in Africa? Using flight data for the year 2020, we explore how changes in the air transportation system correlate with evolution of epidemiological indicators. Our results suggest that air transportation could indeed play a critical role for the spread of COVID-19 in Africa as well. Overall, we hope that our analysis contributes towards a better understanding of COVID-19 and the role air transportation plays in an under-researched region of the world.",

History has several examples which show the extreme importance of air transportation for a contagion to spread successfully (Brockmann & Helbing, 2013; Budd, Bell, & Brown, 2009) , with examples from the recent two decades including SARS 2003 (Likhacheva, 2006) , MERS 2012 (Zaki, van Boheemen, Bestebroer, Osterhaus, & Fouchier, 2012) , and Ebola 2014 (Bogoch et al., 2015) . In the latter three cases, we were able to avoid a transition from an epidemic outbreak to a full pandemic, mostly by coordinated actions of relevant policy makers and stakeholders. For COVID-19, however, the critical time window for constraining the spread was missed (Sun, Wandelt, & Zhang, 2021b) . The pandemic has extreme effects on our society, with more than 289 million cases reported and more than 5.4 million directly related fatalities worldwide, by the end of the year 2021.",

Looking back, however, it seems like Africa has shown a significantly different epidemiological profile than expected. A comparative visualization among the number of daily reported COVID-19 cases in Africa, Europe, and the United States is shown in Fig. 1 . For a long time, there has been an absence of exponential growth in several African countries; and much lower rates of both the confirmed cases and fatalities were reported (Bamgboye et al., 2020) . Africa is accounting for about 3% of the world's confirmed cases and deaths, despite being the second most-populated continent on Earth, covering about 17% of the world's population. Moreover, the genesis of COVID-19 in Africa is reportedly later than that for other continents and less renal complications have been reported in Africa. Accordingly, there are several open questions regarding the role and performance of Africa under COVID-19. Recent studies have coined these questions as being an important puzzle to solve (Maeda & Nkengasong, 2021; Nordling, 2020) ; see also Winning (2020) . Several explanations for the unexpected performance of Africa have been discussed, including the relatively young population (Diop, Ngom, Biyong, & Biyong, 2020) , more historical exposure to other types of coronavirus with an accompanying higher natural defense mechanism (Nordling, 2020) , and a head start having learned from earlier epidemic outbreaks in Africa (Ondoa et al., 2020) .",

Therefore, it cannot be stated with confidence that the African continent went through the pandemic much better than other countries. While the lack of consistent reports and large-scale coverage makes it hard to draw ultimate conclusions, the puzzled (and seemingly obvious) differences between Africa and other continents do suggest that more study of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa is warranted (Bearak & Paquette, 2020; Chakamba, 2020) ; see also Section 2 below. Furthermore, a recent development in Africa indicated the emergence of new coronavirus variants (as, for instance, Omicron), which not only leads to a larger number of infections and deaths, but also poses significant threats to other continents. Therefore, a better understanding of the African continent is essential to better fight COVID-19 and future pandemics at a continental and worldwide scale. We contribute to the study of the African continent under COVID-19 by taking a different perspective compared to the literature. We investigate the changes in air connectivity and ask whether there are significant differences observable on the African continent compared to those in other regions of the world. Air transportation-related activity directly supports almost eight million jobs and more than 63 billion USD of continental economic value, covering almost 3% of the total GDP of all African countries in 2018. Given the long-distance connections to Asia, Europe, and the United States, air transportation contributes a substantial share to the tourism-related economies in Africa. While these long-distance connections are essential for economical reasons, they also open the door for the spreading of a contagion/disease. Accordingly, better understanding the mutual influence between aviation and African COVID-19 development is an interesting case for research analysis.",

We report aggregated data for 54 African countries and perform an in-depth analysis of the top-20 countries ranked by the total population. These 20 countries are highlighted in Fig. 2 , together with locations and degree of traffic for the airports on the African continent. Our selection of the countries is representative of a wide range of geopolitical regions on the continent. Alternatively, we could have selected countries based on the degree of flight activity, but this would have possibly led towards a bias for African countries with high international flight activity. Based on the findings in our study below, we conclude that air transportation could indeed play a critical role for the spread of COVID-19 in Africa as well, which is a result complimentary to those in the existing literature. Therefore, it is hoped that our study on the relationship between COVID-19 and air transportation for Africa contributes towards resolving the continent's COVID-19 puzzle.",

Sun, Wandelt, and Zhang (2020) performed a complex network-based analysis of the impact that COVID-19 had on aviation during early periods of the year 2020. Strict flight restrictions were observed at the global level, mostly executed on international connections. Similarly, Suzumura et al. (2020) analyzed the number of flights during COVID-19 as a time series for the first few months in the year 2020 and discussed these results in context with workforce occupation in different sectors. Ni\u017eeti\u0107 (2020) performed an impact study with a focus on Europe for the first four months of the year 2020. Sun, Wandelt, and Zhang (2021b) found that flight bans in Europe came particularly late and several domestic air transportation networks were significantly less impacted than one would have expected. Albers and Rundshagen (2020) investigated the first five months of 2020 and derived a classification of the reactions observable for individual airlines. Budd, Ison, and Adrienne (2020) showed that operational changes to flights, fleet rationalization, and staff reduction were prevalent among airlines early in the year 2020. Other research specific to airlines includes da Silveira Pereira and Soares de Mello (2021) and Bombelli (2020), who analyzed the role of Brazilian airlines and cargo airlines, respectively. Iaquinto (2020) discussed the impact of COVID-19 on global tourism and argued that COVID-19 should be taken as an opportunity to rethink mobility.",

To provide an overview, Fig. 3 shows the evolution of confirmed COVID-19 cases for selected African countries in the year 2020. For each of the top 20 countries by population, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is shown, with countries being stacked on top of each other. By the end of 2020, South Africa (ZAF) was the hardest-hit country (in total confirmed cases), having reported more than one million cases. One possible driver of the devastating impact of COVID-19 on South Africa was the emergence of a mutation, the so-called South African variant, Lineage B.1.351. While research on such variants of concern is still under progress in the scientific literature, it has been stated that this variant is much easier to transmit and might partially evade vaccination (Singh et al., 2021) . To better understand and compare the evolution of individual countries, we visualize the 0/1-normalized number of infections for each of the top 20 African countries against all countries worldwide in Fig. 4 . The African countries have hit their exponential growth phase relatively late. Notably, South Africa (ZAF) reached the first peak around July 2020, later than several other heavy-hit countries in the world. Some countries, including Burkina Faso (BFA), Mali (MLI) and Uganda (UGA), were hit particularly late. A few exceptions for countries which reach their peak relatively early include Ivory Coast (CIV), Ghana (GHA), Nigeria (NGA), and Sudan (SDN). Tanzania (TZA) is an exception according to our data with an extremely small number of confirmed cases in the year 2020.",

We can see that the evolution of the pandemic in different parts of Africa is a rather heterogeneous process, at least according to the number of confirmed cases, consistent with results in the literature (Bamgboye et al., 2020) . A few correlations between countries stand out and are explained as follows. The evolution in Nigeria (NGA) is correlated with Ivory Coast (CIV), DR Congo (COD), Egypt (EGY), and South Africa (ZFA). Especially the correlation coefficient between Nigeria (NGA) and South Africa (ZFA) is rather high (0.83). There could be various reasons for the strong correlation: Both countries have a very large population (see Table 1 in the Appendix) and are rather well connected to non-African countries, which could imply that they receive their initial cases at a similar time.",

In such a country network, nodes represent individual countries and links represent flights between any two airports between these two countries.

A few countries stand out in terms of enabling efficient air transportation inside Africa. Specifically, several countries along the coastline seem to act as bridges for connecting their neighborhood. These countries include South Africa (ZAF), Morocco (MAR), Kenya (KEN), Nigeria (NGA), and Ivory Coast (CIV). Strikingly, many of these countries were identified as highly correlated regarding the COVID-19 evolution in the previous section. Accordingly, we can conclude that air transportation could indeed play a critical role for the spread of COVID-19 in Africa as well. Ethiopia (ETH) seems like a special case here: Despite its central role for African air transportation, its number of confirmed cases was not highly correlated with other countries. African countries whose air transportation volume and degree of connectivity is much lower, were less synchronized and rather developed their own epidemiological characteristics. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized again that air transportation is only one of the drivers; there are many others, including ground transportation, health-care development status, and climate. A specific quantification of the contributions for these individual factors is a very important direction for future work.

For this purpose, we extracted a total of twelve monthly country networks for 2020. The results are shown in Fig. 7 . For the first two months of 2020, the network is highly similar with the network derived for 2019. Starting from March 2020, we can observe initial changes, which mostly consist of flow reductions in the Northern parts of Africa. Particularly, we can see that Morocco (MAR) and Tunisia (TUN) reduced their intra-continental flights. This is somewhat consistent with what has been found in early research on other parts of the world, where the major flight restrictions in Europe took place in the middle of March 2020 (Sun, Wandelt, & Zhang, 2021b) . Several other African countries, including South Africa (ZAF), on the other hand, show a less significant reduction in connectivity and flow magnitude, indicating that in March 2020 it was still wellconnected in the Southern part of the African continent. This means, that the disease still had ample opportunity to spread. Starting with April 2020, we can see that almost all inner-African flights collapsed; a recovery gradually started in July/August 2020. By the end of 2020, the connectivity of the country network is largely recovered, but the flows are smaller compared to the first two months of 2020.",

Two highly relevant node importance metrics for air transportation are degree and betweenness.

The betweenness of a node indicates the number of shortest paths a node appears on, estimating the frequency a random traveler would have to pass through a given country. It is known that a high node degree does not necessarily coincide with high betweenness in air transportation (Guimera, Mossa, Turtschi, & Amaral, 2005) ; accordingly, both notions contribute to the function of hubs: the degree directly and the betweenness indirectly. Fig. 9 reports the evolution of the top ten African countries ranked by the product of the two metrics.

First, the flight reduction by Kenya (KEN) and South Africa (ZAF) are much stronger than those implemented by Ethiopia (ETH). The latter country has implemented flight bans mainly for a period of 3-6 months; the length of the period is destination country-specific. For instance, the connection between Ethiopia (ETH) and Egypt (EGY) was disrupted for a period of three months and quickly recovered to more than 60% of its original capacity. The connection between Ethiopia (ETH) and Uganda (UGA), on the other hand, has been disrupted for more than half a year. This is an interesting observation, since Uganda (UGA) had a much better path throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in the year 2020, compared to Egypt (EGY).

Temporal evolution of the normalized number of flights between Ethiopia (ETH) and twelve highly-connected neighbors. find that the number of inter-continental flights with Africa was significantly reduced in March 2020. This reduction seemed to have happened in a synchronized way towards all other continents. Interestingly, the magnitude of flights did almost reach zero, meaning that the African continent was largely disconnected from other parts of the world in the period between April 2020 and June 2020. Starting from July 2020, the air transportation activity started to slowly recover. Similar to the flight bans, the degree of recovery is rather synchronized among all continents; flights towards Oceania are perhaps recovering slightly faster than those flights to other continents, particularly towards the end of 2020. The recovery towards Europe was stalled in the period between September 2020 and November 2020, possibly because of multiple strong outbreaks on the European continent in Summer 2020. Fig. 14 extends the earlier results and shows the evolution of airports and their spatial locations in Africa. We find that most airports along the North coast and South coast were significantly affected by the pandemic, large airports and small airports alike. In the inner parts of Africa, mainly around the equator, we can find that some airports did not incur such strict flight bans. While these are mainly smaller airports, it is a striking observation. Specifically, this means that from these smaller airports, there is an unreduced potential to spread the virus. The reasons for virtually non-existent flight reductions in this area are not clear. One possible explanation could be a lack of control measures and containment policies in the concerned countries. Fig. 15 provides a comparison of the evolution for the international flights (blue) and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (red). The data is 0/1 normalized to compare both indicators and to perform crosscountry comparisons. This chart aims to explore the possible degree of synchronization between the two indicators.

This group includes, for instance, Ivory Coast (CIV), Algeria (DZA), Egypt (EGY), Ghana (GHA), Mali (MLI), Niger (NER), Nigeria (NGA), and Tanzania (TZA). For these countries, flight reductions possibly came too late. Particularly, it should be noted that there is an unavoidable delay between the implementation of flight reductions and measurable results for multiple reasons. First, from an infection to the confirmation, it might take up to two weeks. Second, there are possibly undetected cases in the population. An increase in the number of confirmed cases should not be misinterpreted as the first event of infections taking place. Accordingly, we think that the flight restrictions for countries in the first group very likely came too late.

Finally, Ethiopia (ETH) takes an interesting role here, given that its international flight reductions were not as strong as those for other countries. The incoming passenger flow -despite being reduced in magnitude -left enough room for importing the disease. Another important observation regarding Ethiopia (ETH) is its flight recovery inside Africa matches exactly the time of entering Ethiopia's exponential growth phase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; refer back to Fig. 7 , where Ethiopia (ETH) took a leading role in July 2020 and August 2020 concerning the inner-African air transportation.

Most importantly, our analysis has shown that air transportation could have indeed played a critical role in the spread of COVID-19 in Africa. This fact has been reported for other countries and continents in the literature, but, to the best of our knowledge, not on Africa. Particularly, we find that several African countries with highly-correlated confirmed COVID-19 cases take central positions in the African air transportation system. These countries include South Africa (ZAF), Morocco (MAR), Kenya (KEN), Nigeria (NGA), and Ivory Coast (CIV). A high synchronization of confirmed cases suggests strong interactions between the populations: Well-established air transportation can be one such explanation for strong interactions. Accordingly, we recommend that studies which aim to understand and resolve the puzzle of COVID-19 on the African continent, do need to consider air transportation. It might be tempting to neglect air transportation for analysis on Africa, as Africa is a largely developing continent, but, epidemiologically, air transportation is the major driver of long-distance spreading.",

For several African countries we conclude that the flight restrictions came too late; a finding like what has been reported in Europe and the United States in the literature. It should be reiterated that air transportation is mainly an initial driver of disease spreading. From an epidemiological point of view, a single unobserved infection on a continent is -in theory -sufficient to turn into a continental outbreak. Accordingly, the delayed intra/inter-continental flight reduction of a single African country can lead to severe consequences for the whole continent, since the virus can spread by intra-continental flights and through ground transportation. There is a need for orchestrated responses in face of an epidemic outbreak threatening to turn into a pandemic. It is a dangerous misbelief that partial flight bans towards selected source countries helps in the fight against a pandemic. History has repeatedly shown that passengers are willing to accept (complex) rerouting in order to reach their destinations; and the highly-redundant air transportation system provides ample opportunity for passengers to circumvent country pair-specific flight bans. Third, the importance and role of individual countries in this pandemic should be investigated in future work. As we have shown in this study, Ethiopia (ETH) obtained an outstanding role of importance from the complex network perspective throughout the period between March 2020 and June 2020. Such a tremendous shift in node importance is accompanied by a significant shift in network dynamics, particularly regarding simulations for disease spreading. A node with higher degree and betweenness is significantly more likely to be an active hub for disease spreading. Therefore, models for pandemic forecasting and explanation should always rely on the latest data. As an example, taking flight data for the year 2019 for simulating the spread in the late stages of 2020 will be highly misleading, as the flow of passengers and importance of airports has undergone tremendous changes throughout one year. A model with inaccurate (outdated) input data will necessarily lead to the wrong conclusions.",

We can partially observe arguments for the most plausible explanations. On one hand, it could well be the African continent was saved from a worse epidemiological situation based on more restrictive flight bans, compared to European countries and the United States. On the other hand, a significant underreporting of cases could also explain the delay of confirmed COVID-19 cases compared to the implemented flight restrictions in some African countries. Overall, it can be concluded that there is an outstanding need for more studies on this special continent, with a better focus on obtaining reliable data. Uyoga et al. (2020) was a first important step into that direction, but there is an urgent need to further studies, particularly at a larger scale.",

A possible direction for future work would be an extension with the consideration of ground transportation data, which could complement our analysis presented here. Air transportation is most important for the initial importation of a disease. Once the virus has infected a sufficiently large subpopulation, the remaining disease dynamics mainly depend on other transmission media and parameters, e.g., public transit, social distancing, and application of facialmasks policies. An investigation of such factors requires much more detailed data but will also lead to realistic and fine-grained insights into the process of epidemic spreading. Moreover, it would be interesting, yet challenging, to implement a simulation framework, which allows to model interactions among different factors (not only concerning transportation, but also age groups and health case development status) and assess their impact. Furthermore, it would be interesting and important to use more recent data to explore how Africa performs with respect to the new variants of concern relative to the rest of the world (e.g., Sun, Wandelt, and Zhang (2021a) ) and the factors that influence the performance. Finally, the analysis in our study is based on flights (aircraft movements) data; as all data-driven research, our results depend on and change with the availability and quality of additional data. Given the lack of actual passenger trajectories, we have used the number of flights between countries as a connectivity indicator. This should be understood as a proxy, as it neglects the load factor of aircraft as well as the transformation of passenger aircraft to cargo aircraft throughout the pandemic. Future research could analyze actual passenger data once such data becomes available. Based on such data, one could perform experiments on behind/beyond traffic, further pushing the envelope or understanding micro-dynamics underlying COVID-19 and African aviation. ",
