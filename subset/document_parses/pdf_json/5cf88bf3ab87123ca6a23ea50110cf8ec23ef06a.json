Methods In this observational, retrospective, monocentric study, all hospitalized patients who underwent CT for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia from February 27 to March 27, 2020 (first wave) and from October 26 to November 24, 2020 (second wave) were enrolled. Epidemiological data, radiological pattern according to the RSNA consensus statement and visual score extension using a semi-quantitative score were compared. Results Two hundred and eleven patients (mean age, 64.52 years \u00b1 15.14, 144 males) were evaluated during the first wave while 455 patients (mean age, 68.26 years \u00b1 16.34, 283 males) were studied during the second wave. The same prevalence of patterns was documented in both the first and the second waves (p = 0.916), with non-typical patterns always more frequently observed in elderly patients, especially the \"indeterminate\" pattern. Compared to those infected during the first wave, the patients of the second wave were older (64.52 vs.68.26, p = 0.005) and presented a slightly higher mean semi-quantitative score (9.0 \u00b1 2.88 vs. 8.4 \u00b1 3.06, p = 0.042). Age and semi-quantitative score showed a positive correlation (r = 0.15, p = 0.001). Conclusions There was no difference regarding CT pattern prevalence between the first and the second waves, confirming both the validity of the RSNA consensus and the most frequent radiological COVID-19 features. Non-typical COVID-19 features were more frequently observed in older patients, thus should not be underestimated in the elderly population.",

The risk of exceeding the capacity of the healthcare systems has led to strict lockdowns with universal movement restriction, involving social distancing measures. These measures have been effective in slowing down the pandemic, possibly reducing many millions of infections and averting the deaths of millions more; thus, they have been adopted as a model by many other countries. Moreover, several studies [2] have claimed that the seasonality of the immune response and the germicidal properties of solar UV rays during the summer months of 2020, as well as improved air quality due to city lockdowns [3] , could have contributed to mitigating the COVID-19 epidemic, with a consequent reduction in both infection rate and criticality.",

The present semi-quantitative analysis of extension of COVID-19 CT features showed similar score severity values during the two waves (8.4 vs. 9.0) but the patients who were admitted during the second wave presented a slightly greater, but significant, CT extension of viral pneumonia. Even if this small difference is of little to no clinical relevance, it can be speculated that the prognosis of COVID-19 patients during the second wave was slightly worse, which would justify the still elevated number of deaths from COVID-19 despite the better level of treatment achieved. This observation could be supported by the evidence of an older age of the patients admitted during the second wave, possibly implying that the infected patients who still required hospitalization during the second wave were the elderly and thus the most susceptible to viral infections [18] while the younger patients could be sufficiently managed outside hospitals.

Moreover, this study confirmed the validity of the RSNA consensus regarding COVID-19 pattern classification and the most frequent radiological COVID-19 features. Finally, non-typical COVID-19 features were more frequently observed in older patients and, therefore, should not be underestimated in the elderly population.",
