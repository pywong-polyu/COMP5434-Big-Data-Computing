By applying intelligent data analysis techniques, many interesting patterns are identified for the early and onset detection and prevention of several fatal diseases. Diabetes mellitus is an extremely life-threatening disease because it contributes to other lethal diseases, i.e., heart, kidney, and nerve damage. In this paper, a machine learning based approach has been proposed for the classification, early-stage identification, and prediction of diabetes. Furthermore, it also presents an IoT-based hypothetical diabetes monitoring system for a healthy and affected person to monitor his blood glucose (BG) level. For diabetes classification, three different classifiers have been employed, i.e., random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and logistic regression (LR). For predictive analysis, we have employed long short-term memory (LSTM), moving averages (MA), and linear regression (LR). For experimental evaluation, a benchmark PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset is used. During the analysis, it is observed that MLP outperforms other classifiers with 86.08% of accuracy and LSTM improves the significant prediction with 87.26% accuracy of diabetes. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed approach is also performed with existing state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating the adaptability of the proposed approach in many public healthcare applications.",

Figure 2 shows the multilayer perceptron classification model architecture where eight neurons are used in the input layer because we have eight different variables. e middle layer is the hidden layer where weights and input will be computed using a sigmoid unit.

LSTM is based on recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, and it has feedback connections that make it suitable for diabetes forecasting [58] . LSTM mainly consists of a cell, keep gate, write gate, and an output gate, as shown in Figure 3 . e key behind using LSTM for this problem is that the cell remembers the patterns over a long period, and three portals help regulate the information flow in and out of the system. e details are presented in Algorithm 2. Input to the algorithm is eight attributes enlisted in Table 3 , measured from healthy and diabetic patients. e proposed LSTM-based diabetes prediction algorithm is trained with 80% of the data, and the remaining 20% is used for testing. We fine-tuned the prediction model by using a different number of LSTM units in the cell state. is finetuning helps to identify more prominent features in the dataset. ese features will be kept in the cell state of the keep gate of the LSTM and will be given more weightage because they provide more insights to predict BG level. After that, we updated the network's weights by pointwise addition of the cell state and passed only those essential attributes for BG prediction. At this stage, we captured the dependencies between diabetes parameters and the output variable. Finally, the output gate updates the cell state and outputs/ forwards only those variables that can be mapped efficiently on the outcome variable. e diabetes prediction algorithm consists of three fundamental steps. First, weights are initialized and a sigmoid unit is used in the forget/keep gate to decide which information should be retained from previous and current inputs (C t\u2212 1 , h t\u2212 1 , and x t ). e input/write gate takes the necessary information from the keep gate and uses a sigmoid unit which outputs a value between 0 and 1. Besides, a Tan h unit is used to update the cell state C t and combine both outputs to update the old cell state to the new cell state.",
