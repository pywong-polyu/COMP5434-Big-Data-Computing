These measures impacted all students, as schools, educators, and families grappled with the realities of transitioning to distance-learning platforms. The research on distance learning is still in its early phases. However, almost no research exists on educating students with severe disabilities and high behavioral needs using this technology. Study 1 collected survey data from students' families and their educators on the feasibility and effectiveness of distance-learning programs when working with students with severe developmental disabilities and high behavioral needs. Results indicated that parents and educators had generally neutral attitudes toward distance learning, although educators agreed that their students were obtaining educational benefits during distance learning. Study 2 further examined the effects of a transition to distance learning on students' Individualized Education Plan (IEP) goal progress. Analyses revealed that students maintained about half of the skills addressed in their IEPs and made progress on an additional quarter of their IEP goals. Findings contribute to a much-needed literature base on distance learning and provide additional information as to the feasibility and effectiveness of distance learning with students with severe developmental disabilities and high behavioral needs. Future work is needed to determine best practices for distance learning with this population.",

COVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus that spreads from person to person and can live in the air for over 3 hr and on some surfaces for up to 3 days (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . The United States detected its first case of COVID-19 on January 21, 2020 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] , 2020a). Soon after, several states issued shelter-in-place orders, leading to the closure of the majority of businesses and educational institutions across the United States. These orders have changed all aspects of society, including education. By April 2020, the pandemic had led to 96% of schools across the United States closing in an effort to keep students safe and healthy (MCH Strategic Data, 2020) . This represents 97.91% of the entire K-12 population of 57,900,000 students (MCH Strategic Data, 2020) .",

Distance learning or education is defined as a method of teaching where the student and teacher are physically separated (Kentnor, 2015) . It can utilize a variety of technologies, including correspondence, audio, video, computers, and the internet (Roffe, 2004) . Distance education is also called \"online education\" and most recently utilizes computers and the internet as the delivery mechanism, with at least 80% of the course content delivered online (Allen & Seaman, 2011; Shelton & Saltsman, 2005) . There are various delivery models of distance learning, including asynchronous and synchronous modalities. Asynchronous models involve a method of communication where messages are sent and received over a period of time, and include two-way communication in which there is a time delay between the message being sent and the message being received. Alternatively, synchronous modalities involve online communication between two or more people at once, but not necessarily in the same place. It is a computer-mediated exchange of information where participants are online simultaneously (Mahoney & Hall, 2020) .",

Specifically, for students with special needs, research has shown that the flexibility of course scheduling, the flexibility of lesson pace with the ability to take breaks, automated and immediate feedback, and the reduced pressure of having to perform in front of peers are benefits of distance education learning modalities (Marteney & Bernadowski, 2016) .

Despite this widespread transition to distance learning, the research on distance learning is still in its early phases, and little research has assessed the effects of online lessons for elementary, middle, and high school students. Of those studies, findings remain mixed. Several studies have demonstrated equal effectiveness of online learning platforms and face-toface instruction (Barbour & Mulcahy, 2009; Barker & Wendel, 2001) . Further, others have even documented the superiority of online platforms over traditional face-to-face learning (Cavanaugh, 2001; Hart, Berger, Jacob, Lomb, and Hill, 2019) . Despite such promising data, other studies document negative effects of moving to distance learning (Fitzpatrick, Berends, Ferrare, & Waddington, 2020) . Even less is known about the mediating and moderating variables that impact the effectiveness of distance learning and whether there are differences in outcomes across age, race, and socioeconomic factors (Cavanaugh et al., 2004) . These mixed results and limited research base make it difficult to truly understand the impact on students' education of moving from traditional face-to-face instruction to distance-learning platforms.",

Fewer studies have looked at the impact of distance learning on students with special needs, let alone those with severe developmental disabilities and high behavioral needs. These students and their families are now in uncharted waters. Although some studies indicate that distance-learning programs are uniquely positioned to meet the needs of students with disabilities (Hashey & Stahl, 2014; Rose & Blomeyer, 2007) , research in this area is scarce, and findings are mixed (Means et al., 2010) . Heiman (2006) found that university students with learning disabilities can be successful in distance-learning programs with additional supports. However, this is not representative of the entire special education population, as participants ranged in age from 18 to 50 years and had IQ scores of 95-120. Findings therefore cannot be generalized to younger students or those with intellectual disabilities. Additional studies investigated teachers' experiences with distance learning. For example, Marteney and Bernadowski (2016) surveyed teachers who taught an online education program for students with special education needs. In this study, the majority of the teachers reported that online education opened up access to learning activities for students with limitations, and reported improvements in student academic performance. These findings are extremely promising and encouraging; however, as with distancelearning studies performed with the general education population, research including the special education population also remains mixed. For example, Carnahan and Fulton (2013) found that students with special needs enrolled in a cyberschool performed worse than the state average for special needs students on standardized math and reading education assessments. In this study, cyberschools were defined as charter schools that were delivering instruction through computer-based formats.",

In 2012, Vasquez and Straub conducted a review of the literature on online learning for special education students. Their review identified 43 studies on this topic. Of those studies, only six were identified as empirical. A deeper dive into the six empirical studies revealed that, although most students had an individualized education plan (IEP), students in three of the six empirical studies participated in mainstream classrooms, suggesting that their developmental or behavioral limitations did not require more restrictive placements. When looking at the percentage of students with special needs enrolled in distance schools, diagnoses that often represent students with severe challenging behaviors and significant developmental delays represented a very small portion of those enrolled. For example, Carnahan and Fulton (2013) investigated distance schools in Pennsylvania. Of the 2,600 students with special needs enrolled in distance-learning schools, the majority of the students were classified as having a learning disability. Less than 10% were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual disability (ID), highlighting the need for research specifically looking at those individuals who are more severely impacted.",

            "text": "Developmental disabilities encompass a broad range of conditions that result from cognitive and/or physical impairments and range in degree of severity (May Institute, 2020). Seventeen percent of individuals ages 3-17 years are diagnosed with a developmental disorder, the most common of which are ID, cerebral palsy, and ASD (CDC, 2020b). Further, Petek (2019) outlined requirements set forth by the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and reported both ASD and ID are considered relatively severe disabilities. In addition to exhibiting delays in development, many of these individuals also demonstrate challenging behavior. Research suggests that approximately 64%-93% of individuals with ASD exhibit one or more challenging behaviors (McTiernan et al., 2011) , and 10%-20% of individuals with ID demonstrate challenging behaviors (Jacobson, 1982; Kiernan & Kiernan, 1994) . These students are often educated with supports and services beyond what is offered in general education classrooms and at times in different classrooms altogether. In California, 12% of students in K-12 schools are in special education (Jones, 2020) ; however, only 20% of these students are in special education classrooms on a comprehensive campus, and 3% of these students are in separate schools away from their school or district of residence (Petek, 2019) . For this 3% of students who are most impacted and unable to be educated at their school of residence, research on distancelearning outcomes is extremely scarce. In fact, the researchers from the present study were unable to find any articles that specifically looked at distance learning in nonpublic schools (NPSs), let alone distance-learning studies in an NPS during an international emergency.",

According to the CDE (2020), NPSs are specialized private schools that provide services to public school students with disabilities. The NPS in the present study primarily serves students with ASD, IDs, and other developmental, behavioral, and cognitive disabilities. One hundred twenty-six students, ages 5 through 22 years, are educated at the NPS. Each classroom consists of up to 12 students, a credentialed teacher, and anywhere from 3 to 12 paraeducators. Given the significant needs of the students, 82.5% of the students have one-to-one paraeducator support throughout the school day. In addition, the NPS utilizes a behavior-analytic framework for all educational services and employs 12 Board Certified Behavior Analysts to ensure that behavior analysis informs both school-and classroom-wide systems, as well as students' individual behavior plans.",

It was determined that a synchronous distance-learning model would be the best approach to serve the NPS's student population. Within a 1-week time span, the distance-learning program was developed, finalized, disseminated through a training program, and launched to all staff. Training consisted of an initial 4-hr training with all teachers and support providers. Training included instruction on the online virtual platform used (www.zoom.us); the utilization of breakout rooms for one-to-one and small-group instruction; the technological systems needed, including how to share a screen; data collection procedures; curriculum and resource libraries available online; the implementation of IEP goals virtually; the completion of academic assessments remotely; and the development of classroom schedules and Zoom meeting codes for entrance into the classroom settings. Additionally, each week following the initial training, teachers and support providers would meet for 2 hr to troubleshoot and collaborate on resources that were most effective.",

For group instruction, teachers would share their screens and students were able to participate by adding content to the shared lesson through the annotation feature or by utilizing the raise-hand feature and waiting to be called on. All one-to-one service meetings were held apart from the virtual group setting in virtual breakout rooms. During the one-to-one service meetings, the students worked with the service provider or paraeducator, and on occasion, a behavior team member. Academic and behavior goals, as well as all one-to-one speech and occupational therapy, were targeted during this time.

The top three themes for each question were then determined for all three respondent types based on the number of statements that fell under each theme.

Interobserver agreement checks were conducted for 100% of the comments. The second author independently coded all of the comments for each theme. If both coders coded the same statement under a theme, an agreement was counted. If one coder coded a statement under a theme, but the other coder did not code that statement under a theme, a disagreement was counted. Interobserver agreement was then calculated for each theme by dividing the number of agreements by the number of disagreements plus agreements and multiplying by 100. For parent responses to the question \"What do you like about your child's distance-learning program?\" interobserver agreement was 100%.

Parent, teacher, and paraeducator surveys were analyzed to determine perceptions of feasibility and effectiveness for students ages 5-22 years who attended an NPS in Southern California. An analysis of feasibility ratings revealed that, overall, parents agreed that although aspects of the distance-learning program were feasible (i.e., the Zoom platform was easy to operate), it did impact typical routines and demanded adjustments. Overall, parent ratings on the feasibility survey items indicated that parents were neutral toward the feasibility of their children's distance-learning program. The scores from the parents who felt like the program was feasible were offset by the scores from the parents who felt like the program was not feasible, creating overall means in the neutral range. Further research should look at the differences between these two groups to determine what variables make it likely for some parents to respond favorably toward distance learning and others to respond unfavorably. An analysis of the openended responses indicated that an area requiring further attention is the high level of parent involvement required. The majority of parents, teachers, and paraeducators all indicated that the students needed a lot of parent assistance (e.g., most parents had to sit right next to their children throughout the day). It is quite possible that families who could accommodate the high level of parental assistance rated the feasibility as more favorable than those families who could not easily accommodate such a high level of parental involvement (e.g., families in which both parents had a full-time job or families with multiple children). What do you like about your students' distance-learning program? Parent involvement \"I also appreciate the parents' willingness to learn.

First, parents indicated that a benefit of distance learning was continued socialization (i.e., their children still had contact with their teachers and got to see their classmates). However, parents also indicated that distance learning limited their child's social interactions. Together, it seems like parents appreciated that their children got to interact with their classmates during distance learning, but recognized that these interactions were inferior when compared to the in-person interactions that their children received prior to distance learning. Given the importance of social skills and the potential impacts on other areas of development, including academic achievement, social acceptance, and comorbid diagnoses (Bellini, 2006; La Greca & Lopez, 1998; Tantam, 2000; Welsh et al., 2001) , this is an important consideration when looking at distance-learning programs and their impact on this population. Similar to parents, teachers' and paraeducators' overall survey scores were generally neutral when rating the effectiveness of their students' distance-learning program. One important difference, however, is that both teachers and paraeducators agreed that their students were obtaining educational benefits by participating in their distance-learning program. Parents, on the other hand, were neutral toward this item. This is an important distinction. Whereas the majority of educators recognized the benefits of distance learning for their students, the majority of parents did not. A limitation of this study is that disparate sample sizes preclude statistical analyses comparing the results of the three groups to determine whether these differences were significant. This is an opportunity for future research to investigate.",

            "text": "The educators' open-ended responses highlight certain nuances regarding the effectiveness of distance learning. Responses suggest several unique benefits to distance learning because it was conducted in the students' homes, such as increased opportunities for parent involvement. Paraeducators also noted that several of the students' home settings presented fewer distractions than classrooms full of other students and adults. On Zoom, paraeducators could work with a student one to one in a breakout room, whereas in a classroom, it was more difficult to find a location away from the other students. Another unique benefit observed by the educators was related to the technological aspects of distance learning. Teachers noted that distance learning forced the students to learn new skills (e.g., how to independently attend a Zoom meeting), and paraeducators described how it was easier to target certain goals on the computer than it had previously been in the brick-and-mortar setting. These comments underscore some of the technological benefits of distance learning and contribute to current conversations on how the transition to distance learning will have an everlasting impact on how education is delivered, even when brick-andmortar schools reopen (Li & Lalani, 2020) . Of note, however, is that the unique characteristics of distance learning that lead to these advantages also come with distinct disadvantages. Teachers described the difficulties training the students' parents over Zoom, and paraeducators commented that parents would often overprompt their children. Further, distance learning made it difficult to address the children's challenging behaviors. Even though distance learning and the access to virtual tools made it easier to address certain goals, other goals could only be addressed face to face. Overall, the results highlight the nuanced reactions to and perceptions of distance learning. Educators recognized that distance learning encompassed both unique benefits and disadvantages, especially when working with a population of students with several developmental disabilities and high behavioral needs.",

To expand on the effectiveness ratings from Study 1, the effectiveness of the distance-learning program was further analyzed by utilizing a paired-samples t test to compare students' mean performance on their IEP goals with in-person instruction to their performance during the distancelearning program. Although there was a slight decrease in the overall mean, the difference was not statistically significant. Further analyses showed that the students' performance did not change from in-person learning to distance learning for almost half of the goals, suggesting these skills maintained. Of the remaining goals, about a quarter showed reductions in performance, whereas the last quarter showed improvement. It is important to note that this suggests that the majority of goals measured showed maintenance or improvement. This is of important consideration, given the high level of supports, services, and curricular modifications per IDEA that this population requires in order to access their education (Lipkin & Okamoto, 2015) . It is promising that a population that typically thrives on structure and routine maintained or continued to make progress on a majority of academic and behavior goals during a major disruption to their educational program. It is hypothesized that the quantity of time in their distancelearning program paired with programming familiar stimuli in the virtual classroom (e.g., teacher, peers, curriculum, schedule) facilitated maintenance on their IEP goals. Although many might find these results promising, others would justifiably question whether we should be satisfied with \"maintenance.\" In fact, the Supreme Court spoke directly to this concern in the ruling for Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District (2017). According to the ruling, students must be making expected progress toward annual IEP goals. There is an important distinction between progress and maintenance, and although it is promising that students only regressed on 25% of their goals during the transition to distance learning, maintenance is not the end goal. Although more research is needed to fully understand the effects that distance learning has on a severely impacted population, these findings are an informative first step.",

Although students who did participate maintained or made progress on the majority of their IEP goals during distance learning, we cannot say that this is due to the distance-learning program, given we do not know the performance levels of those who did not participate. It is possible that those students would demonstrate similar performance on their goals in the absence of any program delivery. This shortcoming therefore limits the conclusions we are able to draw from Study 2. A further limitation of Study 2 is that there are no interobserver agreement data for the students' data during distance learning. Although it is standard practice at the NPS to take interobserver agreement data regularly, the limitations of the distance-learning program and the timeline in which it was developed and executed prevented consistent interobserver agreement data collection. Without this data, it is difficult to conclude that all goals that were included represent accurate data.",

Given the shift in daily routines and responsibilities that came with an unexpected and sudden transition to distance learning, the fact that parent ratings were not more negative is interesting and promising for distance-learning programs in general. Further analyses of individual academic and behavior goals also indicate that students maintained skills for half of their goals and made progress on an additional quarter of their goals.

Parents were able to see what their child was able to do academically and how to manage challenging behaviors more effectively. This created consistency of care and increased collaboration across the home and school environments. An additional benefit was that teachers and paraeducators had an accessible means to provide parent training. During traditional brick-and-mortar school sessions, parents often reported difficulties coming in for parent-training opportunities. Distance learning allowed for an alternative means to access parent training, and efforts should be made to continue access to parent training even when schools reopen their school sites. Although these benefits were extremely helpful, paraeducators and teachers also reported that parents' involvement became problematic at times. For example, through no fault of their own, parents tended to overprompt and not follow prompt hierarchies outlined in the students' Behavior Intervention Plan and learning plans. They often provided answers to their student prior to allowing their child to answer independently. This is understandable given the intensity of training that the educators have received in the strategies necessary to educate these students as compared to the minimal training that parents have received.

Recently, California passed Senate Bill 98, which requires local education agencies to include a description of emergency procedures should distance learning be required in all student IEP documentation. Although advanced planning is certainly beneficial, we must understand what is needed to ensure student success with such programs. It will be important for future research to examine what the best practices for distance learning are to minimize regression and to ensure students' success with this education modality.",

For example, is there a certain type of student who may perform better with a distance-learning platform? Many students with developmental disabilities and high behavioral needs have comorbid anxiety disorders. Perhaps these students would perform better in a more predictable and familiar environment with fewer distractions and social and academic demands. It is also possible that there may be differences in performance across ethnicity and socioeconomic or developmental levels. More work is needed to determine whether, and which, variables exist that may predict success with certain learning modalities over others.",

            "text": "In conclusion, Studies 1 and 2 lend support to the fact that this population requires continued service and that educators and clinicians must make data-based decisions that honor the ethical obligation to not abandon their clients and students even during global emergencies (Colombo et al., 2020) . Although the NPS examined in the present study was forced to transition their service delivery model to a distance-learning program, the students continued to be offered education and service levels consistent with their IEP. Based on the data collected, it is possible that some form of education is more effective than eliminating services and education altogether. However, feasibility remains a consideration, as it was extremely difficult for students and their families to consistently access the program and their services, and many students were unable to log on. If in-home applied behavior analysis services are medically necessary and their personnel essential (Colombo et al., 2020; LeBlanc et al., 2020) , what about applied behavior analysis services delivered in a school setting? Are special educators also essential workers? What are the detrimental impacts of closing school on students with special needs and their families? And how should these variables be taken into account when deciding how and when to open schools for in-person instruction? Unfortunately, there are more questions than there are answers. However, as the nation grapples with the decisions that lay ahead, it is imperative to also consider the needs of those most severely impacted during these emergencies. These students are a unique population with extreme challenging behaviors that compromise their safety. During times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, these behaviors are likely to increase (LeBlanc et al., 2020) , therefore necessitating the need for continued service levels and instruction. The present study attempted to begin to analyze whether these services and instruction would be feasibly and effectively delivered through distance learning. Although more research is needed, it is promising that educators felt there was some educational benefit and that students who participated maintained or continued to make progress on a majority of their IEP goals. However, this is only a small first step, and more work is needed to fully understand distance learning with this population.",
