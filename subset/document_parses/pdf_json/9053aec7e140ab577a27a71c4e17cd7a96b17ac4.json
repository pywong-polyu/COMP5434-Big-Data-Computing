            "text": "One of the procedures in which culture-based prophylaxis could be a promising strategy is transrectal prostate biopsy (PB). Transrectal PB, which is used to diagnose and stage prostate cancer, is one of the most frequently performed urological procedures. 4 A worrying increase in infectious complications after transrectal PB from ,1% to 6% now has been reported in recent years. [5] [6] [7] This rise in post-biopsy infections has been linked to the growing resistance of Gram-negative bacteria, the main pathogens involved, to fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotics. 8, 9 Two meta-analyses have provided evidence for the use of culture-based prophylaxis in reducing infectious complications after transrectal PB. 3, 10, 11 One meta-analysis from 15 studies representing 12 320 participants, showed infectious complications in 3.4% (95% CI 2.6%-4.3%) of the patients after empirical prophylaxis and 0.8% after culture-based prophylaxis (95% CI 0.4%-1.3%). 10 The other meta-analysis from nine cohort studies (4571 patients) also reported significantly higher post-biopsy infection rates after empirical prophylaxis (4.55%; 95% CI 3.80%-5.44%) compared with culture-based prophylaxis (0.72%; 95% CI 0.44%-1.18%). 3 Innovative culture-based prophylaxis starts with pre-biopsy screening for FQ-resistant bacteria in the rectum of patients undergoing transrectal PB. 3, 10, 12 Ideally, the swab is collected within 2 weeks before PB. When the swab is collected by the patient, this can be done either in the hospital or at home. Next, a bacterial culture test is performed at the clinical microbiological laboratory to identify men with FQ-resistant rectal Gram-negative bacteria where FQ prophylaxis is not appropriate. Moreover, the suitability of other antibiotics is assessed by bacterial culture tests and/or antibiotic susceptibility testing. Finally, urologists prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis based on these culture results.",

The trial started in April 2018 in three Dutch hospitals and two connected Dutch clinical microbiological laboratories and was expanded to 11 Dutch hospitals and six connected Dutch clinical microbiological laboratories during the trial. Patients were randomized into two groups of 666 patients each: a control group receiving routine empirical prophylaxis with oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg 2 h before and 12 h after prostate biopsy and an intervention group receiving rectal culture-based oral antibiotic prophylaxis. The antibiotics used in the intervention group are ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin or pivmecillinam/amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The primary outcome measure was any registered clinical infectious complication within 7 days after transrectal PB.",

For urologists, the choice for a particular screening scenario mainly depended on the simplicity with which rectal culture collection can be implemented in the existing logistic pathway around PB. A decisive factor for urologists would be that the strategy has no or limited influence on the speed of the cancer diagnostic process. Provided that these conditions are met, multiple scenarios within a hospital are probably needed to meet the various patients' needs and preferences.",

Selfsamplers reported lower levels of shame and pain compared with patients who were sampled by a healthcare provider. However, trust in the correct execution of sampling was higher when a healthcare provider performed the rectal culture. These findings are in line with other qualitative studies addressing patients' perspectives on self-sampling, e.g. with regard to human papillomavirus. 15, 16 Furthermore, in our study, about 15% of the self-samplers indicated that they would have preferred sampling by a healthcare provider (home: 17.9%; hospital: 13.1%). In addition, some selfsamplers felt that they were not able or found it difficult to sample themselves, while 1 in 4 patients noted that, if needed, they could not ask for help. Based on these results, patients should at least be offered the option of having the rectal culture collected by a healthcare provider.",

In addition, all tools used in our study have been added as appendix to facilitate researchers/ professionals in assessing the acceptability in other settings or countries. Second, it is important to note that we only explored the acceptability of oral culture-based antibiotic prophylaxis strategies. As a result, we cannot make statements about any barriers that may be experienced when testing for and administering intravenous antibiotics.

The instruction should at least contain the following information:the purpose of rectal culture collection in case of self-sampling: how to collect the swab the swab must be inserted into the intestine through the anal sphincter. N.B. do not state the exact number of cm the swab must be inserted as this could lead to uncertainty among patients about the correct depth of insertion.faecal material must be visible on the tip of the swab, then the sampling has been performed properly.the presence of lubricant or vaseline in the rectum (after internal examination) does not affect the collection of the swab. when and where to collect the swab. how to pack the tube. Pay special attention to this in case of self-sampling at home.when sampling at home: patients should return the sample as soon as possible after sampling (<24 hours) per post and store the tube in the refrigerator before posting. Due to the postal delivery, posting is possible from Monday to Thursday evening 5:00 PM. where to hand in the tube (including opening hours). contact details in case of questions or concerns. -Offer patients the option of having the rectal culture collected by a healthcare provider. -In case of self-sampling in the hospital: if possible, arrange that patients can sample themselves in a separate room at the outpatient department (instead of at the hospital toilet). -In case of self-sampling in the hospital: arrange that petroleum jelly is present so that, if desired, patient can apply it to the anal region to ensure easy insertion of the swab. -Provide a clear point of contact for patients to help resolve problems or concerns. -Contact the medical microbiologist in an early stage so that the laboratory can be prepared in time and to discuss how much time there must be scheduled between rectal culture collection and PB. Medical microbiology perspective -Ensure that there are clear protocols before implementation. -Provide instructions to laboratory technicians about the protocol and the usefulness of the culture-based prophylaxis strategy in reducing infectious complications and AMR during a scheduled team meeting prior to implementation. -Pay special attention to checking the shelf life of the culture media. -Provide a point of contact for laboratory technicians to help resolve problems or concerns.",
