ED doctors in 11 spoke hospitals were trained in performing vHIT, nystagmus detection and alternating cover test. Patients with first time acute dizziness, vertigo or imbalance, whether ongoing or resolved, presented to the teleneurologist were included in the analysis, as long as no focal neurological deficit according to the standard teleneurological examination or obvious internal medicine cause was present and a fully trained team was available. Primary outcome was defined as the feasibility of the telemedical HINTS examination. Results: From 01.06.2019 to 31.03.2020, 81 consecutive patients were included. In 72 (88.9%) cases the telemedical HINTS examination was performed. The complete telemedical HINTS examination was feasible in 46 cases (63.9%), nystagmus detection in all cases (100%) and alternating covert test in 70 cases (97.2%). The vHIT was recorded and interpretable in 47 cases (65.3%). Results of the examination with the VOG system yielded clear results in 21 cases (45.7%) with 14 central and 7 peripheral lesions.

            "text": "The quick differentiation between a central and a peripheral cause of dizziness/vertigo is crucial to start appropriate therapy in time, e.g., stroke unit therapy including thrombolysis in selected cases. In order to differentiate central and peripheral causes, the HINTS (Head Impulse test, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) is the best known clinical test battery in cases of acute dizziness/vertigo (10) . The HINTS examination is a battery of bedside clinical tests and consists of three examinations: the head impulse test, characterization of nystagmus and test of skew. It has been shown to be more reliable than a cranial MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in the first 48 h after the onset of vertigo symptoms in patients with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) (11) . Within the HINTS examination, the single best predictor for stroke is the clinically assessed horizontal head impulse test (HIT). A bilaterally normal result increases the odds of a stroke and an abnormal HIT is predictive for a peripheral vestibulopathy (9) . HIT is also the most challenging to perform and to interpret, and the expertise of the examiner affects results with sensitivity of maximum 70% [compared to video head impulse test (vHIT)] even in experienced neurootologists (12, 13) . This is, amongst other reasons, due to the fact that in a relevant proportion of individuals early corrective saccades in eye movements or so-called covert saccades are clinically not detectable. Clinically visible saccades with later onset are referred to as overt saccades. The clinical differentiation of correcting saccades from Nystagmus might therefore be difficult (14) . Furthermore, HIT is a subjective test without an objective verifiable approach. The quantitative analysis of HIT, called vHIT overcomes these limitations (10, (15) (16) (17) . It has already been shown in various studies that, compared to clinical bedside HIT, vHIT improves the HINTS examination (10, 17) . Moreover, HINTS examination's sensitivity and specificity are higher when tests are performed and interpreted by a trained neurologist rather than by emergency physicians (18) . Those specialists are mostly not available in the ED of primary care hospitals and due to lack of expertise HINTS examinations are often not performed at all (9) . In our study we built on those experiences and performed HINTS examinations via a VOG system. The technical examinations were included in a standard videoconferencing system to be assessed remotely by an experienced teleneurologist. Our telemedicine-supported project to examine patients with dizziness and vertigo (called TeleVertigo) may offer improved acute care in patients with acute dizziness, vertigo or imbalance in EDs of primary care hospitals (19) . This study aims to analyze the feasibility of a telemedical HINTS examination.",

The Telemedic Project for Integrative Stroke Care (TEMPiS) is a telestroke unit network in South East Bavaria, Germany, with two comprehensive stroke centers (hubs) and 24 primary stroke centers (spokes) (20) . Within this network any patient with suspicion of acute stroke admitted to the ED in one of the spokes is presented to a teleneurologist provided there is no consultant neurologist on site. In addition to the evaluation of computed tomography (CT) scans (or MRI) hyperacute treatment, e.g., recanalization therapies and stroke unit care, can be recommended. In the network more than 7.000 teleconsultations are performed annually.",

A VOG system plugged into the existing video conferencing system was established. This feature enables the remote teleneurologist to see even subtle eye movements and to instruct and evaluate the vHIT. According to the standard TEMPiS procedure, any patient examined via videoconference first undergoes medical history screening (including pre-existing conditions and medication) and stroke assessment including National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) classification. In dizzy and vertiginous patients and those with acute balance disturbance a more detailed neurological examination is performed provided it is possible via standard camera. In this study, according to a consensus statement of the Barany Society, we defined dizziness as \"the sensation of disturbed or impaired spatial orientation without a false or distorted sense of motion\" and vertigo as \"the sensation of self-motion when no self-motion is occurring or the sensation of distorted self-motion during an otherwise normal head movement\" (21) . If there are clear signs of either a central origin (mostly concomitant focal neurological deficits) or a primary internal disease in history, clinical examination, laboratory results or imaging explaining the patients' symptoms, they are admitted either to the stroke unit or to internal medicine ward respectively. If standard teleneurological examinations reveal no conclusive signs concerning the symptoms' etiology, examination with the VOG system is added. An algorithm for the HINTS examination for dizzy/vertiginous patients aimed at differentiating peripheral vs. central origin was implemented. Further detail can be found in an already published account on this system (19) . This study exclusively evaluates the telemedical HINTS examination.",

These lightweight video goggles include a light, small and very fast infra-red camera, a halfsilvered mirror reflecting infra-red light and small sensors measuring head movement velocity. Video goggles are secured to the patient's head with adjustable straps to minimize slippage. They were especially developed to document and quantify the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). In the telemedical setting, those video goggles are used additionally as a second camera during videoconferencing for detection of nystagmus and skew deviation. This allows teleconsultants to explore even subtle eye movements, which is not possible with a standard camera. The video goggles are plugged into the videoconferencing system on demand. The teleconsultant operates the video goggle software and camera, and the doctor in the spoke hospital carries out examinations on the patient (e.g., giving head impulses, covering the eye, etc.).",

Peak velocity of head impulses in these 14 cases was 220 \u00b1 42 on the right side and 204 \u00b1 31 on the left side with a mean gain of 1.02 \u00b1 0.13 and 0.96 \u00b1 0.15, respectively. In 25 cases (54.3%) the HINTS rule was not applicable as no nystagmus was detectable. For the application of the HINTS rule a nystagmus as part of a vestibular syndrome is required. Therefore, we classified these cases without any nystagmus as unclear with respect to the underlying etiology. For details see Table 3 .",

This study is the first evaluating a telemedical HINTS examination in ED patients of primary care hospitals. Our findings suggest that extensive area-covering and an 24/7 availability approach for the adequate workup of patients with acute dizziness and vertigo in hospitals without specialized neuro-otological care is possible. It may lead to a faster classification of these highly prevalent symptoms and may therefore be a relief not only for the patients but also regarding the socioeconomic burden. Reports are available on management improvements concerning dizzy patients via telemedicine. Zee et al. describe first experiences in the classification of patients with dizziness and vertigo in the ED by a \"Tele-Dizzy consultation service\" (26) . Greater diagnostic accuracy via a telemedical connection to the neuro-otological department in the same academic center is reported. Similarly to our project, a VOG device was employed. All other published reports about telemedicine in dizzy/vertiginous patients focus on aspects others than the acute management in the emergency department (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) . Most challenging to perform but the single best predictor of a stroke is the vHIT. The full interpretability of almost two thirds of telemedical vHIT examinations in our cohort is therefore a remarkable result. Furthermore, based on the analysis of peak velocities of telemedical vHITs, peak velocities of head impulses of around 210 \u2022 /s were reached, which is within recommended ranges (15) . Nystagmus detection as well as test of skew were evaluated by clinical assessment of the transmitted video. The employed VOG system also allows a quantitative evaluation of these tests and may further improve diagnostic accuracy.",

Absence of a nystagmus in all those cases, made the HINTS rule nonapplicable, and criteria for AVS were not met. AVS is a clinical syndrome of severe vertigo, nausea and vomiting, spontaneous nystagmus and postural instability (34) . Recent studies estimate a proportion of AVS in all ED cases with acute dizziness/vertigo of about 10-20% (7). The higher proportion in our sample of 46% may be explained by case selection, as we did not include cases with obvious internal medicine cause, focal neurological deficit (explored in the teleneurological examination) and recurrent vertigo/dizziness symptoms of known quality. Nevertheless, with 54% of unclassifiable cases, the telemedical HINTS examination alone is of limited value for ED triage when criteria for AVS are not met. This is in line with recent publications (18) . The addition of further symptom characteristics and tests may be of value. Further extensions of HINTS or new approaches to dizzy/vertiginous patients include addition of a bedside hearing test to HINTS (HINTS plus) to differentiate posterior fossa stroke from peripheral origin of vertigo (35) , a more extended access including symptom timing, triggers and bedside eye examination (TiTrATE) (36) or adding standing examination and search for positional vertigo (STANDING) (37) . Most of these items are integrated in the algorithm suggested by Venhovens et al. (38) . Improved approaches to vertigo and dizziness with well-defined algorithms and further developed technology may offer new telemedical approaches (19, 39) .",
