This period covered three semesters of studies, and due to these changes students experienced fundamental changes in their learning. The present research was carried out 3 times during the pandemic (e.g., May 2020, December 2020, and April 2021) to investigate study engagement and burnout, and their associations with various demands, resources, and psychological needs among university students. Self-reports were collected from 1501, 1526, and 1685 university students in Helsinki. The results showed that study burnout increased across the time points, being the highest in April 2021, whereas study engagement was the lowest in December 2020. Further, at the beginning of the pandemic the explanatory power of study-related demands and resources on study burnout and engagement was stronger, whereas in April 2021 the role of psychological needs increased. These results inform strategies to promote students' engagement through distance-learning, mitigating negative effects of the situation.",

            "text": "Study burnout is a study-related syndrome including exhaustion, negative cynical attitude towards studying and feelings of inadequacy as a student (Salmela-Aro et al., 2009; Salmela-Aro & Read, 2017) . Study engagement, in turn, can be defined as vigor, dedication and absorption towards studying (Salmela-Aro & Upadyaya, 2012; Salmela-Aro & Read, 2017) . Recent studies have revealed that study burnout can lead to depressive symptoms and increase the risk of dropping out from studying four times more, whereas study engagement can promote both life satisfaction and success in future educational transitions (Bask & Salmela-Aro, 2013; Salmela-Aro et al., 2021; Upadyaya & Salmela-Aro, 2015) . Both study engagement and burnout are multi-dimensional constructs, which consist of behavioral, affective, and cognitive components (Fredricks et al., 2004; Salmela-Aro et al., 2009; Upadyaya & Salmela-Aro, 2013) , and involve dynamic and reciprocal processes between the sub-components which influence and are influenced by the study environment (Wang & Degol, 2014) . Recent studies have recommended that study engagement and burnout should be investigated together (Salmela-Aro & Read, 2017; Tuominen-Soini & Salmela-Aro, 2014) , and it has been suggested that study engagement and burnout provide an adequate overview of students' study-related well-being (Salmela-Aro, 2017; Upadyaya & Salmela-Aro, 2013) . Engaged students have energy and are willing to put effort into their work (i.e., vigor), they feel driven, enthusiastic, and inspired (i.e., dedication), as well as entirely concentrated in studies that they enjoy doing (i.e., absorption). In contrast, school burnout occurs when students feel overwhelmed by the demands of their studies (Schaufeli et al., 2002) . As a result, these students tend to feel exhausted and pressured by their studies, may become cynical toward their studies, and come to feel inadequate or unable to reach their study goals. Study environment provides the opportunities and resources for engagement as well as demands for burnout to occur, and students' skills, needs and motivation determine how they engage within those opportunities. Recently, understanding both the opportunities and resources that support students' engagement and prevent from stress and burnout have become an important priority for educational policy and practice (Wang & Eccles, 2012) . the more likely the students are engaged (Salmela-Aro et al., 2021) . In turn, study burnout can be approached as a mismatch between distance online study resources and the demands imposed by the distance study context, such as technical challenges, which cause students to experience depletion of energy without gaining appropriate returns. In line with the study demands-resources model, two processes can be identified concerning the distance study context: a motivational process, in which distance study-related resources can lead to increased study engagement, and a health impairment process in which distance studyrelated demands lead to study-related strain and stress and problems with mental health (see also Bakker & Demerouti, 2006) . In support of the model, findings from longitudinal research have shown that study burnout and engagement also spill over from the study domain-specific context to general ill-and wellbeing (Salmela-Aro et al., 2021; Upadyaya & Salmela-Aro, 2017) : engagement predicts later life satisfaction, whereas burnout predicts subsequent depressive symptoms. Longitudinal studies have shown that engagement predicts higher grades, successful educational transitions, and later satisfaction with chosen educational pathways (Upadyaya & Salmela-Aro, 2015) . Study burnout, in turn, predicts decreases in educational aspirations (Salmela-Aro, & Upadyaya, 2017; Widlund et al., 2021) , a fourfold greater likelihood of dropping out (Bask & Salmela-Aro, 2013; Parker et al., 2015) , and decreases in academic achievement (Madigan & Curran, 2020 ). In the current study, we examine the role of distance study-related demands and resources in explaining study burnout and engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

While today's students are generally well-prepared to engage with digital technologies in their studies, smaller groups of students can be identified to whom it is not the case and who are particularly vulnerable (Nguyen et al., 2020) . Furthermore, less digitally adept students may experience a double burden, caused by higher digital demands due to distance learning as well as unfavorable, stress-related emotions and loneliness (H\u00e4ndel et al., 2020) . However, students that were already well-versed with digital technologies and social media before the pandemic may have been better equipped to harvest the benefits provided by these digital tools as resources and avenues to keep up sense of relatedness (Cantanero et al., 2021) , and to mitigate the negative effects of social distancing (Orben et al, 2020 ).",

Basic psychological need satisfaction can also act as a buffer in times of crisis, such as during COVID-19, reducing possible stress and promoting adaptive coping with the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., Vansteenkiste & Ryan, 2013) . Competence refers to achieving one's goals and experiencing one's related behavior as effective and competent. University students feel effective and competent when they are able to meet the requirements of their studies, such as progress with their courses. Autonomy refers to experiencing one's behavior as volitional. University students feel autonomous when they willingly put effort and time to their university studies and feel internal motivation. Relatedness refers to feeling connected with other students, and experiencing mutual support from others, such as teachers, peers and parents Niemiec & Ryan, 2009 ): The need for social relatedness refers to feeling connected to and accepted by others. In the current study, we examine the role of psychological needs, competence, autonomy, and relatedness for study engagement and burnout during COVID-19.",

            "text": "In the context of OECD Education 2030 Learning Compass, the role of higher education institutions is not only to impart knowledge, but to develop the whole student by providing opportunities for wellbeing, thriving, and personal growth. OECD Learning Compass highlights three issues: First, the learning compass points towards wellbeing highlighting the importance of student wellbeing for learning. Second, the learning compass highlights the importance of new transformational competences, creating new value, reconciling with challenges, and taking responsibility which are in line with psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Third, the learning compass highlights both student agency and co-agency with peers for learning and wellbeing. Universities foster a range of transversal skills such as complex and autonomous thinking (European Commission, 2017) , and enable social contacts and interaction, offer chances to build networks, establish new friendships, and provide experiences of belonging to the institution (Tonon, 2020) . Universities represent an important developmental context for young people to acquire their developmental tasks and unfold their potentials, and to experience relatedness and sense of belonging in the peer group. The lockdown of universities due to the COVID-19 crisis is thus an unprecedented challenge for students' engagement and may hinder students' possibilities for thriving. Rapid transitions from face-to-face classes to online distance learning environments occurred at the beginning of the pandemic when universities worldwide switched to distance education in order to enable young people to continue their studies (Marinoni et al., 2020; Murphy, 2020) . Distance education refers to an umbrella term, and its implementation varies greatly, even oftentimes it involves three factors: (1) lack of physical presence, (2) less informal discourse, and (3) declines in spontaneous social interaction between students and teachers. These factors can lead to communication gaps between teachers and students, as well as gaps in understanding, which may further manifest as negative emotions, and misconceptions (Moore, 1993) . However, less is known about students' psychological needs and challenges in distance learning environments, and there is a need to examine them further. Numerous studies have shown that social relatedness is often associated with academic success in both in-person and distance learning environments, thus, it would be important to support interaction among students in any learning settings (Smith & Naylor, 2001; Tom\u00e1s-Miquel et al., 2016) . Moreover, consistent evidence exists showing that relatedness is an important factor contributing to one's psychological well-being (e.g., Olsson et al., 2013; Reis et al., 2000) , which further highlights the relevance of maintaining social contacts even during the pandemic, either with other students participating the same distance learning environment or with other social contacts outside of the university.",

Previous studies have revealed that autonomous, individualized learning environments create optimal learning conditions for students to experience themselves as competent (Niemiec & Ryan, 2009 ). According to self-determination theory, both autonomy and competence are necessary conditions for intrinsic motivation . Moreover, relatedness has been found to be related to positive emotion, in line with previous studies pointing to the high relevance of social contacts for students' well-being (Damon et al., 2003; Kern et al., 2015) .

In M1a and M1b the intercept should be interpreted as the baseline mean for the dependent variable, whereas positive or negative Times 2 or 3 effects would indicate cumulative change over time (in comparison to the baseline). To answer RQ2, distance study related demands and resources alongside with their interaction terms with measurement time were included as predictors of study engagement and burnout (Models M2a and M2b). To answer RQ3, basic psychological needs and their interaction terms with measurement time were included as predictors of study engagement and burnout (Models M3a and M3b). The direct effects from demands, resources, and psychological needs to engagement and burnout in M2a to M3b should be interpreted as the effects of the predictor at baseline (Time 1), whereas the Time*Predictor interaction terms differing from zero would indicate that the effect of the predictors is higher/lower in certain timepoint in comparison to baseline, which further indicates change over time in the dependent variables. In order to examine RQ4 further, we compared the two theories by estimating the models 2 and 3 separately for each measurement point and compared how well the two theories explained variance in study engagement and burnout by using marginal R 2 with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals-nonoverlapping intervals indicating differing explanatory power.

            "text": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic many universities closed their doors from in-person teaching for over one and a half years. These changes likely had severe implications on university students' study burnout and engagement. The present study examined how study-related burnout and engagement developed among students across the COVID-19 pandemic in University of Helsinki. In addition, the associations between distance study demands and resources, psychological needs, and study burnout and engagement were examined. Supporting our expectations, the results showed that study burnout increased across the time points, being the highest in April 2021, whereas study engagement was the lowest in December fall 2020. However, study engagement bounced back during the second spring (2021) of the pandemic to the same level with the first COVID-19 spring (May 2020). Supporting our expectations, distance study-related demands were associated with lower study engagement and higher burnout, whereas resources were associated with higher study engagement and lower burnout, and the role of distance study demands attenuated during April 2021. It is possible that at the beginning of the pandemic when University of Helsinki students were still getting used to the life under the new restrictions caused by the pandemic, they also faced more distance study demands (e.g., planning daily schedules, technical challenges). However, as time passed on, students acquired new skills on how to manage their daily lives and distance study challenges, and the role of such demands in their study burnout reduced, and the role of psychological needs, such as the need for relatedness, became more pronounced. Supporting our expectations related to RQ3, the results showed that while generally the influence of autonomy and competence in predicting higher study engagement and lower burnout were strong in May 2020, the role of relatedness seemed to increase during the pandemic-especially concerning study burnout. The results showed that especially in April 2021 relatedness was negatively associated with study burnout. This result is likely to reflect the long period of isolation and increased loneliness among the university students during the long lockdown period. Thus students' social contacts reduced drastically, increasing students' stress, loneliness (Zheng et al., 2021) , and burnout (Salmela-Aro et al., 2021) , and when the situation became prolonged, our results showed that the effect of relatedness became more pronounced and an important factor reducing burnout. In addition, it is possible that over the pandemic, students learned new ways how to strengthen their connections to friends and peers, which manifested as relatedness in the present study, and was further negatively associated with burnout symptoms. For example, university of Helsinki provided increasing support for students across the pandemic (e.g., online resources and support from psychologists, instructions and tips for remote studying, support and online courses to promote personal well-being), which might have increased students' feelings of relatedness at the later phases of the pandemic.",

However, later on during the pandemic the role of psychological needs increased, supporting our expectations. The explanatory power of both demandsresources and basic psychological needs increased during December 2020 whereas in April 2021 the demands-resources model explained considerably less of the variation in burnout and engagement compared to December 2020, and compared to the concurrent basic psychological needs satisfaction.

For example, at the beginning of a crisis situation students may need more support concerning coping with distance study demands (e.g., technological support, scheduling support), whereas later on, if the crisis is prolonged, support related to basic psychological needs (e.g., social support, promoting sense of belonging) would be required. This was indicated by the findings showing that elements of self-determination theory, in terms of basic psychological needs, explained over 50% (R 2 = 0.53) of the variation in study burnout during April 2021. Accordingly, the present study identified a high relevance of competence, autonomy, and relatedness in later phases of COVID-19 for university of Helsinki students' study engagement and burnout. Even in a distancelearning context, it is possible to promote all of the three basic psychological needs among university students. Based on the identified high relevance of students' competence, distance education in times of crisis is required to explicitly enable students to experience successes. Through individualized, personalized, and simultaneously autonomy-supportive learning opportunities it would be possible to provide experiences of success. For example, by challenging students based on their individual resources and strengths. Experiences of success can be also promoted by setting intermediate goals and enough individual feedback (Oliveira et al., 2018) . University students miss individual discussion concerning their studies, and thus individual, personalized support and guidance from the university staff and teachers to students could be provided via online digital platforms. Moreover, promoting relatedness is highly important, and identification with the university in the current situation, and digital learning platforms can be used to enable online group work in a situation where physical distance is required. To foster feelings of learning together as a group, synchronous learning units should be used to reflect on learning processes, successes, as well as struggles and to promote cohesion within the group. Moreover, in crisis situations universities should make every effort to reopen as soon as possible after the closures, as public health restrictions allow.",

In addition, the data collection in each sample was cross-sectional by nature, and modelled as such, yet we cannot be certain whether some students participated more than once. The inclusion of the random intercept at the faculty and starting year level, however, adjusts for this uncertainty to a certain extent. University of Helsinki student population were well represented, with the exception that female students were overrepresented in the sample (+ 11%). Such gender imbalance is likely to induce some bias as female students tend to report both higher study engagement and study burnout. In addition, we cannot separate random sampling variation from variation caused by the continuing pandemic situation and context-that said, the effects found are, however, theoretically predictable.",
