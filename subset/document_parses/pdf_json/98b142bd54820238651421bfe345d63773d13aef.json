Persons affected by Long COVID report various health problems, yet evidence to guide clinical decision making remains scarce. Objective The present study aimed to identify Long COVID research priorities using a citizen science approach and solely considering the needs of those affected. Methods This citizen science study followed an iterative process of patient needs identification, evaluation and prioritisation. A Long COVID Citizen Science Board (21 persons with Long COVID, and seven with myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome) and a Long COVID Working Group (25 persons with Long COVID, four patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and one relative) were formed. The study included four activities: three remote meetings and one online survey. First, Board members identified the needs and research questions. Second, Working Group members and persons affected by Long COVID (241 respondents, 85.5% with Long COVID, 14.5% with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and 7.1% relatives) evaluated the research questions on a 1-5 Likert scale using an online survey. Then the Board gave feedback on this evaluation. Finally, Board members set the priorities for research through voting and discussion. Results Sixty-eight research questions were generated by the Board and categorised into four research domains (medicine, healthcare services, socioeconomics and burden of disease) and 14 subcategories. Their average importance ratings were moderate to high and varied from 3.41 (standard deviation = 1.16) for sex-specific diagnostics to 4.86 (standard deviation = 0.41) for medical questions on treatment. Five topics were prioritised: \"treatment, rehabilitation and chronic care management\", \"availability of interfaces for treatment continuity\", \"availability of healthcare structures\", \"awareness and knowledge among professionals\" and \"prevalence of Long COVID in children and adolescents\". Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study developing a citizen-driven, explicitly patient-centred research agenda with persons affected by Long COVID, setting it apart from existing multi-stakeholder efforts. The identified priorities could guide future research and funding allocation. Our methodology establishes a framework for citizen-driven research agendas, suitable for transfer to other diseases.",

Population-based prevalence estimates for adults centre around 20% but there is a large variability across studies depending on the population studied, the length of the follow-up period and the chosen definition of Long COVID [1] [2] [3] . People commonly report fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disorders, pain or inability to return to work or have a normal social life [2] . Such longterm consequences are referred to by the World Health Organization as a post-COVID-19 condition. As such, \"post COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis\" [4] . While the World Health Organization uses the term \"post COVID-19 condition\", those affected have been using the term \"Long COVID\", which seems to be broadly accepted and widely used across media platforms and by the general population [5] . As our research directly involved affected people, we decided to consistently use the term \"Long COVID\".",

(Fig. 1) [11, 12] . We explicitly aimed for an exploratory approach, characterised by an open group process with iterative development and fewer boundaries. This approach allowed for co-creative participation and enabled us to keep bringing new ideas into the discussion and, most importantly, to be more flexible in responding to the needs of the citizen scientists. For this purpose, we built two different types and intensities of participation: a Long COVID Citizen Science Board and a Long COVID Working Group. For both, citizen scientists were recruited online via the Altea Long COVID Network platform (https:// www. altea-netwo rk. com/ en/) that is funded by the Federal Office of Public Health and other supporters and Long Covid Switzerland's Facebook group. Because Altea started as a Germanspeaking platform, and the members of Long Covid Switzerland's Facebook Group were also mainly from the German-speaking and French-speaking part of Switzerland, we mainly reached people from these regions. Citizen scientists were eligible if they were (i) affected by Long COVID, (ii) relatives of a person affected by Long COVID or (ii) patients with ME/CFS. We decided to include relatives because they are closely involved and often also strongly affected. We also invited patients with ME/CFS, who share several common symptoms with Long COVID-affected people, to include a long-term perspective, which may still be missing among the other participants. Patients with Long COVID in Switzerland had been in contact with people with ME from the first months of the pandemic as they not only share similar symptoms but also strategies to overcome the stigmatisation. Patients with ME added medical, social and economic perspectives, which would have been difficult to gather from scientific publications. It was important to coordinate efforts between the two communities, to learn from each other and be as inclusive as possible. Registration was open from 25 March to 18 April, 2021 and interested parties could sign up for the Citizen Science Board, the Working Group or both.",

For this purpose, we structured the meeting into plenary sessions and breakout groups using MURAL. MURAL is a web platform that provides blank boards to work in teams with virtual Post-Its and drawings. These acceleration room techniques allowed participants to table their thoughts personally or anonymously on the MURAL board that was serving as a whiteboard, structuring the discussions and automatically generating a written document. After the first Board meeting, we structured the identified participants' needs based on their content into overall research domains and subcategories. In a second step, we translated all identified and categorised needs into research questions. Consensus was reached through multiple rounds of discussion and subsequent revisions among the research team. As the aim of these questions was to guide future research and funding allocation, we explicitly derived general and not specific clinical research questions using the PICO framework [14] .

From these, we formulated 68 research questions considering the broader scientific context. The questions were allocated to four overarching research domains and 14 subcategories. Some contributions from the first Board meeting could not be formulated as research questions, as they were mostly requests, questions, and concerns that required already established regulatory and infrastructural processes (e.g. legal or clinical guidelines). These were listed in a separate category defined as \"further questions\" (Electronic Supplementary Material). An overview of the four emerged research domains and 14 subcategories is presented in Fig. 2 . The first domain, named \"medical questions\", consisted of 32 research questions grouped into six subcategories (A1-A6): A1 \"risk factors\", A2 \"disease development\", A3 \"definition and differential diagnosis\", A4 \"prognosis\", A5 \"treatment, rehabilitation and chronic care management\" and A6 \"vaccination\". The second domain, \"questions about healthcare structures\", included 20 research questions grouped into four subcategories (B1-B4): B1 \"availability of healthcare structures for diagnosis\", B2 \"availability of interfaces for treatment continuity\", B3 \"availability of healthcare structures\" and B4 \"awareness and knowledge among professionals\". The third domain named \"socioeconomic questions\" included eight research questions split into two subcategories (C1-C2): C1 \"acceptance and stigmatisation\" and C2 \"work and socioeconomic consequences\". Finally, the fourth domain, \"burden of disease\" included eight research questions split into two subcategories (D1-D2): D1 \"Prevalence of Long COVID among adults\" and D2 \"Prevalence of Long COVID among children and adolescents\".",

A similar geographic distribution to that of citizen scientists is also evident among survey participants. The majority (n = 198) live in Germanspeaking Switzerland and some live in French-speaking cantons (n = 43). Most of the participants were affected by Long COVID (85.5%), 14.5 % had ME/CFS and 7.1% were relatives. For details, see Table 1 . Table 2 shows, in descending order, the participants' median and average ratings (and standard deviations) of the level of importance of each research question with a range from 1 (not important) to 5 (very important) by domain. In general, none of the 68 research questions was rated as unimportant or less important and all ratings exceeded 3 (neither important nor unimportant). As shown in Fig. 3a , there was a large variation in the level of importance between the 68 research questions and within the four research domains. While research question A5.1 \"What existing and new therapeutic approaches/treatment methods, depending on diagnosis and severity, are effective to treat Long COVID patients?\" scored the highest at 4.86 (standard deviation 0.41), the research question A3.3 \"Are there differences in diagnostic criteria between men and women?\" scored the lowest at 3.41 (standard deviation = 1.16). Despite the large variation within the four research domains, some of the 14 subcategories were perceived to be more important than others. As such, participants consistently rated the subcategory D2 \"prevalence of Long COVID in children and adolescents\", A5 \"treatment, rehabilitation and chronic care management\", A2 \"disease development\", B4 \"awareness and knowledge among professionals\" and B3 \"availability of healthcare structures\" as important or very important (Fig. 3b) .

Indeed, standard medical care is currently insufficient to alleviate the heterogeneous symptom burden of Long COVID. Our results emphasise the importance of appropriate care structures for adequate diagnosis and treatment, including efficiently regulated supply processes, improved continuity of care and better awareness, as well as knowledge about and understanding of Long COVID among healthcare professionals. This indicates an increased need for integrated multi-disciplinary care structures [17] as an integral part of care management, incrementally, over the course of the illness. More research on health services is needed to determine how such approaches can be linked to existing care structures to make efficient use of available resources.",

Our results show that at an individual level, people were concerned about losing their jobs and potential stigmatisation by healthcare professionals, as well as by the broader social environment, including work and family. Evidence on Long COVID-related stigmatisation remains scarce, but the lack of adequate healthcare structures may indicate institutional discrimination [18] . Institutional discrimination occurs when healthcare systems fail to provide the right care to people because of their health condition [19] . In the case of Long COVID, major drivers for possible institutional discrimination are likely to be the lack of a universal definition until recently and the complex diagnostic procedures. For instance, in many countries, people experiencing Long COVID are only entitled to sick leave after a confirmed diagnosis [20] . Further, a recent living systematic review revealed that Long COVID can affect patients' family life, social functioning and ability to work [1] . In line with this, the National Institute for Health and Research found that Long COVID affected patients' ability to work in 80% of respondents and patients' family life in 71% of surveyed patients [2] . The full extent of Long COVID's socioeconomic implications remains to be determined. Despite this, socioeconomic questions are not a priority in the research agendas developed by multi-stakeholder approaches [2, 9, 10, 21] .",

A longitudinal cohort study found that 2-4% of children enrolled in the first and the second wave of the pandemic reported at least one symptom lasting beyond 12 weeks of acute infection [22] . Long COVID in children and adolescents was prioritised equally strongly only by one multistakeholder study known to us [10] . The Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Evaluation of Social Services (SBU) also collected research questions on Long COVID in children but did not prioritise them further [9] . This may be an indication of diverging priorities between those affected by Long COVID and other stakeholders.",
