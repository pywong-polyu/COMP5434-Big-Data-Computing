Though, few studies have been done to identify predictors of stillbirth, the most important predictors were not assessed. Therefore, this study assessed predictors of still birth by incorporating the most proximate factors affecting birth outcomes in the study setting. Of the variables that were assessed in this study; having no ANC visit, being hypertensive during pregnancy, having cesarean section mode of delivery, having multiple pregnancies and preterm birth had a significant association with stillbirth. Mothers who had no ANC visits were almost four times at a higher risk of developing stillbirth than mothers who had ANC visits. This finding is consistent with those of studies conducted in Northern Ethiopia and Nepal [26, 27] . This could be because mothers who had no antenatal care visits will not receive any antenatal care services including risk assessment, care provision, and health promotion. Hence, mothers who had no ANC visits will not gain a screening opportunity for certain risk factors that are associated with antepartum hemorrhage, intrapartum hemorrhage, certain medical conditions, infection, or hypertensive disorder. If risks are found, health care providers will not have the opportunity to manage or treat specific conditions. Additionally, they could not provide counseling to mothers and families, all of which could not help to prevent stillbirth. This report also indicates that the provision of good and sufficient perinatal counseling in the MCH clinic will help to mitigate the problem of stillbirth.",

The 2019 EMDHS results show that 74% of women who gave birth in the 5 years preceding the survey received antenatal care from a skilled provider at least once during their last pregnancy. Four in 10 women (43%) had four or more ANC visits for their most recent live births [32] . Moreover, large disparities exist in the access to antenatal care by socioeconomic status, with women from rural residents and those with the least education have the lowest access to care in Ethiopia [32] . Hypertension during pregnancy is significantly associated with stillbirths. Mothers with hypertension during pregnancy were almost 3 times more likely to develop stillbirth compared to mothers who had no hypertension during pregnancy. This finding is congruent with those of studies conducted in Taiwan, Nepal, and England [28, 29, 35] . This is because mothers who have hypertension during pregnancy do not have sufficient blood flow to the placenta compared with mothers who have no hypertension during pregnancy. In addition to this, blood pressure falls by the second trimester in most cases but rises during the third trimester to a level somewhat above in the early pregnancy. Hence, the fetus will receive less oxygen and fewer nutrients, which in turn causes the fetus to be born a stillbirth.",

This health challenge often develops prematurely and is worse than that in gestation with one baby. It can also accelerate the early separation of the placenta (placental abruption).
