In August of 2020, a university in North Carolina recorded 670 new cases of COVID-19 within 22 days of reopening [4] , resulting in the university transitioning all classes to online format. Similarly, an outbreak on a university campus in Indiana resulted in 371 new cases between 16-22 August 2020 [5] . This prompted the university to transition classes online on 19 August 2020 before returning to in-person instruction on 2 September 2020. Additionally, Duke University identified 84 new cases from 2 August 2020-11 October 2020, which did not require a transition to online classes [6] . While these studies present responses to individual outbreaks, a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 management strategies spanning an entire academic year has not been reported. Such evidence-based guidance is needed as easing public restrictions and increased vaccine availability are leading universities to consider resuming fully in-person operations. This is especially true since SARS-CoV-2 variants among other emerging pathogens could leave institutions vulnerable to outbreaks.",

Temperature check stations were utilized before entering high traffic buildings, and room sanitation was conducted before the start of each class.

Transmission risk was classified according to NCAA guidelines, which is based on sport-specific environments that would contribute to the likelihood of the spread of respiratory droplets during vigorous activity. Common characteristics of sports classified as high risk for transmission of COVID-19, were sports played indoors (or in poorly ventilated spaces) and/or environments where sport-specific activities demand frequent close contact between competitors and teammates. Low/intermediate risk sports were characterized by outdoor environments where physical distancing can be consistently maintained and/or by sport-specific activities that facilitated at most, short-lived close contact between teammates and competitors. One exception of our classification to that of the NCAA guidelines was water sports. Swimming and diving, which is listed by the NCAA guidelines as low risk, was combined with the high-risk water polo because of the overlap of these student-athletes between these three sports.",

Pennsylvania state exhibited a gradual increase in the number of COVID-19 cases between 3 December 2020 and 28 January 2021, recording its largest count of 12,798 new cases on 10 December 2020. An additional increase in state cases was identified between 19 March 2021 and 29 April 2021, peaking at 7078 cases on 12 April 2021. In contrast, Gannon experienced episodic rises in cases including two small outbreaks occurring 40 days into the fall semester-the first on 16 September 2020 (four positive cases) and again on 1 October 2020 (five positive cases). Gannon's highest daily case count of COVID-19 occurred on 27 November 2020 when it recorded 10 new cases. Several of Gannon's outbreaks that were distinguishable from state trends were marked with a high percentage of infection among student-athletes. For example, 90% of positive cases recorded on 27 November 2020 were student-athletes. Additionally, student-athletes made up 40% of all cases on 1 October 2020, and 100% of all cases on 16 September 2020. also true of the high percent positivity of new COVID-19 cases recorded on 29 December 2020 (10.0%) compared with the relatively low number of new cases recorded on that day. With these exceptions, the trends between new COVID-19 cases at Gannon and the percentage of samples positive for COVID-19 were similar. This is also reflected when comparing the total case counts with the percent of samples positive for COVID-19 for those tested statewide ( Figure S1 ). ",

This suggests that some positive specimens may not have viral loads which can be reliably distinguished by this limit of detection. Additionally, the timing of testing can influence the detectable signal produced by presence of SARS-CoV-2 in an individual, with a mean incubation period of 4-5 days post-exposure [11] . This implies that tests administered to infected individuals before this period may not have sufficient viral load to produce detectable signal. Lowering the minimum threshold of detection is a strategy that can increase the likelihood of identifying samples with low SARS-CoV-2 viral load but risks an increased number of false positive results. Regardless, our results were remarkably consistent with those of a CLIA certified reference lab and allowed for a rapid and aggressive public health response to outbreaks of COVID-19 on campus. Hence, while we were unable to identify all COVID-19 cases within our campus environment, our strategy was effective in mitigating COVID-19 spread in a way that allowed Gannon to resume in-person instruction and activities for the entire academic year.",

The few exceptions were on days where total volume of testing was low.",

First, despite adoption of national and state guidance for mitigating spread of COVID-19 on campus, along with enhancing measures that included rapid surveillance testing, Gannon was only able to limit but not eliminate the occurrence of outbreaks of COVID-19 on its campus. This suggests that state guidance and enhanced protocols are necessary but not sufficient in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in a university campus environment. Second, our data provides evidence that the unique trends we observe at Gannon compared with statewide data are not largely due to difference in daily testing volume, but instead arise from unique features of the campus community which cannot be easily predicted from statewide trends.",

For days where athlete status was known, 45.9% of all COVID-19 cases on Gannon's campus were student-athletes (Table 2 ). An important note is that athletes across risk designations experienced a comparable percent of samples positive for COVID-19. Athletic teams designated as high-risk for transmission of COVID-19 had an average incidence of 14.3, which is remarkably similar to the average incidence of low/intermediate risk athletic teams of 14.9. This indicates that student-athletes as a population, regardless of the risk designation for individual sports are prone to contracting COVID-19, and should be surveilled in increased, and comparable volumes across all sports. This demonstrates that risk classifications for sports is not a relevant indicator for transmission risk of COVID-19. A plausible explanation for this finding is that strict preventative measures (masking, temperature checks, frequent sanitation, and symptom reporting, etc.) are in place during practices and competition for all sports at Gannon, which may decrease the risk of transmission irrespective of risk factors. Regardless, given the high incidence of COVID-19 found in athlete groups within our population, studies that further explore events and/or behaviors associated with the transmission of COVID-19 are warranted.",

Despite this, we noted disproportionately high COVID-19 incidence within this population compared with non-athletes ( Figure 2 ). The risk ratio associated with these incidences demonstrates that student-athletes on Gannon's campus were nearly 5 times more likely to contract COVID-19 compared with non-athletes. While the exact reason for higher incidence of COVID-19 in student-athletes is unknown, the information gathered from contact tracing suggests repeated group gatherings, that are non-compliant with safety protocols, rather than sport related activities are likely reasons. A possible explanation is that athletes in university environments typically coexist in larger social groups than other campus populations and frequently interact with other team members, and across athletic teams. Frequent and sustained social interactions present a large risk for the spread of contagion [13] , which is evidence to suggest that athletes as a university population are at high risk for contracting COVID-19. In support of this, an outbreak of COVID-19 on a university men's and women's soccer team demonstrated by whole-genome sequencing that 17 new cases across both teams, likely emanated from a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 during multiple social gatherings between teams, where preventative measures were not taken [3] .",

Second, the frequency in which a particular athlete group was tested showed no statistical relationship between COVID-19 incidence rates.

Based on this information, a focus on enhanced surveillance and prevention strategies which targets the entire student-athlete population is warranted. In addition, since our study could not fully exclude the possibility that other student populations are prone to high COVID-19 incidence rates, routine testing of all student populations is recommended if resources are available.
