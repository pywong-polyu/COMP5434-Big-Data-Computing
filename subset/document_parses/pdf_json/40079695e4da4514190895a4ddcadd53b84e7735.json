These data raise important questions about the relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes concerning causality, biological mechanisms, and implications for clinical care and public health.",

Diabetes was defined by International Classification of Diseases-10 diagnosis codes or an HbA 1c of more than 6\u00b74% (46 mmol/mol). The authors used inverse probability weighted survival analyses, including predefined and algorithmically selected high dimensional variables and reported two measures of risk; hazard ratio (HR) and burden per 1000 people at 12 months.",

COVID-19 survivors also had an increased risk (HR 1\u00b785, 95% CI 1\u00b778-1\u00b792) and excess burden (12\u00b735, 11\u00b736-13\u00b738) of incident antihyperglycaemic use. Results were consistent when historical controls were used. The association between COVID-19 and diabetes was consistent across strata of several potential confounders, namely, age, sex, race, BMI, diabetes risk score, steroid use, and area deprivation scores. The authors also did a full range of sensitivity analyses, including accounting for missing data with multiple imputation. Furthermore, an exposure-response relationship between severity of the acute infection, as shown by the care setting (non-hospitalised, hospitalised, or admitted to intensive care), and diabetes incidence was found. Notably, even those with mild, non-hospitalised COVID-19 had an excess 1-year burden of 8\u00b728 per 1000 persons (95% CI 6\u00b797-9\u00b762). However, a major weaknesses of the study is the inclusion of a study population that was predominantly White and male. Furthermore, socioeconomic factors imposed by COVID-19 were not taken into account and there was no assessment for differential diabetes testing between cases and controls. Nevertheless, these data warrant further multipronged investigations.",

Factors postulated to influence long-term complications of COVID-19 should also be measured, including severity of infection, viral load, and the presence of antibodies signalling auto-immune attack. 4 Variables that might help explain potential mechanisms for any association between COVID and diabetes should also be collected (eg, multiple point insulins, C-peptides, pancreatic and hepatic ectopic fat, and body composition), as well as co-occurring conditions, such as cardiovascular events, 5 that could share disease mechanisms with diabetes pathogenesis. Studies should examine the extent that biological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection are specific to diabetes or generalised by similar mechanisms across multiple systems.",

Among the most intriguing of hypotheses to explain the COVID-19 and diabetes connection is that SARS-CoV-2 virus might infect and replicate in the pancreas, injuring exocrine and endocrine cells. 6, 7 Analysis of autopsy samples suggests that COVID-19 infection could lead to beta cell transdifferentiation mediated by the eIF2 signalling pathway. 8 Other potential mechanisms, which the authors mention, are also worthy of investigation, including autonomic dysfunction, immune response or induced autoimmunity, and low grade inflammation. 3 All of these factors should be considered within a real-world context of preadmission diabetes, steroidinduced diabetes, and sources of stress hyperglycaemia. 9 The data presented by Xie and Al-Aly 3 have major implications for clinical policy and public health. If COVID-19 is indeed a risk factor for diabetes in the postacute phase of infection, screening and management of dysglycaemia should be an integral part of clinical guidelines for COVID-19 diagnosis and follow-up. The long-term implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection increasing diabetes risk are profound. The rates of type 2 diabetes, and associated non-communicable diseases, are already growing, as shown on the diabetes atlas by the International Diabetes Federation. With large and growing numbers of people worldwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 (434 154 739 cumulative cases by Feb 28, 2022), 10 any COVID-19-related increases in diabetes incidence could lead to unprecedented cases of diabetes worldwide-wreaking havoc on already over-stretched and under-resourced clinical and public health systems globally, with devastating tolls in terms of deaths and suffering.",
