Here we show a sensitive method to measure polyclonal T cell activation by downstream effects on responder cells like basophils, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes and neutrophils in whole blood. We report a clear T cell hyporeactivity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients that is pronounced in ventilated patients, associated with prolonged virus persistence and reversible with clinical recovery. COVID-19-induced T cell hyporeactivity is T cell extrinsic and caused by plasma components, independent of occasional immunosuppressive medication of the patients. Monocytes respond stronger in males than females and IL-2 partially restores T cell activation. Downstream markers of T cell hyporeactivity are also visible in fresh blood samples of ventilated patients. Based on our data we developed a score to predict fatal outcomes and identify patients that may benefit from strategies to overcome T cell hyporeactivity.",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fatal outcomes are also associated with hyperinflammation and microthrombosis 7 . Activated monocytes/macrophages contribute to death in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection 8 and also seem to play an important role in hyperinflammation in human SARS-CoV-2 infection 9, 10 . Monocytes are activated by a wide range of signals, including pathogen-derived signals (e.g. nucleic acids) and T-cell-derived signals (e.g. cytokines) 11 . The innate immune system seems to be insufficient to rapidly clear SARS-CoV-2 infection by itself, as SARS-CoV-2-specific T-and B-cell responses develop in most patients [12] [13] [14] . Virus-specific T-cell responses and neutralizing antibodies, typically generated in a Tcell-dependent manner, are considered essential for viral clearance 15 . Potential benefits of plasma obtained from convalescent COVID-19 patients also points into this direction 16, 17 . On the other hand, hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients might be caused by excessive T-cell responses that activate monocytes and neutrophils. Beneficial effects of dexamethasone indicate that hyperinflammation contributes to fatal outcomes 18, 19 . However, dexamethasone does not only interfere with T-cell activation and could also exert therapeutic effects by blocking excessive innate immune responses against viral components.",

To measure Tcell reactivity, we used fresh heparinized whole blood and polyclonally activated the T cells with immobilized anti-CD3 antibodies. T-cell activation was quantified not only by cytokine release but also by downstream effects on various cell types including basophils, pDCs, monocytes, and neutrophils. In preparation for the study, we have established that T-cell activation results in strong activation of basophils measured by upregulation of CD203c and downregulation of the IL-3-receptor beta-chain CD131 (used in this study). Basophils strongly express IL-3receptors but only low levels of GM-CSF-and IL-5-receptors that also use CD131 for signal transduction 30 . Thus, among a variety of cytokines IL-3 is mainly responsible for downregulation of CD131 on basophils ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). pDCs express IL-3and GM-CSF-receptors; thus both cytokines contribute to downregulation of CD131 on pDCs ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) . CD14 + monocytes respond to T-cell activation by a very pronounced upregulation of the IL-3-receptor alpha-chain CD123. Various cytokines, including IL-3, GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-15, IFNgamma, IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha induce a strong upregulation of CD123 on monocytes ( Supplementary Fig. 1c) . Thus monocytes integrate a larger set of direct and indirect T-cell-derived signals. Similarly, neutrophils respond to a large set of cytokines with upregulation of CD11b ( Supplementary Fig. 1d) .",

In COVID-19 patients these changes were much weaker. Ventilated COVID-19 patients showed no significant downregulation of CD131 on pDCs, a weak downregulation of CD131 on basophils (to 77%), a weak upregulation of CD123 on monocytes (to 345%), and of CD11b on neutrophils (to 424%). Responses of non-ventilated patients were in-between the responses of ventilated patients and healthy controls. Duration of T-cell hyporeactivity as defined by weak upregulation of CD123 and CD11b was significantly associated with prolonged viral replication in these patients (Supplementary Table 2 ). Absolute expression levels of surface markers on basophils, pDCs, monocytes, and neutrophils and representative FACS dot plots of unstimulated and anti-CD3-stimulated whole blood cells are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary  Fig. 3 . Downregulation of CD131 on basophils was almost completely dependent on the release of IL-3 as shown with a blocking antibody against IL-3, while downregulation of CD131 on pDCs was only partially dependent on IL-3 ( Supplementary  Fig. 2a, b) . Inhibition of IL-3 did not reduce the upregulation of CD123 on monocytes or CD11b on neutrophils ( Supplementary  Fig. 2c, d) , most likely due to the high redundancy of T-cellderived signals with effects on monocytes and neutrophils ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Stratification of ventilated COVID-19 patients according to their clinical outcome (survival vs. death) revealed that downregulation of CD131 on pDCs or basophils was low in both groups (Fig. 1b) . In contrast, upregulation of CD123 on monocytes and CD11b on neutrophils, that integrate a larger set of signals from activated T cells, were almost absent in COVID-19 patients with fatal outcome, but still detectable in ventilated patients who recovered and were later discharged from the ICU (Fig. 1d, f) . In healthy males and non-ventilated male COVID-19 patients, T-cell activation resulted in a significantly stronger upregulation of CD123 on monocytes than in females, suggesting a stronger T-cell-monocyte connection in males ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). In ventilated COVID-19 patients, the impairment of T-cell-induced CD123 upregulation on monocytes was very pronounced in both genders ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). Basophils, pDCs, and neutrophils responded equally to T-cell activation in males and females ( Supplementary Fig. 4a , b, d).",

We have incorporated three parameters that discriminated best between various groups of COVID-19 patients and calculated predictive values for the death of ventilated patients ( Table 2 ). The first two parameters are CD123 upregulation on monocytes and CD11b-upregulation on neutrophils induced by anti-CD3 in whole blood with a cutoff of 130%. Both parameters reflect the degree of T-cell hyporeactivity; however, they are not interchangeable, as monocytes and neutrophils sense different sets of T-cell-derived signals. The third parameter is the basophil count in the peripheral blood with a cutoff of 25/\u00b5l. All three parameters should be easy to establish in different labs because the counting of basophils is routine and no standardized absolute expression levels are required for upregulation of CD123 and CD11b as only relative changes are calculated. By combination of all three Fig. 4 Immunophenotyping of fresh peripheral blood cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. a-d 42 healthy controls (healthy; n = 42 biologically independent samples), 39 non-ventilated (non-vent.; n = 68 biologically independent samples), and 30 mechanically ventilated (vent.; n = 120 biologically independent samples) COVID-19 patients were analyzed.

T-cell reactivity was much lower in ventilated than in non-ventilated hospitalized patients, which was again somewhat lower than in healthy controls. T-cell hyporeactivity was only detectable in assays with whole blood but not with purified PBMC and could be attributed to suppressive components present in the plasma of COVID-19 patients. Incubation of whole blood from a healthy donor with plasma samples from ventilated COVID-19 patients resulted in a pronounced polyclonal T-cell hyporeactivity. Neither immunosuppressive drugs potentially present in the plasma of COVID-19 patients nor IL-10 or degradation of Ltryptophan could explain the inhibitory effects of COVID-19 plasma. With PBMCs and classical methods to study T-cell activation conflicting data have been published showing unaltered, increased, or decreased polyclonal T-cell responses in critically ill COVID-19 patients 20, 21, [23] [24] [25] [26] . Recently, impaired SARS-Cov-2-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses were found to be associated with older age and more severe outcome, while humoral immune responses were not predictive 27, 28 . Our data are in line with these findings and additionally suggest that critically ill COVID-19 have a more general T-cell suppression that could also impair the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses. Many critically ill COVID-19 patients suffer from fungal infections, which may be caused by the general T-cell suppression in these patients 33, 34 .",

The appearance of T-cell hyporeactivity could be a counter-regulatory mechanism to the hyperinflammation present in COVID-19 patients or a strategy of the virus to interfere with specific host immune responses and may explain the prolonged viral replication seen in the group of ventilated patients. Prolonged viral replication in turn may result in more tissue destruction, more activation of innate immune cells by viral components and more inflammation. The pronounced T-cell hyporeactivity in critically ill patients with hyperinflammation strongly argues against a major direct role of T cells for hyperinflammation. Immunosuppressive approaches targeting T cells are unlikely to improve hyperinflammation, while strategies to overcome the pronounced T-cell hyporeactivity in critically ill COVID-19 patients could be a promising therapeutic approach to improve virus clearance without aggravating the hyperinflammation.",

It is known that IL-3 is the major cytokine to increase basophil counts 30 . IL-3 and/or GM-CSF are also important survival factors for basophils and pDCs 35, 36 . Thus the lower counts of pDCs and basophils in critically ill patients may reflect not only their increased recruitment into tissues but also reduced survival and production of cells due to diminished secretion of IL-3 and GM-CSF by anergic T cells. Compared to healthy controls, basal CD11b expression on neutrophils is higher in non-ventilated and somewhat higher in ventilated patients. This indicates that COVID-19 leads to an activation of neutrophils. The pronounced T-cell hyporeactivity in ventilated patients may explain why basal CD11b expression is significantly lower in ventilated compared to non-ventilated patients and again lower in patients with a fatal outcome.",

Plates were washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween-20, blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at RT for 1 h, and washed again with PBS. Samples were preincubated with 100 \u00b5g/ml mouse IgG1, kappa isotype control antibody (MOPC21, BioXCell, Lebanon, USA) for 1 h by RT and added to the plates for 2 h by RT (100 \u00b5l/well, diluted in PBS/1% BSA). Recombinant human IL-3 (BioLegend) was diluted from 7.8 to 500 pg/ml in PBS/1% BSA and served as standard.

Three parameters were used individually or in combination to predict fatal outcome in ventilated COVID-19 patients. Absolute basophil counts in fresh peripheral blood. Basophil counts <25/\u00b5l defined \"Low Baso count\". Upregulation of CD123 on CD14 + monocytes and CD11b on neutrophils was calculated as the ratio of surface marker expression with anti-CD3 and surface marker expression without anti-CD3. Upregulation of <130% defined \"Weak upregulation\". In the combined scores, a logical AND combination was used that required all parameters to be fulfilled. For all three parameters, 77 datasets from 21 ventilated COVID-19 patients were available. In total, 17 ventilated patients were discharged from the ICU (survived) (69 samples) and 4 patients died on the ICU (8 samples). The number of right and false-positive samples, the test sensitivity (Sens.), specificity (Spe.) were calculated. The negative (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) for predicting death were calculated using a prevalence of death in ventilated COVID-19 patients of 19% (4 dead patients/21 ventilated patients).",
