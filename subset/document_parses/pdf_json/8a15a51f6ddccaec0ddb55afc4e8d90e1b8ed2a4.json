In this study we evaluated the \"I 2 vapor infusion\" (I 2 VP) technology which passes an airstream through a matrix containing elemental iodine (I 2 ) to produce I 2 vapor as an innovative method of iodine delivery for water disinfection. Pressured air was provided either by a compressor or hand pump. Testing was performed with water inoculated with either Gram-negative (Escherichia, Salmonella) or Gram-positive (Enterococcus) bacteria or with pre-formed Acinetobacter or Staphylococcus biofilms. Bacterial colony forming units were used to assess efficacy of the device. In distilled water all bacteria and biofilms were eliminated after brief exposures (<90 s). Culturable bacteria were also eliminated from pond and municipal sewer water, but the technology was mostly ineffective against dairy lagoon water with high turbidity and organic particulate. Longer duration infusion and higher air volumes used to overcome interference from organic matter were also associated with higher concentrations of residual iodine.

Its use as a water disinfectant can be dated back to the early 1900 s when the military first developed a tablet formulation for use in the field [6] . Like all halogens, iodine is a biocide because it is a strong oxidant [4] . However, relative to other halogens, complexed iodine has greater chemical stability [7] . It is also less reactive with organic nitrogenous contaminants and can be retained at a higher residual concentration in water [7] . These characteristics mean that iodine residuals will persist longer and will be more stable in the presence of organic matter compared to chlorine, the other commonly used halogen for water disinfection [6, 8] . Compared to chlorine, iodine also has a more acceptable taste in equipotent concentrations and it is effective over a wider pH range [9] [10] [11] . Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, iodine is known to rapidly penetrate into microorganisms [12] . It targets aromatic C-H functions, sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine, methionine), and unsaturated fatty acids [13] . As a bactericidal agent, iodine likely penetrates bacterial cell walls, and it's killing mechanism is likely related to retardation of bacterial protein synthesis, disruption of electron transport, DNA denaturation or membrane destabilization [3] . In lipid enveloped viruses [14] it is presumed to attack the surface proteins and destabilize membrane fatty acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds [15] .

The airstream was first directed to a heater element ( Figure 1A , ii.) warmed to 90 \u2022 F to increase sublimation of iodine. The amount of air entering the unit was controlled by a manual valve that was fixed to one position for all the experiments. From the heater element, air then entered the iodine resin encased in a cartridge. (Figure 1A , iii.). The iodine cartridge comprises of an air-inlet portion, through which air enters. The column of the cartridge is packed with beaded iodine resin. As air passes from the air-inlet portion, into the column, the iodine resin rapidly sublimates iodine ions into the air passing through the column and exists at the distal end connected to a tube.
