In the last months, various signs showed that the COVID-19 curve was flattening, but even the partial lifting of some containment measures (e.g., school closures and telecommuting) appear to favor a second wave of the disease. The accurate evaluation of possible countermeasures and their well-timed revocation are therefore crucial to avoid future waves or reduce their duration.",

On March 11, 2020 , the WHO declares COVID-19 the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus [2] . Face masks [3] , social distancing [4] , and, in the worst cases, quarantine and (partial) lockdown measures [5] , [6] are the most commonly adopted strategies to flatten the infection curve. The above measures proved effective in slowing down and limiting the pandemic outbreak [7] , but new COVID-19 waves are expected if mitigation measures are lifted [8] , [9] , [10] . Simulation and mathematical models can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation actions in advance, such as restrictions to population movement. Typically, the effectiveness of models is tied up to their parameterization. Past work uses synthetic [11] or interaction data limited to small areas (e.g., households) [12] .",

The KCDC records patient movements in plain text (i.e., natural language) without any unified rule. Researchers parsed these logs through automated code and rule-based methods to extract keywords that are then used with web mapping service APIs (e.g., Google Maps [14] , Kakao Map [15] , or Naver Map [16] ) to extract geographical coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) and other data.

For example, in the case of patient routes with missing location type (e.g., store, school, hospital), other attributes, such as geographical coordinates, are used to retrieve the visited location and identify its type. Data sets with missing data (e.g., movements of only the 15% of confirmed cases are logged) cannot be always made complete by looking for extra information. In this paper, we advocate using available data to extract information on movement habits of people living in Seoul (e.g., daily travel speed and distance based on patient age and day of the week). We feed this information to a patched version of GeoMason [19] , a tool that uses agent-based models (ABM) and geographic information systems (GIS) to study disease outbreaks (e.g., a cholera outbreak was studied using this tool in [20] ). This way, we simulate 1 interactions of thousands of people in Seoul on roads and in buildings to investigate the COVID-19 outbreak in the largest metropolis of South Korea and evaluate different what-if scenarios. This tool offers a flexible model based on real-world COVID-19 spread information that can be used to facilitate evaluation of different mitigation measures and different patient behaviors. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sections II and III describe the data sets used in this paper and their analysis. Section IV presents the patched version of GeoMason and the data used to simulate the COVID-19 outbreak in Seoul. Section VI discusses related work and Section VII concludes the paper.",

Age is provided at the decade granularity for people in their 20s through 70s. No information is provided for children or for people who are 80 or more years old.

Fig. 2 depicts the population (grouped by age) of both healthy and sick people moving in Seoul on a per-day basis. Two clear classes of people are identified depending on their mobility: people that are 20 -50 years old (adults) and those that are 60 -70 (seniors). The first group has higher mobility within the city during week days, but this mobility decreases during weekends. The second group (seniors) does not have any discernible change in mobility patterns during the week. A dip for the adult class observed on January 25 corresponds to the lunar new year day, no such dip is observed for the senior class. The Seoul population shows a peak and a dip on February 23 and in March. Since there is no clear explanation regarding why, we treat these two days as measurement outliers and ignore them in the rest of the analysis. Perhaps because of the pandemic onset in South Korean and KCDC advice, we observe the mobility of seniors to decrease at the beginning of February.",

The patients in the graph account for more than 150 visits to this location, causing repeated contact among individuals. This location is the biggest hot spot in the province. With some exceptions, people mostly travel short distances and visit only a few locations each day. The CDF of the daily traveled distance is shown in Fig. 7(b) . Patient mobility is another important attribute that must be considered when studying the COVID-19 outbreak. Intuitively, the more places a patient visits, the higher their mobility is. Fig. 8 depicts the number of patients that are seen on a specific number of unique locations (x-axis) for a specific number of days (y-axis). Note that the above graph does not distinguish patient mobility across different days. Indeed, looking at the mobility of individual patients, there are days where they exhibit high mobility and days where they move significantly less. This leads us to a more usable definition of mobility as a function of different time periods (days). Fig. 9(a) shows the day count of unique locations reached by the patients in the data set: for 2,063 days (88.9% of days) a typical patient visits 1-3 locations, while for 258 days (11.1%) more than 3 unique locations are visited.",

Based on the histogram shown in Fig. 9 (a), days with L \u2264 3 are considered of low mobility. The CDF of patient mobility using the above definition is depicted in Fig. 9 (b). The figure shows that 57.6% of patients never visit more than 4 locations in a day. Different classes of patients have different mobility. Fig. 9 (c) shows the difference in mobility between super spreaders and low spreaders, while Fig. 9 (d) illustrates mobility by age groups. Super spreaders and young people have higher mobility compared to low spreaders and seniors, respectively. For higher percentiles, the low spreaders have larger mobility than super spreaders due to the small number of super spreader agents available in the KCDC data set. Patients behave irresponsibly when they keep moving after the onset of their first COVID-19 symptoms. This clearly facilitates the diffusion of the disease since sick people can still meet and infect healthy ones. We present how long sick people continue to show mobility after exhibiting symptoms. Results are shown in Fig. 10 , where one can see is that only the 20% of patients stop moving and isolate immediately after initial symptoms are observed. Some patients keep moving for more than a week after initial symptoms were observed, see Fig. 10 (a). They also visit many locations.

In addition to the mobility distribution of super spreaders and low spreaders, the CDF of daily traveled distance in Fig. 7(a) is also used to determine the distance to a destination. The simulation time is defined by cycles. In each simulation cycle, agents outside a building move along the road towards their destination; agents inside a building can choose to stay or leave, based on their mobility. Agents with high mobility have a high probability to leave the building. Note that agents stay in a building for at least 15 minutes in order to meet the definition of close contact [22] . If multiple agents are inside the same building, they may infect each other with a certain probability. When infection happens, the agent state changes from healthy to infected, as the state transition shown in Fig. 11 . We assume the outdoor infection probability to be negligible.

Roads and buildings are placed in the simulated area as described in [24] , a collection of GIS data with regard to Seoul. GeoMason loads the GIS data (e.g., roads, road intersections, buildings) stored in a shapefile format, i.e., a file that stores geometric locations and their attribute information.

Therefore, we normalize the maximum distance to 3.53, which is half of the longest distance in the simulated area, to ensure a valid building selection as the agent's destination. Gangnam district district's population is 604,586 and a total of 7,043 buildings. We do not have any information on the building stories, entries, or number of rooms. This information is crucial, especially for apartment buildings, where multiple people can be inside the same building at the same time without contact. To address this lack of information, we limit the population in our simulations.",

In Fig. 14 , the benefit of patient isolation can be seen clearly: The proposed approach allows investigating the spreading of COVID-19 in an urban population. Incomplete and missing data may limit its generalization and make it far from being the definitive COVID-19 spreading model. Main limitations of our approach are discussed in this section. Scarcity of data. We continue to seek additional data sets on COVID-19 outbreaks to increase the accuracy of simulations, however, the current lack of data is an unfortunate limitation. The limited amount of data for super spreaders affects obser-vations on their mobility, see Fig. 9 (c). Selfish decisions (e.g., people that ignore mask mandate) are considered in Section IV by using different infect ratios due to missing information about protective measures adopted by patients. The infect ratio increases with the number of selfish agents. Our approach accounts for irresponsible behaviors (i.e., people moving after being infected) as presented in Section III-G. We overcome the absence of data about movements inside buildings (i.e., rooms and floors) by reducing the population size. Privacy concerns. The KCDC data set is anonymized and no sensitive data of monitored patients can be retrieved. No data about the underage population is provided as well as movements of patients from/to their private homes. This limits scenarios that can be analyzed, e.g., the impact of school closures or the spreading of the virus in households. Input parameter assumptions. The KCDC data set does not show the mode of transport. We overcome this limitation by assuming a pedestrian:vehicles ratio of 1:1. Input parameters can be fully customized and other researchers using our approach can easily change these values.",
