Besides its direct impact on patients [2] , COVID-19 has disrupted essential hospital procedures, such as endoscopy, due to concerns of viral transmission [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Endoscopic examinations are of particular interest due to the high levels of aerosols generated [8] , increasing the risk of viral transmission directly and via contact with contaminated surfaces [9] . Guidelines have been developed for appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by endoscopists that, when stringently followed, have been associated with only slightly increased risk of seroconversion for healthcare workers [3, 10] . However, the extent to which endoscopic procedures on COVID-positive patients can lead to viral dissemination has not been thoroughly examined. By collecting surface swabs in the close proximity of patients undergoing endoscopy followed by quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we set out to prospectively quantify viral distribution generated by endoscopic procedures in order to better understand major sources of risk.",

Procedures for patients B to D were performed in an endoscopy suite reserved for COVID-positive patients, which was decontaminated by environmental staff between each patient procedure. All pre-procedure swabs for these patients were done after decontamination, but prior to or immediately after patient arrival. Post-procedure swabs were done prior to patient departure or decontamination. Environmental surface samples were collected by swabbing for 2 minutes using polyester-tipped swabs (Isohelix) pre-soaked for 1 minute in DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research). Swab tips were then placed into vials containing 400 uL of DNA/RNA Shield and stored at 4\u00b0C until ready for RNA isolation and analysis. Samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1,500 g to remove debris and the supernatant was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube. RNA isolation and purification were performed using QIAamp Viral RNA Isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol before storing at -80\u00b0C. One-step quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR was performed using the TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher) on the LightCycler 480 System (Life-Science) in 384-well format in triplicate, using a total sample volume of 12.5 uL per well, including 5 uL of purified template RNA. SARS-CoV-2 N1 nucleocapsid primers and probes (IDT) were used. Cycle threshold (Ct) values generated from a standard curve of known SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid plasmid (IDT) were used to quantify RNA in our samples. A sample was considered positive if all three replicates resulted in a Ct value prior to the terminal cycle. Viral copies were calculated and divided by the area of the sampled surface, to account for the fact that smaller surfaces would be expected to receive less virus. Positive results are reported in terms of viral copies/cm 2 .",

Patients A and B had samples collected from the isolation pad adjacent to the procedure field; both samples were negative for viral RNA.

We attribute this decreased risk of viral spread to two likely causes. First, the use of semi-closed circuit oxygen delivery methods, such as prior tracheostomy or procedural oxygen masks, in our patients limited aerosolization compared to active intubation pre-procedure [11] . Because SARS-CoV-2 viral loads are highest in the lower respiratory tract [12] , reducing aerosol-generating \u25b6 procedures will lower the spread of viral RNA to the environment. Second, all of the procedures in our study were conducted with patients in the left lateral decubitus position, which may have contributed to directing expelled droplets towards the floor rather than into the air, where they could be widely dispersed. This is supported by the higher rate of viral RNA detection on the floor compared to other surfaces, including the PPE of nearby endoscopists.",

It is imperative to expand this study to include quantification of viral RNA in airborne droplets via air sampling, as recent evidence has demonstrated the importance of airborne particles in SARS-CoV-2 transmission [13] . The extent and duration of viral shedding by patients must also be understood in order to assess the risk of performing endoscopic procedures. Previous research has found that SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks at or shortly after symptom onset and decreases thereafter [14] . We did not measure viral shedding by patients in our study, and therefore, cannot comment on the correlation between viral load and environmental spread. However, we do note that the patient with the shortest time since a positive test, Patient B, generated no positive samples, suggesting that there may not be a strong association between the risk of viral transmission during endoscopy and the recency of the patient's last positive test for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the method of anesthesia strongly affects the production of aerosols or droplets, and thus, the levels of disseminated viral RNA. The patients in this study were all sedated throughout the procedure, which would reduce aerosol generation and dispersion. Patients A and B were under closed-circuit ventilator control, while patients C and D utilized a procedural oxygen mask. The presence of post-procedure viral RNA was low for all subjects, however, regardless of the method of respiratory control. This low level of viral dissemination may be ameliorated through the use of a mask or face covering for the patient throughout the procedure, which can be a simple low-risk action that could have a major benefit in reducing viral spread [3] .",

            "text": "While prolonged procedures have an increased risk of viral transmission [15] , our results indicate that short-duration procedures generate less viral dissemination to the environment, reaffirming that endoscopy teams strictly adhering to PPE guidelines have minimal additional risk if care is taken to minimize provider exposure [16] . It is also important to consider the relative size of contaminated surfaces when interpreting these results, as smaller surfaces will capture less disseminated virus. This is highlighted by the fact that the patient mouthguards were negative even in the presence of a positive sample from the floor, which may be due to the larger surface area of the floor receiving more total virus particles. However, the presence of detectible viral RNA on the floor after procedures, along with positive pre-procedure samples from the floor and the ventilator screen, underscores the importance of thorough cleaning of the procedure area between patients. The quantities of virus detected in our study are comparable to those reported in other studies investigating surface contamination in hospital settings [9, 17] , and generally lower than viral levels collected from COVID-19 wards [9, 18] .",
