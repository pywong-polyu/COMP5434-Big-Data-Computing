The goal of this metaanalysis was to summarize the evidence regarding the prognostic relevance of cardiac biomarkers from data available in published reports. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched from inception through April 2020 for studies comparing median values of cardiac biomarkers in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, or patients who died versus those who survived. The weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the groups were calculated for each study and combined using a random effects meta-analysis model. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality based on cardiac injury was combined from studies reporting it. Troponin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients who died or were critically ill versus those who were alive or not critically ill (WMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.70, p < 0.001). Additionally, BNP levels were also significantly higher in patients who died or were critically ill (WMD 0.45, 95% CI \u2212 0.21-0.69, p < 0.001). Cardiac injury was independently associated with significantly increased odds of mortality (OR 6.641, 95% CI 1.26-35.1, p = 0.03). A significant difference in levels of D-dimer was seen in those who died or were critically ill. CK levels were only significantly higher in those who died versus those who were alive (WMD 0.79, 95% CI 0.25-1.33, p = 0.004). Cardiac biomarkers add prognostic value to the determination of the severity of COVID-19 and can predict mortality.",

Given the discrepancy among these reports, it is prudent to investigate the association of cardiac biomarkers with the severity of disease experienced by and the survival or death of COVID-19 patients.

For the analysis of the risk of mortality with COVID-19 infection based on cardiac injury, event rates or univariate and multivariate odds ratios (OR) for mortality were extracted. For studies reporting Hazard ratio (HR) only, HR was adopted as the best estimate of OR. OR were transformed logarithmically, then standard error was calculated from Log OR and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The inverse variance method was used to achieve a weighted estimate of the combined overall effect. For all the analyses, we assessed the results for heterogeneity in our analysis by examining the forest plots and then calculating a Q statistic, which we then compared with the I 2 index. We considered the presence of significant heterogeneity at the 5% level of significance (for the Q test) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and values of I 2 exceeding 56% as an indicator of significant heterogeneity 18, 19 . We adopted the random effect model to pool WMD or effect sizes. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 (Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA). For Meta-regression, we adopted a weighted regression random effect model and carried out a multivariate regression of pre-determined factors using comprehensive meta-analysis version 3. These variables were selected based on traditional factors shown to affect cardiovascular health and on data availability for the majority of the studies included. A two-sided P-value < 0.05 was regarded as significant for all analyses. Data were represented as forest plots, and potential publication bias was assessed with the Egger test and represented graphically with Begg funnel plots of the natural log of the OR versus its standard error.",

Additionally, these studies only included troponin as the cardiac marker in their analysis as a prognostic indicator [31] [32] [33] . Our sub-group analysis also found that BNP levels were significantly different in critically ill patients compared to those who were not critically ill. While pre-existing cardiac co-morbidities increase the risk of Acute COVID-19 Cardiovascular Syndrome (ACoVCS) 34, 35 , recent evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 can cause acute myocarditis-like illness in an otherwise healthy patient 36 . The mechanism of cardiac injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 is not yet understood, but possible mechanisms include cytokine storm as a result of dysfunctional and uncontrolled immunological response, evidenced by increased levels of d-dimer, IL-6, CRP and LDH 14, 37 , and primary cardiac injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. The first case of acute cardiac injury directly linked to myocardial localization of SARS-CoV-2, demonstrated by endomyocardial biopsy, was reported by Tavazzi et al. 38 The viral envelope of SARS-CoV-2 is studded with glycoproteins called Spike proteins composed of two subunits. Subunit S1 has affinity for ACE2 receptors on the cell surface and Subunit S2 fuses with the cell membrane; acting together, these two proteins aid in the endocytosis of the viral particle 39, 40 . Cardiac tissue has a significantly higher expression of ACE2 receptors and is therefore prone to direct cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19 41, 42 .",

SARS-CoV-2 reduces the expression of ACE2 due to internalization as shown in a study by Oudit et al., which demonstrated a marked decrease in ACE2 expression in the myocardium of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 44 . ACE2 is responsible for the degradation of AT-2 into Ang 1-7, which is cardioprotective and has anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties 45 . The loss of ACE2 shifts the balance towards an accumulation of AT-2, which has inflammatory and pro-thrombotic properties. AT-2 promotes vasoconstriction and increases the levels of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1, which plays an active role in thrombogenesis and myocardial infarction 45 . This shift in RAAS axis towards AT-2 could possibly explain high D-dimer levels, a biomarker that showed clearly increased levels in both critically ill patients and patients who died compared to levels in not critically ill and alive patients in our meta-analysis (Fig. 4) .",

Surprisingly, based on our meta-analysis, BNP levels did not differ in patients who died and those who lived. In addition to ventricular stretch, BNP is a known marker for many other conditions, including lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, kidney dysfunction, and excessive cortisol levels. COVID-19 infection causes an assortment of these conditions in the different groups of patients, effectively neutralizing the differences between the groups. Troponin and BNP were both higher in the combined analysis of critically ill and/or dead COVID-19 patients compared to not critically ill and/or alive patients. These results suggest that while there could be minimal changes in troponin in critically ill patients due possibly to non-cardiac reasons, significant elevation in COVID-19 patients may be an indication of direct myocardial injury, which in turn increases the risk of death, thereby making it a crucial tool in predicting death. Unfortunately, not many studies reported the MB isofraction of CK. In addition, the inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6 and CRP; see Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7) and D-dimer levels from the same studies were significantly increased in the critically ill patients and the patients who died compared to levels in the control population, suggesting that it might be difficult to use these biomarkers to differentiate patients who are just critically ill from those at risk of dying. However, the difference in IL-6 (p 0.04) and CRP (p 0.04) levels between patients who died compared to levels in patients who survived was significantly higher than in patients who were critically ill and those who were not (Fig. 4) . Finally, LDH was significantly higher in both critically ill patients and patients who died compared to those who had mild illness and those who survived.",

First, the critical and not critical groups included in our analysis are heterogenous, i.e., we defined critical as patients who required ICU admission as well as those who developed severe lung injury and ARDS. Similarly, the criteria for ICU admissions may differ from one hospital to another. Second, most studies were conducted in and published from China and therefore the generalizability of this information to other parts of the world and ethnicities is limited. The absence of details regarding the timing of measurement of biomarkers during the hospital stay limits the use of the results as an aid to the 'predictability' of death or critical illness. Last, the studies included in the meta-analysis evaluating the risk of mortality with cardiac injury varied in their definitions of cardiac injury.",
