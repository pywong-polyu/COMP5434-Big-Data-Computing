The number of patients with any serious adverse event was smaller in the colchicine group compared to placebo (4.9% versus 6.3%). Pneumonia was reported less frequently in patients of the colchicine group (2.9%) than those of the placebo group (4.1%). Colchicine has previously been shown to reduce acute lung injury in an experimental model of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 14 The risk of viral inflammatory pneumonitis might therefore be lowered by colchicine in patients with COVID-19. In contrast, there was no evidence of an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia in COLCORONA. The number of reported cases of pulmonary embolism was higher in patients of the colchicine group compared to placebo (11 versus 2) . Whether this represents a real phenomenon or simply the play of chance is not known. Colchicine has previously been shown in murine models to lower the release of alpha-defensin associated with large thrombus burdens and in clinical studies to reduce the aggregation between neutrophils and platelets. [16] [17] [18] Nevertheless, the numbers of hospitalizations, use of mechanical ventilation and deaths were lower in the colchicine group than in the placebo group. Although uncommon, the number of reports of cutaneous rash was lower with colchicine than in the placebo group (4 versus 13).",

The duration of follow-up was relatively short at approximately 30 days. The evolution of persistent COVID-19 symptoms and the effects of longer-term treatment with colchicine were not evaluated. The benefit of a shorter course of colchicine therapy for less than 30 days is also not entirely known, although the results of a small open-label study showed benefits of treatment administered for up to 3 weeks. 19 Finally, our results apply to patients who have a proven diagnosis of COVID-19, are at risk of clinical complications and are not hospitalized at the time of treatment initiation.",
