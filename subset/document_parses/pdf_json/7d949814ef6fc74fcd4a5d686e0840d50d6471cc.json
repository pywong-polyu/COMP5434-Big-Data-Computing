This is supported by data from a recent study of 265 clients receiving residential SUD treatment in Southern California, among whom 74% had received a COVID-19 test [26] . Although it is not clear whether or not individuals had received testing at the SUD program itself or whether SUD treatment was a marker for health-seeking behaviors, some participants did report having had a COVID-19 test at SUD treatment clinics in our study. SUD treatment programs could serve as an ideal venue for providing COVID-19 testing as well as vaccines and education to dispel myths about COVID-19 testing and vaccination. However, during the pandemic, some SUD treatment programs were suspended or only offered take-home or telemedicine services [40] , potentially reducing opportunities for the provision of other services.",

Compared to other illicit substances, fentanyl is a highly potent drug with heightened risks for experiencing an overdose [43] , which may have led to increased contact with medical settings (e.g., Emergency Departments) [44] and subsequently COVID-19 testing. These interpretations are speculative and deserve greater attention. Kral and colleagues have documented marked transitions from injection of black tar heroin to non-injection use of fentanyl in San Francisco [45] and this sub-group of substance users may be more attuned to their health. Contrary to expectation, we did not find that Latinx ethnicity was associated with a lower odds of COVID-19 testing; however, ethnicity was highly correlated with place of residence. We did not find that COVID-19 disinformation or misinformation were significantly associated with a reduced odds of COVID-19 testing after controlling for other factors, perhaps because these measures were not specific to COVID-19 testing. Future studies may benefit by incorporating tailored measures on COVID-19 disinformation and misinformation that specifically address COVID testing which should be informed by qualitative research to more fully assess the influence of these factors on COVID-19 testing behaviors.",

To reduce high rates of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 and ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is critical that infections among PWID and other vulnerable populations are detected early, especially given their high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection [18] . Efforts to expand free rapid testing for PWID at venues they already access and trust are especially needed, given recent evidence suggesting that people with SUD may be more prone to breakthrough infections following vaccination due to their high prevalence of co-morbidities [48] .",

Although this was a binational study, sampling was non-random and our findings may not generalize to other PWID populations. Our reliance on self-report may have led to socially desirable responding or problems with recall. We were unable to differentiate between situations where COVID-19 testing was mandatory versus situations in which testing was voluntary and sought out by participants. For example, COVID-19 testing was likely required for participants entering correctional facilities and may also have been mandatory in some shelters. Similarly, we did not ask participants if they were required to pay for COVID-19 testing. Since both the availability and the cost of COVID-19 testing may have changed during the pandemic, we controlled for time in our analysis. It should be also noted that after study recruitment concluded, at-home tests became freely available from the U.S. government [49] in January 2022. However, access to government distributed at-home testing kits may still pose access difficulties for some populations, such as those who are unstably housed or people with low health literacy.",
