            "text": "Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive renal tubulopathy characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria [1] . GS is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the solute carrier family 12, member 3 (SLC12A3) gene which encodes a thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule [2] . The increased sodium delivery in the cortical collecting duct leads to increased sodium reabsorption from the epithelial sodium channel, and simultaneously increased potassium and magnesium wasting. If severe, hypokalemia can cause periodic paralysis (PP) [3] . Common clinical features include transient periods of muscle weakness and tetany that may be accompanied by abdominal pains, vomiting, and fever.",

This is in contrast with the familial hypokalemic PP, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is due to mutations in ACNA1S or SCN4A gene which alter the structure and function of calcium or sodium channels [5] . Our patient did not have family history of PP. Thyrotoxic PP manifests as recurrent episodic muscle weakness with hypokalemia and hyperthyroidism. It mostly has been described in Asian men and is caused by hyperstimulation of Na + /K + -ATPase channel due to high thyroxine level that results in the rapid shift of potassium into the cells [6] . Concurrent GS and thyrotoxic PP has been described, both in children and adults [7] [8] [9] . Imashuku et al. described a 16-year-old Asian male with thyrotoxic PP with a concurrent GS secondary to a missense homozygous mutation of SLC12A3 [7] . Acute kidney injury (AKI) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) have been described with GS [10, 11] . Nishihara et al. described an adult male with AKI secondary to hypokalemic rhabdomyolysis in association with GS [10] .

Given pregnancy, further modalities including radioactive iodine uptake study were not pursued, given risk of fetal hypothyroidism, mental retardation, and increased risk of malignancy. Partial molar pregnancy was initially considered due to presentation of thyroid storm, however, the beta-hCG level was trending down and the patient did not show any signs of pre-eclampsia. Thyroid sonogram showed normal sized thyroid with homogenous thyroid texture and without increased vascularity, making Grave's disease unlikely.

Random urine calcium to creatinine ratio was also low at 0.005. She required multiple intravenous potassium and magnesium supplements. Discharge serum potassium and magnesium was 3.5 meq/L and 1.2 mg/dL, respectively. She was discharged on magnesium oxide 400 mg daily and potassium chloride 10 meq twice daily. BUN and serum creatinine slowly improved with intravenous hydration. Kidney biopsy was not performed and renal replacement therapy was not required. Discharge BUN and serum creatinine was 15 mg/dL and 0.97 mg/dL (MDRD eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), respectively. Due to the persistent hypokalemia, alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria despite resolution of emesis, a genetic testing by next generation sequence analysis was done which showed that the patient was homozygous in the SLCA123 (NM_001126108.2) gene for a known sequence variant designated c.2581C>T (p.Arg861Cys) (Prevention Genetics, Marshfield, WI, USA). No further in vitro functional studies were performed, hence the exact functional implication of this variant was unknown. However, to determine the pathogenicity of this variant, in silico tests were performed using SIFT, PolyPhen-2, FATHMM and MutationTaster. The resulting prediction utilizing these in silico tools was \"Pathogenic\". At 37 weeks gestation, a healthy infant of 3.5 kilograms was born vaginally without any perinatal complications.

Other disorders, such as familial hypokalemic PP, thyrotoxic PP, and renal tubular acidosis, can present with hypokalemia as well. During pregnancy, hypokalemia can also occur from hyperemesis gravidarum. The patient in this report did have hyperemesis but the metabolic abnormalities persisted after resolution of emesis and the sequence analysis of the SLC12A3 gene confirmed GS. Hence, the constellation of hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, alkalosis, mild activation of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and mutation in SLC12A3 gene was confirmatory of GS. The mild activation of the RAS was most likely the appropriate regulatory response to dehydration secondary to renal salt-wasting. Additionally, thyroid hormones are known to influence the synthesis and secretion of renin by juxtaglomerular (JG) cells. T3 has been shown to increase renin secretion, renin content, and renin mRNA in rat JG cell cultures [12] . In our patient, the concomitant presence of severe transient hyperthyroidism made thyrotoxic PP another possibility. However, given that the TSI was normal and patient had no prior history of hyperthyroidism, the transient elevation of thyroid hormones and suppression of TSH was thought to be secondary to hCG-related.",

The prevalence is 1 in 40,000 and the diagnosis is usually made in late adolescence or early adulthood, sometimes incidentally during presentation of other conditions which are known to cause hypokalemia. Jalalzadeh et al. reported a diagnosis of GS in a patient presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis [13] . Zhou et al. reported Graves' disease in a patient with GS [9] . Although pregnancy with GS has been reported with varying outcomes [14, 15] , a new diagnosis of GS during pregnancy has not been reported. Potassium and magnesium loss can occur in pregnancy due to increased renal tubular loss, partly due to activation of renin-angiotensin system [16] . The presence of hyperemesis and fetal demands can also worsen hypokalemia in patients with GS during pregnancy. However, pregnancy typically is associated with retention of potassium, which is thought to be mediated by progesterone due to its mineralocorticoid effect which, in turn, can prevent excess kaliuresis [17, 18] . It needs to be studied whether this protective mechanism is maintained in pregnant patients with underlying GS as the loss of urinary electrolytes can result in severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia during pregnancy in these patients [19] . Hence, a high index of suspicion for GS is necessary in pregnant patients with severe or refractory hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. The outcome of pregnancy in patients with GS is favorable as long as electrolyte supplementation is adequately managed. However, increased risks of miscarriage, oligohydramnios and intrauterine growth retardation have been reported [20, 21] .",

            "text": "Gestational thyrotoxicosis (GT) is a transient form of hyperthyroidism caused by excessive stimulation of thyroid gland by hCG and usually limited to the first 12-16 weeks of pregnancy [22] . It is known to affect mostly women with hyperemesis gravidarum, multiple gestation, molar pregnancy, and choriocarcinoma [23] . The thyroid stimulating effect of hCG is thought to be due to the significant homology between the beta-subunits of hCG and TSH. As hCG secretion declines, serum free T4 and T3 concentrations decline and serum TSH concentrations rise slightly to or within the normal range. Hence, it is necessary to understand the thyroid physiology during pregnancy that can cause altered thyroid function tests. Additionally, it is recommended that during normal pregnancy, these tests should be interpreted using population based, trimester-specific TSH and T4 reference ranges for pregnant women [24] . Patients usually have a suppressed (<0.1 mU/L) or undetectable (<0.01 mU/L) serum TSH value and a free T4 and/or free T3 (or total T4 and/or total T3) measurement that exceeds the normal range for pregnancy. GT resolves on its own mostly by early second trimester and no anti-thyroid drugs are indicated [22] . Another important cause of persistent hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is Graves' disease which usually manifests with overt signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, diffuse nontender goiter with or without bruit, various degrees of opthalmopathy along with a positive serum thyroid peroxidase antibody and a positive serum TSH receptor antibody test [25] . Anti-thyroid drugs are necessary to treat Graves' disease. Other causes of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy are toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter, and subacute thyroiditis [25] .",

            "text": "Thyroid storm, also referred to as thyrotoxic crisis, is an acute, life-threatening, decompensated, hypermetabolic state induced by excessive release of thyroid hormones in patients with thyrotoxicosis. It is typically seen in the setting of Grave's disease and the clinical presentation includes fever, tachycardia, hypertension, neurological, and gastrointestinal abnormalities; heart failure, delirium, and seizures can occur [26] . Superimposed insults, such as infection, trauma, surgery, myocardial infarction, diabetic ketoacidosis, pregnancy, and parturition, have been known to trigger the thyroid storm. Additionally, hyperemesis in pregnancy has been reported as a cause of thyroid storm in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy [27] . Return of thyroid levels to normal with resolution of emesis and without anti-thyroid agents suggests the role of beta-hCG in the GT, as seen in our patient. Beta-hCG is known to share some structural homology with TSH [28] . Our patient had markedly elevated serum beta-hCG level, and cross-reactivity with TSH based on identical alpha subunit has been described. An inverse relationship between TSH and beta-hCG at about 10-12 weeks of pregnancy, the time of peak hCG levels, has been well described [29] . There is also a two-three fold estrogen-mediated increase in circulating levels of thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) during pregnancy [30] . TBG, which is one of the proteins which transport thyroid hormone in the blood with high affinity for thyroxine (T4) increases in serum a few weeks after conception and reaches a plateau during the mid-gestational period. The mechanism for this increase in TBG involves both increased hepatic synthesis of TBG and estrogen-mediated perpetuation in sialylation of TBG that increases the half-life from 15 min to three days to fully sialylated TBG [31] .",
