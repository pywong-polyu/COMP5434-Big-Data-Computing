[2] Better understanding of in-hospital infection sources is therefore urgently needed. Pleural procedures are not currently considered aerosol-generating by the WHO [1] , and special precautions to mitigate against viral transmission and/or to protect HCWs are not currently recommended. However, this is based on the absence of any prior data regarding the aerosol generating potential of a chest drain (where an aerosol is defined as a particle smaller than 5 microns) rather than a robust understanding of the level of risk involved.",

[1] This is consistent with the observations reported here in that unfiltered emissions of the smallest particles (0.3-0.5 microns) increased progressively from 1 to 3 to 5 L/minute. Our findings are also concordant with a recent study reported by Akhtar et al, in which a similar anti-viral filter was evaluated and produced a qualitative reduction in droplet emissions. However, droplet size, and therefore aerosolization potential were not examined. [8] These data support risk mitigation in patients with suspected or proven COVID-19, as recommended by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) [6] and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST). [7] However, the absolute risk involved remains uncertain.

Lescure [3] and Mei [4] have recently reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 positive effusions, but in these cases air-leak was not reported as a significant component, and larger studies are needed to define the prevalence and risks of unfiltered air-leaks in COVID19 more clearly. In a recent post-mortem series, Schaller et al reported that 50% of patients with fatal COVID-19 had associated pleural effusion, of which 50% were PCR positive. The experiments reported here were carried out in a controlled environment with minimal background environmental disturbances. It is therefore unknown how normal background activities (e.g. staff proximity, the opening and closing of doors), which can affect the rate of aerosols resuspension on surfaces, would affect concentrations in a clinical setting. Given that our data were recorded at flow rates of 1, 3 and 5 L/minute it should also be acknowledged that the particle emission profile of smaller volume air-leaks cannot be directly concluded from our data. Nevertheless, it appears clear that a bubbling chest drain is a source of aerosolised particles, and that dispersion can be prevented using a simple anti-viral filter.",

The completed assembly was comprised of a Heat and Moisture Exchange (HME) filter normally used on a ventilator circuit (Teleflex Humid-Vent Filter Compact, 19402T), a 5 cm section of standard chest drain tubing (Rocket Medical R54502) and the proximal adapter from a size 8 endotracheal tube (Portex 100/199/080). The safe functioning of the filter was assessed within a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) framework (BS EN ISO 14971:2012: Application of risk management to medical devices). This included demonstration that over 24 hours of continuous flow at 5L/minute, the pressure within the bottle rose by no more than 0.3 cm H2O, suggesting the filter has minimal impact on drain function.",

Particle counts (pc/ft 3 ) were notably lower in all channels compared to without-filter measurements. Counts of the smallest particles significantly reduced between baseline and initiation of air flow (based on Bonferroni adjusted p<0.dilution of background aerosols by filtered air. With the filter added, normalised particle count differences were significantly lower (p<0.00086) ) at all flow rates, compared to without-filter values.",
