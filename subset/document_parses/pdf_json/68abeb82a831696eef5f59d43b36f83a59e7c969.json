            "text": "Except for specific vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapeutic treatments are currently limited for COVID-19. Propolis, a honeybee's product, has been suggested as a potential candidate for treatment of COVID-19 for its immunomodulatory properties and for its powerful activity against various types of viruses, including common coronaviruses. However, direct evidence regarding the antiviral activities of this product still remains poorly documented. VERO E6 and CALU3 cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and cultured in the presence of 12.5 or 25 \u00b5g/ml of a standardized Hydroalcoholic Extract acronym (sHEP) of Eurasian poplar type propolis and analyzed for viral RNA transcription, for cell damage by optical and electron microscopy, and for virus infectivity by viral titration at 2, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. The three main components of sHEP, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, galangin, and pinocembrin, were tested for the antiviral power, either alone or in combination. On both cell lines, sHEP showed significant effects mainly on CALU3 up to 48 h, i.e., some protection from cytopathic effects and consistent reduction of infected cell number, fewer viral particles inside cellular vesicles, reduction of viral titration in supernatants, dramatic drop of N gene negative sense RNA synthesis, and lower concentration of E gene RNA in cell extracts. Interestingly, pre-treatment of cells with sHEP before virus inoculation induced these same effects described previously and was not able to block virus entry. When used in combination, the three main constituents of sHEP showed antiviral activity at the same levels of sHEP. sHEP has a remarkable ability to hinder the replication of SARS-CoV-2, to limit new cycles of infection, and to protect host cells against the cytopathic effect, albeit with rather variable results. However, sHEP do not block the virus entry into the cells. The antiviral activity observed with the three main components of sHEP used in combination highlights that the Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 799546 Sberna et al.",

Currently, it is widely consumed worldwide as a health aid and immune system stimulator, having been classified as a food or dietary supplement or as a functional/health food (Berretta et al., 2017) . Vegetal and geographical origin determines the characteristics of different propolis and many different propolis types are known (Cornara et al., 2017) . Brazilian green propolis from Baccharis sp. and, mostly, Eurasian poplar type propolis are the two mainly investigated for their use in human health. These propolis show a broad spectrum of properties, thanks to more than 200 bioactive compounds, mainly flavonoids, that exert strong antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant activities and antimicrobial, bactericidal, and antiviral power (Zareie, 2011; Shahzad and Cohrs, 2012) . Despite numerous in vitro and in vivo 1 https://covid19.who.int/ 2 https://www.ema.europa.eu/ studies, propolis targets and mechanisms of action still remain quite unclear (Sforcin, 2016) .",

SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is characterized by viral spike protein (S) interaction with cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) (Hoffmann et al., 2020) : at least 8 flavonoids (chrysin, galangin, myricetin, rutin, hesperetin, pinocembrin, luteolin, and quercetin) caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and caffeic acid in propolis show high binding energy to ACE2 receptor, thus suggesting a marked hampering activity of viral entry (Guler et al., 2021) . Another component of propolis, naringin, is able to inhibit in vitro the infection of VERO E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 and to prevent the cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by the virus (Clementi et al., 2021) . Furthermore, in vitro, rutin, the propolis ethanolic extracts, and the propolis liposomes show the ability to block also all non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Refaat et al., 2021) . Instead, caffeic acid phenyl ester and withanone are predicted to interact with the main protease Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and cellular coreceptor TMPRSS2 (Kumar et al., 2020 (Kumar et al., , 2021 . In addition, many flavonoids detected in propolis showed high binding affinity toward the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a crucial enzyme for SARS-CoV-2 replication, with binding scores higher or similar than the reference remdesivir (Elwakil et al., 2021) .",

For CALU 3, CC 50 values were 181, 164, 113, and 55 \u00b5g/ml of sHEP, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1E) . Based on these data, it was decided to use a dose of sHEP lower to the CC 50 value, which had been well tolerated by both cell lines during the experiments, namely 25 \u00b5g/ml of sHEP. In addition, doses of 12.5 and 50 \u00b5g/ml sHEP were also used as controls in many experiments. During culturing in presence of increasing concentrations of sHEP up to 25 \u00b5g/ml, a progressive reduction of cell growth directly related with sHEP dose was observed, however without CPE, in line with the evidence that water extracts of propolis inhibit different cell line growth with cytostatic effects (Najafi et al., 2007) . Indeed, up to 48 h of culture in presence of 25 \u00b5g/ml sHEP, no alteration of cell morphology was observed ( Supplementary  Figures 1B-D,F-H) .

In particular, in presence of 25 \u00b5g/ml sHEP, the cell viability percentage of infected VERO E6 remained above 80% until 72 h p.i. (91.8% at 48 h p.i., p = 0.0034 vs. SARS-CoV-2 and 86.0% at 72 h p.i., p < 0.0001 vs. SARS-CoV-2); in CALU3, it was maintained around 70% (67.6% at 48 h p.i., p = 0.0339 vs. SARS-CoV-2 and 76.4% at 72 h p.i., p = 0.0039 vs. SARS-CoV-2). By contrast, in absence of sHEP, cell viability of infected cells dropped below 50% or more at 48 h and 72 h p.i. in both cell lines due to the CPE resulting from viral infection. Interestingly, images captured at optical microscopy showed that while in VERO E6 sHEP reduced CPE in a significant quote of cells, in CALU3 sHEP was capable to prevent cell damage almost completely [compare the images of infected cells shown in Figure 1B vs. those of VERO E6 treated with 12.5 \u00b5g/ml and 25 \u00b5g/ml sHEP in panels (C), (D), and (G) vs. those of CALU3 in panels (H) and (I)].",

At each time points, both SNs and cell extracts were harvested and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR to measure levels of negative sense transcripts (Figures 3A,C) . The Ct values for these transcripts were higher (meaning lower levels of viral load) when both the infected cell lines were cultured in presence of sHEP, mainly at 25 \u00b5g/ml, thus pointing out the ability of sHEP to exert its antiviral effect directly at intracellular level. Although no significant differences were observed for VERO E6 (Figure 3A) , in CALU3 the negative sense RNA transcript levels of the N gene were significantly lower at 24 h p.i. (p = 0.0024) and at 48 h p.i. (p = 0.0002) with 25 \u00b5g/ml sHEP and at 24 h p.i. (p = 0.0043) also with 12.5 \u00b5g/ml sHEP, compared with untreated but infected cells ( Figure 3C ). This effect was confirmed by measuring the positive sense RNA transcripts of the viral E gene in the same cell extracts (Figures 3B,D) . The remarkable effectiveness of sHEP in limiting the synthesis of new viral transcripts was much more noticeable in CALU3 already at 24 h (Figures 3C,D) .",

Conversely, the combination of the three molecules (CAPE + GAL + PIN) was extremely effective (VERO E6: p = 0.0002 vs. SARS-CoV-2; CALU3 p = 0.009 vs. SARS-CoV-2), so much to limit viral replication to the same levels as those observed with sHEP, thus demonstrating that the antiviral effect of sHEP is mainly due to a synergistic effect of the main characteristic polyphenols of poplar type propolis. The same components added two by two showed different efficacy, depending on the combination and cell line.

            "text": "Currently, in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, only vaccinations are proving full effectiveness against the virus (Pritchard et al., 2021) . Indeed, remdesivir demonstrated, with a moderate quality of evidence, no benefit in mortality rate and, with low or very low quality of evidence, benefits in terms of rates of clinical improvement and faster time to clinical improvement (Singh et al., 2021) . Moreover, the monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, although effective as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent severe diseases or complications, show several limitations, such as difficulties in development and production, high economic costs, and loss of efficacy against new viral variants. Accordingly, a feverish research of drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing and natural products have become alternatives to consider being often free of toxic or side effects, cheap, and readily available all over the world (Mani et al., 2020) . Propolis is one of the most intriguing products, thanks to the high concentration of bioactive of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and terpenes that exert strong antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities, thus reducing the activation of the cytokine storm and the risk of comorbidities that complicate the clinical course of COVID-19 ( Sforcin et al., 2000; Machado et al., 2012; Chan et al., 2013; Galeotti et al., 2018; Bachevski et al., 2020; Berretta et al., 2020; Maruta and He, 2020; Scorza et al., 2020; Al Naggar et al., 2021; Ali and Kunugi, 2021; Elmahallawy et al., 2021; Keflie and Biesalski, 2021; Lima et al., 2021; Ripari et al., 2021; Rivera-Ya\u00f1ez et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2021) . Consequently, propolis have been proposed as prophylactic or adjuvant for COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, some of the main constituents of propolis (such as caffeic acid, galangin, and pinocembrin) were predicted also to inhibit both the TMPRSS2 and the ACE2 receptors on host cells, the viral protein Spike, and the viral Mpro and RdRp enzymes, all of them crucial elements for entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 (Bachevski et al., 2020; Berretta et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020 Kumar et al., , 2021 Maruta and He, 2020) .",

For example, in a randomized, controlled, open-label, single-center trial conducted in Brazil (registered as ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04480593), hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients were treated with standard care therapies plus an oral dose of 400 mg or 800 mg/day of green propolis extract (EPP-AF) for 7 days. Propolis was safe and beneficial and the length of hospital stay post-intervention was significantly shorter. Patients treated with propolis had a reduced need for invasive oxygen therapy and administration of propolis early in the disease would seem to have even greater benefit in reducing the disease's consequences (Berretta et al., 2020; Ribeiro et al., 2021; Ripari et al., 2021; Rivera-Ya\u00f1ez et al., 2021; Silveira et al., 2021) . Another study reported that hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving green Brazilian propolis anticipated viral clearance, symptom recovery, and discharge from the hospital. Interestingly, to date, no patient discontinued propolis treatment for adverse events (Silveira et al., 2021) , even though allergic reactions against some components of propolis are not an uncommon occurrence, as cases of allergic dermatitis and hypersensitivity reactions have been previously described (Bellegrandi et al., 1996; Kurek-G\u00f3recka et al., 2020) .",

Further confirmation was the smaller amount of viral particles counted within the cellular vesicles when sHEP was added to the culture medium. The fact that CALU3 have characteristics similar to human lung epithelial cells and that in the presence of sHEP they resisted well to the devastating impact of viral infection further support the hypothesis of antiviral power of this complex and, in parallel, indirectly explain the beneficial effects observed on COVID-19 patients. In fact, another interesting finding that emerged from this study was that sHEP was able to exert its antiviral power essentially downstream of infection, i.e., after virus entry, while pre-treating of cells with sHEP prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 was unable to interfere with the infection. This observation has important clinical relapses that perfectly fit in and provide a plausible explanation for the beneficial effects registered in ongoing clinical trials, where patients already infected by SARS-CoV-2 show significant clinical improvements after starting treatment with other propolis.",

Furthermore, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses are required for each of the individual components since they have different characteristics from each other. Finally, it will be also necessary to establish which preparation to use, the safety concentrations, and the best methods of administration in infected tissues (i.e., oral intake, inhalation, nasal spray, etc.) to avoid side effects, even though oral doses of 400 mg or 800 mg/day of green propolis extract are already in use in registered official trials. In our opinion, the use of purified components with antiviral power in combination could be the safest method of administration of such product, not only to ensure the lowest rate of adverse events, especially in the most sensitive individuals prone to allergic reactions, but also to ensure selective and specific antiviral effects, and our results confirmed this alternative use of propolis.",
