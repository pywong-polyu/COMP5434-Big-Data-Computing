We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional analysis in COVID-19 recovered patients at various time points over a 10-month period in order to investigate how circulating antibody levels and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) release by peripheral blood cells change over time following natural infection. From March 2020 till January 2021, we enrolled 412 adults mostly with mild or moderate disease course. At each study visit, subjects donated peripheral blood for testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and IFN-\u03b3 release after SARS-CoV-2 S-protein stimulation. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were positive in 316 of 412 (76.7%) and borderline in 31 of 412 (7.5%) patients. Our confirmation assay for the presence of neutralizing antibodies was positive in 215 of 412 (52.2%) and borderline in 88 of 412 (21.4%) patients. Likewise, in 274 of 412 (66.5%) positive IFN-\u03b3 release and IgG antibodies were detected. With respect to time after infection, both IgG antibody levels and IFN-\u03b3 concentrations decreased by about half within 300 days. Statistically, production of IgG and IFN-\u03b3 were closely associated, but on an individual basis, we observed patients with high-antibody titres but low IFN-\u03b3 levels and vice versa. Our data suggest that immunological reaction is acquired in most individuals after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 and is sustained in the majority of patients for at least 10 months after infection after a mild or moderate disease course. Since, so far, no robust marker for protection against COVID-19 exists, we recommend utilizing both, IgG and IFN-\u03b3 release for an individual assessment of the immunity status.",

We sought for an easy-to-perform test that might be used as a marker for Tcell responses by determining the capacity to release interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) upon specific stimulation. Approximately 7 ml blood was collected in heparinized blood collection tubes. Within 6 h, 0.5 ml of the blood was transferred into three different tubes. One positive control tube (containing a mitogen), one SARS-CoV-2 specific stimulation tube (coated with antigens based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), and one blank tube without antigens to measure individual IFN-\u03b3 background of an individual (product ET 2606-3003, https://www.euroimmun. com). After 20-24 h of incubation at 37 \u2022 C, the tubes were centrifuged at 12.000 rfc for 10 min. IFN-\u03b3 concentrations were measured in the supernatants by IFN-\u03b3 ELISA according to the instructions of manufacturer (product EQ 6841-9601, EUROIMMUN; https://www.euroimmun.com). When the positive control tube shows a reaction (to confirm sufficient quantity and viability of immune cells), the IFN-\u03b3 concentration from the specific stimulation tube (after subtracting the IFN\u03b3 background) was used to quantify specific T-cell responses.",

Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's R) and p-value were calculated to evaluate the correlation between variables, where a Person's R between 0 and 0.19 is regarded as very weak, 0.2 and 0.39 as weak, 0.40 and 0.59 as moderate, 0.6 and 0.79 as strong, and 0.8 and 1 as very strong correlation (11) . To identify potential factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (yes/no), a binary logistic regression analysis using the logitem command in Stata (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA, version 15) to correct for the specificity and sensitivity of the test was performed. We estimated the models with the following explanatory variables: comorbidity, COVID-19 disease course, and time since the positive COVID-19 test by rt-PCR. Two separate models were run to account for potential confounding. Model 1 included an unadjusted analysis and Model 2 included age-and sex-adjusted analysis. Confounding occurs in epidemiological research when the relationship between a given exposure and a specific outcome (i.e., seropositivity) is distorted (confused) by the influence of a third variable or group of variables (confounders). In this analysis, age and sex were considered confounders if they changed the coefficient of the significant variables by > 10%. The 95% CI for odds ratios (OR) were calculated and a p = 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses using were conducted using Stata version 15.0.",

These data substantiate our previous findings from the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020 (9) . On a population basis, the clinical severity of the disease was positively correlated with the level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (Tables 3, 4) , as had been shown previously by others (12) . On an individual level, there was great variability between patients. Thus, the individual level of antibodies is not of diagnostic value, for example, for the assessment of patients with long COVID syndrome, which is often associated with chronic fatigue (13) . As expected, in many cases, the antibody levels faded over time. When compared with the first 3 months after infection, the mean antibody levels decayed steadily and approximately halved within 300 days (Figure 2) . Although our data do not allow a meaningful calculation of the half-life due to a cross-sectional design instead of longitudinal for each patient, the finding is in accordance with reports from others (14) (15) (16) (17) , who calculated the half-life of neutralizing IgG antibodies with 140 to 220 days. Recently, colleagues reported that IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid protein reduced the risk of reinfection for up to 10 months after primary infection (18) . Researchers from the University of Padua and Imperial College London tested more than 85% of the 3,000 residents of Vo' , Italy, in February/March 2020 for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and tested them again in May and November 2020. The strength of the immune response did not depend on the symptoms and the severity of the infection. The team found that 98.8% of people infected in February/March showed detectable levels of antibodies in November, and there was no difference between people who had suffered symptoms of COVID-19 and those who had been symptom-free. The results showed that while all antibody types showed some decline between May and November, the rate of decay was different depending on the assay (19) . Interestingly, after COVID vaccination, neutralization capacity was different from natural infection (20) .",

Like with the antibody kinetics, the IFN-\u03b3 values decayed over time after infection with similar kinetics (Figure 3) which is in line with other works (21) . Unexpectedly, however, we saw a substantial number of patients with low-antibody levels and extremely high-IFN-\u03b3 levels and vice versa (Figure 4) . Although unlikely, it cannot be completely ruled out that the observed T-cell reactivity was due to pre-existing memory of T cells recognizing the common cold coronaviruses, as has been described before (22, 23) . Existing T cells might be an explanation for cross-reactions in an IGRA that could also be seen in our study (24) . To explain this dichotomy, an in-depth longitudinal analysis of the precise numbers and types of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells will be necessary, especially the characterization of T memory cells.",

The antigens used are based on the S1 of the wild type-this is the antigenic origin currently used by all wellknown manufacturers. We mainly conclude from our data that using antibody, neutralizing and IFN-\u03b3 assays are useful to monitor individual immune responses. However, we know that in infections with the beta or delta variant, for example, there are mutations that lead to a kind of immune escape. Theoretically, it cannot be ruled out that in infections with highly divergent variants, differences in immune responses against the S1 used would be observed.",

Longitudinal data for each subject, with at least three timepoints per subject, would be required to better understand the kinetics of durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Furthermore, since patients were sampled only once at various time-points after the confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, the results are vulnerable to bias caused by individual variations and inter-individual variation cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, the current cross-sectional data describe well the dynamics of spike-specific antibodies over 10 months and IFN-\u03b3 release by blood T lymphocytes at one study point.
