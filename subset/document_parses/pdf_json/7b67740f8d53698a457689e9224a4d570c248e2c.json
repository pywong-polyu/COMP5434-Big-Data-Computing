Vaccinating HCPs is an essential preventive measure to protect them and their patients against communicable diseases, while positively and directly impacting the functioning of the healthcare system. In India, healthcare represents one of the largest employment sectors with 3.8 million HCPs; however, there is limited awareness of national immunisation guidelines for the Indian HCP population. Data from communicable disease outbreaks across India suggest inadequate vaccination rates amongst HCPs; studies have reported influenza and varicella vaccination rates as low as 4.4% and 16%, respectively. In this review, we discuss data highlighting the impact of insufficient vaccination coverage, barriers to vaccination, and the lack of immunisation guidelines amongst HCPs in India. COVID-19 vaccination programmes for HCPs have been critical in slowing the pandemic in India. This provides an opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of vaccines amongst HCPs in India.",

            "text": "Communicable diseases and related adverse health outcomes are a concern for HCPs and their patients. Face-to-face visits allow HCPs to provide invaluable healthcare services to the patient; however, they are at increased risk of communicable disease [2] . For example, transmission of the influenza virus can occur from HCPs to patients and from patients to HCPs [3] . The significance of possible transmission is exacerbated in at-risk populations, including those who are pregnant, immunocompromised or have comorbidities [4] . In the event of nosocomial disease outbreaks in the healthcare setting, control measures can include closure of medical departments, but this is a costly measure. One analysis from August 2005 investigated global outbreaks reported at www. outbreak-database.com and showed that 38.5% of influenza outbreaks resulted in closure of hospital units in an attempt to reduce the spread of the disease [5] . An additional burden on healthcare services is the transmission of infections from HCPs to family members, which has been observed in the recent COVID-19 pandemic [6] . Initial reports from a Wuhan hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that 29% of the cases were HCPs infected with SARS-CoV-2 while treating patients. Of these, 77.5% worked on general wards, 17.5% were from the emergency department and 5% were from intensive care units [7] . Healthcare services risk being understaffed if HCPs are unable to work when infected [8] . This highlights that more cost-effective, protective measures against infectious diseases are needed for HCPs. HCP health and wellbeing is a key consideration in the context of infectious diseases and can be achieved through preventative measures, including telemedicine and vaccination. Initiatives that incorporate vaccination against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) may prevent the transmission and/or acquisition of infections in HCPs [8] .",

However, affordability is a barrier that limits access, with many people in India having low socio-economic status. Overcrowding can occur in both sectors, but is a particular risk in the public sector, which offers most of its services at no cost or comparatively low costs [14] . Overcrowding is an additional risk for the spread of infections and VPDs among HCPs, patients and their visitors, where general wards, waiting halls and emergency departments are often poorly ventilated. To improve our understanding of this risk, we review existing seroprevalence studies to assess the vulnerability of HCPs to infectious diseases.",

Among HCPs, it has been shown that seropositivity for anti-HAV antibodies through previous exposure can vary because of factors including age, education, occupation, income and socio-economic class [44] . However, in India, a decline in infection rate in children due to improved living conditions has led to an increase in susceptible adults, who are more likely to have severe morbidity and mortality if not exposed in childhood [45] [46] [47] . This is highlighted by HAV outbreaks that have disproportionately affected adolescents and adults compared with children [48] . In Kerala, an outbreak in 1998 led to 399 cases of hepatitis A, 65% of which were in adults aged 15-33 years [49] . In 2004, an outbreak occurred at a medical college hospital, also in Kerala; of 1180 cases, 540 were from the college, including 170 HCPs, and two deaths were reported among doctors [50] . Due to the historically high seroprevalence of HAV antibodies from a young age in India, there is no universal vaccination against HAV recommended for children, and HCPs are not universally included in the list of at-risk adults for whom a HAV vaccination is recommended [51, 52] . With an increasing population of adults who are seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies, vaccination is becoming increasingly important. Vaccination in children could provide protection into adulthood [53] ; however, it is also important to consider broadening HAV vaccination coverage in adult populations, particularly for at-risk groups such as HCPs.",

HBV infection among HCPs is an occupational hazard because of frequent exposure to infectious bodily fluids. It has been estimated that globally around 3 million HCPs experience such exposure each year [54] . One of the most frequent ways HCPs are exposed to HBV is through needle stick injuries (NSIs). Several studies have been conducted assessing NSIs among HCPs in India (Table 1) . Several HBV outbreaks in healthcare settings around the world have been reported, where the strain of HBV determines the severity of the resultant disease [55] [56] [57] [58] . These studies highlight the need for additional efforts, beyond strict hygiene standards and adherence to standard precautions, to reduce the risk of HBV transmission in healthcare settings. Vaccination against HBV infection among HCPs is relatively low ranging between 25.8% and 55.4% in centres across India; vaccination coverage in some other areas of the world is also inadequate (Figs. 2, 3) . In studies conducted in New Delhi and Bhopal, 44.6% of HCPs in New Delhi and 61.2% of HCPs in Bhopal were not vaccinated against HBV infection (including HCPs who did not know their vaccination status) [54, 59] . Similarly, a study investigating the status of HBV vaccination among dental students found that only 45% of students were vaccinated against HBV [60] .",

A vaccine targeting diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus has been used routinely in India since 1978, which significantly reduced incidence of disease in children. However, due to the duration of protection and need for boosters, it has led to concern over a potential shift of disease incidence into older age groups. In an investigation of male adults in Pune, India, who missed their initial vaccination, 88%, 100% and 79% of individuals were protected against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, respectively. However, long-term protection was only observed in 9% for diphtheria and 74% for tetanus. After receiving the recommended diphtheria-tetanus vaccine, all participants were protected, with long-term protection achieved in 87% for diphtheria and 97% for tetanus [71] .

These studies highlighted that HCPs were often too busy to get vaccinated and/ or did not perceive themselves as an 'at-risk' population. The reasons HCPs provided for not receiving a vaccine included inconvenient timing and location, cost, hospitals not providing free vaccines, needle phobia, concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy (especially for newer vaccines) and the lack of official recommendation to receive the vaccine.",

They work in a hazardous environment, which is often unpredictable and may lead to physical, mental and social stress. Therefore, HCPs may be directly or indirectly at risk of exposure to infection and VPDs as they work close to their patients. Our review highlights that HCPs susceptible to VPDs can contribute to nosocomial infection or disease outbreaks within the community and that there is a gap between vaccination coverage [16, 20, 22-24, 75, 76] . Moreover, challenges and barriers regarding vaccination awareness and uptake exist among HCPs, highlighted in a study by Tandale BV et al.

Vaccine education amongst HCPs is one pivotal strategy that could support this initiative. For example, a study by Bali NK et al. showed that an educational journey regarding the influenza vaccination, including its tolerability and efficacy, will be beneficial for all HCPs [16] . Such initiatives will be considered as a complementary step towards national initiatives for VPD control and elimination. In our review, we observed that there are several guidelines that recommend HCP vaccination, although there are differences and discrepancies in their specific recommendations. Thus, a uniform policy in an Indian context should be developed, appropriately implemented and routinely followed up, so the spread of VPDs and disease outbreaks can be prevented or controlled.",

HCP vaccination status assessment is recommended before their duty rosters are prepared and assigned and before they encounter vulnerable patients. Moreover, screening and vaccination records should be maintained for all HCPs across the various healthcare departments to aid in any follow-up or further action. If the cost of screening and documentation of immunity are an additional burden on healthcare expenditure, it might be prudent to vaccinate each HCP at the time of admission (after considering the cost-benefit ratio), considering that vaccination is more cost-effective than screening (both serology and/or medical history). An additional strategy to increase HCP vaccination could include sharing updates on airborne infections, VPDs and disease outbreaks across the healthcare setting, through text messages, emails or print media. Applying these measures may help HCPs protect themselves, their family members, peers and patients without disrupting healthcare services.",

Induction training programmes on disease awareness along with screening and vaccination should be implemented at respective institutes across India to resolve several misperceptions and beliefs regarding vaccinations. In addition, it will be important to immunise all HCPs, not just those who are in direct contact with patients. Hospital and clinic administrations must be proactive against VPDs and should develop guidelines and implement vaccination programmes as a standard policy. A dedicated infrastructure towards implementation of vaccination policies in HCPs and prevention of disease through vaccination alongside other preventive measures should be considered as a priority for limiting nosocomial infections.",
