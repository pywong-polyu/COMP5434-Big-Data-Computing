            "text": "Objective Cervical cancers present major threats to women's health in China. Eliminating cervical cancer in China is a huge challenge, with application of the HPV vaccine, which is an important part. Methods There are currently four HPV vaccines available in China: E-coli bv-HPV (Wantai, China), bv-HPV, qv-HPV (GSK, UK), and 9v-HPV (MSD, USA). To observe the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of these four vaccines in China, we formed the ''Chinese Expert Consensus on the Clinical Application of HPV Vaccine.'' Results At 7 months after vaccination, all vaccinated subjects had the same immunogenic response to either HPV16 or HPV18, ranging from 96 to 100%, and antibody production in girls aged 9-14 years was 2-3 times higher than that in adult women. Efficacy of the four vaccines against CIN2 ? ranged from 87.3% to 100%, with prevention of HPV-associated infection reaching 96% * 97% at 12 months. Clinical trials showed bv-HPV and qv-HPV vaccine were also safe in women aged 18-45 years. Clinical trials of the 9v-HPV vaccine are underway. HPV vaccination is currently voluntary and self-paid in China. The ''Chinese Expert Consensus on the Clinical Application of HPV Vaccine'' will work to promote the application of HPV vaccine in China. Conclusions In clinical studies, the available HPV vaccines showed excellent efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in Chinese women. We will continue strengthening screening and encouraging HPV vaccination.",
