Family medicine is a specialty that provides continuing care for family members regardless of age, gender, or comorbidities. Family medicine treats all patients with acute illness and chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the public's perception and awareness of family medicine and family physicians. The analysis showed that nearly half of the participants (286, 55.1%) were aware of the role of family physicians, and most respondents (450, 86.7%) had previously heard about family physicians. However, a large percentage of the participants (61.7%) had never visited a family physician, and fewer than half knew the locations of family medical centers. These outcomes are similar to another study conducted in Jazan, which reported that 467 (56.3%) of the participants were aware of the role of family physicians. However, a large group of the participants (749, 90.2%) had no regular family physician, and 496 (59.8%) preferred seeing a specialist [9] . According to a previous study by Aldhamadi and Alzahrani in the cities of Dammam and Al-Khobar, the reasons for avoiding PHCs might include long waiting times (29.94%), inconvenient working hours (29.94%), unreliable physicians (29,38%), and distant PHCs (6.21%) [16] . In another study in Dammam, Bograin et al. reported that 61.1% of the study participants know about the role of family physicians in treating clinical and surgical diseases such as respiratory, urinary, and skin diseases [13] , results that agree with ours to some extent; almost half of our participants were aware that family physicians could treat respiratory (57.2%), urinary (45.3%), and skin (49.9%) diseases.",

Regarding the involvement of family physicians in various clinics such as pediatric health and preventive medicine, the analysis estimated that 40.8% of our study participants knew about the presence of family physicians in maternity clinics, which is lower than the percentage estimated in the previous study from Nairobi, where 55% confirmed that family physicians had a part in prenatal clinics [17] .",

The earlier findings proved that despite the high awareness regarding family medicine and family physicians, there is a tendency to favor emergency departments and specialized clinics over family medicine clinics. We, therefore, recommend organizing community-based campaigns to emphasize the benefits of a regular physician as the first contact and clarifying the services that family medicine clinics offer. These efforts will ensure complete, easy, and time-saving access to healthcare and will markedly decrease the burden on other medical departments.",
