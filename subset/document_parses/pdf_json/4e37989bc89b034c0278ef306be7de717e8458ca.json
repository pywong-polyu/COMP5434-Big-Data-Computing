            "text": "Stress is often associated with negative experiences or notions of distress and negative effects that are related with the incapacity to deal with them. Every job can produce a certain level of stress which can affect individuals at all levels in the organization, from employees to managers to senior leaders. If stress is occasional it does not appear to be harmful, but problems often arise when it is chronic. Some of the sources of stress at work include interactions among employees, the workload, personal responsibility, and conflicts between home and work. Stress is known to cause adverse effects on health, physically and mentally [1, 2] . For instance, it can lead to an escalated anxiety, substance addiction, burnout and depression. Employees who feel stressed at work are highly likely to get involved in unhealthy behaviors like poor diet, smoking, drug abuse, and alcoholism. Reports show that excess work stress leads to approximately 120,000 deaths and a total of approximately $190 billion in health care costs annually [3] around the world. This is about 5-8% of the healthcare spending of national economies, which is a result of high direct expenditures (about $48 billion), lack of insurance cover (about $40 billion), and conflict ($24 billion) [4] . Work stress can worsen an existing mental health problem, thus making it harder to control. Common mental and physical health issues and stress can exist independently, meaning people can be stressed about work and at the same time experience physical changes like high blood pressure with no depression or other mental health conditions. They may also have depression without experiencing stress. The effects of work stress include reduced job satisfaction, absenteeism, poor delivery of services and higher mortality rates.",

Professional stress occurs due to a discrepancy between the demands at the workplace and the capacity of an individual to meet these demands [5, 6] . Professional stress greatly affects productivity, mental, physical, behavioral, and emotional health among professionals. The Professional Stress Scale (PSS) is a self-reporting technique for establishing sources of stress for professionals. It is utilized to determine the degree of stress experienced by professionals in the healthcare workplace (specifically referencing mental health professionals who work in schools such as school psychologists) and in the school environment [7, 8] . This paper aims to discuss work stress, mental health and validate the Professional Stress Scale. For this purpose, the 33-item PSS scale, which includes four subscales, was administered to 200 individuals in a cool group and 1137 individuals in an experimental group. It had a Cronbach's Alpha score of 0.936 and KMO score of 0.925.",

            "text": "Most jobs may promote work related stress, particularly nowadays it involves the healthcare sector [9] [10] [11] . There are few studies carried out on mental health professionals, whose work is often considered less interesting, however, lots of research shows that these professionals may display high vulnerability to stress. Reports show that psychiatrists seem to have the highest rates of suicide among healthcare practitioners [12, 13] . Other authors report that mental health professionals experience a wide range of problems which lead them to drop out of training [14] . According to [15] , there is a perceived distress level of 59% of clinical psychology trainees, which is higher than in other groups. If the stresses of mental health professionals have to be mitigated, it is important to systematically analyze the stressors that cause them. Some studies show that mental health professionals face different stressors from other professionals in other healthcare sectors. Mental health studies show that besides being susceptible to stressors that are inbuilt in the workplace, mental health workers tend to face more challenges. For instance, a descriptive literature review reveals that the two primary sources of stress in healthcare facilities are patient contact, and organizational and administrative factors. According to the research conducted by Travers and Firth-Cozens [16] , some of the causes of stress in the workplace include lack of resources and shortage of personnel, along with the major one being violent experiences with patients. While most of the problems in psychiatry field seem to be common to all health workers, the impacts may be aggravated by the intrinsic nature of the job. As such, Ref. [17, 18] show that there are unique problems in this group that should be addressed. Thus, there is a great need for more research on the specific stressors faced by mental health workers. Hellman et al. [19] established five key stressors related to the therapeutic role of mental health workers in the public and private sectors. These factors include scheduling, professional uncertainty, personal degradation, work overload, and sustaining a therapeutic relationship. In a study of psychologists, Cushway and Tyler [20] noted that factors like self-doubt and client distress were stress factors. Additionally, other factors like organizational issues and workload were revealed. The coronavirus has changed the way people live and work. The study by Irawanto et al. [21] revealed that working from home, work-life balance, and work-related stress have significant effects, both direct and indirect, on job satisfaction. In fact, COVID-19 has changed working conditions due to social distancing policies. As many workers have begun to use new technologies at work, the study by Oksanen et al. [22] probed the potential effects of social media communication (SMC) stress on work. The results indicate a disparity in the resilience of workers during remote work and highlight the need for organisational support [23] . The study by Hong et al. [24] , on the other hand, examined the associations between work overload, parental stress, work-family conflict, and job satisfaction during COVID-19. Seven hundred and eighteen kindergarten teachers participated in the study.",

There are claims that in areas such as education, services and the aid professions nothing material is built, and the immateriality of the product of work is something that can upset the individual, as the lack of a material aspect makes work critical. The Mental Health Professionals Stress Scale (MHPSS) is a self-assessment method for identifying sources of stress for mental health professionals. The 42-item scale, which includes seven subscales, was administered to 154 clinical psychologists and 111 mental health nurses. MHPSS was found to have good internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.87 for clinical psychologists; \u03b1 = 0.94 for mental health nurses). Preliminary evidence suggests that the simultaneous validity of MHPSS is good. The modified mental health Professional Stress Scale (PSS) is used to assess self-perceived work-related stress [31] . This research included a validation of the Italian Version of Professional Stress Scale [32, 33] . The questionnaire consists of 33 questions and detects the frequency of occurrence of certain stressful events using the following 4-value scale: 0 = never happened, 1 = doesn't happen usually, 2 = happens occasionally, and 3 = happens to me.",

The effectiveness of these scales for measuring stress has been studied in various mental health settings, ranging from nurses, to university students, to public administration workers [37, 38] . Edwards and Burnard [39] revealed an excessive level of workplace stress for mental health nurses. The most frequently reported sources of stress were administrative and organizational concerns, patient issues, heavy workload, interprofessional conflict, financial and resource issues, professional self-doubt, home/work conflict, staffing levels, changes in the health service, maintaining standards, lecturing and teaching, long waiting lists, and poor supervision.",

In fact, nurses and social workers showed significantly higher total scores than clinical psychologists, and there were significant differences in subscale scores among professionals. Results and reviews conducted to date have suggested that the scale was a useful measure and predictor of stress [41] . Specifically, in this study, the PSS was administered to professionals in the educational setting; indeed, it was found that there are contexts such as education, service, and helping professions in which the immateriality of the work product can upset the individual. For this reason, in order to better assess the dynamics related to work stress, the need emerges to validate the PSS tool in Italian.",
