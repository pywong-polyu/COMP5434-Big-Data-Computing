Misinformation and widespread reporting of vaccine-related myocarditis are contributing to vaccine hesitancy. When compared to severe cardiac complications that are associated with COVID-19, vaccine-related myocarditis has a milder presentation, is easily treated, and has a good prognosis. Acute COVID-19 has been associated with higher rates of myocarditis and myocardial injury. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children occurs weeks after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 and can be associated with severe cardiovascular complications and death. Cardiac complications associated with acute COVID-19 and MIS-C are more severe and occur more frequently than myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Furthermore, some of the academic and social disruptions caused by the pandemic expect to be eased by widespread vaccination. For all these reasons, COVID-19 vaccination is strongly recommended for all eligible age groups.",

            "text": "There has been vaccine hesitancy among families of young children who are now eligible to receive the coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine. This hesitancy remains despite clear recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that everyone five years and older receive the COVID-19 vaccine [1] . As of December 1, 2021, 15% of 5-11-year olds have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 60% of 12-17-year olds have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, with wide variation across states [2] . Misinformation and widespread reporting of vaccine-related myocarditis are likely contributing to this hesitancy, although this adverse reaction is rare, easily treated, and has a good prognosis. While it is known that older individuals are much more likely to become severely ill or require mechanical ventilation from COVID-19, with greater than 80% of deaths related to COVID-19 occurring in the 65 and older population [1] , it is important to remember that although rare, children who contract severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are at risk for severe outcomes, including post-infective myocarditis, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and even death. As more of the older population gets vaccinated, adolescents and young adults aged 12-29 years represent an increasing proportion of COVID-19 cases [3] . Although most children who contract SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild illness, the CDC has reported 2095 deaths due to COVID-19 among those aged 5 to 24 years as of November 24, 2021 [4] . This paper serves to review cardiac complications associated with acute COVID-19 infection, MIS-C, and vaccine-related myocarditis.",

The exact mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to myocarditis is unknown.

Pediatric cases of fulminant myocarditis [11] [12] [13] and arrhythmias have been reported [14, 15] . These pediatric patients have not had any significant underlying health conditions and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction. Cardiac complications have been reported in neonates as young as nine days of life [15] .

MIS-C can resemble Kawasaki disease as they both have similar laboratory and clinical features. In contrast, however, MIS-C disproportionately affects African American and Hispanic patients, occurs at an older age (mean age of nine years old), and appears to have a higher incidence of myocarditis, elevated troponins, ventricular dysfunction, and vasopressor requirements [22] . It has been reported that between 50 and 70% of patients with MIS-C have myocarditis [23, 24] and in a study by Son et al. evaluating 518 hospitalized pediatric patients diagnosed with MIS-C, 47% required vasopressor support, 41% had depressed left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 12% developed coronary artery aneurysm, and 3% required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [25] . Furthermore, in a case series evaluating 20 patients with MIS-C and cardiac involvement, 50% of patients had depressed left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction < 55%) on echocardiography and myocardial edema suggestive of myocarditis on cMRI [26] . While short-term cardiac outcomes in these patients are reassuring, with almost all patients fully recovering at 2-week follow-up, there is some evidence that diastolic dysfunction may persist in a small subset of patients six months after acute illness [27] . Due to these severe findings, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that patients with a diagnosis of MIS-C and cardiac involvement should not be cleared for physical activity for at least 3-6-month post-infection, and clearance should be obtained by a cardiologist [28] .",

            "text": "There are three predominant hypotheses on the underlying pathophysiology of MIS-C. The first postulates a post-infectious autoimmune response. Patients with MIS-C present several weeks after acute infection, have low viral load, low immunoglobulin M (IgM), and high IgG and IgA expression [29] . It is therefore plausible that like other viral triggers of autoimmunity, SARS-CoV-2 activates an autoimmune response resulting in tissue damage [20, 30] . A second theory is that there is an uncontrolled immune response to prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen. Yonker et al. have shown that weeks after acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 antigen can still be found in the gastrointestinal tract of patients who developed MIS-C [31] . Finally, similar to patients with toxic shock syndrome, a third theory suggests \"superantigen-like activity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\" \u2192 incites a dysregulated immune response with cytokine storm [30] . As it pertains to cardiovascular dysfunction, the release of cytokines (TNF-\u237a IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3) is the known cause for left ventricular dysfunction, affecting both the extracellular matrix and myocyte contractility [32] . The pathophysiology of MIS-C may indeed be multifactorial, yet in order to tailor management, more research is needed to determine the downstream cardiac effects of this inflammation.",

However, in June 2021, the CDC reported a post-vaccine myocarditis rate that was higher than expected from baseline. The myocarditis predominantly occurs in adolescent males after the second dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with the onset of chest pain ranging from one to five days after vaccine administration. As of November 24, 2021, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has received 1949 reports of myocarditis or myopericarditis after the mRNA COVID-19 vaccination among people 30 years of age and younger [37] , with 1071 confirmed cases by the CDC and Food and Drug Administration [38] . One study showed the rate of myocarditis after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech was approximately 54 cases per million doses administered to males aged 12-17 years [1] . The CDC estimates the incidence of myocarditis after the COVID-19 vaccine to be 1.2 per 100,000 doses administered to those between the ages of 18 and 29 years [3] . The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) found the rate of myocarditis after the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in the 12-29-year age group to be 40.6 cases per million in males and 4.2 cases per million in females [39] . In clinical trials, no cases of myocarditis have occurred in children aged five to 11 years who have received the COVID-19 vaccine [1] .",

            "text": "Myocarditis involves inflammation of the myocardium, whereas myopericarditis involves the pericardium as well. Diagnosis is made clinically along with electrocardiogram (EKG), cardiac markers, echocardiogram, and cMRI to support the diagnosis. Typically, patients present with chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations within 1-5 days of receiving the second dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. While pathophysiology of COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis and myopericarditis is still unclear, there are few potential mechanisms proposed. COVID-19 vaccination may trigger an immune-mediated adverse response in those with genetically predisposed individuals with preexisting dysregulated pathways [40] . Another theory is that those with elevated heart-reactive autoantibodies, which are found in patients susceptible to myocarditis, may attack the cardiac myocytes after vaccination [41] . Diagnostic findings to suggest post-vaccine myocarditis or myopericarditis may include elevated troponin, elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated inflammatory markers, diffuse ST-segment elevation, nonspecific ST changes, T-wave inversions on EKG, left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiography, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and myocardial edema \u00b1 late gadolinium enhancement based on T2-weighted imaging or T2 mapping on cMRI. Acute management is the same as for viral myocarditis/myopericarditis: supportive care to treat the symptoms, ensure adequate perfusion, and treat arrhythmias. While controversial, patients can receive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immune globulin (IVIG), and steroids. Once patients have clinically improved and labs are downtrending, they are discharged home. Reported cases to date have shown that patients have a benign clinical course and favorable short-term outcomes. In most patients, follow-up 3-6 months after have shown resolution of symptoms with normal ventricular function [42] . No deaths from myocarditis post-mRNA COVID-19 vaccination have been reported in the USA, with very rare deaths reported worldwide. A systematic international review of mortality following COVID-19 vaccination found two autopsy-confirmed cases of myocarditis causing death, one in a 22-year-old man following the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and one in a 42-year-old man following the Moderna vaccine [43] . The pathophysiology and long-term complications, if any, need to be studied further. Despite the risks of myocarditis or myopericarditis associated with vaccination, the benefits of vaccination likely outweigh the risk of COVID-19.",

The CDC has reported an increased risk of myocarditis in the adolescent and young adult population after the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, but this is a rare complication with a good prognosis. It is important to keep this risk in perspective, especially in the context of an ongoing pandemic with new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Children, adolescents, and young adults are not immune to some of the complications associated with severe COVID-19 disease, and widespread vaccination is effective in mitigating severe medical complications, preventing further community spread, and lessening the disruptions associated with the pandemic, with the ultimate goal of ending this global crisis.",
