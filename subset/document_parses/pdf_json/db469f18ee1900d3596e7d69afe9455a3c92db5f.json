The association between rituximab and COVID-19-related death could have also been influenced by the typical coadministration of methylprednisolone with rituximab.",

This association has also been reported in results from an international registry of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and COVID-19, where sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) use was associated with severe ). 20 This finding is surprising as sulfasalazine is usually considered to have a low immunosuppressive effect. Prior research supports an immune regulatory effect driven by sulfasalazine or its metabolite 5-ASA against other RNA viruses. [21] [22] [23] [24] However, causal interpretation of the association between sulfasalazine and COVID-19-related death should not be made. The perceived low immunosuppressive effect of sulfasalazine may have led rheumatologists to prescribe preferentially sulfasalazine over methotrexate in patients who were perceived to be at higher risk, for example, patients with pulmonary disease, smoking or recurrent chest infections. In an observational study like ours, this could lead to unmeasured confounding. A salient difference in sulfasalazine users in our study was a higher proportion of current or former smokers, compared with non-users. In the stratified analyses for chronic lung disease, the association between death and sulfasalazine was significant in both subgroups with and without chronic lung disease, while in the stratified analyses for smoking, the association between death and sulfasalazine was limited to ever smokers, so the factor 'smoking' could potentially be an effect modifier. Another potential explanation for this finding could be the Missing values were imputed via multiple imputation, patient numbers may thus be rounded. Effects significant at level \u03b1=0.05 are marked in bold. Patients were excluded from a particular analysis if the medication they received provided \u226420 patients for that analysis or if there were no deaths reported for that specific medication.",

IL-6 inhibitors have been used to counteract the hyperinflammatory state produced by COVID-19, with mostly disappointing randomised trial results. 25 26 Their efficacy is still being investigated in ongoing trials, but it is reassuring that they were not associated with COVID-19-related death in our analyses. Previous studies had shown an association between TNF inhibitors and a decreased risk of sepsis and mortality in patients with RA after serious infection compared with csDMARDs. 27 28 We could not confirm such an association after stratification by disease and adjustment for disease activity. However, the data indicate that some associations may exist among patients diagnosed with IJD other than RA (a subgroup comprising predominantly patients with axial SpA and PsA), in whom male sex and diabetes mellitus were associated with a higher odds of death, and TNF inhibitor use was associated with a lower odds of death (univariable analysis, data not shown). Due to a small number of deceased patients in this subgroup with non-RA subtypes of IJD (n=37 deaths), these effects could not be assessed in a multivariable model and this should be investigated in the future when higher case numbers allow a more stable assessment.
