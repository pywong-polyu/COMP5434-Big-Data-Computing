The hostility toward nurses, physicians, and hospital staff has reached the point that it can be considered a public health problem. In this paper, we focus on the harassment, aggression, and violence that many healthcare workers have encountered while treating unstable psychiatric patients in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a case with a history of violence toward mental health workers, review psychopathological and clinical aspects, and discuss how both the COVID-19 pandemic and current challenges in psychiatric hospital settings increase the frequency and severity of these attacks and how this affects the team on inpatient psychiatric units. We used the CARE guidelines to provide the most accurate and transparent information about the patient and relevant psychosocial aspects. We also pooled more than 20 unique sources to cover all aspects of violent behaviors in all psychiatric settings for all age groups. We concluded that a lack of nursing staff, the mental burden imposed by difficult patients, and poor communication between team members are some of the factors contributing to patient violence. An incomplete understanding of the problem creates barriers to change on both personal and systematic levels. Constant violence and abuse against healthcare workers cause stress, decreased productivity, and work dissatisfaction. To improve the safety of healthcare professionals, especially in inpatient psychiatric settings, several system-based changes should be implemented.",

            "text": "Physical aggression and violence against healthcare workers is a serious problem that has been increasing over the past several years. Recent studies have elucidated how serious and commonplace these events can be in the middle of the pandemic [1] . In November 2020, National Nurses United (NNU) surveyed 15,000 nurses across the country and concluded that 20% of respondents reported increased workplace violence during the global pandemic. Moreover, 31% of nurses stated that workplace violence had increased even further, as reported in NNU's COVID-19 survey published in September 2021 [2] . Recent data published by the University of California, Berkeley's Human Rights Center revealed more than 1100 threats or episodes of violence against healthcare workers worldwide, while 400 incidents were directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic [3] . According to the CDC, almost 25% of healthcare workers report feeling bullied, threatened, or harassed because of the nature of their work and ongoing professional responsibilities [1] . In the context of COVID-19, rates of referral to mental health and psychological services have decreased, but the global pandemic has dramatically cut the availability of inpatient psychiatric beds, despite an increase in psychological distress and violence on inpatient units. The continued rise of workplace violence has been noted in mental health institutions and inpatient psychiatric settings across the country. In Missouri, a tripling of physical assaults against healthcare workers forced Cox Medical Center to order panic buttons for hospital staff to provide some measure of workplace violence prevention during the pandemic. In 2020, the number of episodes (including physical aggression and assaults) increased from 40 to 123, while reported injuries increased from 17 to 78. Although official numbers are still unavailable, hospital officials have reported that many of the episodes were directly related to underlying mental illness and/or substance use [4, 5] . Even before the pandemic, experts had grown increasingly worried about the problem of violence toward healthcare employees, including mental health workers, in Missouribased hospitals [4, 6] . According to the Missouri Nurses Association, hostility and violence against healthcare workers increased dramatically from 2018 to 2020 [7] . The Kansas Hospital Association also emphasized that workplace violence in the Kansas/Missouri area was associated with an ongoing opioid crisis, substance abuse, psychiatric and behavioral problems, and staff shortages [8] . While their study did not focus on workplace violence in behavioral health facilities, the authors specifically outlined the inpatient psychiatric setting as \"a risk factor for workplace violence.\" The following case clearly demonstrates that unstable psychiatric patients may be a danger to themselves or others on the unit while indirectly contributing to staff shortages, as they are unable to understand the effects or the results of these violent actions.",

The toxicology screen was negative. She demonstrated lifetime patterns of insecurity, antisocial traits, impulse control problems, possessiveness in relationships, use of violence for need gratification, and an overall sense of inadequacy. Specifically, she reported ongoing thoughts of harming her half-brother and his significant other, and had at one point destroyed some of her half-brother's property. This patient also had a history of violent behaviors in jail, with several intimates being harmed or injured. The patient also had a lifelong pattern of faulty problem-solving skills, at least three past suicide attempts, and chronic substance abuse that led to impulse control problems and violent behaviors in three different treatment settings over the past five years. She tried multiple medications, including six antipsychotics, two mood stabilizers, and three anxiolytics, all with questionable compliance and poor treatment responses.",

Soon after, the patient began whispering to herself due to \"physical pain\", referring to a car accident that had happened four days prior. She began exhibiting signs of acute mania and psychosis and was observed responding to internal stimuli. She verbally threatened resident physicians and left the room abruptly, which terminated the initial interview. Later, the patient gestured for the interviewers to return to her room. She handed them a piece of paper that was handwritten and split into boxes. She stated that the information provided was \"patented\" and warned providers not to copy it. Her sheet contained medications, goals (including being elected president by 2030), and different bits of her health and psychiatric histories.",

During regular daily follow-ups with psychiatry residents, she would scream, curse, and use verbally abusive language when frustrated or stressed. She made excessive demands and unreasonable requests that needed to be met instantly. She used intimidating behavior to influence others to act in ways that tended to satisfy her personal needs, and failed to accept responsibility for deceitful behavior. She continued to threaten other patients on a daily basis and eventually required manual hold and mechanical restraints. There was an escalation of physical violence toward patients and staff, including throwing water, punching, and attacking others, including two psychiatry residents. Nursing staff consistently needed to move other patients from one unit to another due to safety concerns. Other patients also repeatedly questioned the staff's ability to handle this situation. The presence of this patient and the ongoing violence on the unit influenced the job performance, recruitment, and overall professional quality of life of residents and nursing staff. At least two team members reported that they were \"extremely concerned\" about issues including their safety around the patient, dysfunctional team dynamics and ineffective management of behavioral emergencies. Although specific numbers are not known, some staff members were either considering or planning to leave their current position because of dangerous staffing practices and being under too much pressure. Specifically, some members of our nursing team struggled to feel safe when attempting to respond to a patient's needs and were ready to quit or call in sick due to ongoing safety concerns. Already brutal shifts could easily turn into \"extra stress\" as other staff members walked away from the pressure, forcing other healthcare workers to stay with the patient and monitor for any changes in her behaviors. Additionally, staff themselves occasionally needed to be moved from one unit to another, and questioned the reasons for this patient's hospitalization, especially during the time of high acuity on the units. That, combined with the realization that some healthcare team members could make the same amount of moneyif not moreon unemployment. Many of our team members, including one psychiatry resident, ended up needing to go to the emergency department for evaluation of their physical injuries. The patient was then placed on a 21day involuntary hold for psychiatric stabilization.",

Again, this patient continued exhibiting violent behaviors, such as throwing liquids at others, becoming verbally agitated while saying somewhat unclear or nonsensical statements, and showcasing increasing emotional lability.

            "text": "While society, the media, and hospital officials have hailed healthcare workers as \"heroes of the pandemic\" for years, the US healthcare system has continued to neglect workplace violence prevention during the pandemic. Verbal and physical violence against healthcare workers is predominant, as these workers are the ones with the duty of endorsing masking and other restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although healthcare workers experienced workplace violence before the pandemic began, the COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously exacerbated the problem. Figure 2 highlights workplace violence in healthcare across the world, as reported by Insecurity Insight [23] . Reportedly, many professionals are subject to health threats, bullying, and abuse, both on social media and in the real world. Payne-Gill et al. [24] confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 35% increase in violent and aggressive cases due to local restrictions and poor patient-staff relationships. Interestingly, other authors noted significant reductions in aggression on inpatient psychiatric units during COVID-19 [25] . In some areas, there has been a dramatic rise in violence in psychiatric facilities and general hospitals [26, 27] . For example, in Long Island, New York, the main psychiatric hospital has seen a 60% rise in violence [28] . Part of this has been due to a 30% decrease in the pre-jail population, restricted access to long-term psychiatric care, and COVID-related court closures [28] . Interestingly, a very similar increase in patients' aggression was also found during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 [25] . Most incidents of aggression occurred on acute admission or locked units, with a prevalence ranging from 44% to 62% on chronic units, and 30% in the outpatient department [15] . The increase in aggression in patients can be triggered not just by the patient's clinical presentation, but also by the nature of the clinical work, which involves coming in close contact, assessing, and interacting with patients on a daily basis [29] . Kinoshita et al. [30] also found that violent behavior prior to hospitalization increased the chances of earlier discharge, which could affect patients' recovery in the middle of the pandemic. Table 1 provides additional information regarding workplace violence obtained during a survey of Michigan nurses in June 2020 [31] . Bed occupancy rates represent one of the reigning issues that mental health wards face during the pandemic, contributing to increased aggression among patients in 2020-2021. Research suggests that the net occupancy of beds was higher on days with aggressive incidents than on days without. An excess between 5% and 10% contributed to increased risk for aggression, with an excess greater than 10% showing the largest risk [15] . Additionally, there were reported findings of unhygienic surroundings, inadequate quality of food, unavailability of daily necessities, and a lack of privacy that contributed to aggression [15] .",

Instead, they are expected to be sent to a psychiatric facility and treated by multidisciplinary team until they are restored to competency. Although these individuals are committed by the courts, they cannot be admitted to the hospital due to staffing issues, overcrowding in psychiatric wards and local epidemiological restrictions. These patients tend to remain in the correctional facilities without appropriate care [38] . The situation is so devastating that Virginia State officials had to close five of eight state-sponsored adult psychiatric facilities to new admissions due to unprecedented staffing shortages noted in the middle of the pandemic. According to data published in July 2021, more than 100 state-employed mental health workers resigned in just two weeks and quickly received multiple job offers in the private healthcare network while contributing to understaffing and other challenges such as increased workloads on nursing staff, greater employee stress, and lower morale on state-run psychiatric units [39] .",

Job strain associated with overwork, tiredness, job dissatisfaction, negative staff morale, and poor collaboration among nurses, as well as poor satisfaction with leadership, contribute to higher reports of aggression in the wards [15] . Dean et al. [41] reported that violence toward psychiatric nurses was one of the most common concerns for employers and staff. They highlighted the lack of support from the administration as another reason why health workers could not deal with violent patients. Some private hospitals across the country tend to decline the most challenging psychiatric cases, while safety-net and community facilities have no choice but to admit these patients. This trend is expected to continue, raising questions about the impact that the policy will have on access to healthcare services in underserved communities. There also exists an issue for mental health patients who are stuck in the emergency department for days on end, prolonging the psychiatric care they need. This experience in mental health care is so common that it has its own name: \"boarding\" which is defined as spending more than 12 hours in an emergency department waiting for an appropriate placement [42] . Since 2020, the number of patients who have boarded in emergency departments has increased by between 200% and 400% [42] . The importance of boarding being eradicated in mental health ward settings cannot be understated: in the long term, patients, especially children, with mental health issues who are not treated right away may deal with worsened symptoms and worsened aggression as a result of improper care.",

It has also been noted that wards that included exclusively green or rural scenery reported significantly fewer physical and verbal incidents than wards with industrial scenery.

We have seen that many mental health services offered by facilities have been indefinitely suspended, there have been patients in need of help having their care delayed, and we have seen a tremendous transition to virtual care. Although more studies are needed to establish a more definitive relationship between workplace violence in healthcare and mental health settings and pandemic-related factors, the majority of attacks come from patients who have problems with substance abuse and mental illness. Patientrelated factors, such as homelessness and low socioeconomic status, and system-based aspects, such as staffing shortages, have been found to contribute to increased aggression in hospital settings. Ultimately, patient aggression is at its core a barrier to best practice and efficiency in care. It is a challenge that can delay treatment, placement, and stunt the best possible outcome a patient may have after a course of inpatient treatment. Although the clinician's right to refuse treatment of violent patients is allowed by law, many practitioners still treat all patients who need our help, regardless of their actions or abusive potential. Unfortunately, no matter what data are presented, medical and psychiatric facilities consistently stand out as some of the most dangerous workplaces in the United States.
