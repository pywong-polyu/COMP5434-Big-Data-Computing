This paper aims to present the PREparedness, RESponse and SySTemic transformation (PRE-RE-SyST): a model for a disability-inclusive pandemic responses and systematic disparities reduction. Methods: Scoping review with a thematic analysis was conducted on the literature published up to mid-September 2020, equating to the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven scientific databases and three preprint databases were searched to identify empirical or perspective papers addressing health and socio-economic disparities experienced by PwD as well as reporting actions to address them. Snowballing searches and experts' consultation were also conducted. Two independent reviewers made eligibility decisions and performed data extractions on any action or recommended action to address disparities. A thematic analysis was then used for the model construction, informed by a systems-thinking approach (i.e., the Iceberg Model).",

The PRE-RE-SyST model articulates a four-level strategic action to: 1) Respond to prevent or reduce disability disparities during a pandemic crisis; 2) Prepare ahead for pandemic and other crises responses; 3) Design systems and policies for a structural disabilityinclusiveness; and 4) Transform society's cultural assumptions about disability. 'Simple rules' and literature-based examples on how these strategies can be deployed are provided. Conclusion: The PRE-RE-SyST model articulates main strategies, 'simple rules' and possible means whereby public health authorities, policy-makers, and other stakeholders can address disability disparities in pandemic crises, and beyond. Beyond immediate pandemic responses, disability-inclusiveness is needed to develop everyday equityoriented policies and practices that can transform societies towards greater resiliency, as a whole, to pandemic and other health and social emergencies.",

For each of the four levels, there is one major response. These reflect the four main themes (under colored background in the figure) of our thematic analyses.

Hence, in rationing decisions on life-saving treatments, it is useful to explicitly distinguish between disability status (e.g., deafness or intellectual impairments, which do not affect survival) and comorbidities that have been shown to affect survival (e.g., end-stage cancer, cardiac dysfunction) [23, 46, 54] . Overall, categorical exclusions, especially ones based on disability or diagnosis, have been discouraged [22] . In addition to basing decisions on objective medical assessments, information affecting survival of PwD and people overall (e.g. on whether to follow acute treatment or palliate care) should be individualized, preference-sensitive, and holistic [9, 22, 46] .",

Scoring systems using qualityadjusted or disability-adjusted life-years should not be used too, as they are overtly discriminatory in explicitly counting a year for a person with disability as worth less than a year for an able-bodied person [22, 23] .

In the interaction with persons with these impairments, speech of professionals could be slowed down as appropriate, but not condescending, and sentences should be as clear as possible, incorporating a single piece of information, i.e. avoiding complex and long sentences with multiple conjunctions and connective [46] . Like in long-term care settings, staff may hold a photograph in the protective clothing, introduce themselves, use the name of the person within the interaction, and adopt a positive and calming tone [46] . Plain-language forms might be used in brochures or other written material supplied at admission or discharge [58] . Finally, healthcare providers could also wear transparent masks to allow lip reading by people with hearing impairments [17] .",

For example, instead of promoting 'social distancing', one can say: 'you should go to the supermarket only once a week. Once you are there, avoid getting too close to the others'.

Indeed, while this training for healthcare professional may be impractical during busy pandemic times, it should be mandatory for long-term disability disparities reduction [54, 58] .

'Simple rules' can accommodate innovative approaches as well as should be adaptive to emergent problems.

Similarly, multidisciplinary committees as well as lawyers have been arguing that PwD should have priority access to vaccines [124, 125] .

Specifically, we present eight 'simple rules' for action on responding to prevent or reduce disability disparities during a pandemic crisis (e.g., avoid disability discrimination in rationing decisions for scarce health resources), two 'simple rules' for stakeholders to prepared ahead for pandemic and other crises responses (e.g. use evidence on disability disparities and its reduction to inform planning), three 'simple rules' on the design of systems and policies for a structural disability-inclusiveness (e.g. mainstream disability in all policies and systems design), and three 'simple rules' on transforming societies' cultural assumptions about disability (e.g. reinforce disability-rights in health professionals' education). As a whole, the PRE-RE-SyST model can be used to foster equity-oriented policies and practices to transform and improve societies' overall resilience to pandemics and other public health emergencies, in a disability-inclusive manner. In addition to pandemic responses, disability-inclusiveness is needed everyday, from policy and systems design to transformational changes in cultural beliefs and assumptions -applicable to pandemics and beyond.",
