There is now clear evidence that severe obesity is a significant risk factor for mortality, independently of diabetes, chronic renal failure, and cancer in patients with SARS-CoV-2 [1, 2] . Bariatric surgery (BS) is the only effective long-term treatment for severe obesity [3] . During the first wave of SARS-CoV-2, BS activity almost completely stopped for several months. One of the reasons put forward was that a recent BS could expose obese patients to the risk of a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 due to massive weight loss, transient immune dysfunction, or vitamin and mineral deficiencies, which is frequent during the first year following BS. To further investigate the topic, we conducted a French nationwide cohort study to investigate the association between the time of bariatric surgery and the risk of hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2.",

We then estimated standardized hospitalization ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), with patients having had BS in 2015 as a reference age distribution. This allows taking into account the fact that those who had their surgery in 2015 were older than those operated more recently.

Even if this has been described outside the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we did not find that patients having experienced a BS recently at the time of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak had an increased risk of BS. By combining our finding, with the results of the GENEVA study which showed that 30-day morbidity and mortality following BS during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with locally appropriate perioperative SARS-CoV-2 protocols in place seemed to be similar to pre-pandemic levels, we have several arguments in favor of maintaining normal BS activity during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [7] .
