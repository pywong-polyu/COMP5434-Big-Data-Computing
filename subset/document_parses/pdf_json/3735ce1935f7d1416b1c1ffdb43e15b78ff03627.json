Group activities in nursing homes were also prohibited. As a consequence, the residents of nursing homes became more socially isolated.

Less than two-thirds (61%) of cases had lung opacities on CT; 20% of symptomatic patients had negative CTs. Although extremely valuable, these results should not be overstated. The CT findings studied (eg, groundglass opacity, consolidation) are not specific for COVID-19. Similar results would probably be found if CT were used during an influenza epidemic, for example. The positive predictive value of CT will be low unless disease prevalence is high, as we suspect it was in Wuhan.

Self-help guidance for reducing stress, such as relaxation or meditation exercise, could be delivered through electronic media. Service teams could support behavioural management through telephone hotlines. Psychological counsellors could provide online consultation for carers at home and in nursing homes. 11 In addition, we encourage people who have a parent with dementia to have more frequent contact or spend more time with their parent, or to take on some of the caregiving duties so as to give the carer some respite time.",
