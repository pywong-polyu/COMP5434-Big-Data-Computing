The patient presents with personal and medical characteristics (X). The clinician measures baseline levels for a set of biomarkers used to monitor disease progression (Y 0 ). Examples include pulse rate, oxygen saturation level, and body temperature. At this point, the clinician makes a preliminary assessment of her patient's risk for each of the three competing events: discharge (1), severe disease defined by the need for ventilation (2), or death (3), versus remaining event-free in the hospital for another day (0). We will write W t to denote the patient's status on day t, where W t \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}. When planning a clinical approach on day t > 0, the clinician updates her baseline assessment by taking into account the observed trajectories for the biomarkers Y 1:t . The clinical target for statistical analysis is the probability distribution of the future competing events and biomarkers given the individual patient's history up until today.

How does the prediction for this patient change if we restrict the training sample to patients 70 years of age? Which prior patients are most like this one and what happened to each of them?

Most institutions currently leave the process of seeking FDA approval to individual research groups to conduct the requisite experiments and file for approval. Lack of an institution-wide regulatory process is a large disincentive to research groups. The more common course for researchers is to form a company under their university's technology transfer policies, raise money for clinical testing, then the company seeks FDA approval. The company can then license the approved software back to the institution where it was developed.

The standard methods of evaluation illustrated in this paper are necessary but not sufficient to handle the dynamics. Curation comprises repeated routine re-training and re-evaluation of the models on early, middle and late subsets of the growing population of patients. A graphical curation dashboard might include a sequence of figures like Figure 3 along with Table 1 showing calibration and discrimination in each time period. In addition to routine curation, model version updates will likely be needed to adapt to the changing epidemiology. Updates must be version controlled and documented for clinical oversight. When a decision support tool is used in clinical care, the predictions and clinical decisions to which they contributed must be linked to the specific version of the software and training data from which they were generated so that the predictions are entirely reproducible.

The JH CROWN registry now includes more than 8,000 COVID-19 patients. An important systems-level question relevant to the ultimate impact of these and similar tools is how they are to be curated. In purchasing devices and pharmaceutical products, health systems count on their suppliers to monitor the longerterm efficacy and efficiency of their products as the population of patients and medical practice change over time. Currently, tools like the ones in this paper do not come with a dynamic curation process to sustain them over the longer-term. Should data science tools be sold like software, imagers, sequencers or drugs? If so, how should they be locally optimized across diverse populations and over time?",
