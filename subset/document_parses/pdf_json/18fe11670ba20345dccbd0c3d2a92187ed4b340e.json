Amid growing concerns regarding an \"infodemic,\" ensuring the quality of information is a crucial vector of public health. Investigating whether and how Wikipedia remained up to date and in line with science is key to formulating strategies to counter misinformation. Using citation analyses, we asked which sources informed Wikipedia's COVID-19-related articles before and during the pandemic's first wave (January-May 2020). Results: We found that coronavirus-related articles referenced trusted media outlets and high-quality academic sources. Regarding academic sources, Wikipedia was found to be highly selective in terms of what science was cited. Moreover, despite a surge in COVID-19 preprints, Wikipedia had a clear preference for open-access studies published in respected journals and made little use of preprints. Building a timeline of English-language COVID-19 articles from 2001-2020 revealed a nuanced trade-off between quality and timeliness. It further showed how pre-existing articles on key topics related to the virus created a framework for integrating new knowledge. Supported by a rigid sourcing policy, this \"scientific infrastructure\" facilitated contextualization and regulated the influx of new information. Last, we constructed a network of DOI-Wikipedia articles, which showed the landscape of pandemic-related knowledge on Wikipedia and how academic citations create a web of shared knowledge supporting topics like COVID-19 drug development. Conclusions: Understanding how scientific research interacts with the digital knowledge-sphere during the pandemic provides insight into how Wikipedia can facilitate access to science. It also reveals how, aided by what we term its \"citizen encyclopedists,\" it successfully fended off COVID-19 disinformation and how this unique model may be deployed in other contexts.",

Studies of readership and editorship of health-related articles reveal that medical professionals are active consumers of Wikipedia and make up roughly half of those involved in editing these articles in English [3, 4] . Research conducted into the qual-ity and scope of medical content deemed Wikipedia \"a key tool for global public health promotion\" [4, 5] . Others have found that in terms of content errors Wikipedia is on par with academic and professional sources even in fields like medicine [6] . Meanwhile, a metastudy of Wikipedia's medical content (specifically those articles overseen by the WikiProject Medicine, a volunteerrun group of editors that focuses on ensuring the quality of health-related articles) found it to be a prominent health information resource for experts and non-experts alike [7] . With the World Health Organization (WHO) labeling the COVID-19 pandemic an \"infodemic\" [8] , and disinformation posing a public health threat, a closer examination of Wikipedia and its references during the pandemic is merited.",

Researchers from different disciplines have looked into citations in Wikipedia and performed bibliometric analyses of it-e.g., asking whether open-access papers are more likely to be cited in Wikipedia [10] . While anecdotal research has shown that Wikipedia and its academic references can mirror the growth of a scientific field [11] , few have researched the coronavirus and Wikipedia. Research focused on Wikipedia and COVID-19 has shown both that traffic to Wikipedia's coronavirus articles reflected public interest in the pandemic [12] and that these articles cite a representative sample of COVID-19 research [13] . However, to our knowledge, no research has yet focused on the bibliometrics of COVID-19 references on Wikipedia-be they popular or academic. These sources serve as the bridge between science and trusted facts on the one hand and public interest on the other. Examining their dynamics on Wikipedia is key for understanding the online knowledge ecosystem during a crucial phase of the pandemic and infodemic.",

It also allowed us to ask what was the percentage of academic citations among any given article and what shifts they underwent during the period researched. This allowed us to gain a historical perspective on the scientific infrastructure supporting them, gauging the amount of time that passed between a scientific study's publication and its being referenced on Wikipedia. Moreover we explored Wikipedia articles' revisions (i.e., their edit history) and co-citations. This allowed us to gain insight into the representation of COVID-19 knowledge on Wikipedia and its growth since the creation of the digital encyclopedia in 2001 and up until 2020. Although predominantly qualitative, for some selected articles we also examined the different claims the citations were used to support at different stages, and reviewed some of the textual changes that articles underwent in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, to provide anecdotal context for our findings.",

DOIs were used to identify academic sources among the references found within any given Wikipedia article. To delimit the corpus of Wikipedia COVID-19 articles containing DOIs, 2 different strategies were applied (Supplementary Fig. S1A ). Every Wikipedia article affiliated with the official WikiProject COVID-19 (a volunteer-run task force overseeing >1,500 articles during the period analyzed) was scraped using an R package specifically developed for this study, WikiCita-tionHistoRy [14] . In combination with the WikipediR R package [15] , which was used to retrieve the list of actual articles covered by the COVID-19 project, our WikiCitationHistoRy R package was used to extract DOIs from their text and thereby identify Wikipedia pages containing academic citations. Simultaneously, we also searched the EuroPMC database, using \"COVID-19,\" \"SARS-CoV2,\" and \"SARS-nCoV19\" as keywords to detect scientific studies published about this topic. Thus, 30,000 peerreviewed papers, reviews, and preprints were retrieved. This set was compared to the DOI citations extracted from the entirety of the English Wikipedia dump of May 2020 (\u223c860,000 DOIs) using mwcite [16] . Thus, Wikipedia articles containing \u22651 DOI citation related to COVID-19 were identified-either from the EuroPMC search or through the specified Wikipedia project. The resulting \"COVID-19 corpus\" comprised a total of 231 Wikipedia articles, all related to COVID-19, which included \u22651 academic source. In this study, the term \"corpus\" describes this body of Wikipedia \"articles,\" and \"sets\" is used to describe a collection of \"papers\" (i.e., DOIs) and their related bibliographic information.",

Among the COVID-19 preprints cited on Wikipedia was an early study on remdesivir [23] , a study on the mortality rate of elderly individuals [24] , research on COVID-19 transmission in Spain [25] and New York [26] , and research into how Wuhan's health system attempted to contain the virus [27] . This shows how non-peer-reviewed studies touched on medical, health, and social aspects of the virus-with 2 of the preprints, for example, focusing on the benefits of contact tracing [28, 29] . The number of overall preprints was slightly lower than the general representation of preprints in Wikipedia (1.5%), but much lower than would be expected considering the fact that our aca- demic database of EuroPMC papers had almost 3,700 preprints-12.3% of the \u223c30,000 COVID-19-related papers in May 2020. Thus, in contrast to the high enrichment of preprints in COVID-19 research, Wikipedia's editors overwhelmingly preferred peerreviewed papers to preprints. In other words, Wikipedia generally cited preprints more often than it was found to do so on the topic of COVID-19, while COVID-19 articles cited openaccess papers by 10% more (from 29% to 39%). Taken together with the bias towards high-impact journals, our data suggest that open-access papers contributed significantly to Wikipedia's ability both to stay up to date and to maintain high academic standards, allowing editors to cite peer-reviewed research despite other alternatives being available.",

One possible explanation is that among the academic papers added to Wikipedia in 2020 were also papers published prior to this year if not a long time before. To investigate this hypothesis we used the latency metric (namely, the lag between a paper's publication and its integration into Wikipedia, see equation [2] ). We found the mean latency of Wikipedia's COVID-19 content to be 10.2 years (Fig. 3C) , slower than Wikipedia's overall mean of 8.7 (Fig. 3D) . In fact, in the coronavirus corpus we observed a peak in latency of \u223c17 years-with >500 citations being added to Wikipedia 17 years after their initial academic publicationalmost twice as slow as Wikipedia's average. Interestingly, this time frame corresponds to the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoV-1) in 2002-2004, which yielded a boost of scientific literature regarding coronaviruses. This suggests that while there was a surge in editing activity during this pandemic that saw papers published in 2020 added to the COVID-19 articles, a large and even prominent role was still permitted for older literature. Viewed in this light, older papers played a similar role to pre-pandemic ar- Supplementary Fig. S3 and in the GigaDB repository [54] . for an interactive version of the timeline. ticles, giving precedence to existing knowledge in ordering the integration of new knowledge on scientific topics.",

Of these 6 major nodes, 4 had a distinct and broad topic: \"Coronavirus,\" which focused on the virus writ large; \"Coronavirus disease 2019,\" which focused on the pandemic; and \"COVID-19 drug repurposing research\" and \"COVID-19 drug development.\" The first 2 articles were key players in how Wikipedia presented its coverage of the pandemic to readers: both were linked to from the main coronavirus article (\"Coronavirus disease 2019\"), which was placed on the English Wikipedia home page in a community-led process known as \"In the News,\" which showcases select articles on current events on the website's home page. Later on, alongside this process led by the volunteers of the WikiProject COVID-19 task force, the Wikimedia Foundation (the WMF is the non-profit that oversees the Wikipedia project) also issued a directive to place a special banner referring to the \"Coronavirus disease 2019\" article on the top of every single article in English, driving millions to the article and to subsequent articles linking out from it. As noted, these articles-\"Coronavirus disease 2019\" and the articles linking out from it-were part of our DOI network. The fact that this central article shared citations with other articles that linked out from it, as described in our network, highlights the interconnecting role that academic citations played in Wikipedia's COVID-19 coverage, allowing academic sources to support both popular and scientific articles and providing the public with access to highquality sources in different contexts. The 2 remaining nodes were similar and did not prove to be distinctly independent concepts but rather interrelated ones, with the articles for \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus\" and \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\" each appearing as their own node despite their thematic overlap. It is also interesting to note that 4 of the 6 Wikipedia articles that served as the respective centers of these groups were locked to public editing as part of the protected page status (see Supplementary Data S3).

Reliability in this context is defined on Wikipedia by the WPM as accordance with its MEDRS policy-shorthand for \"MEDical Reliable Sources.\" The sourcing policy, which is Wikipedia's most rigid, bans primary sources. Instead, MEDRS demands that medical and health claims cite meta-analysis or secondary sources that provide an overview of existing research or multiple-case-study clinical trials [31] . This policy is facilitated by the WPM's aforementioned partnership with the Cochrane Library. The fact that popular articles like \"Coronavirus disease 2019\" or \"COVID-19 drug development\" shared academic citations with other articles underscores the important role that academic publications play on Wikipedia, creating the web of knowledge that our network describes. Furthermore, it highlights how the editing community's centralized efforts (both articles were locked [Supplementary Dataset S3] and fell under the oversight of Wikipedia's volunteer-run COVID-19 task force) allowed certain academic studies to find a role both in popular articles and in scientific articles linking out from them.",

For example, the academic paper that was most cited in Wikipedia's COVID-19 articles was a paper published in Nature in 2020, titled \"A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin\" (Supplementary Table S3 ). This paper was referenced in 8 different Wikipedia articles, 2 among which dealt directly with scientific topics-\"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\" and \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\"-and 2 dealing with what can be termed parascientific terms linked to COVID-19-the \"Wuhan Institute of Virology\" and \"Shi Zhengli.\" This serves to highlight how contentious issues with a wide interest for the public-in this case, the origin of the virus-receive increased scientific support on Wikipedia, perhaps as a result of editors attempting to fend off misinformation supported by lesser, non-academic sources.

However, the mere existence of this policy does not necessarily mean that it is respected. Our findings indicate that this policy, aided by the infrastructure provided by the community to enforce it, likely played a key role in regulating the quality of coronavirus articles. One mechanism used generally by the WPM to enforce the MEDRS sourcing standards and specifically deployed by the COVID-19 task force during the pandemic was locking articles to public editing (protected pages, Supplementary Dataset S3). This is a technique that is used to prevent vandalism on Wikipedia [38] and is commonly used when news events drive large amounts of new readers to specific Wikipedia articles, increasing the risk of substandard sources and content being added into the article by editors unversed in Wikipedia's standards. This ad hoc measure of locking an article, deployed by a community vote on specific articles for specific amounts of time, prevents anonymous editors from being able to contribute directly to an article's text and forces them to work through an experienced editor, thus ensuring editorial scrutiny. This measure is in line with our findings that many of the COVID-19 network central nodes were locked articles.",

The WPM has formed institutional-level partnerships to provide editors with access to reputable secondary sources that are in line with the MEDRS policy on medical and health topics-namely, through its cooperation with the Cochrane Library. The Cochrane Reviews database is available to Wikipedia's medical editors, and it offers them access to systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses summarizing the results of multiple medical research studies [39] . As well as the existence of this database on medical content, the practice of providing access to high-quality sources was also deployed specifically in regards to coronavirus in the form a list of \"trusted\" sources provided to volunteers of the task force on the WikiProject COVID-19 project page. Alongside Cochrane studies, the WHO, for example, was given special status and preference [40] . This was evident in our results, with Cochrane sourcing being prominent, and the WHO being found to be among the most cited publishers on the COVID-19 articles. Also among the most cited scientific sources were others that were promoted by the task force as preferable sourcing for COVID-19 content: e.g., Science, Nature, and The Lancet. This indicates that the list of sources recommended by the task force were actually used by the volunteers and thus underscores the connection between our findings and the existence of a centralized community effort.",

Because each new edit to any locked COVID-19 article needed to be vetted by an experienced volunteer editor before it could go online within the body of an article's text, the influx of new information being added was slowed down and regulated. Together with the source list, this allowed an especially strict sourcing policy to be rigorously implemented across thousands of articles. This was true despite the fact that there is no academic verification for volunteers-in fact, research suggests that less than half of Wikipedia's editors focused on health and medical issues are medical professionals [3, 4] -meaning that the task forces and its list of sources allowed non-experts to enforce academic-level standards.",

Despite a deluge of preprints (both in general in recent years and specifically during the pandemic [41, 42] ), in our analysis, non-peer-reviewed academic sources did not play a key role in Wikipedia's coronavirus content, while open-access papers did. Therefore, one could speculate that our finding that open-access papers were disproportionately cited may provide an explanation-with academic quality trumping speed, and editors opting against preprints and preferring published studies instead. Previous research has found that openaccess papers are more likely to be cited on Wikipedia by 47% [10] and nearly one-third of the Wikipedia citations link to an open-access source [43] . Here we also saw that open access was prevalent in Wikipedia and even more so on COVID-19 articles. This, we suggest, allowed Wikipedia's editors (expert or otherwise) to keep articles up to date without reverting to non-peerreviewed academic content. This, one could suggest, was likely facilitated or at least aided by the decision by academic publications such as Nature and Science to lift their paywall and open public access to all of their COVID-19-related research papers, both past and present.",

With Facebook and other social media giants struggling to implement both technical and human-driven solutions against medical disinformation from the top down, it seems that Wikipedia's dual use of established science and an open community of volunteers provides a possible model for how this can be achieved-a valuable goal during an infodemic. Some have already suggested that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should adopt Wikipedia's model to help communicate medical knowledge [49] . In October 2020, the WHO and WMF announced that they would cooperate to make critical public health information available via an open licence. This means that in the near future, the quality of Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic will likely increase just as its role as central node in the network of knowledge transference to the general public becomes increasingly clear.",

This can lead to large discrepancies in article quality and inconsistencies in the way editors add references to articles' text [43] . We tried to address these limitations using technical solutions, such as regular expressions for extracting URLs, hyperlinks, DOIs, and PMIDs. In this study, which was limited to English, we retrieved most of our scientific literature metadata using Altmetrics [17, 50] , EuroPMC [19] , and CrossRef [18] R APIs. However the content of the underlying databases is not always accurate, and at a technical level, this method was not without limitations. For example, we could not retrieve all of the extracted DOIs' metadata. Moreover, information regarding open access (among oth-ers) varied with quality between the APIs [51] . In addition, our preprint analysis was mainly focused on MedRxiv and BioRxiv, which have the benefit of having a distinct DOI prefix. These collections make up the majority of preprints. However, others may also exist. Unfortunately, we found no better solution to annotate preprints from the extracted DOIs. Preprint servers do not necessarily use the DOI system [52] (i.e., ArXiv) and others share DOI prefixes with published papers (for instance the preprint server used by The Lancet). Moreover, we developed a parser for general citations on Wikipedia (categorized natively on the site as news outlets, websites, publishers), and we could not avoid redundant entries (i.e., \"WHO\", \"World Health Organisation\"). In addition, our method to delimit the COVID-19 corpus focused on medical content (EuroPMC search) and may explain why we found predominately biomedical and health studies. Using DOI filtering on Wikipedia's coronavirus articles should have equally led us to find papers from the social sciences-should those have been cited in this context. However, it seems that as these socially focused articles do not fall under the MEDRS sourcing policy, there was less if any use of academic studies, resulting in a low scientific score, thus further highlighting the importance of this policy in enforcing academic standards on the open encyclopedia's articles.",

Our study is limited to focus on the pandemic's first wave and its history on English Wikipedia alone, a crucial arena for examining the dynamics of knowledge online at a pivotal time frame. As these findings regarding the first wave were the result of a robust community effort that utilized English Wikipedia's policies and mechanisms to safeguard existing content and regulate the creation of new content, it may be specific to English Wikipedia and its community. Nonetheless, it seems safe to speculate that at least on English Wikipedia, similar processes will continue to take place in the future as new textual additions are made to the open encyclopedia. In fact, one could speculate that as more time passes from the first wave, the newer post-pandemic articles that had low scientific scores will undergo a form of review and have their sources improved as newer research becomes more readily available. Studying the second wave-e.g., shifts in the scientific score over time-and understanding how encyclopedic content written during the first wave changed over the next year could be very instructive. Analyses of coronavirus articles indicated that at least on science, medical, and health topics-especially those in the news and driving public interest-Wikipedia's methods for safeguarding its standards withstood the test. Perhaps as more academic research regarding the virus passes review and is published in 2021 and in the coming years, the ability of Wikipedia to reduce latency on this topic without having to compromise its scientific character will increase. Moreover, our findings hint that should journals open access to research in other fields, it may help Wikipedia cite even more peer-reviewed research instead of media sources or preprints. Thus, with the help of community enforcement, like that seen during the first wave of the pandemic, Wikipedia should be able to succeed in other fields as well.",

Most of Wikipedia's COVID-19 content was supported by references from highly trusted sources-but with the pandemic's breakout, these were more from the general media than from academic publications. That Wikipedia's COVID-19 articles were based on respected sources in both the academic and popular media was found to be true even as the pandemic and num-ber of articles about it grew. Our investigation further demonstrates that despite a surge in preprints about the virus and their promise of cutting-edge information, Wikipedia preferred published studies, giving a clear preference to open-access studies. A temporal and network analysis of COVID-19 articles indicated that remaining up to date did come at a cost in terms of quality. It also showed how pre-existing content-both in the form of pre-pandemic articles and papers-helped regulate the flow of new information into existing articles. In future work, we hope the tools and methods developed here will be used to examine how these same articles fared over the entire span of 2020, as well as helping others use them for research into other topics on Wikipedia. We observed how Wikipedia used volunteer-editors to enforce rigid sourcing standards-and future work may continue to provide insight into how this unique method can be used to fight disinformation and to characterize the knowledge infrastructure in other arenas.",

Supplementary information and datasets are available in the GigaScience GigaDB repository [54] . Figure S1 : Corpus identification and citation extraction pipeline. (A) Scheme of the corpus delimitation rationale and citation extraction. To delimit our corpus of Wikipedia articles containing DOI, we applied 2 different strategies. First we scraped every Wikipedia page from the COVID- 19 Wikipedia project (\u223c3k pages) and we filtered them to keep only articles containing DOI citations (149 Wikipedia articles). For our second strategy, we searched the EuroPMC database for COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, SARS-nCoV19-yielding 30,000 scientific papers, reviews, and preprints. These were then compared to the citations extracted from the English Wikipedia dump of May 2020 (860,000 DOIs). Searching Wikipedia with the resulting set led us to identify an additional 91 Wikipedia articles containing \u22651 citation from the EuroPMC set. Taken together, from the resulting corpus of 231 Wikipedia articles, we extracted DOIs, PMIDs, ISBNs, websites, and URLs using a set of regular expressions, as described in the Materials and Methods section. Subsequently, we computed several statistics for each Wikipedia article and we retrieved Altmetrics, CrossRef, and EuroPMC information for each of their cited papers' DOI. Finally, we produced tables of annotated citations and extracted information from each Wikipedia article such as books, websites, and newspapers. In addition, a timeline of Wikipedia articles and a network of Wikipedia articles linked by their shared scientific sources was produced.
