This study adds several loci to the ones linked to coagulation-all involved directly or indirectly in platelet or erythrocyte biology or inflammation. Most identified common genetic variants are weak risk factors, that is, those with relative risks between 1.0 and 1.5 in the general population. How this information can be used in the clinic remains to be better characterized. Beyond common variants and given the evolution of molecular technologies and the widespread use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) at low cost, it becomes possible to identify very rare disease mutations that could even lie outside the classical coagulation cascade. 9 Bleeding New technologies were continuously incorporated into European laboratories leading to the progressive reduction of unexplained hemophilia-A (HA). For example, whole F8 sequencing and RNA analysis are now implemented for genetic analysis in HA showing that deep intronic variations are a recurrent molecular mechanism causing hemophilia-A. [10] [11] [12] A GWAS on >46,000 normal individuals has found 11 susceptibility loci for plasma VWF levels. 13 The majority of VWF loci fall into 3 categories: genes that modify either VWF glycosylation, secretion, or clearance. Gene panels have been established by different consortia, which include the commonly affected genes. About 50% of patients with inherited thrombocytopenias and about 25% of patients with inherited platelet function defects can be diagnosed by NGS. Serious concerns have been raised regarding the genetic diagnosis of particular disorders which are rather mild in terms of bleeding manifestations. However, these are associated with an increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies. Careful and detailed discussions between the treating physician and the patient should precede testing.",

The identification of structural variants remained challenging and the development of single-molecule long-read sequencing technologies should improve the diagnosis rate. Moreover, it has been proposed recently that miRNA dysregulation is a likely cause of the disease in HA patients. It is, however, very likely, that in many patients, the reduced activity of coagulation factors are combinations of dysfunction of the protein and reduced expression of the gene. This hypothesis is bolstered by findings that different patients with the same missense F8 mutation may exhibit mild, moderate, and severe forms of the disease based on FVIII activity. MiRNAs, whose principal biological function is fine-tuning of gene expression, are likely candidates for maintaining the balance between preventing both, excessive bleeding and clots that could lead to thrombosis.

These abnormalities range from subtle activation of hemostasis that can only be detected by sensitive markers for coagulation activation to somewhat stronger. Here, hemostatic activation may be detectable by a small decrease in platelet count and subclinical prolongation of global clotting time, to fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This is also characterized by widespread simultaneous microvascular thrombosis and profuse bleeding. 28, 29 We also see ample evidence that activation of coagulation in concert with inflammatory activation can result in microvascular thrombosis thereby contributing to multiple organ failure in patients with severe infections. 30 Infection-associated coagulopathy has shown to be an independent predictor of organ failure and mortality in patients with sepsis. 31, 32 In a consecutive series of patients with severe infectious disease, the mortality of patients with DIC was 43%, as compared with 27% in those without DIC. 33 Infection-associated coagulopathy is most frequently associated with bacterial sepsis. Sepsis is a major health problem with an estimated 48.9 million incident cases worldwide and 11 million sepsis-related deaths in 2017, representing a fifth of all global deaths that year. 34 Total in-hospital mortality of sepsis is around 20%, whereas severe sepsis is associated with mortality rates of 40%-50%. 35 If sepsis is complicated by coagulopathy, mortality significantly increases. Activation of the coagulation system has also been documented for nonbacterial pathogens including viruses, protozoa (malaria), and fungi. Common viral infections such as influenza, varicella, rubella, and rubeola are rarely associated with DIC. 30 Other viral infections can cause \"hemorrhagic fever\" characterized by fever, hypotension, bleeding, and renal failure.

A more integrated view needs to be developed focusing on the interaction of various systems that are involved in the pathogenesis. This includes endothelial cells, platelets, plasma, complement factors, inflammatory cells, and mediators. For instance, it is likely that activation of coagulation in DIC occurs at the surface of the endothelium that interacts with inflammatory cells and mediators, and we must gain more knowledge on the exact interactions between these components at the surface in vivo. Since most of our current insights are based on in vitro observations (for example, by using cultured cells and isolated molecules), this might lead to spurious results. Studies in experimental animals and humans are mostly based on ex vivo observations, the real challenge maybe able to more directly and incisively analyze inflammatory-driven activation of coagulation at the vascular wall surface in vivo. This approach could potentially yield new targets for improved treatment strategies for infection-related coagulopathy. 45 Better treatment for coagulopathy Current therapeutic interventions are mostly supportive and only partly effective. Although these interventions can lead to improvement of the coagulopathy or more rapid resolution of coagulation derangements, they do not affect clinically relevant outcomes such as organ dysfunction or mortality. Further refinement of supportive treatment might come from the notion that the effect of the coagulopathy in infections might vary from organ to organ. 46 Hypothetically, it could be argued that therapy should be tailored to organs that are most affected. For example, if acute lung injury is the most prominent feature, therapy should be aimed at restoration of physiological anticoagulant pathways such as antithrombin or thrombomodulin. In severe sepsis presenting with purpura fulminans, there are ample indications that restoration of the activated protein C pathway might be most effective. By contrast, in acute renal failure, interventions aimed at the deranged platelet-vessel wall interaction (eg, restoring the levels of ADAMTS13) can be most helpful. 43 Another example is the COVID-19-related coagulopathy where a better understanding of the underlying pathogenesis is important to come to better preventive and treatment strategies to manage thromboembolic complications and to improve the outcome.",

The vector toxicity is linked to the ability to integrate into the host genome, but AAVs are not considered as integrating vectors existing mainly in the nucleus in episomal form, although random integration events occur but at very low frequency. A recent study in animal models has shown that fragments of the vector sequence were integrated into the genome of a dog model without any association with evidence of malignancy. Postmarketing surveillance in gene therapy, therefore, is a crucial issue that needs capturing unexpected or rare events that occur in patients receiving such therapy.",

These new drugs act by decreasing natural anticoagulants, determining an imbalance in the natural clotting process. The exact procoagulant activity and also the hemostatic potency of these drugs are not completely understood. Therefore, the management of patients in specific challenging situations such as surgery, the elderly, acute bleeding, and others should be carefully considered. 3. Data monitoring on novel therapies by specialized laboratories and qualified staff are required. Discrepancies between FVIII and FIX assays have been described for new extended half-life products including emicizumab and also other gene therapy trials. In view of the aforementioned, the specialized EHCCC laboratory should guarantee the application of the most appropriate tests for each clinical situation and a correct interpretation of the results to ensure an accurate diagnosis and optimal and safe therapeutic management of patients. 4. The future direction of hemophilia treatment is gene therapy, although there are still some critical points needing to be addressed when determining the cause of liver toxicity triggering the increase in liver enzymes, and overcoming liver transduction inhibition due to pre-existing anti-AAV antibodies against the capsid. To solve this problem, new viral vector manufacturing processes are emerging, as well as the selection of other AAV serotypes. However, more collaboration between academia and manufacturers is required to solve major unmet medical needs. 5. Neutralizing antibodies against FVIII administered at the early stage of life is still up to 30% of patients with severe hemophilia even with novel extended half-life products. 64 An answer has been given in understanding which type of product could most likely cause the inhibitor development. 65 However, the immunological mechanisms that trigger this immune response needs further investigation. 6. Long-term postmarketing monitoring of the efficacy and safety for all therapies using a patient registry for hemophilia and other bleeding disorders is required. Each European nation should have a register of patients with rare diseases and in particular with hemorrhagic disorders, to collect data on usage of products, their efficacy and side effects. 7. There is a need for legal provision with specific amendment to ensure that regulators accommodating new scientific developments allowing scientific collaboration between academic and pharmaceutical centers. 8. Unnecessary multiplication of procedures should be avoided to render drug registration at European level more efficient and less burdensome. 9. A revised system of incentives to boost the research and innovation in new therapeutic areas is required (very rare disorders, as FV, FII, and inhibitor development).",

It is important that patient management also occurs in collaboration with clinical researchers to better understand the new therapeutic strategies.
