Other app features discussed and ranked included appointment reminders, nutrition training and quizzes, shopping lists, clinic and store locators, recipe gallery, produce calculator, and dietary preferences/allergies. Conclusions: This study demonstrates how a user-centered design process can aid the development of an app for low-income families participating in WIC to inform the effective design of the app features and user interface.",

This study highlights many barriers to the successful usage of WIC in its current form and the opportunity to overcome many of these with the transition to an efficient and a useful digital program. However, as revealed by the participant who could not complete the task owing to literacy issues, there might be a risk that some program participants could be left behind owing to low information technology (IT) literacy or limited access to appropriate or suitable devices and the Internet. App developers must be mindful of these issues when designing tools meant to help low-income families.",
