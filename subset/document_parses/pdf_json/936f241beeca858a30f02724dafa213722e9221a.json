The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between pre-/post-treatment 3-month RDW levels and changes in RDW with 3-year prognosis of prostate cancer. Patients and Methods: A total of 348 patients with prostate cancer were recruited between June 1, 2012 and June 1, 2017 and were followed up for at least 3 years. RDW was measured with the Mindray BC-6800Plus automatic blood counting system at pre-and post-treatment 3-month. Demographic and clinical information of the participants were also collected. The overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression and competing risk regression analyses were performed. Results: During the follow-up period, 51 (14.66%) deaths occurred. The levels of pre-and post-treatment RDW levels were significantly higher in the death group than in the survival group (p<0.001). In the death group, the level of RDW continued to rise in most subjects, and the mean level of RDW was significantly higher at post-treatment than pre-treatment, contrary to the results observed in the survival group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that high pre-treatment RDW, high post-treatment RDW, and persistently higher RDW were independently associated with OS and CSS (p<0.001). Similar results were observed in the competing risk regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with higher pre-treatment RDW levels, higher post-treatment RDW levels, and persistently higher RDW levels had poorer 3-year OS and CSS rates (p<0.05).",

Tonelli et al 14 also reported that higher RDW levels were associated with an increased risk of coronary death/nonfatal myocardial infarction, new symptomatic heart failure, and stroke. Furthermore, a large-sample (n = 992) retrospective study by Ichinose et al 17 reported that a high RDW level was significantly associated with high morbidity and reduced survival in elderly patients who underwent resection for non-small cell lung cancer. However, patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and RDW > 14.5% have been found to have independent prognostic significance for overall survival (OS). 18 Only one small-sample case-control study reported that the mean pre-treatment RDW level of patients with prostate cancer was higher than that of the healthy control group (14.6% vs 13.7%, p = 0.001), and higher pretreatment RDW was associated with an increased risk of cancer progression. 19 However, the association between the changes in RDW levels and the clinical prognosis of prostate cancer has not been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of pre-and post-treatment RDW levels and changes in RDW on OS and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in a large cohort of patients with prostate cancer.",

Serum levels of the total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA) were measured using a Mindray CL-6000 automatic chemiluminescence analyzer (Shenzhen, China). Another 2 mL of blood was collected in an EDTA anticoagulant tube. RDW was measured with the Mindray BC-6800Plus automatic blood counting system (Shenzhen, China) within 0.5 h after blood collection. Persistently higher RDW levels mean post-treatment RDW minus pre-treatment RDW>0. Persistently lower RDW levels mean post-treatment RDW minus pre-treatment RDW<0.",

Considering RDW as a prognostic marker, comparable and stable values are vital. At the pre-treatment time point, the RDW levels were not affected by radiotherapy or androgen deprivation therapy. Three months after treatment, the inflammation subsided. The post-treatment 3-month was chosen to exclude the effect of radical prostatectomy, which led to systemic inflammation on RDW. We found that high pretreatment RDW, high post-treatment RDW, and persistently higher RDW were independently associated with OS and CSS (p < 0.001). Thus, the levels of and changes in RDW before and after treatment were associated with the 3-year prognosis of prostate cancer, suggesting that RDW might be an efficient prognostic predictor in patients with prostate cancer.",

In line with these findings, our study also found that a high pretreatment RDW level is a poor prognostic factor for OS and CSS in patients with prostate cancer. Interestingly, we further found that post-treatment RDW and changes in RDW (persistently higher RDW) were associated with the prognosis of prostate cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the relationship between changes in RDW before and after treatment and the prognosis of prostate cancer. Limited data are available in the literature regarding the association between RDW and prostate cancer prognosis. An early case-control study conducted by Sebahattin et al 19 found that patients with prostate cancer had higher pre-treatment RDW levels than normal control subjects. Based on our results, different factors might explain the prognostic value of RDW. Recent evidence indicates that the host inflammatory response plays an important role in tumor progression. 25 Meanwhile, the heterogeneity of red blood cell size (high RDW) correlates with inflammation and undernutrition status. 10,11 A higher tumor stage can lead to significant systemic inflammation through the secretion of cytokines and release of tumor-degradation products, which, in turn, increases RDW levels. 19 In our study, we also found an association between increased tumor size, advanced tumor stage, and high RDW levels.",

We also speculate that high RDW levels may represent a response secondary to tumor necrosis and local tissue damage, which is caused by the tumor -host cell interaction and reflects a high tumor burden. 30 The inflammatory response, which is indicated by a high RDW level, results in tumor microenvironment dysfunction that promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. 31 Higher post-treatment RDW levels and changes in RDW (persistently higher RDW) also represent patients with a high systemic inflammation status. In this study, posttreatment RDW levels and changes in RDW (persistently higher RDW) were associated with the prognosis of prostate cancer. Thus, high RDW levels can be considered a biomarker for poor tumor biology and adverse prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.",

Second, although patients with obvious infectious diseases were excluded, subclinical infection, which cannot be found by physical examination, could influence RDW levels. Third, this was a single-center retrospective study; future studies should consider conducting a controlled prospective clinical trial. Fourth, death was considered as the primary outcome.
