Healthcare professionals directly involved in diagnosing, treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objective: This study investigated the prevalence of PTSD among nurses working in a COVID hospital and evaluated associated factors. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Crema Hospital and the Impact of Event Scale -Revised (IES-R) was administered. Data collection took place from July to September 2020, during which 275 questionnaires were distributed. Results: Of the total sample, 39.88% received a provisional PTSD diagnosis deserving of further analysis. Nurses stated that they were predominantly overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts (M = 1.55). Working in the emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR=2.40; p=0.02), irregular work shifts (OR=5.41; p=0.01) and coming from a mental health ward (OR=3.80; p=0.02) increased the risk of receiving a provisional PTSD diagnosis. Our findings showed significantly higher IES-R scores among women than among men (p = 0.01). The activities that caused the most distress were related to technical skills required for managing ventilation and intubation devices. Conclusions: The results of the study highlighted the presence of considerable psychological distress in the sample. There is an urgent need to monitor the short-and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and implement early intervention measures.",

(6) examined the impacts of viral epidemic outbreaks on healthcare professionals, reporting a high prevalence of acute stress disorder (40%), anxiety (30%), burnout (28%), depression (24%), and PTSD (13%). A recent systematic review with meta-analysis established that the prevalence of PTSD among healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19 ranged from 2.9% to 49.5% (9) . However, PTSD prevalence should be interpreted with caution because the time of data collection can influence the results; data collected during and immediately after the pandemic will likely yield higher prevalence rates than data taken months or years after the psychological distress-causing event (4) . Various factors were been previously recognised as related to the worsening mental states of healthcare professionals during a viral epidemic; these include female gender, young age, social factors (e.g. lack of social support), the nursing profession and a lack of specialised knowledge and skills (6, 7, (10) (11) (12) . Working in a high-risk wards or in front-line settings was identified as a condition that further exposes healthcare workers to elevated risks of psychological distress (5, 10, 11) .",

The Italian version of the tool developed by Giannantonio (17) demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency in studies addressing different at-risk populations (18) (19) (20) . The tool consists of 22 items, to which respondents answer using a 5-point Likert scale (from 0 = Not at all to 5 = Extremely). A total score equal to or higher than 26 indicates the presence of PTSS, and a score of 33 or higher shows a probable PTSD diagnosis deserving of further analysis (17) . Notwithstanding the availability of several other valid and reliable instruments to evaluate PTSD, the IES-R was selected for the present study for its feasibility and in consideration of the tool's psychometric properties. Another advantage of IES-R is that it requires a short time to fill out. However, the IES-R also has several weaknesses: it is not a useful tool for formulating certain diagnosis of PTSD, and it is best used in relation to recent traumatic events (21) .",

The COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to re-evaluate the prevalence of PTSD among nurses-particularly those working in COVID hospitals. Indeed, frontline settings were identified as a major risk factor for developing PTSD (11) . Nurses have been required to endure stressful work shifts and considerable professional challenges, such as acquiring new technical skills in a short time. Shortages of personal protective equipment, the perception of not being sufficiently safe at work, isolation from family members to avoid contagion and fear of the unknown all have contributed negatively to nurses' mental states during the pandemic (6, 23, 24) .",

The participants described being overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts. They confirmed recalling unpleasant or traumatic events, acting and feeling like a traumatic event continues to happen and exhibiting strong psychological distress from exposure to triggers. The PTSD prevalence falls within the range recently estimated by Li et al. (9) among healthcare workers and, it is predictably higher than before the pandemic (22) . As expected, this prevalence rate is lower than that reported nationally after the first COVID-19 contagion peak in Italy (10, 14) . This is in line with recent findings and confirms that prevalence scores change during a viral epidemic, decreasing with time from the traumatic event (4). However, it is important to highlight that the PTSD prevalence reported in this study is not lower than that observed in the Lombardy region after the national lockdown (12) . Our findings stressed that nurses who worked in psychiatric units before the pandemic reported higher levels of psychological distress. These findings may be due to a lack of experience in infection management and in caring for patients who differ clinically from the those the nurses were accustomed to working with (7) . Further, the open question highlighted several gaps in the nurses' technical skills in terms of managing ventilators and in undertaking professional activities in which they were not confident. This suggests that a lack of specialised training is a risk factor for developing PTSD. This gap requires, together with the promotion of initiatives for psychological support, investment in training healthcare profes-sionals to prevent feelings of inadequacy and fear when faced with a pandemic (6, 25) .",

The effect of gender on PTSD manifestation among healthcare workers has been debated in the scientific literature. Several studies claimed that women are more susceptible to PTSD than men (5, 7, 10, 12) . Gonzalez-Sanguino et al. (26) hypothesized that during situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, female healthcare workers are more vulnerable to psychological distress because of their additional role of home caregiver. Other studies reported no gender differences or even higher PTSS occurrence among male medical staff due to women being more likely to express their emotions, thereby defusing the impact of stressors (27, 28) . Another variable found to be connected to psychological distress was that of changes in work shifts. Thus, the results confirm that the COVID-19 pandemic and other coronavirus outbreaks adversely affect the daily lives of healthcare workers and increase their likelihood of developing depression, stress, anxiety and PTSD (6) .",

The conducted analysis of factors associated with PTSD and the activities that lead to higher levels of psychological distress may be useful if offered to healthcare organisations as tools to protect the mental health of their workers. As for limitations, any generalisation of the present findings should be conducted with caution due to the monocentric nature of the study and the reduced extent of the sample. Moreover, the cross-sectional nature of our data did not allowed to establish the direction of causality and longitudinal studies are necessary to assess whether the psychological distress incurred from the COVID-19 pandemic will be persistent.",

Finally, any previous psychiatric disorders or perceived stress level before pandemic, as well as the nurses' coping strategies, were not investigated; this prevented the authors from examining whether these factors influenced the observed IES-R scores.

Protecting healthcare professionals against symptoms of distress should be an important requirement in any healthcare organisation. It is recommended that healthcare organisations offer more specialised training for healthcare professionals, as well as introduce measures to identify the onset of mental disorders, implement early interventions and monitor both short-and long-term consequences. The Unit of Clinical Psychology at Crema Hospital created a COVID-19 Emergency Team to pursue such objectives. The team consists of a group of psychologists who provide psychological support to healthcare professionals. The COVID-19 Emergency Team also conducts defusing and debriefing meetings, in which many healthcare professionals have taken part since May 2020. The healthcare workers who participated in this study have since been offered individual psychological interviews for restitution. Those for whom a mental disorder was observed have been started on psychotherapeutic treatment. In the future, it would be useful for related studies to evaluate the impact of these interventions on the mental health of healthcare workers. ",
