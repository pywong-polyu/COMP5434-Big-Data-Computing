Mental illness is estimated to cost the world economy US$2.5 trillion each year (2) , the leading cause of mortality in 14-45 year olds (3, 4) and, in Australia, 15% of 15-24 experience high or very high levels of psychological distress (5) . The associated health care costs and productivity losses amount to $40-70 bn in Australia (6) . Modifiable drivers of mental health include interdependent structural and individual factors, such as environment, education, employment, health and social services, and individual behaviours (7) . Overall, mental health is a systemic challenge that extends beyond the health sector. This requires a systematic policy response with a focus on prevention, reconceptualising mental health as an asset and where improvements in mental capital (cognitive, emotional, and wellbeing) can lead to improved population health, and social and economic prosperity (8) .",

Further, there is a policy direction towards place-based and outcome-based budgeting to overcome siloed approaches, incentivise multisector coordination and encourage joined-up and comprehensive person-centred care (5, 9) . Such aspirations meet with significant operational challenges when mental health has traditionally been the domain of health sector and may be significantly underfunded (10) . From a systems perspective, the flow-on impacts from investing in mental health to wider intersectoral benefits should be considered in funding and implementation decisions. However, while there is a need for a systems approach to investment there are significant gaps in evidence regarding whether services are efficiently delivered, effective or cost effective (11) .",

From an economics lens, given scarce or finite resources (e.g., skilled people, time, and physical locations) there is a need to prioritise and allocate funding between different spending areas (health and non-health) and particular interventions (policies, programs, technologies). To improve population mental health outcomes overall, it is important to understand both the investment required, cost and benefits from implementation, the budget available, and to undertake an explicit option appraisal process to identify best buys.",

Disease transmission models (e.g., Decision trees and Markov models) generate risk-to-event equations, observed trial effect sizes adjust transmission rates, and the focus is on \"final\" or cumulative outcomes and costs over the lifetime of a patient cohort, such as Quality-Adjusted Life years (QALYs). Notably, the implementation context is rarely explicitly modelled, but rather embedded within risk-to-event equations. The potential limitation is that evaluation results are implicitly assumed to hold across time and between contexts. Further, results are then scaled to the population eligible for a particular intervention rather than modelling the population demand explicitly, which can vary over time and with implications for service capacities to meet needs. To identify best-buys, it is common for league tables' to be generated that ordinally rank individual interventions in order of cost effectiveness. For combinations of interventions, there is a need to impose exogenous assumptions regarding potential additive or multiplicative effects. Overall, these methods have been influential in HTA where implementation context can be relatively simple and static, where one product can be swapped for another in a well-resourced supply chain. However, such approaches may not be ideally purposed for the challenge of priority setting and managing dynamic service systems and where local implementation context is vitally important.",

Such models have provided key insights regarding the potential impacts of an array of social and service level interventions, including the synergetic or antagonist effects of interventions to better generate positive population outcomes. DSM has also been important to demonstrate potentially counterintuitive and unintended harms from introducing interventions without considering implementation context. For example, public awareness campaigns for mental health and screening for psychological distress may lead to increased self-harm and suicides unless there are also sufficient downstream service capacities (20) . A key value of simulation modelling is to learn from the model itself and not only as a tool to project evaluation evidence. DSM have the capability to test out in a simulated environment whether changing the mix, scale and timing of intervention combinations can significantly impact population outcomes over time, before real world implementation (19) (20) (21) (22) . That is, even if evaluation studies demonstrate cost effectiveness, the impacts may be improved by adjusting complementary services that cumulative impacts depend upon (e.g., better balance of service demand and supply conditions).

For priority setting, there is an opportunity to develop dynamic portfolio approaches to identify the best-value mix of interventions to balance the demand and supply of services (35, 37) . Further, there is a need for adaptive decision analysis, where decision-makers and researchers can use the models to manage the system prospectively. It is also important to enable models to take either a societal and multi-sector perspective (including, but beyond QALYs) to support the operationalising of whole-of-government approaches. This also enables a fuller assessment of the societal value of investments to inform allocation of funding to particular sectors. It is also important to understand, where possible, the distribution of costs and benefits across sectors and households to inform a change management process if reallocation of resources between and within sectors is required (38) .",

While transfer payments are not normally included in economic analysis the SD models will have this ability to highlight both the financial cost and proportion of carers unpaid incurring opportunity costs.

For example, the studies used different time horizons, there was no implementation context reported, and valuation was restricted to return on investment. Decisionmakers who are tasked with managing budgets over time are left to second guess key operational considerations, such as whether cohort study evidence directly translates into population level impact given local implementation context, what the impacts of investing in combinations of interventions are likely to be, and how costs and outcomes are expected to be distributed over time, and wider metrics beyond cost savings.",

Overall, this is appropriate for the selection of an SD model where the primary purpose is strategic policy making across a system (25) .

This is a purposeful decision and considered appropriate for the broad model scope and current computational power available. For context, there are multiple examples where SD models have undertaken in-depth uncertainty analysis where the scope of the model permits (61) (62) (63) . While HTA models normally have uncertainty throughout all aspects of the model (although rarely structural uncertainty or model updating) a key driver of that uncertainty is the implementation context which is embedded in risk-to-event equations and calibration given the relatively simple model structures. The SD model will explicitly capture such implementation and contextual factors. This is intended to be a more practical approach when the decision challenge is strategic priority setting to manage a system as a whole. Further, results from economic evaluation studies that have conducted in-depth uncertainty analysis to identify cost effective interventions can be read into the SD models to project local impacts. Formal assessment of structural uncertainty is rarely undertaken in health economic models (64) or more complex system dynamics models (the latter due to computational and practical constraints). This is an important area for future development outside of the scope of the current project, however, ongoing efforts will be made to minimise structural uncertainty over time in the models developed.",

To reiterate, in this study a pragmatic approach will be taken where the SD model will focus on the dynamics of psychological distress in the general population estimated using K10 scores. Consequently, the economic approach maps K10 scores to utilities which will be undertaken using a validated algorithm calibrated to the routinely used EQ5D5L (49) . However, there are novel health economic tools emerging in the United Kingdom for mental health that are likely to be more sensitive to change (65, 66) . These may be considered in the future should further testing be undertaken to understand the relative improvements over the EQ5D5L (66) . To use these tools in this modelling study there is a need for a mapping algorithm to be developed to convert K10 scores to utilities and using Australian preference weights to ensure validity for the local population. Fourth, the range of data sources will be locally sourced congruent with the eight model locations. However, it is expected that where local data is missing then a higher level of aggregation may be needed and/or calibration required.
