According to the common factors view, some 30% of counseling outcomes are accounted for by the therapeutic relationship between the client and the counselor (Hubble et al. 1999 ). More recently, though, the concept of face-to-face practice has been challenged by those who have advocated for the use of diverse forms of technology in practice (Fenichel et al. 2002; National Board for Certified Counselors [NBCC] , 2016). Their views have reflected a new model that includes the incorporation of technology into counselor training and practice, because of its availability, benefits and varied applications (Fenichel et al. 2002; Glasheen and Campbell 2009; Watts, 2002; Venne & Doerr, 2018) . Thus, there is now a growing consensus that counselor training and practice should be aligned with the utilization of technology (de la Varre et al. 2011; Dincyurek and Uygarer 2012; Glasheen et al. 2016; King et al. 2006; Menon and Rubin 2011) .",

For example, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, conducting counseling sessions on-line (e.g., videoconferencing or web-based messaging) has become much closer to being standard practice, given the circumstances and the need to avoid risks of infection in the counseling office (Reidbord 2020) . Technological advances being utilized by counselors relate directly to the various regular elements of counseling (National Board for Certified Counselors [NBCC], 2016). For example, technologies offer counselors several opportunities, including taking digitally-stored case notes, advertising counseling services to broader client populations, consulting with professional colleagues, even internationally, and receiving and sharing information via professional listservs (McFadden and Jencius 2000) . Technologies also make it possible for counselors to provide and/or participate in distance education, on-line courses and presentations, web-based messaging, and videoconferencing (Shallcross 2011) . As Baltimore (2001) asserted, it is indeed difficult to think of counselors without them using technology in some form in their practice.",

Cyber-supervision, which utilizes Internet video conferencing to supervise counselors-in-training, allows students and their supervisors to communicate in real time whenever it is convenient and/or advantageous (Conn et al. 2009 ). Similarly, webbased training of counseling supervisors on practicum and internship sites is another example. These involvements are cost effective and time saving and can be particularly useful to students and site supervisors who experience logistical difficulties, geographical limitations, and/or disabilities that interfere with traditional face-to-face supervision (Bacigalupe 2010; McAdams and Wyatt 2010; Perry, 2012; Rousmaniere and Frederickson 2013) . In addition, advances in information and communication technology, in particular, have increased avenues for counseling programs to internationalize students' educational experiences through such initiatives as online exchange programs (Bhat and McMahon 2016) .",

We found a number of content areas with interesting findings. First of all, although more and more scholars (e.g., Brandt and Henning 2002; Sabella 2010; Tang 2003) emphasize the importance of integrating technologies into counselor training and practice, articles discussing technology integration in the field of counseling comprised only 0.9% of the articles published in ACA journals within the 19-year span. This finding clearly demonstrates the gap between the increasing interests and use of technology in counselor training and practice (e.g., Brandt and Henning 2002; Sabella 2010; Tang 2003) and the scarcity of technology-specific discussion published in counseling journals. It is possible that the lack of proactive measures on technology-integration (West 2012) and/or the difficulty faced when trying keep up with advances in technology present a challenge for generating technology-specific research. The limited number of publications on technology-integration, particularly the lack of empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of technology use in counselor training and practice, might present a concern for counseling professionals who consider using or who have been active users of technology in counselor education and/or practice.",

This may be because surveys are much easier than other quantitative methods in gathering data from large samples in a short period of time (Hew et al. 2007) . As the role of evidence-based practice (EBP) has continuously gained emphasis in the counseling field (Heppner et al. 2008) , it is our hope that more empirical studies would examine counseling interventions integrating technologies and their effectiveness. In regard to the study locations in which research was conducted, findings showed that university settings outnumbered any other settings such as K-12 schools. This finding is consistent with that of previous technology-focused content analysis in other fields (e.g., Hew et al. 2007) . It is possible that the majority of the authors were affiliated with universities as faculty members or graduate students; thus, it might have been easier for them to utilize preestablished relationships and connections to universities in conducting research and collecting data. Difficulties in getting parental consents and/or getting school administrators on board, frequently mentioned as a challenge when conducting research in K-12 school settings, might be another possible reason.",

Using technologies as resources in mental health counseling was the most prominent theme within the first main topic of interest, which possibly reflects the call for increased consideration for technology as a useful communication tool and resource when counseling clients (e.g., Paisley and McMahon 2001; Van Horn and Myrick 2001) . In addition, a wide variety of technologies were used in various areas, such as counseling practice, counselor training and supervision, support/discussion groups, assessment, and psychoeducation. It is encouraging that various forms of technologies have been examined even with a relatively small number of articles published. It is our hope that more research studies will be conducted on the various settings and areas within which technologies can be utilized (e.g., counseling clients with disabilities; multidisciplinary settings) and on the newest forms of technologies used in counseling that can inform the latest clinical perspectives.",

            "text": "The current investigation aimed to provide counseling researchers, practitioners, and educators with an accurate representation of the status of technology-integrated literature in the field of counseling over recent years. From our content analysis, several important implications were drawn. First, despite the skyrocketing rate of technology use in our daily lives, and in virtual mental health services in particular, the frequency of publications on technology use in counseling journals is disproportionately limited. According to the Pew Research Center (2018), 95% of Americans now own a cellphone and 73% own a laptop or computer. In other words, the majority of Americans and many others around the world have access to technological mediums through which they could receive counseling services. However, of all the articles published in the 21 counseling journals we examined, less than 3% included a discussion of technology-integrated practices.",

For example, a global pandemic, as is the case with COVID-19, presents counseling practitioners with extra challenges. They need not only offer counseling remotely, but also do so taking into consideration constantly changing contexts and consequences of the ongoing crisis. Keeping confidentiality in distance counseling during such circumstances can be extra challenging as physical separation from family members at home may be difficult to manage and to apply safeguarding policies (Tip 2020) . Under these circumstances, information on how to conduct or improve distance counseling and what methods to use to best deliver it to diverse clients in urgent need is extremely important. With more attention given to and research undertaken on such practice guidelines and methods, the use of them can become more refined, effective and helpful to clients, counseling students, and practitioners. Thus, the current analysis highlights the importance of future studies for examining technologyintegrated elements so as to keep the field of counseling on par with the increasingly pervasive nature of technology in the world today.",

While there were a few articles that focused on Asian American and Asian international college students, the majority of participants in the other studies were White/European Americans. However, other racial/ethnic groups could greatly benefit from inclusion in this research. Studies indicate that non-English speaking Asians and Latinos (Sentell et al., 2007) and Blacks/African Americans living in high poverty neighborhoods (Denton and Anderson 2005) have limited access to mental health care. Given that technology serves as a potential mechanism for providing services to those with limited access to traditional mental health services and the poor access that has been reported among certain racial/ethnic groups, more inclusive research is needed.",

Therefore, fewer articles were published by non-academics, such as counselors or staff in counseling centers or K-12 educational settings. Even though the majority of authors were associated with universities, most of the articles were focused on the use of technology-integrated methods in mental health counseling. Thus, the current literature on technology-integration may be less representative of counseling professionals' field experiences. Accounting for this possibility, we suggest that non-academics become more involved in technology-integrated research to ensure that their unique perspectives are represented.",

            "text": "Lastly, the ethics of technology-integration in the field of counseling was mentioned as a key topic of interest in a quarter of the articles included in our analysis. The frequency of the discussion of the ethical use of technology in these articles highlights a potential concern for how technology can best be used in accordance with the ACA Code of Ethics (ACA, 2015). Specifically, these articles considered ethical issues such as access, assessment, confidentiality, data storage, informed consent, multiple relationships, professional competence, records and security. Many of the articles that expressed ethical concerns were literature reviews and conceptual pieces, rather than empirical research articles. Thus, we assert that more empirical research is needed on the ethical implications and guidelines of using technology to deliver counseling services and to educate and/or supervise counselors and counseling students. Furthermore, more empirical research is needed because the variety of technological mediums that can be used in counseling (i.e., text messaging, emails, Skype) each present unique ethical considerations and potential pitfalls. For example, the use of email presents different ethical concerns than videoconferencing methods such as Skype, especially regarding security and data storage.",

With our recommendations for future empirical research on the ethical use of technology-integration with various technological mediums and the development of an instrument to assess the ethical competence to use technology-integrated methods, we hope that more clear expectations for the ethical use of technology will be created in the field of counseling.",
