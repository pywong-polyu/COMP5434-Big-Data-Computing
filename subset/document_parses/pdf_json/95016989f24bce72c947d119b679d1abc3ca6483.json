As the impacts of the interventions cover a broad spectrum of conditions (suicide, overdoses, delayed diagnoses, socioeconomic damage, etc.) over individual life spans, a measure of life years lost versus those lost to the pandemic would afford a comparable measure. The overall life years lost from the pandemic can, in most cases, be readily calculated from available epidemiological data. Calculating the effect of individual interventions is much more complex because of inconsistencies in definitions and data collection as well as the extreme variation in their application and enforcement. The result is a mass of data that can be used to support conflicting positions and policies that are more reflective of individual bias than science.",

All of these negative health outcomes will have some impact on overall mortality, some immediately measurable, but most in terms of future life years lost leading to decreased individual life expectancy for a significant component of the population. If such interventions are to be used to control and mitigate future pandemics, we must be able to make a reasonable assessment that the overall benefits achieved outweigh the cumulative harm done and that we are protecting individual lives without undue injury to the public health.",

One such study recently published measured the increase in opioid-involved deaths in Cook County during the pandemic lockdown period and reported that they increased to a mean of 44 deaths from 23 for the pre-lockdown period and declined sharply in the weeks following. 7 Age data were not reported but can be extrapolated from national estimates provided by the CDC. 8 Another recently published paper estimated excess mortality from drug overdoses, homicides, unintentional injuries, motor vehicle crashes, and suicide for the first 6 months of the pandemic. 9 Following the first publication of this paper an additional study addressing the overall morbidity and mortality impacts of our interventions from a global perspective has been published and should be of interest to the reader. 10 Going forward, a compendium of such studies would be an extremely useful decision-support tool to inform policy development and implementation in future events.",

This is certainly a welcome relief from the anxieties and stresses of the past year, but we must not become too complacent regarding either the current pandemic or the next one. From a global perspective, with vaccine supplies in short supply, COVID-19 continues to be a major killer and the only available defense for many continue to be the non-pharmaceutical, social-distancing interventions. In addition, the virus continues to produce new variants, 1 or more of which might become vaccine-resistant and result in yet another wave.",

Even if we could accomplish that same feat, other interventions would be required to control and mitigate well before the availability of a vaccine. As a case in point, we can juxtapose the COVID-19 vaccine timeline on the epidemiological mortality curve for the 1918 influenza pandemic. As noted, it took just under a year to have an approved vaccine, but it took an additional 4 months (mid-Dec 20 to mid-April 21) to even partially vaccinate 50% of the US population. 11 As seen from the graph in Figure 1 , 12 this timeline, as rapid as it was, would have had essentially no effect on the 1918 pandemic mortality. If we are again faced with a major event, such as COVID-19, and we must depend again on non-pharmaceutical interventions awaiting vaccine fielding, hopefully, we will be better prepared to optimize saving lives and protecting public health while mitigating self-imposed, debilitating, socioeconomic impacts.",
