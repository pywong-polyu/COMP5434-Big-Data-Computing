There are currently no vaccines or medicines to prevent or treat EV-D68 infections. Herein, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of EV-D68-infected human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells to investigate host-pathogen interplay. RNA sequencing and subsequent experiments revealed that EV-D68 infection induced a profound transcriptional dysregulation of host genes, causing significantly elevated inflammatory responses and altered antiviral immune responses. In particular, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is involved in highly activated TREM-1 signaling processes, acting as an important mediator in EV-D68 infection, and it is related to upregulation of interleukin 8 (IL-8), IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-1b, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a). Further results demonstrated that NF-kB p65 was essential for EV-D68-induced TREM-1 upregulation. Moreover, inhibition of the TREM1 signaling pathway by the specific inhibitor LP17 dampened activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, suggesting that TREM-1 mainly transmits activation signals to phosphorylate p38 MAPK. Interestingly, treatment with LP17 to inhibit TREM-1 inhibited viral replication and infection. These findings imply the pathogenic mechanisms of EV-D68 and provide critical insight into therapeutic intervention in enterovirus diseases.",

            "text": "Multiple EV-D68 outbreak and pathogenicity reports highlight the need to understand the molecular mechanisms to develop countermeasures against virus infection. The innate immune system is critical to the host's resistance to viral infection. When challenged by pathogens, host cell pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can recognize viral components through the pathogen-associated molecular patterns of viruses or other pathogens, and subsequently trigger intracellular signaling cascades to activate proinflammatory responses, which can induce an antiviral state in infected host cells (7, 8) . For evading and antagonizing the host innate immune response, viruses have evolved complex mechanisms (6) . Previous studies have reported that enterovirus has several inhibition mechanisms to diminish production of type I interferon, resulting in reduced host antiviral responses (9) (10) (11) . As a feature of their pathogenic mechanism, many viruses facilitate their replication by interacting with host factors. Our recent studies found that stress granule proteins interact with the 3'untranslated region of EV-D68 to block viral replication (12) . Furthermore, our results indicated that EV-D68 2A pro cleaves TRAF3, inhibits type I interferon responses, and subverts the innate immune responses (13) .",

In this study, we applied RNA-seq to human muscle rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells infected with EV-D68 over multiple timepoints. The results showed that the highly activated TREM-1 was involved in inflammatory cytokines production during EV-D68 infection. And the activation of TREM-1 associated with NF-kB p65 was identified by siRNA treatments and a dual-luciferase assay. Finally, based on largescale proteomic screen arrays, we demonstrated that TREM-1 mainly transmitted activation signals to phosphorylate p38 MAPK to influence inflammatory responses. These findings contribute to the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms of EV-D68, and help to develop novel therapeutic strategies in enterovirus diseases.",

We collected infected cells at different time points (6 h, 12 h, and 24 h), hoping to observe the dynamic mutual regulation between EV-D68 and infected cells (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 0.1). In the early stages of virus infection, the cytopathic effect (CPE) was relatively insignificant. At 12 h post-infection (hpi), RD cells began to shrink, and some were shed ( Figure 1A ). At 24 hpi, EV-D68 infection promoted extensive cell rounding and detachment of RD cells, consistent with the CPE caused by enterovirus infection (1, 19) . Figure 1B RT-PCR result showed the replication of EV-D68 in RD cells. Next, total RNA from noninfected and EV-D68-infected RD cells (6, 12, and 24 hpi) was collected and analyzed using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to quantitate host gene expression. From an overall perspective, a clustering heatmap was drawn to show gene expression levels at the indicated timepoints upon EV-D68 infection ( Figure 1C Figure 1D ).

First, three comparisons were made at indicated timepoints of EV-D68 infection, including transmembrane receptors, transcription factors, and cytokines ( Figure 2A) . We found that several immune-related genes, including TLR family members (TLR7, TLR4, TLR3), TNF family members, IL-1 family members, and IFN and some transcription factors (NF-kB, STAT3, JUNB) were significantly differentially regulated. Among these, transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), the transmembrane receptor TREM-1, and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) showed increased activation from 6 to 24 hpi. Next, the three regulators and their target genes were used to reconstruct a gene regulatory network (GRN) in Figure 2B . The GRN results confirmed a positive feedback loop among the three genes, which is likely to cause significant activation of TREM-1 at 24 hpi. Furthermore, the dynamic GRN for the 24 hpi also demonstrated that activated TREM-1 promotes a severe inflammatory response in which highly activated upstream and downstream regulators are related to inflammation. Thus, the upstream regulators involved in viral infection are likely to utilize the TREM-1 signaling pathway to mediate inflammatory responses in EV-D68 infection.",

The top 30 enriched pathways are listed according to activation z-score values in Figure 2C . Additionally, we found that diverse antiviral immune responses were activated, including PRRs that recognize viruses, HMGB1 signaling pathway, IL-8 signaling pathway, IL-6 signaling pathway, TNFR signaling, acute phase response signaling, and others ( Figure 2C) . Consistent with the results of upstream regulator analysis, NF-kB signaling, and TNFR signal pathway were activated at 6 hpi, and persisted until 24 hpi. Remarkably, TREM-1 signaling was most strongly activated at 24 hpi. Therefore, dynamic TREM-1 signaling was observed at 24 hpi ( Figure 2D ). TREM-1 directly interacts with DAP12 to trigger distinct downstream signal transduction pathways for proinflammatory responses (21) . The expression of genes related to these pathways, such as TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8, was altered during viral infection. This implies that the TREM-1 pathway may be involved in the inflammatory cytokine response at 24 hpi during EV-D68 infection. Of note, the molecular mechanisms related to the TREM-1 pathway have not been investigated previously in the context of proinflammatory responses during EV-D68 infection.",

Consistently, western blotting (WB) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that TREM-1 protein levels were elevated by EV-D68 ( Figures 3B, C) . Considering enterovirus caused human respiratory illness, we also evaluated TREM-1 upregulation induced by EV-D68 in human fetal lung diploid fibroblasts (2BS) and human lung carcinoma (A549) cells. RT-PCR results showed EV-D68 infection upregulated TREM-1 mRNA level in 2BS and A549 cells, which proved that is a common phenomenon (Supplementary Figure 2) . These results suggest that EV-D68 infection upregulated TREM-1 production. Also, we performed ELISA experiments to characterize the change in levels of TREM-1 downstream cytokines, and the results proved that IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, and others were indeed upregulated in response to viral infection ( Figures 3D-H) .",

Furthermore, activation of TREM-1 signaling amplifies proinflammatory responses induced by Toll-like receptors or NOD-like receptor ligands (21, 24) . To investigate the molecular basis of TREM-1 regulation of downstream cytokines, we down-regulated endogenous TREM-1 activity using LP17 (25, 26) , a molecule targeting TREM-1. We confirmed downregulation of TREM-1 by RT-PCR, WB and ELISA (Figures 4A-C) . When investigating whether TREM-1 signaling modulates EV-D68induced inflammatory responses, we found that EV-D68 stimulation of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-12 p70 was abrogated following down-regulation of TREM-1 (Figures 4D-G) . Additionally, we overexpressed TREM-1 in HEK293T cells, and verified changes in protein abundance by WB ( Figure 4H) . Similarly, we observed that EV-D68 infection led to the upregulation of TREM-1 in HEK293T cells ( Figure 4I, lane2) . Notably, our RT-PCR results demonstrated that overexpression of TREM-1 increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a at the mRNA level ( Figures 4J-L, lane5) , while this amplification effect could be eliminated by LP17 ( Figures 4J-L, lane4) . Collectively, our results suggest that TREM-1 is involved in regulating EV-D68induced inflammatory responses.",

Herein, we investigated whether the LP17-mediated downregulation of the TREM-1 signal pathway affects the replication of EV-D68. First, RD cells were infected with EV-D68 at an MOI of 0.1 after LP17 pretreatment for 2 h. Next, the abundance of viral RNA, the induction of viral protein, and the viral titer of EV-D68 in uninfected control, EV-D68-infected, and LP17 treatment groups were compared. Our RT-PCR results showed that the abundance of EV-D68 RNA in the LP17 treatment group was significantly lower than in the EV-D68-infected group ( Figure 5A ) in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, WB analysis showed that LP17 significantly inhibited the production of the viral structural protein VP1 ( Figure 5B,  lanes 2 and 3) . Furthermore, WB analysis showed that LP17 significantly inhibited the expression of VP1 at 12 hpi and 24 hpi, and the inhibition rate at 24 hpi was~50%, consistent with the results in Figure 5B ( Figure 5C ). Furthermore, as expected, the LP17 treatment group had a markedly lower viral titer than the EV-D68 infected group, and the inhibitory effect was~90% ( Figure 5D ). To further confirm the correlation between TREM-1 and EV-D68 replication, TREM-1 was overexpressed in HEK293T cells, which were then infected with EV-D68, and the abundance of EV-D68 viral RNA was measured. The results showed that the abundance of EV-D68 RNA was increased significantly following TREM-1 over-expression, and could be inhibited by LP17 ( Figure 5E) . Additionally, the results of Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) and transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) experiments showed that the LP17 treatment group displayed a lower rate of apoptosis and higher cell viability, compared with the EV-D68-infected group (Figures 5F, G) . Taken together, these results suggested that TREM-1 potentially participates in and affects the replication of EV-D68 in host cells.",

Zeng et al. reported that NF-kB p65 regulates the expression of TREM-1 in mouse-derived cells (28) , but the promoter sequence similarity among different species is low based on Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches. Therefore, we explored whether NF-kB p65 is involved in regulating the expression of TREM-1. We first confirmed that nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 was induced by EV-D68 ( Figure 6B, row 2) . Activation of NF-kB was alleviated by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a selective NF-kB p65 inhibitor, resulting in a decrease in TREM-1 mRNA level ( Figure 6C, lanes 3\u22124) . To further define the regulation between TREM-1 and NF-kB p65, we silenced the p65 gene using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach ( Figure 6D) . NF-kB p65 knockdown cells were infected with EV-D68, and expression of the TREM-1 gene was measured. We observed that p65 silencing resulted in an approximately 50% decrease in TREM-1 mRNA levels ( Figure 6E, lane 4) . Next, we performed a dual-luciferase assay to determine whether NF-kB p65 could bind to the promoter region of the endogenous TREM-1 gene. Figure 6F shows that TREM-1 expression was regulated at a transcriptional level by NF-kB p65. Together, these results indicate that activation of NF-kB p65 is essential for expressing the TREM-1 gene in response to EV-D 68 infection.",

            "text": "After ligand binding, activation of TREM1 signaling is mediated by homotypic interactions between the immunoreceptor tyrosinebased activation motifs (ITAM) between TREM1 and the adaptor DNAX-Activation Protein 12 (DAP12) (29) . This interaction results in phosphorylation of DAP12, which facilitates the recruitment of Src family kinases to activate downstream signaling involving Janus kinase (JAK), signal transducers and activators of transcription 3/5 (STAT3/5), MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) (29-32). Next, we identified TREM-1 downstream targets by directly comparing the phosphorylation levels of the above candidate signals between groups ( Figure 7A ). Using large-scale proteomic screen antibody arrays, we discovered that EV-D68 significantly increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (phospho-Thr180/Tyr182), Table 2 ). The involvement of p38 MAPK was further confirmed through studies utilizing LP17. Phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK (phospho-Thr180/Tyr182) were decreased 0.76-fold in the LP17-treated group compared with the EV-D68 infection group ( Figure 7B, lane 3) . Figure 7C shows the phosphorylation modification and significant changes in p38 MAPK. This result indicates that EV-D68 infection activates TREM-1 and leads to phosphorylation of downstream p38 MAPK, which is potentially involved in the regulation of downstream cytokines (33) . Taken together, our study demonstrated that EV-D68 infection stimulated NF-kB p65 nuclear import to activate TREM-1 transcription, and then TREM-1 transmitted activation signals to phosphorylate p38 MAPK to involve host inflammatory responses. Based on these results, we developed a schematic diagram of the activated TREM-1 signal pathway during EV-D68 infection (Figure 8 ).",

            "text": "To date, no specific antiviral medicines or treatments have been approved for EV-D68 infection, partly due to the lack of in-depth understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of the virus. In the present study, we generated a transcriptomic landscape map of EV-D68-infected RD cells to reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for viral infections. We applied IPA to construct a GRN, analyzed the activation of genes and their upstream regulatory factors, and further verified our hypotheses through in vitro experiments. In summary, we found that TREM-1, TNF, and NF-kB are the major regulators in the gene regulation network connecting proinflammatory responses. Thus, TREM-1 signaling pathway is an important mediator of inflammatory responses associated with EV-D68 infections. Transcript profiling showed that EV-D68 infection significantly stimulated host immune responses, resulting in an activated antiviral state in infected cells. EV-D68 infection triggered activation of transmembrane receptors (TREM-1, TLR3/4/7, IL-1R), transcription factors (RELA, STAT3, JunB), and cytokines (TNF, IL, CCL5). IPA-based analysis showed that these factors interact through a GRN, and are involved in the host inflammatory response. Recently developed animal models of EV-D68 infection have provided limited information about the pathogenesis of EV-D68-induced airway disease. Nasal inoculation of cotton rats with a recently isolated EV-D68 strain (VANBT/1) significantly upregulated pulmonary cytokine mRNA levels (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, IL-6, IFN-b, and IFN-g) and provided histological evidence of peribronchiolitis and alveolitis (34) . Nasal infection of ferrets with the EV-D68 Fermon strain increased the abundance of lung proteins IL-1a, IL-8, and IL-12 p70 during early infection, and lung pathology was continuously exacerbated during the progression of infection, causing lung edema as well as lung injury at the middle and late stages of infection (35) . These reports explored the abdominal inflammatory pathological response induced by EV-D68 infection, and suggest that inflammation is involved in pathophysiological processes caused by EV-D68 infection. Rajput et al. found that treatment with anti-IL-17 antibody reduced the expression of lung cytokines (TNF-a, IL-12b, and IL-17A) and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL10), and attenuated EV-D68-induced airway responsiveness in neutrophilia (36) . However, the specific mechanism needs to be further investigated.",

We found that TREM-1 was involved in inflammatory responses and regulated the secretion of downstream cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, and others. Additionally, NF-kB p65 was essential for EV-D68-induced TREM-1 up-regulation based on NF-kB p65 activation inhibitor and small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatments. A dual-luciferase assay demonstrated that NF-kB p65 binds to the promoter region of the endogenous TREM-1 gene and regulates TREM-1 expression at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, inhibition of the TREM1 signaling pathway with the specific inhibitor LP17 dampened activation of the p38 MAPK signaling cascade, which suggests that TREM-1 mainly transmits activation signals to phosphorylate p38 MAPK. Increasingly, studies are exploring the role of inflammatory responses in antiviral immunity. For example, Rao et al. applied a cell bait approach to deceive coronavirus, reduce inflammatory cytokine production, and eliminate lung damage caused by SARS-Cov-2 infection (43) . However, a deeper conceptual understanding of the mechanisms associated with the pathogenic and protective functions of TREM-1 in antiviral immunity is essential to develop novel therapeutic strategies for controlling virus infection by modulating innate immune signaling.",
