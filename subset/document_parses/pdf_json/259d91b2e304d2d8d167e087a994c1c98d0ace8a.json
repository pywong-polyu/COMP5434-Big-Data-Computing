            "text": "Serological surveys can provide evidence of cases that were not previously detected, depict the spectrum of disease severity, and estimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections. To capture these parameters, survey sample sizes may need to be very large, especially when the overall infection rate is still low. Therefore, we propose the use of \"snowball sampling\" to enrich serological surveys by testing contacts of infected individuals identified in the early stages of an outbreak. For future emerging pandemics, this observational study sampling design can answer many key questions, such as estimating the asymptomatic proportion of all infected cases, the probability of a given clinical presentation for a seropositive individual, or the association between characteristics of either the host or the infection and seropositivity among contacts of index individuals. We provide examples, in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, of studies and analysis methods using a snowball sample and perform a simulation study that demonstrates scenarios where snowball sampling can answer these questions more efficiently than other sampling schemes. We hope such study designs can be applied to provide valuable information to slow the present pandemic as it enters its next stage and in early stages of future pandemics.",

While random testing is common for such surveys, the cumulative incidence will vary greatly depending on the stage of the pandemic, and a very large sample may be necessary to obtain enough cases to capture less common disease presentations. An alternative study design based on \"snowball sampling\" offers a route to collect data on the spectrum of clinical severity and transmissibility. This sampling approach is a form of survey sample enrichment for hard-to-reach populations (4, 5) . While enriched sampling might typically focus on a marginalized or underrepresented community, snowball sampling in this context enriches for the presence of seropositivity. Similar enrichment can occur in studies focused on high-risk populations (e.g., health care workers (6)) or by studying family members of infected individuals (7), but these are not as representative of the population and possible transmission routes in a more general setting.",

The general research method involves identifying index individuals and, along with collecting information on them, asking them to refer other individuals suitable for the study (8, 10) . These named individuals are then recruited into the study. This process may end there or continue for further stages (9) . The method is often used for qualitative studies of \"hidden\" populations, where subjects are difficult to reach or a sufficient sample is unlikely to be obtained from random sampling (5, 10, 11) . It has more recently been used in infectious disease settings as a cost-effective way to recruit individuals into care and into studies (12) (13) (14) . One study of human immunodeficiency virus infection found it to be a more cost-effective approach and generate a more representative sample of the spectrum of disease than standard recruitment methods (14) . The generalizability of results from snowball sampling has been criticized because the sample is not a true probability sample (11, 15, 16) . This can be mitigated, however, by ensuring a random or representative selection of index individuals and by accounting for clustering in the analysis (15) (16) (17) (18) .",

The goal of snowball sampling, as we propose it, is not to determine the amount of population-level immunity, which is best addressed by conventional serosurveys, but to obtain many individuals who have been exposed in order to estimate the range of clinical presentations and their relation to transmission. We propose that investigators consider a snowball sampling approach based on contact tracing in order to more fully answer important questions about the clinical presentations of disease and factors associated with transmission in a cost-effective way.",

This relies on contact tracing, which is primarily used for outbreak mitigation and to identify linkages between transmission chains (19) . Assuming that a serological assay with high specificity and sensitivity for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is available, the method begins with a sample of individuals who were infected. We then proceed to test the reported contacts of these cases, both those to whom the primary case is known to have transmitted and other potential contacts who may not have been previously identified. Backward tracing, which incorporates potential infectors of the index case, may also be used. Other questions of interest may focus on the network structure itself, that is, the number of seropositive contacts of each index individual. Much of the snowball sampling literature focuses on these types of questions and we refer readers there for appropriate analysis methods (8, 9, 15) .",

Sample size calculations are thus likely to be conservative, as the true correlation will be lower than the hypothesized correlation.

In a sample of sufficient size, we would also be able to compare the numbers of onward infections associated with different clinical presentations. More data on the role of asymptomatic and less severe clinical presentations in onward transmission is critical to designing appropriate responses, as existing studies may reflect changing contact patterns due to public awareness of the disease rather than biological patterns of infectiousness (36) . This sampling approach could also inform estimates of the secondary attack rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, improving future modeling studies and providing context for tailored public health interventions.

These and many other parameters important for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic public health response were difficult to estimate early in the pandemic. In addition, while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases are known to be capable of transmission, the proportion of infections caused by such cases is not clear. While it appears that SARS-CoV-2 transmission displays overdispersion, a high variance in secondary cases per index case around the population mean basic reproduction number (R 0 ), we do not yet know what characteristics are associated with superspreading events (1-3).",

Enlargement continues until the sample is estimated to have sufficient statistical power to answer the question(s) of interest. A history of symptoms relevant to the question of interest, covering the time period from the earliest possible infection date to the latest possible date yielding seropositivity, is collected for each identified case and contact. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND QUESTIONS OF INTEREST Several types of scientific questions of interest may be answered through this design. For example, using only sampled individuals who test positive: 1. Identify the range of clinical presentations for an individual with a positive serology test (seropositive individual). 2. Identify the probability of a given course of disease for a seropositive individual. 3. Identify the association between a contact's characteristics of interest (e.g., types of contact or personal characteristics) and their course of disease. For instance, some individuals may be more likely to experience minimally symptomatic infections. With information on both seropositive and seronegative contacts, researchers can also answer questions about transmission such as: 4. Identify the association between some characteristics of interest (of either the contact or index individual) and seropositivity among contacts of index individuals, to determine which are associated with increased likelihood of transmission. For example, cases who are asymptomatic (and were undetected by initial contact tracing) may be more likely to transmit because they are unaware of their status.",

This allows inference to proceed, treating the sample as a cluster sample from a larger population of clusters(22).For questions 1 and 2, analysis can account for this potential correlation by using a hierarchical model, where the probability of a given clinical presentation differs depending on the index",

At the earliest sampling time, when the population prevalence is around 5%, only 77% of the regular samples included at least one symptomatic individual, while over 97% of the snowball samples did. Incorporating contact recall error in the snowball samples reduced this percentage by less than 1%.To compare performance on question 2, estimation of the symptom rate among infected individuals,Figure 1displays the number of infections identified in each sample (panels A,B), the median and interquartile range of the estimated symptom rate (panels C,D), and the root mean squared error of estimation (panels E,F) across all simulations for each method, by sampling time and ICC.

The snowball samples, with or without contact error, identify more infections, however, and so have a smaller interquartile range and lower root mean squared",

It also demonstrates that minor violations of assumptions, such as some incorrect contact identification, do not negate the benefit of snowball sampling. The approach described here is agnostic to the true infector of a contact, so the method is also robust both to the index individuals including their infector as a contact and to other sources of infection being included among identified contacts for the ICCs studied here.",

            "text": "Compared to other enriched designs, this approach is not limited to certain segments of the population and thus provides a more representative sample of clinical presentations and demographics. It also provides a larger and more representative sample per index individual than only sampling household members, enabling better power to answer a wider range of questions of interest.There are settings where the snowball sampling design is not feasible, however, or where it has minimal benefits compared to random sampling. First, it is not suited to estimate overall population seroprevalence. Second, it is less beneficial in a more mature epidemic, where the prevalence reduces the efficiency of the snowball sample enrichment. In a later epidemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions may have also reduced the reproduction number, thus reducing the number of seropositive individuals per index case. These interventions (e.g., social distancing) may also reduce contacts, however, thus preserving the relative benefit of snowball sampling. Third, if there is substantial misclassification of close contacts or bias in recall by index individuals, this can limit the benefits of the design and even lead to bias. In particular, if index individuals are more likely to recall contacts who did experience symptoms, this approach may lead to overestimation of the rates of severe clinical presentations. Finally, a high proportion of superspreading events will lead to high variance in cluster sizes, reducing the effective sample size of the snowball sample.From the practical side, there is a cost of identifying and reaching index individuals and their close contacts above that of identifying and reaching randomly sampled individuals. This may reduce the number of individuals who can be sampled. This is particularly the case if a true random sample of index individuals is desired so that the results are generalizable, rather than using a convenience sample of index individuals(5). The use of pre-existing contact tracing information from public health authorities will reduce the contact tracing labor required and thus the cost of snowball sampling. It will also reduce contact recall bias by shortening the time delay.Further work should consider whether contact tracing efforts with virologic testing provide enough information to be used as de facto snowball samples for retrospective analysis.As in all serological surveys, the results depend on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay used. Low sensitivity will lead to the exclusion of cases, reducing the sample size achieved and the representativeness of clinical presentations. Low specificity will lead to the inclusion of non-infected individuals as index individuals, resulting in wasted resources, and could also lead to bias in determining the association between characteristics and the likelihood of infection among contacts. By enriching the sample through snowball sampling, resources that might otherwise go to sampling individuals could go to the use of a more accurate test, mitigating some of these problems. If these test characteristics are known, then analysis methods can be adjusted to account for them.Since directionality is important in identifying transmission risk factors but unable to be fully established in general in such surveys, evaluations of factors that predict transmission should be interpreted with caution(37). In some cases, limiting the analysis to cases where temporal ordering of infection can be established may be warranted.Finally, the symptom or risk factor being accurately recalled by the close contacts is also important for obtaining unbiased results. This will depend upon the time between their possible infection and the occurrence of the survey, as well as the specificity of the symptom under investigation. For many of these factors, surveys early in the epidemic will perform better than those later in the epidemic, and so snowball sampling might be an effective approach at ensuring adequate power.The snowball sampling survey design can collect samples in a more rapid and efficient manner than conventional serosurveys, especially in the early stage of an epidemic. Studies using this design can then provide vital information on important parameters, including the range and clinical disease severity among infected individuals. It should be considered for use in locations still in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and its properties should be further studied so the method can be improved and used in future infectious disease outbreaks.DATA AVAILABILITYAll simulated data generated for this study, as well as R code to reproduce the simulations, analyses, and figures, are available at https://github.com/leekshaffer/snowball-sampling.",

Clustering can be accounted for by specifying the ICC . For questions 2 and 3, we must inflate the variance (and thus the required sample size) of a standard analysis by an appropriate design effect.
