Concurrently, many subspecialty providers who had not been deployed to the ICUs were eager to help and had excess capacity, since all elective surgeries and many ambulatory visits were suspended. Some of these providers had not been deployed because their age or health status imparted unacceptably high risk to onsite service. More commonly, however, these providers had not been selected for ICU service because they lacked the critical care experience to justify their presence, especially when critically low personal protective equipment supplies required thoughtful distribution to only those caregivers able to provide care most effectively.

The RCLP was designed for a dual mission: (1) to support the families of critically ill COVID-19 patients, and (2) to support the ICU teams delivering care to those patients. To achieve these goals, Communication Liaisons needed to speak with families at least once a day, and to provide timely and accurate clinical updates, empathic guidance through difficult decisions, and consistent emotional support. Liaisons worked remotely, gathering information from chart reviews and discussions with critical care team members (Figure 1 ). Early each morning, liaisons reviewed their patients' electronic records to learn about overnight events and any changes in clinical status. Following these chart reviews, all liaisons and liaison-coaches assigned to a given unit would meet together virtually, to confirm or clarify their understanding of their chart reviews, and to discuss anticipated challenges in the planned phone calls for that day. Palliative care providers, who also divided themselves according to specific ICUs during the surge, joined these morning liaison team calls for their units whenever possible.",

In these calls, liaisons would inform a patient's family of the patient's stable status, remind them that the liaison would be in touch later in the day after speaking with the ICU team, and inquire whether the family member had any specific questions or concerns to relay to the ICU team. A primary purpose of these brief check-in calls was to reaffirm to family members that their loved ones had the attention of hospital caregivers; by calling and assuaging anxiety early in the day, liaisons pre-empted family members' calls into the ICU early in the day during rounds when it was difficult for the ICU tem members to meet their needs. When the chart review suggested a clinical status change, or raised questions the liaison could not answer from the chart alone, the morning check-in call was deferred until the liaison could speak to an on-site ICU team member for clarification.

Liaisons exhibited a high degree of engagement with the program, evidenced by the high (>80%) proportion of repeat volunteers and their magnanimous responses to scheduling disruptions, as well as by informal strongly positive feedback from many of the liaisons. Keys to success include strong logistical support, a team-based system with peer coaching, and \"just-in-time\" training with quick guides in wiki format to allow constant updates.

            "text": "The next challenge was to provide rapid training for liaisons in the basics of critical care medicine and palliative care communication. A large plurality of liaisons were dermatologists, pathologists and ophthalmologists; very few had recent or substantial experience with either critical care medicine or end-of-life care. Errors in communication stemming from liaison misunderstanding or misrepresentation could cause substantial emotional harm to patients and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f families. Liaisons needed to reliably extract and relay pertinent clinical information, without seeing the patient directly, without presence on rounds, without extensive contact with the ICU teams, and without substantial prior expertise in the subject matter at either end of the communication. The pilot phase of the program quickly demonstrated that effective communication under these circumstances was indeed possible, if liaisons were provided three basic ingredients for success: 1. Logistical support 2. Clinical reference materials provided through a \"Wiki\" 3. Liaison team coaching Logistical support: Liaisons participated in interactive virtual orientation sessions and received a comprehensive reference guide detailing all structural components of the program, including a recommended daily schedule (Figure 1), documentation instructions, coding and billing guidelines, and links to other pertinent reference material (Appendix B). A new \"Liaison Communication\" note type was created in the electronic health record to clearly distinguish liaison notes from consult notes related to the liaison's primary specialty. A new liaison note template streamlined and standardized documentation, and provided liaisons with memory triggers to help them navigate through difficult discussions (Appendix C). To maintain liaison privacy, outgoing calls to families were routed through the hospital; families could reach out to their liaison through virtual pagers established for the program.",

            "text": "Clinical reference \"Wikis\": The program created two collaborative guides, a \"Palliative Care Wiki\" and a \"Critical Care Wiki,\" populated initially with abbreviated key content from subject matter experts (Appendix D). All program participants were encouraged toJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f amend the documents as they learned from experience during their liaison service blocs. The Palliative Care Wiki included sections on medicolegal documents and considerations, goals-of-care basics, and a guide to challenging conversations. The Critical Care Wiki included instruction on performing an ICU \"chart biopsy\", and quick guides to hemodynamic assessments, common infusions, and ventilator settings. With constant updates, both wikis quickly evolved into refined, effective, stand-alone references. Liaison team coaching: Early in the pilot phase, it became clear that even novice liaisons consulting with each other could work through many of their questions without the need for extensive consultation with critical care teams or other experts. Therefore, each ICU was assigned a team of 2-3 liaisons who would discuss their respective patients each morning, leveraging their complementary expertise as they grappled with challenging situations. Each team had one team member with more extensive experience with critical care medicine, end-of-life care issues, or challenging conversations who served as a coach, in addition to performing the typical functions of a communication liaison. The liaisoncoaches were typically experienced providers in fields such as medical oncology, surgical oncology, neurology, and primary care. Many held clinical and academic leadership positions, through which they had experience guiding less experienced providers through various challenges. Finally, the liaisons and coaches could escalate deeper concerns to the program's lead coach, or to the palliative care providers, who participated in many of the liaison daily team meetings, and who could assume the primary communication role when a higher level of expertise was required. was established swiftly to match the speed of the surge, with liaison coverage to all COVID-19 ICUs commencing on April 11, just nine days after the program's inception. Liaisons set aside other professional obligations for four-day shifts, staggered with the ICU team blocs to provide continuity through team transitions.",

            "text": "early afternoon, after the ICU team finished their on-site rounds, the liaison team would meet virtually with the ICU attending. In these calls, the ICU attending would answer liaisons' questions and ensure mutual understanding of the care plan. They would discuss any major changes in prognosis, goals or clinical course that would inform the communication between the liaison and the family members later that afternoon. In the case of a substantial clinical status change, the ICU attending might ask the liaison to defer the afternoon family phone call to the on-site ICU providers or palliative care team. The program's training in the basics of critical care medicine allowed liaisons to converse with ICU teams efficiently, and then to reliably address many of the clinical questions posed by family members.Liaisons would then call the patients' family members a second time to provide more detailed updates, answer questions, provide emotional support, and retrieve information that would help the ICU team care for the patient. Liaisons were trained to remain attentive to comments from family members that might further inform goals of care considerations, and how to pivot on those comments to help family members discuss difficult and emotional issues, to make the best possible decisions for their critically ill relatives.Over the course of the program, liaisons provided extensive clinical updates to patients' families. However, providing emotional support remained the top priority for these family phone conversations, over other important tasks such as providing test results and clarifying goals of care. Liaison schedules were structured to allow them the time to build trust with families, so that when critical time-sensitive information needed to be conveyed in either direction, liaisons would be well positioned to facilitate that communication. We repeatedly reminded liaisons of program's core mission to support families and ICU team colleagues, with emphasis on the word \"support,\" recognizing that liaisons could achieve much of the program's intended benefit by listening actively and responding with empathy. By explicitly elevating the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f provision of emotional support above other important liaison functions, we sought to protect liaisons from pressure to interpret or communicate data beyond their fund of knowledge, thereby minimizing the risk of harm from delivery of erroneous clinical details. Because of the program's core supportive mission, liaisons could leverage their pre-existing empathy and interpersonal skills to mitigate the key problem at the heart of the Liaison Program's inception: the exclusion of family from the bedsides of their critically ill loved ones. The rapidly evolving COVID-19 surge challenged hospital and ICU leaders to adapt operations swiftly, in broad, sometimes unforeseen ways that often caused sudden fluctuations in the immediate need for liaisons. Increasingly close communication between the RCLP leadership and the ICU Surge leaders over the course of the program moderated these impacts, and the liaisons responded to disruptions with magnanimity, volunteering on very short notice, shifting liaison teams without complaint, or graciously agreeing to delay service blocs despite having cleared their schedules for their expected four-day shifts. The program ran for 53 days until June 2, 2020, when the surge waned sufficiently to disband. In that time, 65 providers from 19 specialties served in at least one four-day liaison bloc. They included 44 physicians, 19 advanced practitioners, and 2 psychologists. Twenty-four of them served as liaison-coaches at some point during the program. Fifty-four of the 65 liaisons chose to return for at least one additional service bloc, and 14 liaisons volunteered at least four times. In all, the liaisons supported families of over 140 COVID-19-positive ICU patients, and wrote over 1450 notes documenting their conversations and any implications relevant to patient care.",
