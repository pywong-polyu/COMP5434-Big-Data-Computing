BTV is an orbivirus that is transmitted by Culicoides midges (Mellor et al. 2000; Mehlhorn et al. 2007; Meiswinkel et al. 2007) . Other exotic arboviruses that infect livestock and are probably transmitted by the same midge species as BTV (Mellor et al. 2000) include EHDV, Akabane virus and bovine ephemeral fever virus. Incursions of these viruses have been reported recently in Israel (Yadin et al. 2008 ) and they could also spread to the European continent as the climate changes. There is already evidence that climate change is affecting endemic diseases in GB too. For example, liver fluke is expanding in range in GB (Scottish Agricultural College 2004; Pritchard et al. 2005) because of warmer, wetter conditions that favour its mud snail intermediate host. National Farmers' Union (2005) has summarized the key climate concerns for farmers and growers in GB as carbon dioxide levels, temperature (including its effect on growing season), water availability (including relative humidity and soil moisture), cloud cover, wind, weather extremes and sea level rise. Climate change is forecast to affect average annual temperature and precipitation in GB (Hulme et al. 2002) as well as to increase the frequency of extreme weather events including torrential rains, very strong winds, heat waves and droughts. Flooding could increase the prevalence of endemic pathogens that are transmitted by the faecal-oral route, and even that of botulism and anthrax (Baylis and Githeko 2006) . Here, the factors through which climate change could affect livestock diseases are reviewed as a basis for developing a qualitative risk assessment framework. A case study is presented for liver fluke and the implications of the effect of climate change on livestock diseases are considered.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 63, "end": 76, "text": "(Landeg 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 282, "end": 302, "text": "(Mellor et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 303, "end": 324, "text": "Mehlhorn et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 325, "end": 348, "text": "Meiswinkel et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 460, "end": 480, "text": "(Mellor et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 609, "end": 627, "text": "(Yadin et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 847, "end": 883, "text": "(Scottish Agricultural College 2004;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 884, "end": 906, "text": "Pritchard et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 989, "end": 1019, "text": "National Farmers' Union (2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1401, "text": "(Hulme et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1707, "text": "(Baylis and Githeko 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The abbreviations used for the viral diseases considered here are listed in Table 1 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 76, "end": 83, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "There is strong evidence to suggest that climate change has, and will continue to affect the occurrence, distribution and prevalence of livestock diseases in Great Britain (GB).

The interaction of these factors is an important consideration in forecasting how livestock diseases may be affected. Risk assessments should focus on looking for combinations of factors that may be directly affected by climate change, or that may be indirectly affected through changes in human activity, such as land use (e.g. deforestation), transport and movement of animals, intensity of livestock farming and habitat change.

Equine piroplasmosis, which is a tick-borne disease of horses caused by two intraerythrocytic protozoans (Theileria equi and Babesia caballi), provides another example of a disease that occurs near GB.

As the average temperatures increase across GB, some factors may change faster than others in effect, resulting in mistiming. An example of mistiming because of climate change is the loss of synchrony between nesting and peak food abundance in migratory birds (Both et al. 2006) . Differential movements of wildlife species' traits (e.g. the range and abundance of species, timing of migration and morphology) in response to the rapid rate of temperature rise together with habitat destructions could result in a disruption of the connectedness among many species in current ecosystems, leading to a reformulation of wildlife species communities (Root et al. 2003) . Differential rates of change could create novel, or at least different, microenvironments and ecological and agricultural combinations with certain imbalances and provide new opportunities for livestock diseases to emerge in GB compared to in southern Europe at present. Therefore, forecasting which livestock diseases will emerge in GB as a result of climate change is not as simple as looking at current livestock diseases in southern Europe alone. The arrival of exotic diseases in GB from distant parts of the world is not new (Gould et al. 2006) . To forecast the 'unexpected', all potential routes for disease to enter GB need to be considered in risk assessments. Similarly, the introduction, establishment and rapid spread of WNV in the Americas (Diaz et al. 2008) show that there is a risk of livestock diseases from distant parts of the world emerging in Europe. With modern international travel and globalized trade, any risk assessment has to look beyond those diseases currently in Europe. For example, exotic pathogens such as the VEEV and the rickettsia Ehrlichia ruminantium need further consideration.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 392, "text": "(Both et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 760, "end": 778, "text": "(Root et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1331, "text": "(Gould et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1553, "text": "(Diaz et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Livestock diseases in warmer regions of the world as an indication of what might happen in GB"}, {"text": "The objective is to develop a risk-based framework to screen for any unexpected organism that might have a higher likelihood of emerging in GB as a result of climate change and to identify endemic pathogens and vectors that might be affected by climate change.

These factors include the molecular biology of the pathogen, the vectors, farming practice and land use, zoological and environmental factors together with the establishment of new microhabitats. ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A risk framework approach"}, {"text": "The ability of a microbial pathogen to mutate and hence respond to opportunities arising from change is a key factor in considering the potential impact of climate change. For example, genetic studies (Brault et al. 2004 ) of VEEV in Mexico implicated a single amino acid substitution in the envelope glycoprotein in the adaptation of the virus to an efficient epizootic vector, namely the mosquito Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus. This vector became the most abundant species of mosquito feeding on mammals after deforestation eliminated the habitats of Culex taeniopus, which had been the principal mosquito vector. This example illustrates the ability of RNA viruses to respond rapidly to changes in vector populations such as those that could arise as a result of climate change. Another example is a single mutation in CHIKV that promotes infection in the mosquito Aedes albopictus over the recognized vector, Ae. aegypti (Tsetsarkin et al. 2007 ). This mutation increases the potential for CHIKV to extend its range into Europe and the Americas, where Ae. albopictus has established over the past 20 years . In 2007, transmission of CHIKV was reported for the first time outside the tropics with the occurrence of cases in southern Europe (Enserink 2007) . RNA viruses have a high evolutionary rate ('genetic drift') because there is no proof-reading, and those with segmented genomes are also able to reassort ('genetic shift'). For example, reassortment of the RNA segments in lineages of CCHFV has been reported (Hewson et al. 2004) . Other examples of segmented RNA viruses include RVFV, AIV, BTV and AHSV. The degree of conservation of the host receptor used by the pathogen is also important, and although not directly affected by climate change would reduce the species barrier, and hence facilitate spillover into new species such as livestock through encroachment into wildlife habitats, for example. Randolph and Rogers (2006) have argued that because they must remain infective in two host species (i.e. an invertebrate vector and the vertebrate host), the rate of evolution of vector-borne microbes may be more constrained than that of directly transmitted microbes. However, although the UK appears not to be currently at risk of invasion by WNV , mutations may easily change the nature of the various biotic and abiotic factors that limit the geographical spread of a virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 201, "end": 220, "text": "(Brault et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 923, "end": 946, "text": "(Tsetsarkin et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1256, "text": "(Enserink 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1517, "end": 1537, "text": "(Hewson et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1938, "text": "Randolph and Rogers (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Molecular biology of the pathogen itself"}, {"text": "Many livestock diseases are transmitted by invertebrate vectors.

The incursions of BTV into southern Europe reflect the northwards expansion of the traditional vector, Culicoides imicola (Purse et al. 2005) , which has also supported excursions of AHSV from endemic areas (sub-Saharan Africa) into Portugal and Spain (Mellor and Hamblin 2004) . Argasid (soft) ticks survive well in very dry, desert conditions and Ornithodoros sonrai has expanded its range, and that of tick-borne borreliosis, into areas of sub-Saharan Africa as the 750-mm isohyet (Trape et al. 1996) has moved in association with the drought. O. sonrai serves as the primary vector for ASFV in Senegal (Vial et al. 2007 ) and its expansion in range could be accompanied by persistence of ASF. The soft tick O. savignyi, which transmits AHFV, is well-established through countries in the Persian Gulf region (Charrel et al. 2007) . AHFV was discovered in 1995 and there is little information on its geographic distribution in relation to the wide range of O. savignyi, which could potentially expand with climate change. Argasid ticks have a higher critical temperature (which controls water permeability) than ixodid (hard) ticks and thus have a greater ability to resist desiccation (Davis 1974) , which may facilitate their expansion in range with climate change. Although it is unlikely that those Ornithodoros ticks which serve as vectors for ASF and AHF could establish in GB through climate change, other Argasid ticks are present on bats (Argas vespertilionis) and pigeons (Argas reflexus) in GB although only one species of Ornithodoros tick occurs in north west Europe.

Its distribution from historical records has been mapped in GB (Pietzsch et al. 2005) .

This could explain why MVV has not been reported in countries with mainly extensively reared sheep such as Australia and New Zealand. MVV does occur in GB and routes include imported sheep for restocking (Otter and Boundy 2005) . Changes in the degree of mixing of cattle and sheep will affect the prevalence of diseases such as MCF, which is caused by OHV and spread by direct contact. An increased incidence of MCF in cattle would depend on more sheepcow contact rather than cow-cow contact (Radostits et al. 2000) . Scottish Agricultural College Veterinary Services (2007a) reported more cases of MCF in Scotland with the lambing season bringing sheep closer to cows on some farms. Although herpes viruses are affected by stress (Heuschele and Reid 2001) , the role of stress in MCF caused by OHV remains unclear. A scenario in which extreme climatic conditions (e.g. heat stress) induced the cell-free OHV in nasal secretions combined with other farming management responses to climate change (e.g. housing of cattle in response to heat stress, or co-mingling of cattle and sheep in response to flood) that increase direct contact could promote the spread of the disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 544, "end": 569, "text": "(Leginagoikoa et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 777, "end": 800, "text": "(Otter and Boundy 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1089, "text": "(Radostits et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1330, "text": "(Heuschele and Reid 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Livestock diseases spread by direct contact with livestock and wildlife"}, {"text": "The emergence of wildlife diseases caused by RNA viruses (e.g. coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses) in livestock is a possibility in GB if livestock come in greater contact with species such as bats and rodents as a result of the effects of climate change.

It could be speculated that the risk of release into GB may decrease because of the long-term extinction of some migratory birds through failure to adapt to climate change (Both et al. 2006) . A reduction in extreme winter conditions in central Europe might reduce the likelihood of wintering wildfowl flying west to GB. This would reduce the probability of release of avian diseases, such as AIV into GB. Warmer climate may decrease the risk of exposure of wild birds to AI through environmental routes (e.g. in lakes) because of reduced persistence of AIV at higher temperatures. Poultry farms in GB adopt biosecurity measures with most poultry being raised indoors, so the intensity of farming is less likely to be affected by climate change than more extensively raised livestock such as cattle and sheep.

Botulism outbreaks in wild birds in GB in 1975 occurred in areas of shallow water and the unusually hot summer that year may have provided a suitable temperature for growth of Clostridium botulinum (Lloyd et al. 1976) . Botulism outbreaks in the US are associated with periods of wet weather in agricultural land prone to flooding (Lloyd et al. 1976 ). The prevalence of endemic diseases (e.g. those caused by E. coli O157, Toxoplasma, Giardia and Salmonella) transmitted by faecal-oral routes may increase because of flooding and wetter conditions, although environmental survival is typically less in warmer conditions. Pneumonia caused by lungworm infection and scours caused by gastrointestinal parasites increased in cattle in the south-west of GB in 2007 as a result of the very wet summer, which suited the development and spread of helminth larvae on pasture (Scottish Agricultural College Veterinary Services 2007b). Listeriosis is associated with consumption of soil, although there is no evidence of any increase in either encephalitic or reproductive listeriosis over the past 10 years.

They concluded that the probability of the evolution of the epidemiological situation of disease in France was negligible to low for RVFV, low to moderate for AHSV and high for WNV and BTV. These biological approaches can be coupled with methods for eliciting expert opinion that ask experts separately, through questionnaires or workshops, to assess the risks of release and exposure and the potential consequences for GB according to the World Organisation for Animal Health framework for risk assessment (Office International des Epizooties 2004). Such an approach has recently been applied to assess the risks of incursion of five vector-borne epizootic viruses into Europe from other parts of the world (P. Gale, unpublished data) . Experts can also be asked to assess risks not only for a top-level 'all routes' overview but also for specific routes for example, vectors, meat products, wildlife, livestock, persons and companion animals.

routes to and \u2044 or within GB. To assess whether climate change could promote new routes, or increase the risk of release though old routes\n</td><td>Effects on prevalence of diseases in other parts of the world. Routes to \u2044 within GB may be affected through changes in vectors, farming practice and land use, and zoological and environmental factors\n</td></tr><tr><td>2 </td><td>Molecular biology of the pathogen itself\n</td><td>To establish the potential of the pathogen to evolve in response to novel opportunities from climate change, and to develop resistance to chemical treatments\n</td><td>High mutation rate in RNA viruses, recombination of genomes in segmented viruses. Ability to adapt to new environments and development of resistance to flukicides (in the case of liver flukes)\n</td></tr><tr><td>3 </td><td>Host reservoirs </td><td>To identify potential and known hosts in GB. To assess the effect of climate change on the range, abundance and diversity of potential vertebrate hosts\n</td><td>Zoological factors together with farming practice and land use.
