            "text": "In this article, we investigate the theoretical aspects of multidimensional persistence, the extension of the one dimensional concept of persistent homology. This article is mainly based on the work of G. Carlsson and A. Zomorodian in [CZ07] and [CZ09] . [CZ07] and [CZ09] are very similar where the difference is that [CZ09] digs deeper into the details. Both [CZ07] and [CZ09] contain unproven statements. So, one of our main tasks is to fill in the gaps in [CZ07] and [CZ09] . Following [CZ07] and [CZ09] , our main goal is to carry out a complete classification (Section 3) and parameterization (Section 4) of the algebraic objects that correspond to the homology of a multifiltered simplicial complex. As in [CZ07] and [CZ09] , we then use the parameterization result to show that it is only possible to obtain a discrete and complete invariant for these algebraic objects in the case of one-dimensional persistence, and that it is impossible to obtain the same in dimension greater than one. Here, a discrete invariant is an invariant which is countable in size and which takes values in the same set independently of the underlying coefficient field (see Definition 2.21 ) and a complete invariant is an invariant which is injective as a function on the objects of classification (see Definition 2.19) . At the end of Section 3, we discuss a discrete invariant for multidimensional persistence, the so-called rank invariant (introduced in [CZ07] and [CZ09] ), which is practicable for analyzing multiparamter problems and equivalent to the barcode in dimension one.",

Note that G F (1, 2) equals the projective line P 1 (F). The automorphism group Aut(F F 2 (\u03be 0 )) is isomorphic to GL 2 (F) (see Proposition 4.12) . Thus, we obtain set theoretic bijections",

In Section 3.2, we present the theory behind free hulls. Free hulls are the basic building block for the complete classification of finitely generated n-graded A F n -modules. This complete classification is then carried out in Section 3.3. To approach the question of whether this classification can provide a complete and discrete class of invariants, we first review the one-dimensional case in Section 3.5, where the barcode provides a complete and discrete class of invariants. Then we turn our attention to the rank invariant for multidimensional persistence, which is discrete and equivalent to the barcode in dimension n = 1.

We obtain a well-defined bijection \u03bb(I) : U (I) \u2212 W (I), [M ] \u2212 M \u22121 I M Note that W (I) \u223c = A m(m\u2212d) F (F) as sets. For I, J \u2208 I, define W (I, J) := {M \u2208 W (I) | det(M J ) = 0} Then we have W (I, I) = W (I) and set theoretic bijections\u03d5 IJ : W (I, J) \u2212 W (J, I), M \u2212 M \u22121 J M. Now let X := I\u2208I W (I)/ \u223c where for x \u2208 W (I) and y \u2208 W (J), x \u223c y if x \u2208 W (I, J), y \u2208 W (J, I) and \u03d5 IJ (x) = y.We obtain a well-defined set theoretic bijection \u03bb :I\u2208I U (I) \u2212 X, U (I) x \u2212 \u03bb(I)(x)and hence a set theoretic bijection\u03bb \u2022 \u03b7 : G F (d, m) \u2212 X.The next step is to translate everything into polynomial equations. Let R := F[(x ij )] be the polynomial ring in dm variables. Then W := Spec(R) \u223c = A dm F . Let K(I) := (x i,j ) I \u2212 1 d and R(I) := R/K(I). Now W(I) := Spec(R(I)) is a closed subscheme of W with W(I)(F) = W (I). For J \u2208 I, define R(I, J) := R(I) det((x ij ) J ) \u22121 and W(I, J) := Spec(R(I, J)). W(I, J) is an open subscheme of W(I). We have W(I, I) = W(I) and for any T \u2208 NAlg F , we obtain W(I)(T ) = Hom F (R(I), T ) = {M \u2208 M d\u00d7m (T ) | M I = 1 d } and W(I, J)(T ) = Hom F (R(I, J), T ) = {M \u2208 W(I)(S) | det(M J ) \u2208 T \u00d7 }. The assignment \u03d5 JI (T ) : W(I, J)(T ) \u2212 W(J, I)(T ), M \u2212 M \u22121 J M. is a set theoretic bijection and natural in T . Hence, we obtain an isomorphism of F-schemes \u03d5 JI : W(I, J) \u2212 W(J, I). We have for all M \u2208 W(I, J)(T ) \u2229 W(I, K)(T ), (\u03d5 KJ (T ) \u2022 \u03d5 JI (T ))(M ) = \u03d5 KJ (T )M \u22121 K M = \u03d5 KI (T )(M ) which shows that the cocycle condition is satisfied. Now use Proposition 4.28 to define G F (d, m) as the F-scheme that one obtains by gluing the W(I) along the \u03d5 JI . By Construction, we have G F (d, m)(F) = X and (\u03b7 \u2022 \u03bb) \u22121 is a set theoretic bijection from G F (d, m)(F) to G F (d, m). So, from an intuitive point of view, this construction is the correct one if we consider F-points. That G F (d, m) is a projective variety follows from [EH00, Ex. III-49] or [GW10, (8.10)].",
