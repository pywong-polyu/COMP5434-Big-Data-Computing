Methods In this single-center cohort study, we included all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a Neuro-COVID Unit. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were compared between patients admitted during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Two hundred twenty-three patients were included, of whom 112 and 111 were hospitalized during the first and second pandemic waves, respectively. Patients admitted during the second wave were younger and exhibited pulmonary COVID-19 severity, resulting in less oxygen support (n = 41, 36.9% vs n = 79, 70.5%, p < 0.001) and lower mortality rates (14.4% vs 31.3%, p = 0.004). The different healthcare strategies and early steroid treatment emerged as significant predictors of mortality independently from age, pre-morbid conditions and COVID-19 severity in Cox regression analyses. Conclusions Differences in healthcare strategies during the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic probably explain the differences in clinical outcomes independently of disease severity, underlying the importance of standardized early management of neurological patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The study received approval from the local ethics committee of the ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia (NP 4067, approved 08.05. 2020). Pre-morbid conditions were recorded at admission using the cumulative Illness rating scale (CIRS) and the premorbid modified Rankin scale (mRS).

            "text": "The specific neurological diagnosis exhibited a different distribution within the two time-periods ( Fig. 1) characterized by a significant reduction in stroke rates during the second wave (n = 54, 48.2% vs. n = 25, 22.5%, p < 0.001). Patients with moderate to severe respiratory disease exhibited a shorter time from symptom onset to hospitalization in the second wave compared to the first pandemic phases (days 0.40 \u00b1 0.74 vs 2.79 \u00b1 7.5, p = 0.037). During the second wave, patients showed lower mortality rates after adjusting for age and COVID-19 severity (n = 32, 38.6% vs. n = 19, 17.1%, p = 0.009), and better clinical outcomes adjusting for baseline status (mRS at discharge 2.40 \u00b1 1.6 vs 1.81 \u00b1 1.7, p = 0.019). The Cox regression model identified age (p = 0.001), COVID-19 severity (i.e., BCRSS, p < 0.001), pre-morbid comorbidity (i.e., CIRS, p = 0.028), and the different time period (i.e., waves, p = 0.012) as independent significant predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients. Standard steroid treatment was adopted in 4.7% and 48.1% of patients admitted during the first and second waves, respectively (p < 0.001). Specific Cox regression analyses revealed steroid treatment as an independent predictor of survival (ExpB 2.084, IC 1.072-4.050, p = 0.007) after adjusting for age, BCRSS, CIRS, and time period-in the global sample (Supplementary Fig. 1 ).",

            "text": "This study included 223 consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized for neurological disorders admitted during two different peaks of the pandemic in Italy in a tertiary hub for Neuro-COVID patient. During the first phases of the pandemic, we observed a higher prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases, representing more than half of patients evaluated in the emergency room [8] . During the second phase of the pandemic, conversely, we observed a slightly higher prevalence of patients hospitalized for encephalopathies or headaches, whereas cerebrovascular events decrease to about a third of admitted patients. These differences might be due to younger age, lower comorbidity status, and lower severity of COVID-19 observed during the second wave, as severe SARS-Cov-2 infection with prominent systemic response has been claimed to be associated with increased risk of stroke [2] [3] [4] . The Cox regression model identified the severity of pulmonary disease, age, and pre-morbid conditions as the most important predictors of mortality, with a strong difference in mortality rates between first and second waves (38% vs 17%). On the one hand, the general decrease of severity of COVID-19 disease during the second wave-reported in Europe and USA-might largely explain the reduction of mortality and medical complications observed [9] [10] [11] [12] . On the other hand, the management of COVID-19 patients consistently improved during the second pandemic wave both at primary care and at the hospital level [13] . The total number of COVID-19 dedicated units and beds were increased along with both the non-invasive ventilation and patients were hospitalized earlier and with milder symptoms [10] . Second, the lessons learned from the first phases of the pandemic allowed the development of standardized procedures and guidelines for the management of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 disease, thus strongly improving the care of patients since the early stages. Third, the primary care doctors were directly involved in the initial management of patients with COVID-19 infection, thus increasing the referral to specific COVID-19 units when needed [11] . Dexamethasone and remdesivir substituted hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir, and anticoagulation therapy was promptly administrated since the first days of admission [14] . Indeed, the time interval since onset appeared to improve survival and outcome independently from the severity of the disease. Furthermore, the known increased inflammatory response to the viral infection might be an important modulator of incidence and severity of related CNS disorders [2] [3] [4] 15] in addition to systemic complications. This fits with the results of our study, indicating immunomodulatory treatment as an independent predictor of mortality-in addition to the time of hospitalization and severity of the disease. We acknowledge that this work entails some limitations, as this is a monocentric study with a relatively small sample size and we could not exclude that some patients with COVID-19 disease and neurological symptoms or syndromes did escape the referral, especially for mild cases not requiring hospitalization. Moreover, this is a retrospective study, and treatments' effects are evaluated by an observational approach.",
