Our approach properly accounts for staggered enrollment and change of background incidence over time, as well as for the fact that higher-risk placebo volunteers may get vaccinated earlier than lower-risk ones during the crossover period. It provides unbiased estimation of the entire curve of placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy as a function of time elapsed since vaccination, up to the point where most of the placebo recipients have crossed over to the vaccine arm.

For example, the interim results for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2 and the Moderna vaccine mRNA-1273 that were presented for regulatory approval are based on a median follow-up time of approximately two months after the second dose; 4\u22125 therefore, the reported 94-95% efficacy pertains only to an average of two months post vaccination. Vaccine efficacy can wane over time because of declining immunologic memory or changing antigenicity of the pathogen. Thus, it is critically important to determine the duration of protection and the need for additional booster doses of vaccine. Certainly, after FDA issues Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), vaccine sponsors should continue to collect placebo-controlled data in any ongoing trials for as long as feasible. 15",
