            "text": "Background: To date, cultural clinical research has primarily focused on differences between ethnic groups when investigating causal beliefs about mental disorders. While individual as well as contextual factors are considered important for gaining a better understanding of cultural influences, research on causal beliefs about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cultural correlates in laypersons is scarce. Objective: This study aimed at gain a better understanding of the association between causal beliefs about PTSD and cultural aspects, as well as other contextual and individual correlates of causal beliefs. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional, vignette-based online survey with 737 laypersons from Mexico, Ecuador, Germany, Greece, and Russia. Participants completed the illness perception questionnaire revised (IPQ-R) and reported several cultural and sociodemographic (e.g. country of residence, gender, personal values) as well as mental health-related variables (e.g. PTSD symptoms, previous seeking of help). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify subgroups of individuals expressing similar causal beliefs for PTSD. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse covariates of class membership. Results: LCA resulted in a three-class solution of casual beliefs: a traumatic event-focused class (41.1%); an intrapersonal causes class (40.1%); and a multiple causes class (18.0%). Multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed country of residence, gender, personal value of security, PTSD symptoms, and mental health literacy as significant covariates of class membership. Conclusions: Integrating a more diverse concept of culture into cultural clinical research can be a valuable addition to group comparisons based on nationality or ethnicity. Cultural clinical research needs to move towards a more integrated approach that accounts for the complexity of culture. Including additional contextual and sociodemographic factors can help to reach a more accurate understanding of the cultural influences on the development of causal beliefs and mental health.",

Si bien los factores individuales y contextuales se consideran importantes para obtener una mejor comprensi\u00f3n de las influencias culturales, la investigaci\u00f3n sobre las creencias causales sobre el trastorno de estr\u00e9s postraum\u00e1tico (TEPT) y los correlatos culturales en las personas legas es escasa. Objetivo: Este estudio tuvo como objetivo obtener una mejor comprensi\u00f3n de la asociaci\u00f3n entre las creencias causales sobre el TEPT y los aspectos culturales, as\u00ed como otros correlatos contextuales e individuales de las creencias causales. M\u00e9todo: Realizamos una encuesta en l\u00ednea transversal basada en vi\u00f1etas con 737 legos de M\u00e9xico, Ecuador, Alemania, Grecia y Rusia. Los participantes completaron el cuestionario de percepci\u00f3n de la enfermedad revisado (IPQ-R en su sigla en ingl\u00e9s) y reportaron varias variables culturales y sociodemogr\u00e1ficas (e.g. pa\u00eds de residencia, g\u00e9nero, valores personales) as\u00ed como variables relacionadas con la salud mental (e.g. s\u00edntomas de TEPT, b\u00fasqueda previa de ayuda).

Those affected by, or encountering others affected by, mental health symptoms hold so-called causal beliefs about them, which are part of a wider range of beliefs that can also include ideas about labels, timeline, prognosis, and treatment (Dinos, Ascoli, Owiti, & Bhui, 2017; R\u00fcdell, Bhui, & Priebe, 2009 ). Laypersons' causal beliefs can differ considerably from medical or psychosocial clinicians' models of diseases. In contrast to scientific models, these beliefs are also dynamic strategies for dealing with illnesses that are shaped by social and cultural context, or personal experiences, and evolve over time (Kirmayer & Bhugra, 2009) .",

            "text": "Although 'culture' is widely assumed to shape causal beliefs and consequently health disparities, there is a relative lack of empirical investigation of those claims, and research on the pathways through which culture may influence causal beliefs is scarce (Hruschka, 2009; Kagawa-Singer, 2012) . For posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in contrast to other mental illnesses, the traumatic event is already included as a cause in the diagnostic criteria. Consequently, in studies across several cultural groups, many participants identified the traumatic event as one potential cause (e.g. May, Rapee, Coello, Momartin, & Aroche, 2014; Slewa-Younan et al., 2017) . Further studies on causal beliefs about PTSD have focused mainly on differences between ethnic groups, finding, for instance, higher agreement on spiritual or religious causal beliefs for refugee populations from Sudan or Sub-Saharan Africa in comparison to residents from Germany or Australia, respectively (Grupp, Moro, Nater, Skandrani, & Mewes, 2018; May et al., 2014) . This research has given valuable insights into the problems that can arise when Western concepts of mental health are applied to people with a different cultural background. However, many studies are implicitly or explicitly based on the assumption that participants can be grouped into 'Western' and 'non-Western', and that the study's results can be extended to other countries according to this dichotomy. This can be problematic as it does not take into consideration the huge differences that can be found among these broad groups (Maercker, 2019) . In response, contemporary cultural psychiatry has been moving towards a perspective that accounts for the dynamics of individuals' hybrid identities, which are in constant transaction and transformation (Good, Willen, Hannah, Vickery, & Park, 2011) . The Lancet Commission on Culture and Health defined culture as 'a set of practices and behaviors defined by customs, habits, language, and geography that groups of individuals share.' They clarify, that 'culture, therefore, does not equate solely with ethnic identity, nor does it merely refer to groups of people who share the same racial heritage' (Napier et al., 2014 (Napier et al., , p. 1609 . Instead, culture can be seen as a living, adapting system that offers contextualization within the geographic, historical, social, and political realities of diverse communities (Kagawa-Singer, 2012) . Therefore, to better understand cultural influences in cultural clinical research it is necessary to consider other factors that may interact with culture, including demographic (e.g. age, gender) and geographic (e.g. region or country), and also attitudes, beliefs and values (Chao & Moon, 2005; Heim, Maercker, & Boer, 2019; Hruschka, 2009; Kagawa-Singer, 2012) . Though applying a broader concept of culture has proven to be a better predictor for mental distress than origin or ethnic group per se (Bhui & Bhugra, 2001) , research is scarce on other factors that might be related to causal beliefs about PTSD. Studies have considered age (Spoont et al., 2005) , education (Grupp et al., 2018; Spoont et al., 2005) , religion or religiosity (Grupp et al., 2018; May et al., 2014) , and economic aspects (Aidoo & Harpham, 2001) . However, few studies have used standardized and comparable instruments and even fewer have considered the interrelations between these characteristics.",

While an emic perspective may have revealed more detailed and culturally rich information, this approach allowed us to compare the results and identify correlates across the chosen countries. Our first goal was to identify profiles of causal beliefs for PTSD among the general population of five different countries. Our second goal was to identify characteristics associated with latent class membership. In line with previous research, we expected participants' country of residence, religion, age, and education to be significantly associated with class membership. In the exploratory analyses, we controlled for mental health-related factors and sought to identify additional correlates by including characteristics that have proven important for mental health research, such as gender, migration, socioeconomic status, and personal values.",

LCA is a personcentred approach that can be used to identify latent subpopulations in a population based on a certain subset of variables, and subsequently analyse the relation between subpopulation membership and a variety of covariates (Lanza & Rhoades, 2013; Nylund-Gibson & Choi, 2018) . Person-centred approaches have become more popular in the field of behavioural research as they allow for more precise estimations of individual differences in complex processes, but have not yet been used to investigate causal beliefs about mental disorders. However, LCA has proven a suitable methodological approach for similar phenomena such as help seeking profiles, attitudes, or health beliefs (Hays & Gilreath, 2017; Smail et al., 2021) .",

Fit indicators slightly favoured the four-class solution over the three-class solution; however, visual inspection revealed that the four-class solution simply subdivided one of the classes in the three-class solution into two similar profiles.

            "text": "Overall, our findings accord with previous results in the field. First, among all latent classes, a majority of the participants identified traumatic stress as a potential cause, confirming previous results (e.g. May et al., 2014; Slewa-Younan et al., 2017) as well as the validity of the presented vignette. Second, the majority rejected biological causes in all classes, which is also in agreement with previous results from predominantly Western populations (May et al., 2014; Spoont et al., 2005) . Interestingly, more than half of the participants expressed agreement about there being more than one explanation. This indicates that different causal beliefs may in fact not compete with but complement each other, as has been suggested, for example, for psychological and spiritual models in non-Western populations (Furnham & Igboaka, 2007; Grupp et al., 2018) . Additional analysis revealed several cultural factors associated with class membership. First, country of residence and class membership were found to be significantly related. This is in line with previous studies comparing participants by ethnic or national origin and indicates that environmental factors are important for the development of causal beliefs about PTSD. Interestingly, differences in causal beliefs were also found between countries that might be perceived as having much in common because they are geographically close and have a common language, such as Mexico and Ecuador, or because they are part of a political union that cooperates on mental health policies, such as Germany and Greece. This is important, as it indicates that the often-used East-West dichotomy is outdated and has little predictive value and that, on the contrary, grouping countries on selective parameters may even be misleading in this way (Maercker, 2019) . Second, gender and class membership were found to be significantly related, with males being more likely to be in the multiple causes class. In previous research, gender has not explicitly been considered a correlate of causal beliefs, but so far has only been included as a covariate (Grupp et al., 2018; Slewa-Younan et al., 2017) . Our results indicate that gender should be included as a meaningful correlate when researching causal beliefs, and stress the importance of gendersensitive approaches in all aspects of PTSD research (Olff, 2017) . Third, regarding value orientation, security, which is considered a traditional value, was associated with class membership. Participants who reported, for example, they would rather avoid dangers or indicated the importance of a country's safety and stability were less likely to be in the individual psychological class in comparison to the traumatic event-focused class and the multiple causes class. In previous research, traditional values have been connected to higher PTSD symptoms in German and Chinese crime victims (Maercker et al., 2009) , and trauma victims were more likely to feel socially excluded and blamed for their symptoms in traditional groups (Bennett Herbert & Dunkel-Schetter, 1992) . Our results indicate that people endorsing traditional values may be less likely to support individual psychological causal beliefs. Further research is needed to establish a better understanding of the complex interrelations between traditional values, causal beliefs, and PTSD symptoms. For all other cultural characteristics, no significant differences were found between classes. And, for several variables, differences between the classes were found on the bivariate level, but not when controlling for other covariates in the regression analysis. This underlines the importance of using multivariate methods when doing cultural clinical research. Results regarding age and education must be interpreted with care due to the limited representativeness of our sample, as previous studies have found both factors to be connected to certain aspects of causal beliefs (Grupp et al., 2018; Spoont et al., 2005) . Particularly with regards to migration, perceived closeness to the country's culture and religion, it is possible that the relations with class membership cancelled one another out, since analyses were performed on the entire sample. A more detailed analysis at the country level may reveal differences in this respect. Values are mean centred at individual mean score over all PVQ-RR-scales in correspondence with author recommendations (Schwartz, 2017) .

Participants recognizing PTSD were more likely to be in the traumatic eventfocused class, and participants with probable PTSD were more likely to be in the multiple causes class. It is possible that recognizing PTSD in someone else led participants to unidimensional and rather simple explanations, while people who themselves have PTSD symptoms might be more likely to endorse multicausal beliefs, owing to their own experiences when dealing with their illness (e.g. lack of social support, financial problems). However, these results must be interpreted with care as our overall sample exhibited unusually high rates of PTSD endorsement and PTSD rates differed considerably between countries. Overall, these results indicate that considering various cultural dimensions and controlling for mental health-related factors can be valuable additions when researching causal beliefs about mental disorders and cultural differences in general.",

While this approach allowed direct comparisons, it prevented us to include culturally specific emic aspects in our analysis. All the results of our study are highly dependent on the symptoms described in the vignette. Although the vignette was designed to be as descriptive as possible, it is based on DSM-5 criteria for PTSD, and is thereby already influenced by cultural beliefs and norms. This limitation also extends to our psychometric tools, since not all the questionnaires had validated translations in every language. Though we chose validated versions wherever possible and followed recommendations for translating instruments closely, we cannot ensure, that measures are, in fact, measurement invariant. Third, the vignette method entails some problems, as its generalizability to clinical situations is limited and not all of the described symptoms are specific to a diagnosis of PTSD. Also, the study focused on causal beliefs for PTSD, and we did not examine other aspects of explanatory models, such as stigmatizing attitudes or potential cures. Lastly, our study included a small selection of countries and the results cannot be generalized to other countries.",

In addition to country of residence, our study revealed that, among laypersons, gender, mental health, knowledge about mental health, and personal values are significant covariates of causal beliefs for PTSD. Of further interest, we found systematic differences in countries that are geographically close or share a language. Research, therefore, needs to move away from transcultural comparisons towards a more integrated approach that attends to the complexity of cultural influences. Focusing on easily visible differences, such as ethnicity, may lead researchers to overestimate the influence of cultural aspects while neglecting other influential factors. Adopting a diverse concept of culture and including other contextual factors in research can help us acquire a more nuanced understanding of cultural influences in the development of causal beliefs and mental health in general. Considering causal beliefs in clinical practice should become an integral part of diagnostic processes and in treatment. Practitioners should be careful not to overestimate the influence of nationality or ethnic group on causal beliefs and pay attention to individual causal beliefs and peoples' tendency to entertain multiple beliefs simultaneously. While cultural aspects clearly may account for differences in causal beliefs, other factors, such as gender, may be just as important.",

She is jumpy and easily startled and has lost interest in activities she previously enjoyed. This all began a few months ago, after an incident in which her life was endangered. Mary was out alone when two armed men threatened her with a knife and robbed her. After the incident, Mary felt numb for several days; then the nightmares began in which she still clearly sees the armed men. She is easily startled by unexpected noises.
