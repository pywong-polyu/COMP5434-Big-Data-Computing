A narrative review of the current Australian literature reveals unique challenges faced by Australian maternity clinicians when addressing this substantial disease burden in our diverse population. Rising rates of maternal overweight and obesity, increasing maternal age and the diversity of ethnicity are key epidemiological impactors, overlaid by the 2015 changes in screening and diagnostic parameters. Our vast land mass and the remote location of many at risk women requires innovative and novel ideas for pathways to diagnose and effectively manage women with gestational diabetes mellitus. By modifying and modernizing models of care for women with gestational diabetes mellitus, we have the ability to address accessibility, resource management and our acute response to global events such as the COVID 19 pandemic. With continuing research, education and robust discourse, Australia is well placed to meet current and future challenges in the management of gestational diabetes mellitus.",

The increase in maternal overweight and obesity, advancing maternal age, \"at risk\" ethnic group representation and the change in diagnostic processes and criteria (summarized in Table 1 ) from the previous Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society (ADIPS) criteria [1] to those recommended by the International Association of the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) and endorsed in 2013 by the World Health Organization [1] have all contributed to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of GDM in Australia. The aim of introducing more widespread testing and uniform criteria for GDM was to improve maternal and foetal outcomes, as suggested by the landmark Crowther [3] and Landon [4] randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, increased rates of GDM diagnosis may also contribute to potential physical and psychological morbidity for the mother and physical morbidity for the child and unfortunately, this may be compounded by an unmet resource gap, as resources may not be available to provide \"best practice\" care for all GDM women.",

Australian prevalence data were drawn directly from the National Diabetes Service Scheme (NDSS) (which registers all Australian residents with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes who receive access to government subsidies for the purpose of diabetes care) and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare website. [7] This review examined the prevalence of GDM in Australia since the adoption of the IADPSG diagnostic criteria (officially 1 January 2015, but variable across the country). Universal screening is recommended for pregnant women, not previously diagnosed with hyperglycaemia, and between 24 and 28 weeks gestation [8] . This highlights the distinctive local Australian challenges of delivering care to geographically isolated women across vast distances and the specific needs and concerns of our First Nation women. This reviews the current models of care and considers how we might cater for women with cultural and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Finally, it addresses the current COVID-19 screening situation and the need for improved post-natal care.",

There is, however, enormous variability between regions in Australia which is discussed further below. International prevalence data drawn from Brown et al.

This report assessed the perinatal data the year before (2014) and the year following (2016) Queensland's move to one step screening and diagnosis of GDM according to IADPSG criteria. Each historical cohort included more than 60,000 women. Perinatal outcomes of interest were defined as gestational hypertension, caesarean birth, gestational age at delivery, birthweight, preterm delivery, large-for-gestational age (LGA) neonates, small-for -gestational age (SGA) neonates, neonatal hypoglycaemia, and respiratory distress. The authors reported a very small decrease in neonatal respiratory distress without significant changes in other perinatal outcomes post-implementation. The authors considered positive impactors including an (independent) improved detection of neonatal hypoglycaemia during this time period, and negative impactors such as increased maternal BMI and the inadequate resourcing of care as possible confounders for the lack of discernible improvement in neonatal outcomes. However, we note that assessing overall outcomes on a population basis is unlikely to show significant changes. In this report, the absolute increase in GDM frequency was 3.2% and only these women would have received different treatment in the two study periods. By contrast, around 88% of women would have been considered as \"non GDM\" in both study periods and would thus have received similar care either before or after the changes in diagnostic processes and criteria were implemented.",

Between 2015 and 2018, the Optimisation of Rural Clinical and Haematological Indicators for Diabetes in Pregnancy (ORCHID) study [25] cohort was recruited in rural Western Australia. This study was conducted to address concerns about geographically mandated long delays between the time of venesection at various remote sites to the centralized laboratory facilities, focusing on the issue of pre-analytic glucose degradation (due to in-sample glycolysis). There were concerns that this could lead to the under diagnosis of GDM in an \"at risk\" group. The authors assessed the potential impact of alternate pre-analytical protocols to minimise glycolysis. Most OGTT samples were stored at room temperature and 92% (461/501) had a substantial delay before analysis; median 5 h, range 2.3-124 h. The authors estimated that 62% of potential GDM diagnoses were missed amongst regional, rural and remote Western Australian women by the 24-28 week OGTT. This is due to the suboptimal sample processing issues, with the greatest preanalytical error relating to the measurement of fasting venous plasma glucose. In a small subset of their cohort, they demonstrated that changing their pre-analytic sampling procedures, by storing samples in an ice-water slurry (following the protocol used in the HAPO study), was able to prevent much of the in-sample glycolysis. However, this was considered impractical for routine clinical use. By contrast, the use of fluoride citrate tubes without cooling was also able to prevent in sample glycolysis, but led to a systematic increase in laboratory glucose measurements of 0.2 mmol/L. This in turn led to an approximately doubled GDM prevalence, predominantly due to elevations in fasting glucose values. They suggested that laboratories could potentially correct for this difference by the systematic subtraction of 0.2 mmol/L from their analytic results, giving results comparable with those obtained with HAPO-aligned methods.",

Commonly, women were provided with a contact phone number to call if the blood glucose levels were out of range. At this point, and no doubt due to the workload, most clinics provided a \"step-up\" option, where only women with self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) out of range receive ongoing care from a diabetes educator or endocrinologist. This resulted in most women remaining with their primary antenatal team, which has some potential benefits in terms of the continuity of care. However, either the primary maternity provider or the woman herself must then take the role of a diabetes advocate-seeking an escalation of care when required. Experience tells us that often the women with the least health literacy or self-advocacy have the greatest need for care. In light of this, models of care need to accommodate all women including those with literacy and language difficulties, those with adherence concerns and women with accessibility disadvantages. From the thematic analysis reported in this paper, common challenges included: busy clinics, lack of coordination between obstetric and diabetes care, CALD, large numbers of GDM women requiring insulin and difficulties in delivering services to patients from rural and remote areas. Proposed solutions included: alteration in traditional models of care, step-up and step-down models, interdisciplinary and midwifery champion approaches, on site interpreters, and technology solutions including portals and telehealth.",

Studies dating back 10 years report high patient acceptability for web-based interventions in GDM. Despite their low-income status, most women had and have access to smart phones and/or computers and report this as their preferred medium for learning. [28] Mobile (smartphone) health solutions are a suitable option for GDM care due to the nature of monitoring, transmitting blood glucose readings from a meter, to phone, to a clinician portal. Education can also be provided digitally in the form of video or teleconferencing mediums. Such a web-based educational intervention was trialled in a multi-ethnic cohort in metropolitan Melbourne [28] with an intervention aimed at a low level of literacy but delivered in English. The three domains assessed were knowledge of GDM, food values and GDM self-management principles. The authors reported the intervention as successful in the first domain with over 70% of women improving their knowledge scores post-intervention. The sample size was small (n = 21) and the authors commented on the comprehension issues with the questionnaire relating to the second and third domains. Language-specific education was proposed for a subsequent trial.",

With approximately 14,000 women requiring insulin therapy per year, MNT interventions which reduce the requirement for pharmacotherapy are potentially very attractive and merit specific funding. The most commonly used oral hypoglycaemic medication for gestational diabetes mellitus in Australia is Metformin, however, its use varies widely between centres, with some preferring insulin therapy alone. The NDSS data do not provide metformin use as a separate measure (many women will be co-prescribed Metformin and insulin therapy) and therefore an accurate assessment of the Australia-wide prevalence of use is not currently available. Some individual centres have published their clinical experience using Metformin. The main focus of these articles pertains to neonatal and maternal outcomes following Metformin therapy. Maple-Brown et al.

In line with multiple international bodies [6] and with the aim of reducing COVID-19 transmission by person to person contact, Australia temporarily revised the recommendations for GDM testing processes and criteria. The COVID-19 revisions included a two-step process with an initial fasting glucose followed by the selective use of OGTTs: fasting glucose of \u22654.6 mmol/L does not require further testing, \u22655.1 mmol/L diagnoses GDM. Moreover, 4.7 mmol/L-5.0 mmol/L requires a full OGTT [33] . Van Gemert et al analysed the proportion of potentially missed diagnoses using this system and 6 years of OGTT data from the Illawarra region, in southern New South Wales [34] . Overall, 16,263 OGTTs were analysed and 1992 patients were diagnosed with GDM, giving a prevalence of 12.2%. Of these GDM women, 29% had a fasting level \u22644.6 mmol/L and would have been missed by the revised COVID-19 screening practice. The authors extrapolated that a fasting glucose cut off of <4.0 mmol/L would be required for a 95% confidence in exclusion of GDM. However, beyond the question of simple GDM frequency, a further secondary analysis of HAPO data from a multi-ethnic cohort involving five HAPO centres has reported that complications including LGA infants and operative birth are less frequent in those women who achieve a GDM diagnosis due to elevated 1 or 2h OGTT glucose but have a fasting glucose <4.7 mmol/L [35] . Therefore, the use of fasting glucose as a first step in GDM assessment may be warranted even after the COVID-19 pandemic. We acknowledge that all changes in GDM diagnostic strategies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic were made on an empirical basis and that they have not been recommended for ongoing utilization outside this context. Further assessment of the perinatal outcomes using any revised screening programme is required before changes are made to the recommended testing protocols.",

Therefore, the general practitioner may not have seen the woman in her pregnancy or even be aware of her diagnosis [36] . Poor follow-up rates are seen despite Diabetes Australia sending reminder letters upon registration of GDM, at 12 weeks post partum and annually thereafter. Many contributory factors and barriers have been proposed, including poor communication from the maternity team at discharge, a lack of patient awareness about the potential risk of type 2 diabetes and reassurance of GDM \"resolving\" post partum [37] .
