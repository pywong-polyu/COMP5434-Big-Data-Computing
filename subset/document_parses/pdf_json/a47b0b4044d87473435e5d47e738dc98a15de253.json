Based on the facts that many reported Nav1.7-selective inhibitors contain aryl sulfonamide fragments, as well as a tricyclic antidepressant, maprotiline, has been found to inhibit Nav1.7 channels, we designed and synthesized a series of compounds with ethanoanthracene and aryl sulfonamide moieties. Their inhibitory activity on sodium channels were detected with electrophysiological techniques. We found that compound 10o potently inhibited Nav1.7 channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells (IC 50 = 0.64 \u00b1 0.30 nmol/L) and displayed a high Nav1.7/Nav1.5 selectivity. In mouse small-sized dorsal root ganglion neurons, compound 10o (10, 100 nmol/L) dosedependently decreased the sodium currents and dramatically suppressed depolarizing current-elicited neuronal discharge. Preliminary in vivo experiments showed that compound 10o possessed good analgesic activity: in a mouse visceral pain model, administration of compound 10o (30\u2212100 mg/kg, i.p.) effectively and dose-dependently suppressed acetic acid-induced writhing.",

            "text": "Pain severely afflicts almost half a billion people worldwide but has no ideal treatment. There appears to be a correlation between voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC, Nav) and human pain syndromes, as identified through genetic studies [1, 2] . The humanvalidated analgesic target sodium channel Nav1.7 is of great interest for the development of new pain medications [3, 4] . It has been reported that gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.7 (SCN9A) lead to several painful conditions, such as inherited erythromelalgia (IEM), paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD), and small fiber neuropathies, whereas loss-of-function mutations in Nav1.7 lead to congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) [5] [6] [7] [8] . It has also been reported that people with CIP are characterized by a complete inability to sense pain without disruption in touch or temperature sensing, except for anosmia [9, 10] . Nav1.7 global knockout mice did not respond to pain stimuli [11, 12] . These results have led scientists to believe that Nav1.7 blockade by small-molecule inhibitors in humans might provide pain relief without side effects [3, 4] . One of the challenges in Nav1.7 inhibitor development is subtype selectivity because of the high sequence homology among Nav isoforms. Nonselective sodium channel inhibitors may lead to some adverse side effects [13] . In particular, acceptable selectivity against the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 is important for preventing arrhythmic side effects such as long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, conduction dysfunction, and atrial fibrillation [14] . Nav1.7 is mainly distributed in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which provides a possible therapeutic strategy for targeting the PNS without affecting the central nervous system [4, 8, 15] . The development of selective Nav1.7 inhibitors is imperative. To date, a number of structurally diverse and selective Nav1.7 inhibitors have been discovered (Fig. 1 ) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

Based on that design, compound 1d has a simplified adamantane moiety instead of an adamantyl group and maintains good activity while displaying increased liver microsomal stability and improved efficacy ( Fig. 1 ) [20] . Looking at the structure of known Nav1.7 inhibitors, it is not difficult to find that aryl sulfonamide or acyl sulfonamide group is important for activity and selectivity. In particular, compounds containing aryl sulfonamide functionalities have attracted considerable attention. According to the cocrystal structure of GX-936 and Nav1.7, the binding sites of these compounds in the fourth voltage-sensor domain (VSD4) of Nav1.7 can be divided into three parts: anionbinding pocket, selectivity pocket, and lipid-exposed pocket [23] . All the aryl sulfonamide inhibitors have similar warheads, which anchor them in specific regions of the proteins to ensure certain selectivity and activity. The difference between most of these inhibitors is mainly on the other side of the molecule, that is, the part that interacts with the lipid-exposed pocket, which makes it the key moiety for our modification.",

            "text": "Recently, studies showed that several tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), such as amitriptyline, imipramine, and maprotiline (MPT) (Fig. 1) , have steady-state affinities for the Nav1.7 inactivated state (K i ) that are much lower than those for the resting state (K r ), demonstrating that they inhibited Nav1.7 channels in a statedependent manner [24] [25] [26] . Notably, the K i values fell in the range of therapeutic plasma concentrations for neuropathic pain relief, suggesting that Nav1.7 channel blocking directly contributed to these TCA-induced analgesic activities [25, 26] . In addition, enhancing channel inactivation and preferentially binding to the channel inactivated state underlie the actions of many identified Nav1.7 channel inhibitors, such as CNV1014802 and PF-05089771 [3, 27, 28] . Therefore, we speculated that these core structures of tricyclic antidepressants might be a good starting point for developing novel Nav1.7 inhibitors. Our group and others have found that MPT is an inhibitor of Nav1.7 with an IC 50 value of 1.51 \u03bcmol/L for the inactivated state ( Fig. 1 ) [25] . By comparing MPT with other reported Nav1.7 inhibitors, we found that this compound has a unique structure and does not share pharmacophore features with those inhibitors. At the same time, the ethanoanthracene moiety in MPT is a large hydrophobic group that is similar to the adamantyl group in GNE-131, which may provide a key hydrophobic effect and contribute to the potency and selectivity. Considering the good inhibitory activity of MPT against Nav1.7, we speculated that the ethanoanthracene core structure of MPT may facilitate the interaction of the compound with the lipid-exposed pocket of the protein. To improve the inhibition potency, we introduced a warhead, for example, an aryl sulfonamide group, and then we designed and synthesized a series of compounds with ethanoanthracene and aryl sulfonamide moieties.",

            "text": "10o inhibits the native sodium currents and dampens neuronal excitability Nav1.7 is heavily expressed in small-diameter mouse DRG neurons [11] . The inhibitory effects of 10o on native sodium currents were then evaluated in mouse DRG neurons. We found that the peak currents decreased as the concentration of 10o in the perfusion solution increased (Fig. 3a) . The current amplitudes were reduced by 24% \u00b1 6% and 40% \u00b1 6% in the presence of 10 nmol/L and 100 nmol/L 10o, respectively (Fig. 3b) . To identify the TTX-sensitive (TTX-S) currents in each neuron, 500 nmol/L TTX was applied after 10o. Nav1.7 is one of the TTX-S isoforms. Notably, the reduction in peak currents caused by 500 nmol/L TTX was 44% \u00b1 4%, suggesting that the Nav1.7 channels expressed in the DRG neurons could be completely suppressed by 100 nmol/L 10o. Encouragingly, a similar level of inhibition on native sodium currents was also observed after treatment with 100 nmol/L PF-05089771, a previously reported selective Nav1.7 inhibitor (Fig. 3c, d) . As Nav1.7 is considered a threshold channel and has a critical role in the generation and conduction of action potentials, we further examined the inhibitory activities of 10o and PF-05089771 on neuronal excitability. The firing frequency of DRG neurons was induced by a step of a 500 ms current injection. As expected, both 10o and PF-05089771 dose-dependently suppressed action potentials in the DRG neurons (Fig. 3e) . Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of 10o was stronger than that of PF-05089771. The reduction in the firing frequency caused by 10 nmol/L 10o was almost equal to that induced by 100 nmol/L PF-05089771 ( Fig. 3f,  g, h) . Overall, 10o inhibits the native sodium currents and suppresses the neuronal excitability of small-diameter DRG neurons.",

Acetic acid-induced writhing in mice is a typical model for inflammatory pain and is widely used for the assessment of the peripheral analgesic activity of compounds [31, 32] . Intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid in mice produces a localized inflammatory response, sensitizes the peripheral nociceptive neurons and ultimately causes writhing behaviors along the abdominal wall [33] . It has been reported that in addition to distribution in peripheral somatic neurons, Nav1.7 is also distributed in visceral sensory neurons and sympathetic ganglion neurons [8, 15] . Some Nav1.7 channel inhibitors, such as \u03bc-SLPTX-Ssm6a, \u03bc-TRX-Hhn1b and HWTX-IV, potently attenuate acetic acidinduced pain behaviors in mice [34] [35] [36] . Thus, the acetic acidinduced writhing mouse model was adopted for evaluating the analgesic activity of 10o. PF-05089771, a potent and selective aryl sulfonamide inhibitor of Nav1.7 in phase II clinical trials, was selected as a positive control and directly compared with 10o [27, 30] . Male ICR mice weighing 22-28 g were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle, PF-05089771 or 10o at the indicated doses 30 min before intraperitoneal injection of 1.5% The values of the I Drug /I Control are the mean \u00b1 SEM.

To understand its mode of action against Nav1.7, we performed a docking study using known structural information. Figure 5 shows the docking analysis of compound 10o in the aryl sulfonamide-binding site in the VSD4 of chimeric human Nav1.7 (PDB ID: 5EK0) [23, 37, 38] . Compound 10o has two enantiomers, among which (S)\u221210o has a higher binding score than (R)\u221210o, as calculated by Schrodinger. By analyzing the docking result for compound (S)\u221210o, we find that compound (S)\u221210o forms van der Waals interactions with residues Tyr1537, Trp1538, Val1541, Met1582, Phe1583, and Arg1605. As illustrated in Fig. 5d , e, the sulfonamide thiadiazole headgroup of compound (S)\u221210o sits in the anion-binding pocket deep in the binding site. This moiety interacts with the guanidinium group of Arg1608 via a salt bridge and forms a bidentate hydrogen bond with the guanidinium group of Arg1602. The benzonitrile ring occupies the selectivity pocket comprising Tyr1537 and Trp1538, which are the key drivers of Nav isoform selectivity. Tyr1537 forms a \u03c0-stacking interaction with the benzonitrile ring, and Trp1538 participates in the \u03c0-stacking interaction with one phenyl ring of the ethanoanthracene moiety, which, we infer, accounts for the excellent isoform selectivity of compound (S)\u221210o. The pyrrolidine nitrogen of compound (S) \u221210o forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Glu1534. The ethanoanthracene moiety occupies the lipid-exposed pocket quite well (Fig. 5d ) and forms \u03c0-stacking interactions with both Trp1538 and Phe1583, which contribute to the significant improvement in the activity of compound (S)\u221210o compared with GX-936.",

Patients with Nav1.7-related CIP do not generally display motor, cognitive, or automatic deficits except for olfactory function damage [9, 10] . Moreover, Nav1.7 is preferentially expressed in the peripheral system. These findings suggested that selective blocking of Nav1.7 could effectively provide pain relief without other potential side effects [3, 4] . As a promising analgesic target, many Nav1.7 channel-selective inhibitors have been identified, such as GX-936, PF-05089771, AM-0466, and GNE-131 ( Fig. 1 ) [17, 19, 23, 37] . Among them, PF-05089771, a highly selective and potent Nav1.7 inhibitor, showed good effects on IEM patients and was used in clinical studies to treat painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy; however, the study was terminated in clinical phase II because PF-05089771 failed to achieve the therapeutic effect [37] . Thus, the rational design and synthesis of sulfonamide-based derivatives through combination with other functional moieties would be necessary and worthwhile to identify novel inhibitors against the Nav1.7 channel.",

Because (+)\u221210o exhibited a higher activity than (\u2212)\u221210o (Table 3) , (+)\u221210o was the main configuration binding to Nav1.7. Consistent with its intense inhibition of Nav1.7 in the heterologous system, we found that this compound decreases the native sodium currents in isolated small-diameter DRG neurons in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a,  b) . Furthermore, 10o intensively suppressed the firing frequency of the DRG neurons (Fig. 3e) . In addition to the reduction in the number of action potentials, the depolarized amplitude also decreased after application of 10o compared with the control. This phenomenon was also observed in the presence of PF-05089771 (Fig. 3g) . The mechanism underlying these results could be ascribed to the fact that Nav1.7 also contributes to the rising phase of an action potential [40] . Thus, these results obtained in heterologous cell lines and native neurons supported that 10o is a potent Nav1.7 channel inhibitor.",

Recently, abdominal pain syndrome caused by Nav1.7 mutations was also reported in IEM patients. In contrast to the visceral pain syndrome observed in patients with IEM and PEPD, no visceral pain behavior was detected in CIP patients [3] . These studies suggested that inhibition of Nav1.7 might be useful for the treatment of visceral pain. In the present study, we evaluated the analgesic activities of 10o in the acetic acid-induced writhing test, a classic model of visceral pain that is widely used in the evaluation of analgesics. We found that 10o and PF-05089771 could relieve acetic acid-induced visceral pain in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, the analgesic effects of compound 10o were stronger than those of PF-05089771. The reduction in writhing produced by 60 mg/kg 10o was even larger than that caused by 100 mg/kg PF-05089771. These results demonstrated to us that compound 10o might have some therapeutic action on visceral pain, providing a direction for further exploration.",

Another specific fragment of 10o is the highly hydrophobic ethanoanthracene core. We speculated that this moiety acted on the lipid-exposed pocket of VSD4 through its strong hydrophobic property, further increasing the binding force between the inhibitor and the pocket. Similar hydrophobic fragments also exist in the inhibitor GNE-131 and compound 1d ( Fig. 1) [19, 20] . In addition, compound 10o also has an alkaline tetrahydropyrrole side chain, which is similar to the ethylazetidine group in GX-936. The interaction with three binding pockets enables 10o to bind to VSD4 stably, thus inhibiting the conformational change in the Nav1.7 channel and blocking the channel current.",

Through varied modification and exploration, we discovered compound 10o, which has good activity and selectivity. The binding mode of 10o with Nav1.7 was illustrated by computer simulation. The hydrophobic effect and an extra \u03c0-stacking interaction between the ethanoanthracene core and Phe1583 may provide new evidence for developing novel Nav1.7 inhibitors with high potency and selectivity. Further research focusing on improving the physical and chemical properties of these compounds is ongoing.",
