Additionally, HCPs have been stigmatized as vectors of contagion, resulting in their assault, abuse, and isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic (4, 5) . This situation has caused many HCPs to feel helplessness, shame, anger, and guilt as hundreds of patients every day succumb to the illness (6, 7) .",

Significant research has been conducted regarding HCPs' experiences of other epidemics (e.g., SARS, MERS, Ebola) including within a Canadian context. For example, Maunder et al. (10) found that an estimated 29-35% of hospital workers experienced a high degree of stress, while another study found that 45% of nurses in Toronto during SARS experienced emotional distress (11) . Other studies of HCPs during SARS have suggested rates of emotional distress being as high as 57% (12) . Longitudinally, HCPs in Toronto reported significantly higher levels of burnout, psychological distress, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 1-2 years post-SARS (13) . More importantly, emotional and psychological distress experienced by HCPs was not necessarily associated exclusively with SARS trauma; rather it was compounded with issues related to quarantine, fear of contagion, concern for family, job stress, interpersonal isolation, perceived stigma, and conscription of non-specialists into infectious disease work (13) .",

One MI scholar commented that HCPs \"are vulnerable to MI because (they) care\" [(16), p. 1] and because they have faced innumerable moral and ethical dilemmas with no \"right\" solutions (15) . While preliminary, research is highlighting the importance of MI when discussing the harm and impairment experienced by HCPs. O'Neal et al. (17) found 66.5% of surveyed HCPs felt moral distress related to conflicts between institutional constraints and what they believed was right during the pandemic. Similar moral dilemmas have been suggested for physicians who may be experiencing tensions between physicians' fidelity to best medical practices, their Hippocratic Oath, and managing scarce resources (18) . Factors and experiences which have been found to cause moral distress during COVID-19 include uncertainty and lack of knowledge, fear of exposure, intraprofessional tensions and miscommunications, policies that prevent or impede care, practicing within crisis standards of care, new roles/tasks and broken routines, and dealing with medical resource scarcity (19, 20) . Noted emotions associated with COVID-19 related MI are feelings of overwhelm, fear, guilt, frustration, distrust, exhaustion, frustration, uncertainty, hopelessness, and helplessness (19) .",

In a recent review, MI is associated with mental illnesses (e.g., PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder), physical health challenges (e.g., pain, sleep disturbances), behavioral issues (e.g., substance misuse, suicidal ideation) and occupational impairment (e.g., burnout, compassion fatigue, and work absenteeism) (21) . Within COVID-19 literature, Wang et al. (22) explored prevalence and correlates of MI among physicians and nurses in mainland China during the pandemic and found an estimated 41.3% of HCPs screened positive for MI, with HCPs providing direct COVID-19 care to patients at 28% greater risk of MI. MI scores in these HCPs were also strongly and positively correlated with depression, anxiety, low well-being, and burnout symptoms (22) . Similar results were found in a Canadian study where, again, moral distress significantly and positively predicted symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and burnout in HCPs (23) . Universally, research is reporting that HCPs are at an increased risk for stress, burnout, and depression during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (24) .",

To date, MI treatments have largely been developed for military personnel and veterans and rely on in-person one-on-one psychotherapy. Evidence-based, trauma-focused treatment approaches, such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, Prolonged Exposure, and Cognitive Processing Therapy, fail to directly address MI. Moreover, current scientific knowledge of MI highlights that this injury, while trauma-based, requires a different therapeutic approach (25, 26) . For example, it has been suggested that rather than relying on strategies that address fear stimuli, MI is best resolved through expression of moral pain, mindfulness, self-compassion, grief and loss rituals, reparation of belief schemas, forgiveness, relationship repair, values or amends work, and self-care (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) . A group approach to MI has also been suggested given the potential for group therapy to support relationship repair (32, 33) . Meta-analyses into group therapy treatments have shown large and significant pre-post treatment reduction in PTSD symptoms (34, 35) and have also been shown to normalize symptoms, counteract isolation, provide peer support and observational learning, and ameliorate important shame-based cognitions (36)-all of which may be central to the treatment of MI.",

The essential goal of ACT interventions is to increase capacity for behavior change by treating emotional avoidance, excessive literal response to cognitive content, and barriers to making and keeping commitments to value-based actions (38) . This ability to choose to do what works in order to move toward who or what is important to the individual is known as psychological flexibility (40) . Six processes combine to promote psychological flexibility and regulate patterns of behavior: cognitive defusion, acceptance, committed action, values, contact with the present moment and self-as-context (40) .",

Theoretically, ACT posits that healing from MI requires a willingness to feel moral pain in the service of creating meaning, purpose, and vitality, while simultaneously reengaging areas of life (e.g., relationships, spirituality, and selfcare) that are often ignored by those suffering a MI (43) . Borges et al.

Time was allotted for individual and group reflections within each session to support learning and group cohesion. The therapeutic components of this intervention consisted of teaching six core processes within the sessions: (1) acceptance and self-compassion related to moral pain; (2) defusion related to self-criticism and resentment; (3) contact with the present moment, including contacting grief; (4) self-as-context and the role of meaningmaking, narratives, and story-telling in perpetrating moral suffering; (5) contacting values related to moral injury, especially values behind our laments; (6) committing to value-driven actions of self-compassion and other reparative practices aimed to heal relationships with self-and/or others (see Table 1 ).",

The facilitators noted that engaging in MI exercises required iterative adaptations both within and between sessions to effectively reflect the group process and honor the lived experiences of participants in the group. For example, 1 week's content shifted from reconciliation/forgiveness work to honoring values, coping amid current struggles and unknowns, taking inventory of losses and betrayals, and finding ways to accept difficult feelings. Other minor changes to the standardized manual included moving some of the psychoeducational content into the handouts rather than in the session content to allow for more time for the exercises and group discussions, the addition of more images, and the streamlining of metaphors throughout the manual so that these could be built upon each week.

While our results are preliminary, they showed that the AMPS-HCP was highly tolerated and meaningful, and participants perceived personal benefit to their mental health. Participants found the use of both the group and online format to be acceptable to them, and in some cases, perceived it as being more beneficial than if they had done it through in person one-on-one therapy.

Our results indicate that participants did not find it to be problematic or an impediment to MI treatment, thus supporting a growing body of literature which shows that online means may be useful for a number of serious mental health conditions including psychosis (57) , PTSD (58), major depressive disorder (59) , and anxiety disorders (60) along with vulnerable populations such as indigenous (61) Group therapy has been shown to be equally effective compared to individual treatment (65) . Group therapy has also been noted to bring unique components to the therapeutic process not found in one-on-one.

Group therapy has also been noted to be especially effective in addressing shame-based cognitions and emotions (67) .

Initially the researchers wondered if participants would relate to the concept of MI given the previous focus on moral distress especially within nursing literature (72) . Participants quickly identified with the concept of MI as cycles of problematic thinking (e.g., avoidance of thoughts); emotions (e.g., judgement of or escape from emotions like anger, worry, hurt, sadness) and behaviors (e.g., disconnecting from relationships, reducing self-care). While participants identified with MI, it is important to note that they identified less with perpetration-based MI (self or others) and more with betrayal-based MI (73) . Betrayalbased PMIEs included institutional neglect/dismissal, healthcare leadership dismissal of psychological harm, conflicting health policies, resource disparities resulting in a suboptimal care, \"COVID denial, \" non-compliance with masks/social distancing, personal exposure to COVID-19 (with long term effects), bearing the brunt of familial or society anger, resent or hostility; and witnessing painful deaths without the ability to comfort. As such, guilt and shame did not figure as prominently in this group as sadness, resentment, and hurt. This is interesting given the predominate focus on guilt and shame as the primary emotions tied to MI (74) . Understanding the role of moral emotions more broadly may support a more comprehensive understanding about MI (28) .",

Studies are currently lacking regarding the potential interplay or overlap of grief and MI; though some MI researchers have highlighted the potential grief elements of MI (75) . Interestingly, the concept of forgiveness was not addressed as it seemed like it would be premature for some, and not a central issue for others; however, the struggles related to acceptance and self-compassion of moral pain were meaningful (29, 42) . This may be an important distinction in treatment between preparation-based and betrayalbased MI. Additionally, it was clear that participants needed tangible practices and skills to be able to integrate, process and move through their moral pain. For example, the Matrix (76) helped to organize discussion, capture painful experiences, clarify values, and support participants in \"toward\" vs. \"away\" behavioral moves. Additionally, the use of storytelling, lament, expressive writing and poetry was also noted by participants to be particularly meaningful. The use of such mediums has been noted elsewhere as being potentially fruitful in the healing of MI and PTSD (36, 77) . These results point to the importance of moving away from a strictly cognitive-based approach for treating MI and instead use language, metaphor, story, imagery, and spiritual practices to move people into their moral wounds (78, 79) . Conversations around MI involve some of the most difficult and unanswerable spiritual and existential questions and require a very different approach than what is seen in traditional trauma therapy.",

This should include a mixed-methods multisite randomized waitlistcontrolled pilot study focused on exploring the efficacy of AMPS-HCP. In particular, it may be helpful to randomize severely affected COVID-19 healthcare sites as this would allow for greater comparability and assist in recruiting a statistically powered sample size of RNs, licensed practical nurses and RTs to further investigate the merit of AMPS-HCP as an evidencebased intervention. Given the larger sample size specific attention would be given to GBA + considerations (e.g., gender, ethnicity, minority status). Additionally, if the results from a AMPS-HCP pilot study were positive, care will be taken to explore implementation science processes to support scale and spread of the intervention.",

            "text": "There were several limitations of the current study that should be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings. First, the sample size is extremely small, and therefore generalizability is low. Second, participants were also recruited via convenience and snowball sampling and were therefore self-selected. This self-selection could mean that participants who were part of the sample were those who most identify with being morally injured because of COVID-19 or who were open to receiving treatment and support. The sample was also largely homogeneous with participants representing registered nurses, registered practical nurses, and RTs respiratory therapists. Additionally, all participants identified as female challenging the research team's ability to explore inclusion, diversity and equity principles; this should be addressed in future randomized control trials. Fourth, the sample size was not powered nor large enough to determine intervention effect, nor were the found effects explored longitudinally to determine sustainability. Fifth, as some participants were not able to attend all intervention sessions and did not complete all of the standardized outcomes measures this may have influenced the quantitative results. Sixth, it has been widely acknowledged in the literature that standardized questionnaires for MI are poor, and may be lacking in reliability, validity, and sensitivity (80) . The MIOS was selected as the best questionnaire at the time of study construction particularly because it is not military-centric, however, caution should be warranted regarding if this questionnaire fully captured the causes, symptoms and harm caused by MI in HCPs. As this area of research is rapidly developing, there may exist other outcome measures for MI that may be appropriate for this population and exhibit improved reliability, validity, sensitivity, and temporal stability. Seventh given the conceptual challenges associated with MI, it is possible that data collection may not have fully encapsulated the events and processes that subsequently produced the noted harms associated with COVID related-MI. Finally, it is possible that participants were grateful to the researchers for receiving support and treatment, and therefore did not wish to express negative opinions regarding the intervention which will need to be countered (e.g., having greater separation between the facilitators of AMPS-HCP and the research team).",

Results from this study showed the use of both the online and group components of the intervention were acceptable and feasible during the third wave of COVID-19. Moreover, participants identified strongly with the concept of MI and expressed the benefit and need for ongoing support to process the morally injurious experiences they had been exposed to in their work. As COVID-19 continues, there is an urgency to provide evidence-informed MI interventions which are tailored to address the unique needs of healthcare providers (HCPs) and the realities of COVID-19. Building on this feasibility and acceptability study, future research to explore and test AMPS-HCP seems warranted. Without this, healthcare systems risk that their most precious resource-their highly trained staff-will succumb to occupational injuries, mental illnesses, MI, or burnout. Fundamentally, when essential HCPs are doing well and are able to maintain health, safety, and security, all Canadians stand to benefit.",
