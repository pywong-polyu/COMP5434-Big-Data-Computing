He was a brilliant scientist in the area of chemistry of semiconductor materials for physical and chemical sensors. He spent his entire research career, which began in 1966, in the Division of Inorganic Chemistry of the Department of Chemistry, Moscow State University. During all his career, he kept generating new ideas, seeking new directions in research and the application of results in practice. He generously shared his knowledge with students and staff, resulting in the emergence of dozens of talented new researchers. The publications produced by the laboratory achieved international recognition.",

In 1961, as the winner of the School Chemistry Olympiad, he was awarded a grant for a trip to Moscow, which he used to enter the Moscow State University (MSU). The entire life of Prof. Alexander Gaskov was inextricably linked to the MSU, at which he has passed all the ranks from a Junior Researcher to the Chief Researcher and Professor of the Moscow State University. In 1966, he was awarded a Ph.D. in Chemistry. The beginning of his research activity was devoted to the development of materials for IR photodetectors and emitters based on single crystals and epitaxial heterostructures of lead and tin chalcogenides. In 1988, he successfully defended the thesis \"Directed synthesis of three-component solid solutions of lead and tin chalcogenides for optoelectronics\" and was awarded the Advanced Doctoral Degree in Chemistry, which is the highest academic award of the USSR/Russia. In 1993, he received the title of Professor in Inorganic Chemistry. In 2008, Prof. Gaskov was appointed to lead the newly established Laboratory of Chemistry and Physics of Semiconductor and Sensor Materials.",

            "text": "In the 1990s, Prof. Gaskov began exploring a new area of research of the synthesis of nanocrystalline semiconductors with high gas sensitivity. Comprehensive experimental studies of the wide-band semiconductor metal oxides allowed determining an innovative strategy for a direct synthesis of nanocrystalline materials for the chemical gas sensors [1] . For a large number of nanocomposites based on nanocrystalline semiconductor oxides, it was shown that their phase composition, the chemical composition of the surface of the nanocrystals, the nature of the mutual distribution of components, as well as the real structure are determined by the conditions of the synthesis. In due turn, these parameters determine the reactivity of materials and the mechanism of their interaction with the gas phase, the concentration and mobility of charge carriers, and, consequently, the sensor characteristics: sensitivity and selectivity. The revealed correlation between the catalytic activity and the sensor properties of nanocrystalline oxide materials allowed determining the criteria for choosing modifiers capable of increasing the selectivity of semiconductor gas sensors depending on the chemical properties of the target gas.",

This led to the development of new in situ and operando techniques for spectral studies of the reactivity of sensor materials in the interaction with gas phase. The trends in active site concentration and sensitivity to various analyte gases were compared across different nanocrystalline metal oxides by using the metal-oxygen bond energy as a descriptor parameter. It was proved that clusters and nanoparticles of noble metals (or noble metal oxides) with specific catalytic activity in the oxidation of certain gas molecules can significantly affect the sensing mechanism.",

These materials are of interest as emitters and photodetectors in the specified spectral regions. Prof. Gaskov initiated the use of quantum dots to promote the photoactivation of gas sensors, which made it possible to reduce the operating temperature to room temperature. Further research was carried-out on the atomically thin colloidal semiconductors complementing the two-dimensional semiconductor systems. In collaboration with other colleagues, a number of new effects were discovered [6] .",
