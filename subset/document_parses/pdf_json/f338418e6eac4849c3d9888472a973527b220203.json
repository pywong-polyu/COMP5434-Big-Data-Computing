This is done both for the general population and across key-groups. We analyze longitudinal data for 15,147 respondents from three waves of the Eurofound-\"Living, Working and COVID-19\" survey, covering the period April 2020-March 2021. MWB is measured by the WHO-5 index. Our evidence suggests that restriction on international travel, private gatherings, and contact tracing (workplace closures) were negatively (positively) associated with MWB by about, respectively, \u2212 0.63 [95% CI: \u2212 0.79 to \u2212 0.47], \u2212 0.24 [95% CI: \u2212 0.38 to \u2212 0.10], and \u2212 0.22 [95% CI: \u2212 0.36 to \u2212 0.08] (0.29 [95% CI: 0.11 to 0.48])",

However, these findings mask important group-differences. Women compared to men fared worse under stay-at-home requirements, internal movement restrictions, private gatherings restrictions, public events cancellation, school closures, and workplace closures. Those residing with children below 12, compared to those who do not, fared worse under public events cancellation, school closures and workplace closures. Conversely, those living with children 12-17, compared to those who do not, fared better under internal movement restrictions and public events cancelling. Western-Europeans vis-\u00e0-vis Eastern-Europeans fared better under NPIs limiting their mobility and easing their debts, whereas they fared worse under health-related NPIs. This study provides timely evidence of the rise in inequalities during the COVID-19 pandemic and offers strategies for mitigating them.",

By 5 January 2022, more than 90 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 1.5 million COVID-related deaths have been reported in the EU and the UK (ECDC, 2021) . Besides causing disease and death, COVID-19 has generated a 'parallel epidemic of poor mental health' (WHO, 2021) . The effects, here, could linger long after the pandemic has subsided. 'Mental illness is taking its toll, both on those who were already at risk, as well as on those who have never sought mental health support before', said Hans Kluge, director of WHO Europe, during a press-briefing on 28 January 2021 (WHO, 2021) . There is increasing evidence for a surge in mental health problems, greater vulnerability (Santomauro et al., 2021) and alarming implications for emotional and social functioning (Moreno et al., 2020) . As far as the USA is concerned, evidence shows that, during the pandemic, about four in 10 adults have reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder (Panchal et al., 2020) . A meta-analysis conducted by Bueno-Notivol et al. (2021) suggests a seven-fold increase in the prevalence of depression across six countries (three European and three Asian countries) as compared to a global depression prevalence in 2017 (Bueno-Notivol et al., 2021) . Unfortunately, this evidence does not pertain to a few selected countries or groups but appears to be generalizable both in terms of geographical and age distribution. Recent estimation shows that during the pandemic the cases of depression rose by 53 million globally and the cases of anxiety increased by 76 million corresponding to, respectively, a 28% and 26% rise above the pre-pandemic levels (Santomauro et al., 2021) . Moreover, anecdotal evidence from the UK suggests that the mental health referrals for children and young adults (children aged 18 or below) have doubled during the pandemic (The Guardian, 2021) .",

            "text": "Pandemic-related distress can depend on many factors including most importantly: fear of illness; economic hardship; and uncertainty about the real impact of the crisis (Moreno et al., 2020) . But it is also a result of social isolation and tensions within families: this a result of the NPIs that most governments have deployed to contain the pandemic (Moreno et al., 2020) . A large Italian study, covering 18,147 individuals, shows that NPIs implementation were associated with an increase in post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), anxiety, insomnia, depression and high stresswith women and younger individuals being the ones hardest hit (Rossi et al., 2020) . Similar results were found for Iran (Moghanibashi-Mansourieh, 2020) . Results for the general Danish population (S\u00f8nderskov et al., 2020) and for physicians in Oman (Badahdah et al., 2020) show the mental well-being (MWB), proxied by the five-item World Health Organization Well-Being (WHO-5) Index (for details refer to section 3.1 The Data), of women appear to be associated with a larger decrease, during COVID, than among men. Studies from China and Japan (Huang and Zhao, 2020; Ueda et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) show younger members of society suffering greater detrimental effects. Increases in mental health disorders independent of age and gender, were found in Portugal, India, and Spain (Moreira et al., 2020; Orgil\u00e9s et al., 2020; Ahmad et al., 2020) . The cross-sectional designs of these surveys are, however, prone to bias given potential seasonal effects and unobserved country-and individual-level confounding factors, such as individuals' initial mental health status. Also, many of these studies are based on convenience samples, such as healthcare workers. This begs the question of how well these samples represent the general population (Kumar and Nayar, 2021) .",

This paper answers these ambitious questions by exploiting a unique longitudinal survey covering over 15,000 individuals from 28 European countries. This survey was administered three times during the pandemic: 9 April-18 June 2020 (wave 1); 22 June -27 July 2020 (wave 2); and 11 February -31 March 2021 (wave 3). This coincides with the implementation and lifting of several NPIs. Individuals are asked to report their MWB measured by the WHO-5 index, besides other socio-demographic characteristics. This dataset was matched with data on the implementation and lifting of 13 NPIs to counteract the pandemic (Hale et al., 2020) . These NPIs can be classified into three main categories: containment and closure (stay-at home requirements; internal movement restrictions; international travel restrictions; private gathering restrictions; public event cancellations; school closures; workplace closures; public transport closures); health (testing policies; contact tracing; facial coverings); and economic support (income support; debt/contract relief).",

First, it is the first study, to date, to document the association of NPIs with MWB for a large set of countries longitudinally. Second, with longitudinal information we can reliably document how individuals' MWB changed with variations in implemented NPIs, while accounting for seasonal effects and country and individual-level confounding factors. This includes daily COVID-related cases and deaths and monthly unemployment rates by country. Third, as the survey covers individuals from diverse key-groups within the general population, our results provide evidence on who is at risk and who potentially suffers more. In particular, we provide results on how NPIs have affected key individual groups defined by: gender; education; age; family arrangements; working in a critical sector; and residing in the Western Europe or the former Eastern bloc. Observing the effects of NPIs on key-groups and examining their differences can inform decisions on future NPIs and on ways of mitigating their negative effects, especially for the most affected groups and for those who already have critically low MWB levels.",

Also, school closures (for those with children) and transport closure might reduce individuals' leisure time, and again decrease their MWB. Conversely, leisure time could increase for some through reduced commuter time in case of workplace closures. Moreover, for many people, the possibility of homeworking came rather suddenly. Increased flexibility might benefit the work-life and work-family balance, which have been found to be positively correlated with MWB (Costa et al., 2004) . In addition, workplaces, public places, and schools can trigger outbreaks, as they increase contact-numbers (Karatayev et al., 2020) . Therefore, workplace closures might reduce the fear of being infected, which in turn might improve individuals' MWB. Other measures such as face-covering (Saunders et al., 2021) and contact tracing (Kawakami et al., 2021) might be perceived as limiting freedom and interaction with others, therefore causing stress. Moreover, the previous literature shows that social support measures such as income replacement tend to have beneficial health effects if perceived as temporary (Stuckler and Basu, 2013) .",

While previous recessions have traditionally affected sectors that are male-dominated such as manufacturing, trade, and construction, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionally hit female-dominated sectors such as the service industries (Mongey and Weinberg, 2020) . Likewise, women might suffer more from school closures, as they are more likely to take care of children (Zamarro and Prados, 2021) . The female childcare-burden might, also, increase because of the implementation of school closures (Douglas et al., 2020; Hupkau and Petrongolo, 2020) , stay-at-home policies, restrictions on internal movement, and restrictions on private gatherings which might lead to a decrease in the opportunity for receiving childcare-provisions (Zamarro and Prados, 2021) . Thus, we would also expect a decrease in MWB for mothers with young children. Likewise, the higher vulnerability of older people including, of course, grandparents, might hinder informal childcare-provisions, which are highly correlated with female labour supply (Heckman, 1974; Baker et al., 2008) . However, since many countries have implemented workplace closures, this might lead both men and women to spend more time at home, and so greater relative balance in terms of childcare responsibility (Zamarro and Prados, 2021) . It should be clear from all this that the net result is a-priori unclear.",

We hypothesize that the MWB of individuals with childrenparticularly those with young childrenmight decrease due to school closures. Likewise, as mentioned above, the implementation of stay-at-home policies, restrictions on internal movement, and restrictions on private gatherings might decrease childcare-provisions, thus increasing the childcare burden, and ultimately decreasing the MWB of individuals with young children. In addition, workplace closures might not increase or even decrease their MWB, because childcare and household responsibilities interfere with their jobs (Douglas et al., 2020; Zamarro and Prados, 2021) .",

Given different historical experiences, the East and West of the continent have important cultural and political differences. Eastern-European countries were previously ruled by socialist parties, with stricter state control (Topp et al., 2015) . There are several reasons why individuals living in the former Eastern-Bloc might suffer less under NPIs than those from Western-European countries. First, they had experienced restrictive policies before and thus current NPIs might be felt to be relatively less intrusive compared to individuals in Western-Europe. Second, individuals from Eastern-Europe might have come up with coping strategies in the past that they were able to repurpose during the pandemic. Third, compliance with NPIs might be lower given lower levels of trust in government. One could also, of course, argue for a contrary effect. Individuals living in the former Eastern European-Bloc might perhaps have suffered more from the implementation of NPIs because of greater fear of state interventions. In the recent past, exposure to state-led restrictions had been extensive and is collectively remembered. Consequently, Eastern-Europeans might remain more sensitive to policy restrictions.",

The scale is a valid screening tool for depression and has been widely used in the literature including in clinical trials (Topp et al., 2015) . WHO-5 ranges from 0 to 25. Zero (25) represents the lowest (highest) level of MWB (Krieger et al., 2014) . Each individual is asked about the frequency of item-specific statements over the past two weeks. Each of them is rated on a scale from 0 (at no time) to 5 (all the time). The specific items are the following ones: 1) \"I feel cheerful and in good spirits\"; 2) \"I feel calm and relaxed\"; 3) \"I feel active and vigorous\"; 4) \"I wake up feeling fresh and rested\"; 5) \"My daily life is filled with things that interest me\". Levels below 13 indicate poor MWB and are cause for testing for depression (WHO, 1998) . The data come from the Eurofound \"Living, Working and COVID-19\" (LWC) survey (Eurofound, 2020) . The survey collects demographic and socio-economic characteristics for more than 150,000 individuals from the 27 EU-member states, the UK, and some other countries: the last group is, however, jointly coded as 'other countries' in the data set. Observations from these other countries (n = 557) have, thus, been removed, because it is impossible to match them with policy data. The LWC survey's target population includes individuals aged 18 years and older. The data was collected via e-survey. The recruitment of respondents was conducted with a snowballing system and through advertisements on social media platforms. At the time of writing, three survey-waves are available covering the periods: 9 April-18 June 2020 (wave 1); 22 June -27 July 2020 (wave 2); and 11 February -31 March 2021 (wave 3). There are 15,147 individuals in our final sample, all of whom have been observed at least twice (n = 36, 848): Fig. A. 1, in the Webappendix, documents our data selection procedure.",

The data are sourced from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) on a country and on a daily basis (Hale et al., 2020) . The dataset is further complemented by numbers of daily COVID-19 cases and deaths at country level. Since, in the LWC survey, individuals are interviewed on different days during data collection, data on both NPIs and COVID-19 exposure are matched with individual-level data based on the day they were interviewed. Table 1 provides further details on the policies analyzed here. Fig. 1a and b (c) illustrate the containment and closure (the economic support and health) NPIs over time. Colored-lines represent the daily average implementation-rate across the 28 European countries under examination (left axis). Colors allow us to distinguish between different policies. Light (medium, dark) grey histograms represent the total number of people interviewed per day in wave 1 (2, 3) (right axis). To contextualize the NPI-trends there are several key policy-events during the pandemic to bear in mind, such as: i) the first implementation of closure and containment NPIs in 11 Northern Italian provinces on 8 March 2020; ii) the WHO's declaration that COVID-19 was a 'global pandemic' on 11 March 2020; iii) the introduction by the European Commission, in cooperation with the President of the European Council, of a European road-map towards lifting Coronavirus containment measures on 14 April 2020; iv) the publication of guidelines for the implementation of COVID-19 NPIs by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on 24 September 2020; and v) the publishing of a framework for encouraging public trust and compliance with COVID-19 NPIs by the ECDC on 17 March 2021 (European Commission, 2020). A few points on NPI-implementations need to be mentioned here: all countries in our sample closed schools between 18 March and 13 May 2020; all countries except Denmark cancelled all public events between 29 March and 11 May 2020; all countries except Luxembourg, Romania, and Croatia closed workplaces through the whole observation period of wave 3 (11 February to 31 March 2021); and all countries except Luxembourg and Bulgaria restricted gatherings in the same period. The survey waves' timing, however, provides us with large variation in NPIs implemented and lifted.",

Again, international travel restrictions were most strongly connected with MWB in both groups, with \u2212 0.65 [95% CI: \u2212 0.82 to \u2212 0.48] points for those living with a partner and \u2212 0.58 [95% CI: \u2212 0.84 to \u2212 0.33] points for those who do not. Restrictions on private gatherings and contact tracing NPIs were also negatively associated with MWB in both groups [\u2212 0.23, 95% CI: \u2212 0.38 to \u2212 0.08; \u2212 0.26, 95% CI: \u2212 0.45 to \u2212 0.06; \u2212 0.16, 95% CI: \u2212 0.31 to \u2212 0.02; \u2212 0.35, 95% CI: \u2212 0.56 to \u2212 0.14]. In contrast, MWB for both those living with a partner and those who do not was positively associated with workplace closures [0.29, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.48; 0.29, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.53]. Differences between these groups were found only for public transport closures and income support NPIs. As for public transport closures, those not living with a partner were better off than those who do [\u2212 0.37, 95% CI: \u2212 0.67 to \u2212 0.07], their MWB being positively related to this NPI [0.40, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.68]. Conversely, those residing with a partner fared better under income support NPIs compared to those who do not [0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.54], whereas this NPI was not related to MWB within either of the groups. Moreover, school closures were negatively related to MWB only for those cohabiting with a partner [\u2212 0.18, 95% CI: \u2212 0.34 to \u2212 0.02]. In contrast, testing policies were positively associated with MWB for the same group [0.15, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.30].

The largest associations -in terms of magnitude -for those living with young children and those who do not relates, again, to international travel restrictions, with \u2212 0.77 [95% CI: \u2212 1.04 to \u2212 0.51] and \u2212 0.58 [95% CI: \u2212 0.76 to \u2212 0.41] points. Likewise, but smaller in magnitude, private gatherings were negatively related to MWB for both groups [\u2212 0.40, 95% CI: \u2212 0.62 to \u2212 0.18; \u2212 0.19, 95% CI: \u2212 0.34 to \u2212 0.04]. Differences between the two groups were only found for the cancellations of public events, school closures, and workplace closures, which all left those residing with children aged below 12 worse off than those who do not [\u2212 0.37, 95% CI: \u2212 0.64 to \u2212 0.10; \u2212 0.46, 95% CI -0.78 to \u2212 0.14; \u2212 0.46, 95% CI: \u2212 0.72 to \u2212 0.19]. Among these three NPIs, school closures were negatively associated with MWB only for those residing with children younger than 12 years old [\u2212 0.50, 95% CI: \u2212 0.79 to \u2212 0.21], while workplace closures were positively connected to MWB only for those who do not [0.40, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.59].

The average MWB in wave 3 (i.e. during spring 2021) across the whole sample dipped below 13 too.

First, the re-implementation of NPIs came not as unexpected and individuals might have developed coping strategies during the first implementation.

Indeed, when considering data from wave one and two, we find that stay-at-home requirements and internal movement restrictions but also international travel restrictions are not negatively related to MWB (see Webappendix B.2, Fig. B.2) . The negative association of international travel restrictions with MWB becomes evident only when including wave three (i.e. when adding observations from February and March 2021). We speculate that there are two potential mechanisms at play here. First, with the third wave, many countries introduced rather draconian restrictions on international travel, with compulsory quarantine even after negative test results. As such, many airlines companies stopped their international flights altogether. Second, these policies would necessarily impose nearly 100 percent compliance, and therefore might have felt harsher than other policies. There might also be an important effect in terms of timing. Individuals might suffer only slightly when there is a short period without travelling abroad (e.g. in the first part of the pandemic). Then, in summer 2020 travelling was not restricted. The restriction was reimposed, however, and lasted for a longer period of time during the second COVID-19 outbreak, which included the Christmas and Easter vacations. This, besides the obvious reason that more data increased the precision of our estimates, might have led to the negative association of international travel restrictions with individuals' MWB when including the third wave.",

First, as mentioned above, our study does not capture the pre-pandemic period, potentially underestimating the impact of the first NPI-implementations. Second, even controlling for daily COVID-related cases and deaths, monthly unemployment rates by country, and country fixed-effects, this might not fully account for the severity of the pandemic in a given place and as such for its direct effects, and for the economic channel through which the pandemic affected MWB. Third, the implementation of most NPIs should, if at least partially efficient, decrease the severity of the pandemic and as such decrease the need to implement other NPIs in the future. We can take this into account only partially by controlling for the present implementation of each NPI in each of our models. Fourth, we only observe NPIs at national level, which precludes any analysis of the within-country variation in those policies. Fifth, we cannot fully control for welfare state changes during the pandemic (e.g. universal credit in the UK), for example through the interaction between country and wave fixed effect, as we run into collinearity problems. In addition, our estimation strategy aims at capturing parts of such welfare state changes by the coefficients for the economic support NPIs (income support and debt/contract relief). Unfortunately, our models cannot perfectly disentangle changes in welfare support implemented as NPIs in the context of the pandemic from policies implemented for other reasons. Future research is thus urgently needed to fill this gap. Sixth, the data come from a web survey, which is not fully representative of the European population. In as far as the sample selection mechanism is correlated with the association of NPIs with MWB, there might be threats to external validity, i.e. the ability to generalize the findings for our sample to the general population. Seventh, only adults were included in the survey. The experiences of children whose MWB was perhaps dragged down by school closures were ignored. Here, too, future research is urgently needed. Eighth, we measure the economic impact of the pandemic through the monthly unemployment rate. However, one might argue that this is not the best indicator given the different policy and economic response to this kind of a public health shock. Although, we opted for this macro-economic measure for the following reasons. First, even if the unemployment rate, during the pandemic, is considerably lower than in other recession periods it is undeniable that the job market has been shocked by the pandemic and that rise in the unemployment rate has been exceptionally high for such a short period. Second, the unemployment rate appears to be the best indicator for macro-economic fluctuations. Tapia-Granados (Tapia Granados, 2008) compared several macro-economic indicators, such as GDP, unemployment rate and their impact on health and showed that the unemployment rate is the best proxy for macro-economic shocks. Ninth, our research cannot test the potential mechanisms underlying the associations of NPIs with MWB, partly because of the lack of data. Research is thus urgently needed to test which of the proposed mechanisms here, drawn from the literature are at play.",

            "text": "Despite these limitations, our results have important policyimplications. The substantial negative association of NPIs with MWB highlights the health-risk connected to these policies. The large negative relation of MWB to international travel restrictions calls for a reassessment of said restrictions and total border closures. More cooperation and more uniform COVID-19-related NPIs might decrease disparities in how the pandemic hits different European countries and reduce the need to restrict movements between them. In addition, the findings of no clear associations of MWB with stay-at-home requirements and internal movement restrictions for the general population might suggest that these policies were well-designed, offering individuals a sufficient level of mobility. On the other hand, they might hint at non-compliance and thus at potential improvements in policy design (e.g. offering exceptions where sensible), better communication to increase acceptance of NPIs, and more compliance-checks. The negative association of MWB with other NPIs, such as contact tracing, might in part stem from ineffective communication (Cho et al., 2020) . Here there might be room for improvement. Our results show that flexible working arrangement might have mitigated the mental health toll connected to the pandemic. Policy-makers should consequently consider incentivizing employers to allow for such working arrangements whenever deemed possible. In parallel, while restrictions on social gatherings were, indeed, necessary for curbing the spread of COVID-19, this likely have led to increased social isolation. Therefore, a possible policy implication for mitigating the mental health consequences of these restrictions might be to incentivize social-bubbles. These are already implemented in some countries and appear to be also an effective way to flatten the COVID-19 cases curve (Block et al., 2020) .",

For instance, women and individuals living with young children appear to have suffered more from stay-at-home requirements, restrictions on private gatherings, and school closures, while benefiting less from workplace closures. Drawing on the previous literature (Zamarro and Prados, 2021) , our results suggest that policies to reduce the burden of family and care responsibilities and the conflict with working remotely might help counteract these inequalities. This is particularly true when the burden increases through NPIs and even more so among women with young children. Moreover, finding that the MWB of women and individuals with young children was disproportionately related to NPIs exacerbates pre-existing inequalities in society. As such, our results are broadly in line with the COVID-19 Marmot Review in the UK. This argued that pre-existing inequalities have contributed to the unequal burden of the COVID-19 outbreak in Britain (Marmot et al., 2021) . Conversely, recent findings from the UK (Davillas and Jones, 2021) show that while psychological distress has increased among the population in general, socioeconomic inequalities remained stable. Understanding whether inequalities increased and, if so, in what way is fundamental for making an informed decision on how to proceed in the future. Mental health support will be necessary as poor MWB is a proxy for future poor mental health, and in some extreme cases, for suicide mortality.",

It is worth noting, that eight countries stand-out for their extremely low levels of mean MWB measured by the WHO-5 (fairly below 13-the depressionrisk threshold): Croatia, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Poland, and Romania. Looking at temporal variation, MWB increased from a mean of 12.96 [95% CI: 12.87 to 13.05] in the first wave to 13.63 [95% CI: 13.54 to 13.72] in the second wave, only to fall to a mean of 12.65 [95% CI: 12.55 to 12.75] in the third wave. On the one hand, this is presumably due to the lifting of restrictive policies following the lower numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths during the summer of 2020 and the re-implementation of NPIs in the winter of 2020/2021. On the other hand, it might be driven by seasonal patterns or other time-variant confounding factors.",
