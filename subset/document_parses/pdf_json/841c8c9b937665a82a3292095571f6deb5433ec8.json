Phase 1 clinical trials have shown Treg therapy to be safe and feasible in clinical practice. Here we describe a protocol for the TWO study, a phase 2b randomised control trial of Treg therapy in living donor kidney transplant recipients that will confirm safety and explore efficacy of this novel treatment strategy. Methods and analysis 60 patients will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to Treg therapy (TR001) or standard clinical care (control). Patients in the TR001 arm will receive an infusion of autologous polyclonal ex vivo expanded Tregs 5 days after transplantation instead of standard monoclonal antibody induction. Maintenance immunosuppression will be reduced over the course of the post-transplant period to low-dose tacrolimus monotherapy. Control participants will receive a standard basiliximab-based immunosuppression regimen with long-term tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppression. The primary endpoint is biopsy proven acute rejection over 18 months; secondary endpoints include immunosuppression burden, chronic graft dysfunction and drug-related complications. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been provided by the National Health Service Health Research Authority South Central-Oxford A Research Ethics Committee (reference 18/SC/0054). The study also received authorisation from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and is being run in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice, in collaboration with the registered trials unit Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit. Results from the TWO study will be published in peer-reviewed scientific/medical journals and presented at scientific/clinical symposia and congresses.",

[2] [3] [4] [5] Novel treatments such as regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy may improve long-term patient and graft outcomes both by reducing immune mediated graft dysfunction and facilitating reduction of immunosuppression to minimise the associated side effects. [6] [7] [8] Tregs are typically defined by expression of the cell surface markers being CD4 + CD25 + and their constitutive expression of the master transcription factor FOXP3. Extensive preclinical models have demonstrated their potency at suppressing rejection responses resulting in long-term allograft survival in the absence of pharmaceutical immunosuppression. [9] [10] [11] The first steps in translation of Treg therapy into the clinical setting of organ transplantation were taken by Todo et al who infused a Treg enriched cell product (less than 15% Treg) into liver transplant recipients. 12 Seven of 10 patients were able to completely withdraw immunosuppression although 3 patients experienced rejection episodes. The low purity of Tregs in the infused cell product and incidence of spontaneous tolerance in liver transplant recipients makes interpretation of these results uncertain. In kidney transplantation, we have recently demonstrated successful infusion of autologous polyclonal Tregs into 12 patients recruited as part of the ONE study consortium. 13 14 This phase 1 trial used dose escalation from 3\u00d710 6 to 10\u00d710 6 Tregs/kg bodyweight infused at day 5 post transplantation. Participants did not receive any monoclonal antibody induction therapy and were initially maintained on prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus. Immunosuppression was weaned over the course of the first year and 4 of 12 patients were ultimately successfully reduced to tacrolimus monotherapy. Four-year follow-up demonstrated no episodes of rejection compared with a 21.1% rejection rate in a retrospective control cohort receiving standard care. Furthermore, there was a suggestion of reduced incidence of opportunistic cytomegalovirus (CMV) and BKV infections. 13 Our ONE study colleagues in Berlin infused 11 patients with autologous polyclonal Tregs in a dose escalation manner at day 7 post transplant. 15 Eight patients were weaned successfully to tacrolimus monotherapy. Three of 11 patients experienced biopsy proven acute rejection, a rate similar to that seen in patients undergoing standard care. 15 These studies have demonstrated initial safety and feasibility of Treg therapy and provide justification for continuation into phase 2 trials. 14 The TWO study will build on our work performed as part of the ONE study consortium 14 to provide further evidence of safety and to explore efficacy of Treg therapy to facilitate immunosuppression reduction in living donor kidney transplant recipients.",

Due to concerns related to an increased risk of severe COVID-19 in the setting of alemtuzumab lymphodepletion, the trial protocol was modified to one using basiliximab-based induction immunosuppression. Basiliximab is a widely used induction immunosuppressive agent that binds to and blocks CD25, the alpha chain of the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, resulting in T cell suppression. Seven patients treated under the original protocol with alemtuzumab induction will be reported as a cohort demonstrating our experience of Treg administration in this context.

They will conduct a review of data at least annually at the discretion of the committee and will be informed of any serious adverse reactions (SARs) or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) as they occur by email notification.
