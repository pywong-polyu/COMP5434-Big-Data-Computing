Methods This multi-institutional review boards-approved retrospective study included 2720 chest CT scans (mean age, 58 years [range 18-100 years]) from Italian and Russian patients. Three board-certified radiologists from three countries assessed randomly selected subcohorts from each population and provided CO-RADS-based annotations. CT radiomic features were extracted from the selected subcohorts after preprocessing steps like lung lobe segmentation and automatic noise reduction. We compared three machine learning models, logistic regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF) for the automated CO-RADS classification. Model evaluation was carried out in two scenarios, first, training on a mixed multidemographic subcohort and testing on an independent hold-out dataset. In the second scenario, training was done on a single demography and externally validated on the other demography. Results The overall inter-observer agreement for the CO-RADS scoring between the radiologists was substantial (k = 0.80). Irrespective of the type of validation test scenario, suspected COVID-19 CT scans were identified with an accuracy of 84%. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) interpretation showed that the \"wavelet_(LH)_GLCM_Imc1\" feature had a positive impact on COVID prediction both with and without noise reduction. The application of noise reduction improved the overall performance between the classifiers for all types. Conclusion Using an automated model based on the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS), we achieved clinically acceptable performance in a multi-demographic setting. This approach can serve as a standardized tool for automated COVID-19 assessment.

Based on CT findings, several radiological societies have released standardized protocols for suspicion staging COVID-19 patients [3] [4] [5] . The COVID-19 Reporting and Data System or CO-RADS is a five-class suspicion classification scheme released by the Dutch Radiological Society (NVvR) [4] . CO-RADS includes discerning features related to unequivocal noninfectious origins, or community-acquired pneumonia from typical COVID-19 features on an unenhanced chest CT in a population with high incidence of COVID-19. This reporting system has shown high discriminatory power in triaging COVID-19 and provides an appropriate reporting language understandable by any radiologist [6, 7] . Therefore, using a standardized score such as CO-RADS is the most straightforward way of implementing an automated COVID-19 detection method [8] .",

For example, the use of non-generalizable data for model training (single demographic, public datasets with different acquisition or reconstruction protocols, unavailability of source DICOM, scans with image artifacts) has resulted in poor application of machine learning methodology. This limitation has led to reproducibility issues and biases in recent study designs [9] . This can further aggravate as data characteristics change based on demographics, immunity landscape and clinical practice shift between different pandemic stages.

Additionally, 26 new radiomic descriptors known as co-occurrence of local anisotropic gradient orientations (CoLlAGe) features were included to capture the lobe-level anisotropy and encapsulate CO-RADS [22] . Furthermore, to increase the feature diversity, features were extracted after applying filters such as Wavelet, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), Square, Square Root, Logarithmic, Exponential, Gradient, and Local Binary Pattern 2D (LBP2D) to the original image.

The scans with COVID-19 suspicion were selected from the Italian and Russian subcohorts retrospectively and annotated by experienced radiologists from different countries. In the first step, the datasets were processed using deep learning-based noise reduction (DLNR) and 3D segmentation masks were generated for each scan. Next, radiomic features were extracted and classified using ML algorithms. In the final step, statistical evaluation of the standard performance metrics and visualization of classspecific features were carried out to enhance the explainability of the models (RF) for automated CO-RADS classification. For comparison purposes, we evaluated the ML models under different combinations of CO-RADS operating points as described recently [8] . To account for the generalizability and reproducibility using multi-demographic datasets in the three machine learning models, we considered two scenarios for model evaluation. In the first scenario, we trained the classification models on a mixed dataset (Russian and Italian datasets) and tested on an internal hold-out dataset (Russian). In the second scenario, the classification models were trained either on the Russian or on the Italian dataset and externally validated on the other population. Since these scenarios were evaluated with and without noise reduction for classification, in total, we implemented six different settings to thoroughly evaluate all the possibilities of model training. The details of each setting including the data split are shown in Fig. 2 .",

To facilitate the translation of COVID-19 detection models into clinical practice, we followed a systematic approach to develop simple, generalizable, and reproducible automated COVID-19 detection models. In this study, (A) we successfully evaluated multi-site or public-private dataset scenarios and showed overall CO-RADS classification improvement by using noise reduction technique; (B) by choosing high-quality data from two clinical centers and heterogenous imaging protocols, we significantly reduced the population selection bias encountered in many recent studies as mentioned in a recent review [9] ; (C) the annotation was done by three experienced radiologists from different countries avoiding the annotation bias that can occur when using inexperienced radiologists or radiologists from the same site; (D) by using a standardized annotation protocol, we made our study easy to implement and compare; (E) the interpretation of radiomic signatures via SHAP enabled us to pinpoint the key features that influence classification; and (F) finally, by carrying out validation procedures resembling the guidelines listed in category 2b and 3 of the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement, we have enhanced the quality of experimental design, and demonstrated the usefulness of the prediction models by testing the cross-dataset domain shift between different institutions [34] . Regardless of the type of validation scenario, CT radiomic features facilitated the identification of CT scans with suspected COVID-19 with accuracy of 84% (138/164) in a twodimensional setting. Homayounieh et al, Fang et al, and Liu et al reported higher accuracies using a combined clinicalradiological radiomic signature, with their training based solely on a single demographic group, which may raise concerns of bias [30, 31, 35] . Lee et al used a deep learning algorithm and achieved accuracies similar to ours while investigating a heterogeneous population from more than eight countries [36] .",

This shows that the model trained on multi-demographics and tested on internal hold-out performs better when compared to the model trained on single demographic data [36] . There have been many automatic models to Fig. 3 The receiver operating curves of machine learning algorithms showing their ability to classify normal chest CT from other CO-RADS stages on the hold-out dataset (scenario 1). The performance of the classifiers increased after noise reduction differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 but a very few that have the capability to segregate comorbidities such as emphysema and lung cancer [2] . Notably, our multi-class classification model (RF) was able to identify other comorbidities with the highest accuracy of 85% (329/386). Prior works have shown that radiomics can be used to distinguish COVID-19 (CO-RADS 4) from other pneumonias (CO-RADS 3) on CT [37, 38] . We observed an average performance of 0.80 (AUC) in differentiating other community-acquired pneumonias (CO-RADS 3) in patients with suspected COVID-19, and in contrast to previous works, we used scans from patients with suspected COVID-19 without including scans from the general population. Studies have shown the importance of using whole lung CT radiomics for predicting outcome and disease severity of COVID-19 patients compared with subjective radiologist assessment [30, 31, 39, 40] . Although the direct comparison of the features obtained in these studies cannot be compared to our study, we observed that textural features dominated feature importance for COVID-19 patients or CO-RADS 5 (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, by employing noise reduction on non-contrast chest CTs, we were able to improve the performance for all the classifiers. This could be because apart from reducing noise and aiding dimensionality reduction of radiomic features, it helped in generalizing the scans acquired from different acquisition protocols (minimizing the variance).",

That is, by harnessing the power of radiomics combined with noise reduction, it is possible to predict the CO-RADS score from a non-contrast chest CT with a relatively high accuracy.
