The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively affected blood supply by affecting donor attendance. This study aimed to investigate blood supply and demand during the pandemic and demonstrate the positive impact of blood donation campaigns through mobile blood drives. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted based on data of the blood bank at Prince Muhammad bin Nasser Hospital (PMBNH) in southwestern Saudi Arabia. Data on the attendance of blood donors at PMBNH were retrieved and retrospectively reviewed to assess the impact of mobile blood drives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Blood supply and donor attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic dropped by 17.32 %. However, blood supply increased between March and May 2020 due to national blood donation campaigns conducted through mobile blood drives. The drop in blood supply after 3 months of mobile blood drives significantly decreased to 0.17 % (P < 0.01). This means the blood supply was increased as follows; (March 2020 = 32.67 %, April 2020 = 45.54 %, and May 2020 = 19.47 %). On the other hand, blood demand decreased by 12.83 %. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the significant impact of establishing blood donation campaigns through mobile blood drives. Our results showed that the strategy can contribute to sufficient blood units to patients during pandemics and emergencies.",

A study by Al-Riyami et al. (2021) on 12 national blood banks and 4 hospitals in the Middle East region showed a 10 %-75 % decrease in blood supply due to the closure of institutions and cancellations of mobile blood drives [22] . In China, donor attendance saw a 67 % drop in blood supply and collection. The study found that the recruitment of donors was largely conducted through text messaging by patients' family and friends, as well as by medical personnel [23] .",

After the first COVID-19 case in Saudi Arabia was reported on March 2, 2020, blood donation campaigns were immediately initiated on March 3, which brought the blood supply to 427 blood units by the end of March 2020. In April, the number increased to 515 blood units and reached a peak of 559 units in May 2020. Unfortunately, following the end of the campaign in June 2020, the number dropped to 333 units. This is similar to the situation in the USA, where approximately 2,700 mobile blood drives were cancelled, resulting in a significant drop in the number of donations by 86,000 donations [24] . Interestingly, mobile blood drives accounted for more than 80 % of the total blood donations.",
