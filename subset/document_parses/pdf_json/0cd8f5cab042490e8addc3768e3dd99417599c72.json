Due to their desire for new and natural products coupled with changes in lifestyle, consumers are looking for food products that have been less processed but possess longer shelf life and maintain nutritional and sensorial proprieties during storage. These requirements represent real challenges when dealing with highly perishable food products, such as fruits and vegetables. Thus, in recent years, edible coatings have been intensively developed and studied because of their capacity to improve the quality, shelf life, safety, and functionality of the treated products. Edible coatings can be applied through different techniques, like dipping, spraying, or coating, in order to control moisture transfer, gas exchange, or oxidative processes. Furthermore, some functional ingredients can be incorporated into an edible matrix and applied on the surface of foods, thus enhancing safety or even nutritional and sensory attributes. In the case of coated fruits and vegetables, their quality parameters, such as color, firmness, microbial load, decay ratio, weight loss, sensorial attributes, and nutritional parameters, which are very specific to the type of products and their storage conditions, should be carefully monitored. This review attempts to summarize recent studies of different edible coatings (polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and composites) as carriers of functional ingredients (antimicrobials, texture enhancers, and nutraceuticals) applied on different minimally processed fruits and vegetables, highlighting the coating ingredients, the application methods and the effects on food shelf life and quality.",

Understanding how consumers form and perceive attitudes in relation to new technologies and products is important for food chain innovation, since consumer acceptance is crucial to the development of successful food products [1, 15] . Several studies regarding consumer acceptance towards novel processing technologies and techniques have been made, i.e., nanotechnology [16] , radio frequency [6] food irradiation [17] , and edible films and coatings [18, 19] . This review focuses on the latest research on edible formulation applied on different minimally processed fruits and vegetables, highlighting the technological aspects such as coating ingredients and formulation, application methods, and the effect on food shelf life and quality, including nutritional quality. Edible films and coatings, their composition, and methods of application as well as the functional additives in edible coatings for minimally processed fruits and vegetables are presented.",

In order for the articles to be included, they were screened for their data and presentation to be correct and clearly described. Selected articles were those that were published after 2010, and that referred only to the coatings of fruits and vegetables. In addition, articles were excluded if their data and results did not take into consideration the effect on the nutritional values of the coated samples and if the coating methods, treated food products, or the effects of the treatments were not clearly stated. All the selected articles presented a shelf life assessment. The content analysis of the reviewed studies was aimed at defining the scope of analysis, evaluating the content, and, in the end, classifying the content in several directions such as: highlighting the importance of functional coatings and edible coatings; highlighting the food product groups which have been treated with functional coatings or edible films and the results of these treatments; and highlighting the film or coating matrix and the functional compound (antioxidants, antimicrobials, emulsifiers, anti-browning agents, flavoring agents, colorants, and probiotics). The literature search included research articles and reviews on the following topics: \"application of food coatings\", \"functional coatings\", \"edible films\", \"edible coatings for fruit preservation\", and \"fruit and vegetable edible coatings\". A total of 87 research articles published in the last decade were selected and synthetized from publisher databases. The vast majority of the research studies that related to functional coatings and edible films presented studies on fresh and minimally processed fruits and less on vegetable products, which are coated with different formulations of functional coatings or edible films. The studies used in this review were screened by two separate reviewers and each made a report containing the most important facts found in the article. No automated tools were used in the process.",

The flexibility and permeability of edible coatings is conferred by the use of plasticizers, tensile strength by the use of solvents, and water vapor permeability prevention is obtained with the help of resins [10, 22] . Yifan et al. (2020) [23] developed self-healing coatings based on sodium alginate (SA) and l-menthol-beta-cyclodextrin-graft-chitosan for the improvement of the postharvest quality of fruits and vegetables. The developed materials presented good characteristics, showing that the addition of l-menthol led to dense, smooth, and transparent coatings with better mechanical and self-healing characteristics. Fu et al. (2021) [24] developed edible films based on waste fish scale-derived gelatin, chitosan, and CaCO 3 nanoparticles. The edible films presented important characteristics such as UV absorption, antimicrobial activity, great mechanical properties, and non-toxicity. Furthermore, the developed edible films were hydrophilic, which means that they can be easily removed from fruit by washing. Fan et al. (2021) [25] developed an edible composite film (PAX) based on pectin, sodium alginate (SA), and xanthan gum (XG). The film showed important properties, such as a tensile strength which could reach a maximum value of 29.65 MPa at a concentration of 4 g/L XG, 18 g/L glycerol, and 20 g/L CaCl 2 . In addition, the elongation at break was of 19.02% and the water vapor transmission rate was of 18.12 \u00d7 10 \u221211 g/(m 2 \u00b7s\u00b7pa). Active films based on chitosan and gum arabic also containing cinnamon essential oil were developed by Xu et al. (2019) [26] . The analysis performed on the developed films showed that there were electrostatic interactions between chitosan and gum arabic, forming an entangled structure. In addition, the addition of gum arabic enhanced the water barrier properties and the antioxidant effectiveness of films.",

Chitosan, functionalized chitosan, and chitosan nano-formulations are excellent candidates for creating edible coating for fruit products such as cut pineapple [31] , cut cherry tomatoes [32] , apricots [33] , peaches [34] , blueberries [35] , etc. Furthermore, a study made by Sun et al. (2021) [36] compared the shelf life effect of three bio-based nanomaterial coatings from chitin, cellulose, and chitosan that were applied on kiwi, avocado, strawberry, banana, nectarine, and apricot. Both wood nanocrystals as well as chitosan nanofibers presented the best antifungal activity. Moreover, color changes and weight loss of the coated strawberries decreased by half compared to the control samples. Jongsri et al. (2016) [21] studied the effect of coating 'Nam Dok Mai' mango fruits (a tropical fruit from the drupe family), a highly perishable fruit after harvesting, with different chitosan solutions (high molecular weight, medium molecular weight, and low molecular weight). The samples were stored for 16 days at a room temperature of 25 \u2022 C. The results showed that the high molecular weight chitosan-based coating led to a delayed ripening of the treated samples, which presented the highest value of titratable acidity, of fruit firmness, and also of the reduction in weight loss, ethylene production, and respiration rate. In addition, the study showed that the mango fruits coated with chitosan with high molecular weight managed to maintain their ascorbic acid and DPPH value over the storage period. It can be stated that the coated mango samples had a better quality compared to the control and the other samples, and their shelf life was significantly improved.",

The functionalized structure of chitosan was analyzed and tested as an edible coating in the case of fresh-cut melon samples. The results of the study showed that the tested films produced well-adhered coatings that managed to increase the fresh-cut melon quality and shelf life without altering the sensorial attributes. In order to test the antibacterial effect, mandarin juice was added to the chitosan and vanillin and trans-cinnamaldehyde mixture, and the results showed a 6 log CFU/mL microbial count reduction, which clearly demonstrates this effect.",

The nanolaminate coating was made from polyelectrolyte solutions of alginate and chitosan that had been treated with ethanol extracts of Flourensia cernua. The samples were coated with this material and several parameters were tested: physicochemical analyses, ethylene production, and microbial growth. The treated samples presented weight loss and microbial growth reduction. In addition, ethylene production was slower, and the tomato firmness and color were better preserved. This shows that the nanolaminate edible coatings could improve the shelf life of tomato samples. Lara et al.

In order to have multiple variants, the study tested several variants of edible coating solutions, consisting in three concentrations of xanthan gum solutions (0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5%). In all of the above solutions 2% (w/w) citric acid was added as an anti-browning agent and 1% (w/w) glycerol as a plasticizer. Fresh-cut lotus roots were then sprayed with these solutions in a 5 mm thick layer for 20 s and stored at a temperature of 5 \u2022 C for 16 days in polyethylene bags. Morphology, pH, color, and microbiological determinations were performed, and it was observed that the treated samples had a significant reduction in the total color changes compared to control samples which were not sprayed. In addition, the enzymatic browning of fresh-cut lotus root during storage was decreased. A lower microbial count was recorded to the treated samples compared to non-coated fresh-cut lotus root samples in terms of Bacillus subtilis growth rate in the first 24 h of storage.",

            "text": "In the study performed by Mendy et al. (2019) [41] papaya fruits (large berry) were coated with aloe vera-based gel, and the shelf life and quality were assessed in order to outline the edible coatings' effects. The coated papaya samples were stored for 15 days and different analyses such as higher soluble solid concentration-SSC, pH, titratable acidity-TA, ascorbic acid-AA, total carotenoids content, total phenolic content-TPC, total flavonoids content-TFC, and DPPH scavenging activity were performed at 3 days each. At 50% gel concentration, the papaya samples coated with two types of edible coatings exhibited a diminished microbial growth rate after 15 days. As for the quality parameters, the coated samples presented a higher soluble solid concentration, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, total carotenoids content, total phenolic content, and total flavonoids content compared to the uncoated samples. It can be stated after the analysis of these results that the shelf life of the coated papaya samples was improved by 25%. Moreover, Passafiume et al. (2020) [74] studied the effect of three edible coatings based on aloe vera gel, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and lemon essential oil-based composite coating on prolonging the shelf life and quality of fresh-cut Hayward kiwis. The treated samples were stored for 10 days at refrigeration temperatures and a series of microbiological, chemical, and sensory tests were performed at days 2, 4, 7, and 10. The edible coatings were applied by spraying method. The results showed that the coated samples presented reduced weight loss and browning and maintained higher firmness, brightness, greenness, and soluble solid contents (SSC). Aloe vera gel and aloe vera gel + lemon essential oil reduced the microbial load compared to the control samples. Khorram et al. (2017) [75] studied the effect of edible coatings, obtained from gelatin (5, 6, and 7%), Persian gum (3.5, 4, and 4.5%) and 9, 10, and 11% shellac, on 'Valencia' oranges (which are considered a hesperidium, a kind of modified berry [76] ) during storage. The composition of the edible samples was established based on the properties of the selected ingredients, which are easy to dissolve and inexpensive. The coated oranges were then stored for 60 days at a refrigeration temperature of 5 \u2022 C. Sample evaluation was made every 20 days and images of the coated surfaces were obtained by scanning electron microscopy. The coated samples were compared with uncoated ones or with waxcoated fruits. In order to test the capabilities of the edible coatings obtained, physiological and physicochemical analyses were performed: total phenolic content, total antioxidant capacity, titratable acidity, pH, ascorbic acid content, total soluble solids, respiration rate, weight loss, fruit firmness, and total soluble solids. The titratable acidity and acid content decreased as the storage time was increased, but the pH, total phenolic content, and total antioxidant capacity values increased. In all coated samples, a glossiness effect was observed. However, fruit coated by gelatin and Persian gum coatings, showed visible cracks with increasing storage time. From all edible coating variants, the shellac was the best, because it formed a non-sticky and odorless coating with a high glossy aspect through the entire tested storage period.",

            "text": "In addition to increased perishability of strawberries due to a delicate tissue and a high sugar content, the transport conditions of these berries is an important additional factor in the reduction of their shelf life. A much-focused study on this issue was performed by Dhital et al. (2017) [49] trying to find a protective solution by using the edible coating of 'Chandler' strawberries subjected to simulated vibrations of local transportation. In this sense, six types of coatings were developed and evaluated based on the quality of coated berries. The coatings were based on incorporation of different proportions of curcumin and limonene, as natural antimicrobials, and their liposomes in methyl cellulose. The first conclusion was that the protection of the vibrated samples, which had a lower shelf life than non-vibrated samples, indicates a need for a more robust coating in order to remain intact during road vibrations. Regarding the shelf life and quality of the treated samples, it was clearly demonstrated that limonene liposomes showed significantly lower fungal growth compared to the control on the 14th day of storage and the titratable acidity and total phenolic contents were also higher in limonene-coated strawberries compared to other coatings. Future research is planned to improve integrity of the coatings, testing liposome coatings of limonene with different particle size. Guerreiro et al. (2015) [77] , performed a complex study focused on the testing of different sodium alginate (AL)-based edible coatings, enriched with essential oils (Eugenol and Citral) as antimicrobial compounds, for maintaining postharvest quality and prolonging storage life of Arbutus unedo fresh fruit (red berry). The quality monitoring (through physicochemical and biochemical analyses-color, firmness, weight loss, antioxidant capacity, microbial growth, and taste panels) of the coated arbutus fruits, showed good preservation in the case of using the coatings with formulation of AL 1% + Eug 0.20% and AL 1% + Cit 0.15% + Eug 0.10%. In a study performed by Oyom et al. (2022) [78] an edible coating formulation containing modified starch from sweet potatoes and cumin essential oil was applied on pear samples (Pyrus bretchneideri Rehd.). The coating method used in the tests was dipping the sanitized and disinfected samples into the coating formulations, and the coated samples were stored for 28 days at a temperature of 25 \u2022 C. The coating treatment managed to suppress the respiration rate and delay the weight loss and maintained flesh firmness after 21 days, due to the adhesiveness of the modified starch coating which formed a thin layer on the pear and maintained the pericarp and freshness. The antibacterial and antibiofilm effect of newly developed edible nano-emulsion coatings containing sodium alginate and essential oil extracted from sweet orange was tested in a study performed by Das et al. (2020) [79] . Two pathogenic bacterial strains were selected in this study, Salmonella and Listeria. Beside the antibacterial and antibiofilm effect, the quality properties of tomato samples were analyzed. The samples were stored at a temperature of 22 \u00b1 2 \u2022 C, over a 15-day storage period. The samples coated with the edible nano-emulsion coatings did not show bacterial growth of the two tested microorganisms. In terms of the quality characteristics of the coated tomato samples, it was shown that the firmness was significantly enhanced, up to 33%, and a decrease in weight loss up to 3-fold lower than uncoated samples.",

Various concentrations of CaCl 2 solutions were mixed with sodium alginate in order to find the best formulation by determining the barrier and mechanical proprieties of the films as well as performing physiochemical analyses of the coated apple samples. The addition of the CaCl 2 solutions decreased water vapor permeability and oxygen permeability compared to the alginate films. As for the physiochemical results, the coated samples presented a significantly reduced respiration rate and weight loss as well as a delayed chilling injury.

The latest developments in this field are represented by the extensive use of chitosan or alginate as the main component of the edible coatings to which different functional ingredients are added, like EOs, nano-forms, antioxidants extracts, and probiotics. The role of these functional ingredients is not limited to the basic function of the protective layer, which assures extending shelf life, but also provide functional properties, such as antioxidant capacity, probiotic properties, better sensory attributes, and higher vitamin C content, having a positive impact on consumers. A better understanding of the mechanism of the edible functional coatings and their promotion among consumers could help to extend their application in fruit and vegetable preservation. Moreover, the edible coatings and film can become a very promising method that could be applied for delivering bioactive compounds in order to increase bioavailability. Despite the various and clear research in this field and due to very specific coating technology applied for different fruit and/or vegetables, with different proposed aims (starting from improving shelf life to preserving a high nutritional value or increasing certain nutritional features of the products) the subject is of permanent topicality and experiments are absolutely necessary starting from the known data.
