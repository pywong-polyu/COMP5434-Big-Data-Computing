Further, for the black hole spacetime, near horizon symmetry has been observed to play possible role in understanding the underlying degrees of freedom for thermodynamic behaviour of horizon. Following the similar idea, in this paper, we analyzed the symmetry and associated algebra near a timelike surface which is situated at any arbitrary radial position and is embedded in black hole spacetime. In this paper we considered both Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole spacetimes. The families of hypersurfaces with constant radial coordinate (outside the horizon) in these spacetimes is timelike in nature and divide the space into two distinct regions. The symmetry algebra turned out to be reminiscent of Bondi-Metzner-Sach (BMS) symmetry, found in the asymptotic null infinity.",

            "text": "Symmetries play fundamental role in the development of the fundamental laws of nature. Thanks to the celebrated Noether's theorem, which says that for every continuous global symmetry of a physical system, there exits associated conserved charges. These global symmetries are typically represented by the finite-dimensional group of transformation and associated Lie algebra. In the context of gravitational theory, it is the diffeomorphism symmetry which plays fundamental role. The associated Noether charges [1, 2] are believed to be encoded into the thermodynamics properties of gravity [4] [5] [6] . One of the most striking object of gravity is black hole which is manifestly endowed with thermodynamics properties specially attributed to the horizon [1, 2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Horizon is a null hyper-surface located at a special point in radial coordinate of the black hole spacetime. Out of infinite dimensional diffeomorphism symmetry, it has been shown to exist a special class called asymptotic symmetry which forms a closed Virasoro algebra [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] (an extensive list of works in this direction can be obtained from reference list of [15] ). An important thermodynamic quantity namely entropy of the horizon can be expressed in terms of the central charge of this algebra by using well known Cardy formula [23] . This approach was first formulated in the seminal work by Brown and Henneaux for the (1+2) dimensional gravity theory [24] . Later it was proved that the entropy and various other thermodynamic quantities can be attributed to any generic null surface [22, [25] [26] [27] .",

It has been shown that these low energy scattering phenomena can be beautifully described by aforementioned non-trivial group of infinite-dimensional symmetries first appeared in the pioneering works by Bondi, van der Berg, Metzner and Sachs (BMS) [34] - [39] . In these works, the attempt was to figure out the isometries of asymptotically flat spacetime at null infinity. To their surprise the symmetry group turned out to be an infinite dimensional one with Poincar\u00e9 as sub group. Apart from usual Poincar\u00e9 transformation, the additional infinite number of generators of symmetry transformation are coined as \"supertranslations\". The crucial point in all these discussion was related to the boundary conditions. Significant efforts have been devoted in specifying the appropriate set of boundary conditions on the gravitational field configuration. One of the popular procedure is to identify the fall off behavior of the background metric components expressed in Bondi-Sachs coordinates at null infinity. The basic criterion of identifying those boundary conditions was that under arbitrary diffeomorphism the form of the background metric must be preserved at its asymptotic null boundaries. Subsequently analogous asymptotic symmetry analysis has been explored near another null surface namely, horizon of black hole [40] - [43] . Further analysis have been done near both extremal and non-extremal null surfaces in a more general setting which include Lanczos-Lovelock (LL) gravity, non-gravitational fields such as U(1) electromagnetism [44] . Also, the symmetry parameters are shown to behave as Goldstone modes which leads to thermal nature of the horizon at the semi-classical level [45] .",

These coordinate system is suitable to explain physical quantities on an (p + 1)-dimensional hypersuface S, embedded in the (p + 2)-dimensional manifold N . For the present discussion we consider sub-manifold S as a timelike hypersurface. One can choose a unique vector N a in the tangent space of the manifold N in such a way that the vector will be orthogonal to all the vectors in the tangent space of the submanifold S. So for S, we can normalize N a such that N a N a = 1; i.e. N a is spacelike corresponding to signature (\u2212, +, +, +) of the metric. Thus the vector N a is unit normal to S. Now we can construct unique geodesic with tangent N a emanating from an arbitrary point P on the aforesaid hypersurface. So the geodesic must pass through another arbitrary point Q situated in the small neighbourhood of the hypersurface S. In this setup one defines a coordinate system in the form (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , \u03c1), among them (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) denote the coordinates of the point P on the surface. On the other hand fourth coordinate \u03c1 labels the point Q which lies on the geodesic, very near to S. Here \u03c1 is a spacelike coordinate while any one of (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) is timelike and rest are spacelike coordinates. So the GNC system (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , \u03c1) will be well defined in the small neighbourhood of the point P in such a way that the congruence of spacelike geodesics will be orthogonal to the hypersurface. The spacetime metric in the neighbourhood of the surface can be expressed in the following form (more details in this regard can be found in [54] ):",

Before proceeding towards computing this quantity associated with the symmetries near our time like surface discussed above, let us make few comments on the meaning of Q when assigned on the cross-section of this surface. It is well known that the Noether current J a associated with the diffeomorphism symmetry x a \u2192 x a + \u03b6 a for Einstein-Hilbert action satisfies covariant conservation equation for arbitrary \u03b6 a (for instance, see [56] and Appendix B of [19] ). Here \u03b6 a , in principle, is completely arbitrary. Hence the conserved charge can naturally be Q t = V d\u03a3 a J a , where d\u03a3 a is the volume element on a t = constant surface. Now J a can be expressed as J a = \u2207 b J ab where J ab is anti-symmetric. Using Stokes' theorem charge Q t is transformed into following closed surface integral Q t = \u2202V d\u03a3 ab J ab , where d\u03a3 ab is a surface element of the closed boundary \u2202V which encloses the volume V. Depending upon the system under study boundary may contains multiple disconnected closed surfaces. For instance black hole spacetime has two natural set of boundaries at the two dimensional cross-section of the null infinity and of the horizon. If the boundary surfaces are disconnected, one can compute the charge for every individual surface and understand their properties. However, one should keep in mind that individual boundary charge may not be conserved in general unless one takes into account all the surface contributions.",

            "text": "In the present discussion we have considered a t = constant slice of r = r c timelike hyper surface which act as a two dimensional boundary between horizon and infinity. Here Q t can be written as Q t = Q t (r = r H )+Q t (r = r c , \u2212N a ) + Q t (r = r c , N a )+Q t (r \u2192 \u221e) , where the expression in the first part corresponds to region within horizon and r c while the second part is connected to region between r c to \u221e. It is expected that Q t (r = r c , \u2212N a ) and Q t (r = r c , N a ) must cancel each other, because the normal on r = r c surface are same but in opposite direction with respect to two regions. However, the value of individual terms may be non-vanishing. This suggests that in principle one can define a unique quantity Q \u223c d\u03a3 ab J ab on any t = r = constant two dimensional cross-section which can be thought of part of the conserved charge Q t if the observer is confined in either one side of the surface. In this sense Q alone should not be a conserved quantity. However, we use the usual nomenclature as \"charge\" here in a very weak sense as this part is not alone conserved. This charge can be interpreted as the induced charge on an arbitrary time like hypersurface associated with a special class of diffeomorphism under study. Now natural question arises, what symmetry does this charge should correspond to? For any arbitrary diffeomorphism, as we stated earlier, the charge Eq. (21) can be defined in principal on any arbitrary surface. This is defined for any arbitrary diffeomorphism. Therefore the choice of \u03b6 a (the gauge choice) from a particular condition will construct a charge which is conserved in the sense of our previous discussion. Even if one finds this diffeomorphism from a local (gauge) symmetry of metric, the total corresponding charge which is sum of contributions from different parts of the boundary, still conserved as this is by construction conserved for any arbitrary diffeomorphism. In fact given a specific form of the diffeomorphism associated with the underlying symmetry the formula yields the well known charges near the horizon or null-infinity. This procedure has been shown to be yielded horizon entropy in the context of Virasoro algebra (e.g. see [13] [14] [15] [16] ). Note that even if the conserved charge here is due to gauge symmetry, its value on a part of the boundary may be non-vanishing. However, in this paper, what would be the physical characteristics and how to compute the charge on the arbitrary time like surface are the questions we have asked and explored in detail. Hence the charges are calculated for a class of diffeomorphism symmetries which which preserves the form of the metric near the timelike surface under study. Once Q is defined as above, on any two dimensional cross-section (like, hypersurface defined by both t = and r = are constants), one can compute the associated diffeomorphism symmetry transformation which keeps the metric structure near the surface under study unchanged, following the usual procedure. One usually computes \u03b6 a from a physically motivated boundary conditions on metric coefficients g ab as just mentioned above. Using this subset of diffeomorphisms, constraint by certain physical boundary conditions on g ab , one usually calculates Q. This well known procedure has been used in the case of horizon as well as asymptotic infinity structure preserving symmetries. In both cases it has been observed that structure of the metric remains unchanged, but the black hole param-eters, such as mass, angular momentum can be modified.",

For Kerr black hole background, we will see this does not hold true. Note that it depends on a particular t = constant slice of our preferred hypersurface r = r c . In this case Q can have leakage on this spacelike slice if one moves with time. But it may be noted that similar leakage in Q can be found on the same t = constant slice of the actual physical boundaries (at r \u2192 \u221e and horizon) and also in other side of r c surface. It may happen that all these leakages are such that the collective quantity vanishes. This feature is not new as it happens for charges on the horizon for general diffeomophism vector \u03b6 a (for example, see Eq. (13) of [16] ; also see [21] ). The reason is obvious. As mentioned earlier, the covariantly conserved Noether current J a and consequently the anti-symmetric potential J ab are defined for any arbitrary \u03b6 a , even it can be time dependent.

Hence, the quantity Q may be interpreted as the local heat content on the hypersurface at a fixed time if one identifies the surface entropy S c \u221d A c and local temperature T c \u221d g(r c ). The temperature is identified as the Unruh temperature which is directly connected with the local gravitational acceleration g(r c ). Hence, with respect to the local observer hovering near the r = r c hypersurface will see the surface as thermal object with the aforementioned Unruh temperature T c . The same conclusion can also be obtained though an interesting perspective considering the Tolman relation [57] - [59] , which gives rise to temperature gradient of a thermodynamic equilibrium system in the gravitational field. The relation entails T (r) g ab k a k b = T (r) \u2212f 1 (r) = T 0 , where k a = (1, 0, 0, 0) is the timelike Killing vector of the background under consideration and T (r) is called Tolman temperature.

In the present analysis the obtained bracket algebra of the asymptotic symmetry group near the timelike surface has similarities with those of the black hole horizon and null infinity in Schwarzschild background but for kerr spacetime there is significant difference between the algebra near the timelke surface and those near actual physical boundaries of spacetime. This is because in Schwarzschld spacetime the symmetry generator defined on the timelike surface turns out to be dependent only on time, but the bracket algebra of the 'supertranslation' generator is similar to that obtained for a generic null surface . Whereas for Kerr case 'superrotation' parameter R(t, x) is time dependent, therefore notable differences has generated for the [R(t, x), F (t, x)] commutator compared to null boundaries. The associated charges have also been computed and shown to follow the same algebra as differomorphism transformation vectors.
