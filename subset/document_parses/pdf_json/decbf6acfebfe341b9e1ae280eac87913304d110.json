            "text": "The emergence of COVID-19 and the importance of behaviour change to limit its spread created an urgent need to apply behavioural science to public health. Knowledge mobilisation, the processes whereby research leads to useful findings that are implemented to affect positive outcomes, is a goal for researchers, policy makers and practitioners alike. This study aimed to explores the experience of using behavioural science in public health during COVID-19, to discover barriers and facilitators and whether the rapidly changing context of COVID-19 influenced knowledge mobilisation. Methods: We conducted a semi-structured interview study, with ten behavioural scientists and seven public health professionals in England, Scotland, Wales, The Netherlands and Canada. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis. Results: We report three key themes and 10 sub-themes: 1.Challenges and facilitators of translation of behavioural science into public health (Methods and frameworks supported translation, Lack of supportive infrastructure, Conviction and sourcing of evidence and Embracing behavioural science) 2. The unique context of translation (Rapid change in context, the multi-disciplinary team and the emotional toll). 3. Recommendations to support future behavioural science translation (Embedding experts into teams, Importance of a collaborative network and showcasing the role of behavioural science). Discussion: Barriers and facilitators included factors related to relationships between people, such as networks and teams; the expertise of individual people; and those related to materials, such as the use of frameworks and an overwhelming amount of evidence and literature. Conclusion: People and frameworks were seen as important in facilitating behavioural science in practice. Future research could explore how different frameworks are used. We recommend a stepped competency framework for behavioural science in public health and more focus on nurturing networks to facilitate knowledge mobilisation in future emergencies.",

            "text": "Public health bodies aim to protect, maintain, and improve health, including promoting health and reducing health inequalities (Cabaj et al., 2019) . Almost all public health strategies involve encouraging behaviour change. In high-income countries, much of this has been focused on the reduction of risk for non-communicable diseases, such as smoking cessation, reduction in alcohol use, increasing physical activity and improving diet (Department of Health and Social Care, 2020) . This is in addition to health protection behaviours, such as attending screening appointments, receiving vaccines and immunisations. The COVID-19 pandemic has raised novel challenges in applying behaviour change related to the infection, prevention, and control of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with limited knowledge of its effect and more recently to the uptake of vaccines. All of which has been required at speed and in the context of changing guidance, changing data and changing scientific evidence (Betsch, 2020; Chater et al., 2021; West et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Public health attempts to change behaviour have traditionally been through informing and educating (Michie et al., 2011) . Behavioural science is an umbrella term that covers disciplines that deal with human actions, including psychology, sociology, epidemiology, biology, anthropology, economics, and political science (Public Health England, 2018) . The degree of the application of behavioural science knowledge and skills in public health has been sub-optimal (McManus et al., 2018; Woolf et al., 2015) . Common limitations in public health campaigns include the assumption that knowledge and information are the main drivers of behaviour, that people act rationally, and that changing behaviour is just 'common sense' (Kelly & Barker, 2016; Michie et al., 2011) . There is a growing recognition that basing public health interventions on best-evidence behavioural science theories, including those from psychology, behavioural economics, sociology and anthropology (Bonell et al., 2020; McManus et al., 2018; Skivington et al., 2021) methods, and high quality, appropriately evaluated evidence, is likely to make them more effective (Glanz & Bishop, 2010) . Common examples of public health initiatives informed by behavioural science include increasing the COVID 19 vaccine uptake (Van Bavel et al., 2020) , tackling antimicrobial resistance by improving prescribing behaviours (Lorencatto et al., 2018) and smoking cessation campaigns (Brown et al., 2014) .",

This finding links strongly with sociological theories such as Actor-Network Theory, which explains how clusters of actors create meaningful networks (Law, 1992) . There was a sense of being unprepared for the novel situation that the pandemic posed, and a feeling of being overwhelmed with information from multiple sources, ranging from social media to scientific literature. Participants reported making recommendations early in the pandemic to use frameworks, and to ensure clarity of information, that comes from a credible source, to reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed (Chater et al., 2020) . While those interviewed demonstrated experience in, and the value of, using behavioural science frameworks, they recognised that professionals might require more support to implement behavioural science in practice.

            "text": "To conclude, we found support for the importance of people and for simple frameworks. We recommend making plans about how those people and frameworks can be mainstreamed in public health. This will likely be a combination of defining and implementing the competencies in behavioural science required by those working in public health roles, as well as nurturing networks to facilitate knowledge mobilisation in preparation for future public health emergencies. Future research could explore how different frameworks are received and used.",

So we use the COM-B to talk about how we need to really define a behaviour, and how we need to understand the influences on the behaviour and how that can then help shape what we do to increase adherence to it or to change it, whatever is needed to be done\u2026I think what worked for me is that, it was such a novel situation, there wasn't going to be a huge evidence base around what works, what doesn't in a pandemic, you know, in terms of all the things we're trying to do, what behavioural science brought was that methodology, so we might not have ever been in this situation. It's been widely applied with other behaviours, and it's proved effective.\" P11 Others were concerned about the translation of knowledge, with some aspects of behavioural science formal methodologies, theories and frameworks such as the use of behaviour change techniques (from the Behaviour Change Wheel) in different contexts being deemed as 'technical' concepts which may be difficult to communicate to others or train others to use effectively. \"Depending on the training session, usually, we would go into mechanisms of action and behaviour change techniques. We've used the theory and techniques tool too, which links up behaviour change techniques to mechanisms of action. So, we've used that as our, you know, this is evidence which has been collated and links what BCTs are effective, then we see like you can use this as a guide to kind of illustrate what BCTs you might want to consider. But not necessarily saying that these are the right ones because they might not have been. It might not be relevant to your research area. I think that's the real limitation of it. So yeah, I think that's the hardest part. Then it's also utilising BCTs, as well, and actually being able to understand how to use them. I think they are still quite technical people who have never used them before or who aren't necessarily that familiar or have that much experience with, with working with behaviours.\" P12 3.2.1.2.

And so that more research can be produced, because then it's, it's easier and more likely, institutions like NHS to adopt more health psychologists, if we've got evidence, we've got proof, we've got robust science that tells us that this can make a positive difference to people's lives.\"",
