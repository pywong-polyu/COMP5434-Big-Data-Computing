A complete mHealth system consists of interconnected wearable sensors, IoT services, mobile devices, mobile applications, and cloud services. The interconnected wearable sensors form a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and facilitates acquisitions of biomedical signals (e.g., electrocardiogram-ECG; phonocardiogram-PCG; photoplethysmogram-PPG) and biomedical parameters (e.g., heart-rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, blood oxygen saturation, energy expenditure, etc.) which are transmitted wirelessly to mobile devices. Thus, mHealth systems enable remote patient monitoring, rehabilitation, therapy, diagnosis, and treatment. The huge amount of data generated in mHealth systems can be used to perform complex analysis of patients' physical, cognitive, and physiological conditions, thus facilitating predictive and preventative healthcare. Moreover, the health data collected from groups of patients through mHealth systems can be used in medical research (clinical trials, randomized control trials, etc.).",

            "text": "In particular, the early detection of atrial fibrillation arrhythmia, most commonly, using mHealth systems can prevent strokes and reduce hospitalizations [13] [14] [15] . In a recent study, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) was developed to classify 12 heartrhythm classes using single-lead ECG signals recorded with an mHealth device. More than 50,000 patients were included in the study and the DNN was trained on more than 90,000 single-lead ECG signals. The results proved that the proposed DNN was able to classify different types of arrhythmia from single-lead ECG signals with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists [16] ; \u2022 Fitness level tracking: regular physical exercise is the main way to prevent obesity and to maintain a healthy lifestyle. However, due to lack of time and motivation, high costs of monthly gym memberships and personal trainers, and sometimes due to special circulation restrictions (e.g., lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic), many people choose to work out from home. In this case, mHealth systems can be used to monitor and assess workout exercises. Based on the fitness level of the user and on information collected by the sensors, the mHealth system can offer a personalized workout plan, suggestions for correct and efficient physical exercises execution, statistical feedback to help keep track of the fitness plan, etc. [17] . For such mHealth applications, usually specific parameters and information are recorded, such as heart-rate, energy expenditure, temperature, skin perspiration, plantar pressure, speed and acceleration, position of the body or a specific part of the body (e.g., hand, limb), number of repetitions, type of exercise, etc. In addition, the data collected can be analyzed to predict possible injury [18] . \u2022 Cancer: mHealth approaches can be used to improve screening rates for different types of cancer. In a recent review, 12 studies were analyzed, in which women were informed and reminded about their upcoming screening appointments for cervical cancer, via text message and mobile application [19] . The results showed that mHealth approaches may be an effective strategy to contact women for improving cervical cancer screening rates. The main concern of the participants was related to privacy and confidentiality aspects during the exchange of health information. In [20] , the authors proposed a new mHealth system for the early detection of oral cancer in a rural population where no medical experts were available. Frontline health workers (FHP) were trained to take images with smartphones and send them to medical experts, who in turn analyzed the images and suggested a diagnostic or possible treatment. The approach was evaluated and validated on more than 45,000 subjects, during a period of eight years (2010-2018) [20, 21] . Brown-Johnson et al. proposed a mHealth perspective for patients with lung cancer to manage experiences of stigma. A health game is developed that allows lung cancer patients to improve communication with their clinicians, to decrease lung cancer stigma and to obtain optimal self-management [22] . In [23] , a mHealth platform was designed and implemented for tumor treatment. The wearable platform was controlled by a smartphone and targeted tumor therapy was conducted. A significant prevention of tumor recurrence and tumor growth inhibition was reported. \u2022 Psychiatry: patients suffering from mental disorders such as bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia have a high degree of cognitive and functional impairment, which drastically reduces the quality of life. The main objectives of mHealth approaches are to improve engagement with treatment and services. Thus, with the help of mHealth technologies, the following benefits can be obtained: (i) identifying patients who are at risk; (ii) encouraging exercise and behavior change; (iii) reminding the patient of the next appointment or to take the medication; (iv) self-management techniques; (v) monitoring symptoms in real time; (vi) developing personalized interventions and caring plans; (vii) identifying warning signs based on self-reports of wellbeing; and (viii) offering continuous professional counseling [24, 25] . However, there are some barriers in the use of mHealth services that patients with severe mental illness may experience, including low income, unstable housing that can influence access to the Internet, cognitive impairment, and symptoms such as apathy, depression, low motivation, and paranoia. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that people with psychosis, despite experiencing these barriers, can make use of smart mobile technologies almost the same as the general population [24, 26] . \u2022 Rehabilitation and therapy: there is a significant number of mHealth approaches for rehabilitation and therapy described in the literature, which can be categorized as the following, [27] : stroke rehabilitation (monitoring and feedback for, physical activity, cognitive assessment, education to raise awareness, education on home exercises for managing poststroke, assistive devices, cognitive assessment) [27] [28] [29] [30] ; traumatic brain injury rehabilitation: improving cognitive memory using gamification, using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to make the use of transportation system easier, providing a home-based rehabilitation plan that includes training with daily activities, planning of appointments using reminders [31, 32] ; pulmonary rehabilitation (enabling home-based rehabilitation for patients with obstructive pulmonary disease (OPD), monitoring daily physical activity, offering motivational messages and/or feedback (e.g., acoustic), analyzing daily symptoms and physiological variables, detecting chronic OPD exacerbations and evaluating the clinical risk of chronic OPD) [33] [34] [35] ; cardiac rehabilitation (monitoring symptoms and physical activity (via ECG recorded signals, HR, HRV, energy expenditure, etc.), improving exercise and medication, messaging with healthcare providers) [36] [37] [38] ; Musculoskeletal rehabilitation: enabling wrist and/or hand rehabilitation using a sensor glove and gamification, improving motion with haptic feedback, prediction of rheumatoid arthritis activity by analyzing data related to joint symptoms, walking ability, limitations of daily activity, determining the osteoarthritis index) [39] [40] [41] [42] .",

The advances in sensor manufacturing technology have allowed the development of miniature sensors that are generally non-invasive, and which are revolutionizing the entire global health system. A variety of wearable sensors exist, depending on the target information to be recorded, processed, and analyzed. When more sensors are used in an mHealth system, usually these are interconnected via some medium and they form a network of wearable sensors named an Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) [43, 43] . The sensors can exchange information between each other, and send it to a cloud server (Figure 1 ). Technologies that are used to interconnect wearable sensors are ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4 standard; data rates-250-300 Kbps; range-100 m; network topology-mesh, star, tree, and cluster; bandwidth-2.4 GHz); Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1 standard; data rates-1-3 Mbps; range-10 m; network topology-star; bandwidth-2.4 GHz); Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 standard; data rates-1-40 Mbps; range-up to 5 km; network topology-tree, star, and P2P; bandwidth-2.4, 3.7, and 5 GHz); WiMax (IEEE 802.11 standard; data rates-75 Mbps; range-15 km; network topology-tree, star, and P2P; bandwidth-2.3, 2.5, and 3.4 GHz) [44] . The use of a particular wireless protocol for creating a WBAN is directly dependent on the data collected by the wearable sensors and its intended medical application [45] .

A light beam (usually with the wavelength of red/infra-red light) is transmitted into the body (e.g., writs, finger, ear lobe, etc.) and usually the intensity of the light is reflected to the receiver component of the sensor. The intensity of the reflected light varies with blood volume variation at the location where the sensor is attached. A PPG signal is obtained that is used to extract the HR. However, a heart-rate can also be extracted from other signals (e.g., ECG) acquired with other types of sensor (e.g., textile electrodes). \u2022 Blood pressure sensors: these are used to obtain indirect estimates of systolic pressure (SP), diastolic pressure (DP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP).",

A smartwatch can inflate a wrist cuff and, based on the oscillometric method, the SP and DP can be estimated [56] [57] [58] . \u2022 Respiration rate sensor: usually, this type of sensor measures strains and is a piezoelectric sensor. The piezoelectric elements are included in a band-aid-like strap that can be put around the thorax, and with every inhalation and exhalation, the thorax moves, deforming the strap, and mechanical stress is applied to piezoelectric elements, generating an electrical voltage. From this electrical signal, the respiration rate can be derived. These sensors can be also included in smart clothes. Other types of sensor measure the difference in air temperature, humidity, or air flow during a breathing cycle (e.g., warmer air during expiration than during inspiration), and the respiration rate is estimated. These sensors can be integrated into face masks [59] [60] [61] [62] . Also, more information about respiration function can be obtained using sensors integrated into smart face masks, such as respiratory minute volume, tidal volume, peak flow rate, and unique respiration patterns [63] .",

The EDA signal is obtained by placing 2 or 3 electrodes on the skin at hand level (wrist, palm, or fingers). An electrical signal is passed between the electrodes and the resistance is measured. The sweat glands produce more sweat when an emotionally arousing stimulus is experienced, which in turn changes the resistance of the skin. In mHealth applications, GSR sensors can be integrated in smart gloves or smart wristbands [68] [69] [70] [71] . \u2022 Temperature sensors: these are used to measure human body temperature. Flexible temperature sensors can be easily integrated into mHealth systems and are usually made from temperature-sensitive conductors or inks based on metals, nanomaterials, or conductive polymers [72] . \u2022 Body motion tracking sensors: these types of sensors are very widespread in mHealth applications for monitoring daily physical activity by tracking step count or by identifying the type of physical exercise performed. They can also be used to monitor body position, identify falls and assess fall risk in older people, or in patients during walking rehabilitation [73] [74] [75] . Changes in velocity, acceleration, body position patterns, which are used to map body movement, are determined from signals acquired with different types of sensors, including barometers, magnetometers, accelerometers, and gyroscopes. Also, a combination of two or more sensors are used to provide a more precise record of body motion.",

The foremost challenges related to mHealth systems are system failure, security, and privacy of the patient data. Thus, a vulnerability in security can easily lead to patient health information alteration and theft [76] . Moreover, cybercriminals can achieve complete control of wearable devices and pose a threat to a patient's life. A case is well known of the insulin pump commercialized by Johnson and Johnson that presented a low security vulnerability permitting hackers to change the insulin dose. For an mHealth system, where wearable devices are interconnected and based on IoT, such a vulnerable device can pose a danger for the entire network, which would lead to the gaining of access to and control of other devices in the network, and ultimately access to the entire health record of the patient. Moreover, it will make the entire mHealth system vulnerable against other types of cybercrimes, such as impersonation, data theft, eavesdropping, etc. [4] . Device-sharing (sharing the device used for mHealth with family and friends) and the lack of cyber-hygiene routines (not using passcodes, encryption, or secure clouds in daily working practice) can also lead to data breaches and unintended consequences [77] . Another important challenge is that wearable devices usually have their own data formats and standards, making the integration of all the data into a mHealth system an important challenge. Also, there is a lack of regulation and guidelines for implementing mHealth approaches [12] .",

The transactions of each block are formed as a Merkle tree, where each leaf value (transaction) can be verified to the known root [80] . Only the root of the tree is recorded in the block. Hence, a new block in the chain will always include a reference to the hash of the previous block. The hash of the new block is computed by the so-called miners or nodes (participants in the network) and must respect specific rules given by the consensus protocols. Once a valid hash is found, it is broadcast to all participants over the network for validation. After all the nodes have confirmed the validity of the found hash, the new block is added to the chain. At this point, the transaction is immutable.

            "text": "Proof of work (PoW): when this protocol applies, to add and validate a new data block, the miners compete in finding a hash (i.e., the target block header) of the proposed transaction (block), which is lower than a target value [81] . The first miner that finds the hash that validates the new block is rewarded. However, PoW requires high computational resources, reflected in high economic costs (in particular electricity consumption). It is used and integrated in Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies; \u2022 Proof of Stake (PoS): this is a modified version of the PoW protocol that aims to reduce energy draining due to extensive hash queries. When this protocol is applied, each miner has an associated stake, which is measured with so-called coin age. A miner basically must solve a PoW puzzle with a specific difficulty, but he can consume his coin age to reduce the difficulty of the puzzle solution. However, so as not to give an unfair advantage to the miner with the highest coin age, different hybrid PoS versions have been developed, where the stake is combined with some randomization [81] ; \u2022 Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT): Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is the characteristic of a distributed network to reach consensus even when some miners in the network respond with incorrect information or fail to respond. Thus, a collective decision is employed with the objective of reducing the influence of faulty miners. The PBFT protocol is applied for permissioned blockchain networks, where a consensus is reached among a small group of known miners. PBFT is currently used in Hyperledger Fabric.",

This characteristic offers data integrity for the data saved in a blockchain-based system. Thus, if a hacker wants to falsify the data, they will need to make a change in the majority of the blockchain nodes, which is almost impossible, so the blockchain has an inherent high degree of security. \u2022 Transparency and privacy: it can offer different degrees of transparency, from public blockchains, where any user is allowed to join the network and anyone can see the data stored, to more private blockchains where a user needs permission to create transactions with other users, and all users are authenticated and known. Privacy is assured by powerful cryptography, making it very difficult to identify a user. \u2022 Traceability and accountability: because the technology is based on a chain of blocks where each block is linked to the previous one by including the hash of the latter [80] , it offers the possibility to everyone or to an authorized entity to audit the history of all transactions.",

Table 1 presents the acquisition parameters for the physiological signals recorded with the wearable sensors. For hand and foot GSR, two pairs of electrodes are placed on the palm of the hand and the sole of the foot and a small electrical current is passed across the two electrodes to record changes in skin resistance. To record the ECG signal, three electrodes are used to obtain a modified lead II. The respiration signal is derived from measuring thoracic movement due to breathing. For this, a Hall effect sensor is used, which consists of two magnets embedded inside an elastic tube. The EMG signal is acquired using three electrodes, two of which are placed on the axis of the trapezius muscle and the third one is used as a reference [105] .",

In the diagram presented in Figure 4 , the healthcare providers, medical experts, and researchers, who should be able to access patient records, act as active (mining) nodes. Patients can connect directly to the blockchain network without a central server or database, thus eliminating single points of failure. Since the amount of raw data that is collected is very high ( Table 2) , it is inefficient to store all the measurements on the blockchain network. Instead, in the proposed framework, raw data is stored as JSON files on the IPFS, which is a decentralized hypermedia protocol for file storage and remote access. On IPFS, each file receives a unique hash, and the file content is distributed across the network. The file hash is stored on the blockchain and associated with each patient. The structure of the raw JSON dataset is presented below: The functionality of the proposed mHealth application is ensured by a smart contract designed, implemented, and deployed on the private Ethereum blockchain network. The architecture of the contract is presented in Figure 5 . In a traditional database design, there would be a many-to-many (M:M) association between doctors and patients. Doctors or healthcare providers have access only to the records of their associated patients. In the proposed smart contract, the associations between the Ethereum address and the users, as well as the association between doctors and patients, are implemented using mapping. It can be seen that the Patient and Doctor structures contain the properties numDoctors and numPatients. These properties are necessary to iterate through the list of patients associated with a doctor or vice versa, since the Solidity mapping is not iterable.",

Although it is not required that the smart-contract functions emit these events, they greatly improve the process of blockchain application development. The proposed framework was deployed on three nodes with the following configurations (Table 3) : In the proposed implementation, all three nodes are configured as mining nodes on the private Ethereum blockchain. In the context of the proposed framework, it is not necessary for the patients to run the blockchain nodes and sync with the blockchain network. Only physicians and healthcare providers must synchronize with the blockchain ledger and reach consensus, while the patients interact with the mHealth network through desktop or mobile applications which transmit information to the blockchain smart contract and interact with the data through events and logs. For the proposed proof-of-concept implementation, a Python web application is developed, but this can be bundled as a standalone application.

Table 4 compares the proposed blockchain framework with the existing ones described in the literature. Griggs et al. [102] introduced a system based on a private Ethereum blockchain with smart contracts. A sensor, such as a heart-rate monitor, records and sends data to a smart device, such as smartphone or tablet, which in turns send the data to the smart contract. The smart contract is executed and evaluates the data and in turn can send alerts to the patient, hospital, or medical expert, or can send a command to activate medical devices such as insulin pumps. In [103] , the authors proposed a decentralized privacy-preserving healthcare blockchain for IoT. The logical flow execution is similar to the one introduced in [102] . It uses symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes and lightweight digital signatures for authentication purposes [103] .",

Only the hash key for each dataset is stored on the blockchain. Using the smart contract, the association between the patient, the dataset, and the medical expert is realized. Moreover, the proposed framework is not a conceptual analysis; instead, the blockchain and smart contracts are implemented, deployed, and tested using real signals collected by wearable sensors. In addition, the framework also offers an interface for both patient and medical experts. The latter provides capabilities for direct interaction with the medical data. Thus, the medical expert can visualize and manipulate the signals recorded by sensors to make a precise diagnosis. It has also the possibility to transmit alerts, treatment and therapy recommendations to the patient. All are stored in the electronic record of the patient.",

The first benefit of this approach is that patients do not need to synchronize the blockchain ledger and have a full node connected to the blockchain network. Due to the way the smart contract is developed, authorized applications (oracles) can be integrated into the mHealth environment. The second benefit of the proposed approach is that the consensus mechanism can be changed from the current proof-ofwork method to a proof-of-stake or proof-of-authority consensus mechanism, since only medical professionals actively participate in data validation and consensus. This would require fewer resources than the current proof-of-work consensus implemented in the Ethereum blockchain. A detailed analysis of the performance impact of the three consensus mechanisms will be addressed in a future study, since Ethereum already supports proofof-authority consensus (on the Rinkeby test network and on private networks using the Clique consensus protocol) and will soon support the proof-of-stake consensus as well.",

Any change to the smart-contract logic implies the redeployment of a new contract instance. However, the data must be referenced or transferred from the previous instance. Due to the data-agnostic approach of the proposed framework, no contract changes are necessary when the data format is modified. Using IPFS as a decentralized solution for the storage and hashing of the data by content achieves two important performance improvements: (a) data duplication is avoided, since the same content will produce the same hash on the IPFS network, thus eliminating unwanted redundancy and optimizing the amount of transferred data; and (b) the data format is not coupled with the blockchain smart-contract logic, so new data sources and formats can easily be added, by updating the front-end application to support the new JSON format. Updating a client-side application is much more convenient, through various distribution channels available for desktop, mobile, or web applications.",

Using a privately deployed Ethereum blockchain, both patients and healthcare providers can join the mHealth network, through a web interface, which allows the sharing, viewing, and interpretation of medical records. A smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain is responsible for data management and proper association between doctors, patients, and monitored data. Since blockchain operations are expensive in terms of storage and processing, the medical data is distributively stored using the IPFS protocol, creating additional redundancy and data availability. Traditionally, a remote, web-based monitoring system would be implemented using a client-server model, where the data would be stored in a centralized database (most likely a SQL variant, such as MySQL). This centralized approach is susceptible to data loss due to server failure or third-party attack. Due to the large number of collected samples, the centralized database approach is much slower than the proposed solution in this paper, as shown in Figures 9 and 10 . Although some optimization could be made to the data model and the querying techniques, a database-driven approach would still be susceptible to a single point of failure. Using blockchain, the information is distributed across all nodes in the network, thus improving the data availability and transfer times.",
