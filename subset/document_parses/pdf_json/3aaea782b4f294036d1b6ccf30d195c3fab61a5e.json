The cumulative numbers of cases and deaths, as of July 25th, 2021, recorded in the 33 areas of Montreal are modelled through a bivariate hierarchical Bayesian model using Poisson distributions. The Poisson means are decomposed in the log scale as the sums of fixed effects and latent effects. The areal median age, the educational level, and the number of beds in long-term care homes are included in the fixed effects. To explore the correlation between cases and deaths inside each area and across areas, three bivariate models are considered for the latent effects, namely an independent one, a conditional autoregressive model, and one that allows for both spatially structured and unstructured sources of variability. As the inclusion of spatial effects change some of the fixed effects, we extend the Spatial+ approach to a Bayesian areal set up to investigate the presence of spatial confounding. Results show that the cumulative totals of cases and deaths are negatively correlated inside and across the boroughs of Montreal. The covariates are not associated in a similar manner for the cases and deaths due to COVID-19. The educational level and the median age seem spatially confounded for the cases and deaths across the boroughs of Montreal.",

We are interested in measuring the strength of the associations between the three selected covariates and the cases and deaths due to COVID-19. Also, we aim at investigating how these two outcomes are correlated within and across boroughs. We examine whether the selected covariates impact the risk of being a case or the risk of dying from COVID-19 in a similar fashion. Additionally, we investigate if there is any structure left in the data after accounting for the available covariates. We explore different prior specifications for these local latent effects, ranging from independent to spatially structured ones. It is known that the inclusion of spatially structured latent effects can affect the estimation of the fixed effects (Reich et al., 2006; Khan and Calder, 2020; Dupont et al., 2021) ; this is known in the literature of Spatial Statistics as spatial confounding. We fit a Bayesian version of the Spatial+ approach proposed by Dupont et al. (2021) to investigate if there is spatial confounding in the fitted models.",

Let D i be the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in borough i. We model the deaths and cases through a joint hierarchical Bayesian model in order to accommodate the natural relationship one expects between cases and deaths of a disease. First, we define a marginal distribution for the cases, and then, conditional on the number of cases, we define a distribution for the number of recorded deaths. Sahu and B\u00f6hning (2021) modelled the cases and deaths due to in England in a similar fashion, using a 2-stage Bayesian hierarchical model. However, their interest lied in the temporal structure of the data and did not consider joint latent effects. Our approach differs because we do not conduct a spatio-temporal analysis, and we are interested in measuring the correlation between cases and deaths inside and across the boroughs of Montreal. To that end, we include a correlation parameter that helps borrow strength from the cases and deaths inside and across boroughs. More specifically, we assume,",

To model the number of deaths conditionally on the number of cases, the Poisson distribution is used as an approximation to a Binomial distribution with size C i and probability p i .

Spatial confounding corresponds to the situation where spatially structured latent effects are correlated with the covariates, resulting in biased estimates of the fixed effects (Reich et al., 2006; Page et al., 2017) . Reich et al. (2006) proposed a restricted spatial regression (RSR) model to overcome this issue, by removing the collinearity between the covariates and the spatial effects.

The proposal is to \"regress away\" the spatial structure from the covariates and only include the residuals from such regression in the modelling of the variable of interest. The Spatial+ approach of Dupont et al. (2021) is based on generalised additive models (GAM). As pointed out by Dupont et al. (2021) , because of the relationship between splines and Markov random fields, next we follow Schmidt (2021) and describe how to adapt the Spatial+ approach when the latent effect follow a CAR prior distribution. Dupont et al. (2021) suggest to use Spatial+ as a tool to investigate for the presence of spatial confounding. If after fitting a model with and without spatial effects the fixed effects estimates are similar, this might be an indication that there is no spatial confounding. We consider the CAR extension that Dupont et al. (2021) proposed for their method and adopt a fully Bayesian approach. Let x \u00b7k = [x 1k , . . . , x nk ] be the vector for the kth covariate.

Metropolis-Hastings algorithms are used for the independent random effects in the IID, BYM and BYM+ models. For the spatial effects included in the CAR, BYM, CAR+ and BYM+ models, the default CAR normal sampler from Nimble is used. The chains have mixed well, as assessed by the trace plots, effective sample sizes and the statistic proposed by Gelman and Rubin (1992) . The reason for the need of these long chains seems to be related to the possible collinearity between the variable diploma and the models that include a spatial effect. The IID model and the ones that accommodate spatial confounding showed convergence before reaching the burn in of 400,000 iterations. For consistency, all models were fitted with the same number of iterations.",

We model the cases and deaths jointly in order to borrow strength from the different recordings both inside each area (e.g., IID model) and between areas (e.g., CAR model). Figure 4 shows the posterior summaries (posterior mean and posterior 95% credible interval) for the correlation coefficients, \u03c1 v and \u03c1 u , respectively included in the latent effects' IID, CAR, CAR+, BYM or BYM+ models. The BYM and BYM+ yield posterior 95% credible intervals that include 0 for \u03c1 u and \u03c1 v . On the other hand, the IID, CAR and CAR+ result in negative correlations between the latent effects for the cases and for the deaths ([\u22120.73, \u22120.08], [\u22120.72, \u22120.07] and [\u22120.76, \u22120.02], respectively). This suggests that modelling the cases and deaths jointly is adequate. Note that for the BYM and BYM+ models, if the posterior 95% credible limits for \u03c1 u and \u03c1 v include zero, this does not necessarily imply that the marginal correlations will also include zero. From Table 1 , it is clear that the correlation between cases and deaths within and across boroughs also depends on the latent effects' standard deviations as well as the spatial structure, when appropriate. Figure B .7 in Appendix B shows the posterior summaries for the intra-borough correlation between cases and deaths for each model. Although \u03c1 u and \u03c1 v have posterior credible intervals that include zero, the BYM model yields strictly negative intervals in 19 boroughs.",

Another goal of this analysis, other than investigate the association of the log relative risks of cases and deaths with the available covariates, is to estimate the correlation between the cases and deaths within and across boroughs. The posterior summaries for the intraborough correlations between cases and deaths obtained for each model are available in Appendix B, in Figure B .7 and the posterior means for the correlation between areas estimated under the CAR, BYM, CAR+ and BYM+ models are available in Appendix B, in Figure B .8, Figure B .9, Figure B .10 and Figure B .11, respectively. We note that all the estimated correlations are negative. Figure 5 maps the posterior means of the correlations between cases and deaths inside each borough for each model that include latent effects. The IID model does not allow for a correlation across boroughs but does accommodate an intraborough correlation (see Table 1 ). All the models estimate negative correlations between the cases and deaths on average a posteriori. For example, the correlation's posterior mean in Senneville is \u22120.2 for the CAR model and \u22120.1 for the BYM model. In C\u00f4te-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce, the posterior mean is \u22120.4 for the CAR+ model and \u22120.3 for the BYM. For the IID, CAR and CAR+ models, the correlations' posterior 95% credible intervals (see Figure B .7 in Appendix B) are always negative. In Figure 5 , there does not seem to be a spatial structure in the negative posterior means of the intra-borough correlations between the cases and deaths due to COVID-19. Additionally, Figure B .12 in Appendix B maps the relative risks of cases and deaths as estimated by each model. The negative correlations between cases and deaths are illustrated in this Figure B .12. For example, the south west region of Montreal has low estimated risks of cases but high estimated risks of deaths for each model. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

The areal means are decomposed in the log scale as the sum of an offset, fixed effects, and latent random effects. One model is fitted without latent effects. We then allow for a correlation between the cases' latent effects and the deaths' latent effects within an area. In one model, we assume that the latent effects are independent across the areas, whereas in the other four models, we accommodate a potential spatial autocorrelation between the latent effects of neighbouring areas. In two of these models, we set multivariate CAR and BYM priors for the latent effects.

Regarding the log number of beds, the coefficient has posterior 95% credible intervals that include zero for the cases (through the IID, CAR, BYM, CAR+ and BYM+ models) but the posterior credible intervals are strictly positive for the deaths. We used the number of beds in CHSLDs as a proxy for the healthcare infrastructure in Montreal. This result suggests that this covariate has no link with the recorded number of cases but that, given the number of cases, an increased number of beds corresponds to a higher risk of death due to COVID-19. This result is consistent with the COVID-19 situation in Montreal and in the province of Quebec. In particular, long-term care homes were the epicentre of the COVID-19 crisis in Quebec (Hsu et al., 2020 ; Institut national de sant\u00e9 publique du Qu\u00e9bec, 2021). The associations between the percentage of the population with a university diploma and the cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in Montreal are also different for each outcome considered. There does not seem to be a relationship between the percentage of people with diploma and the risk of death due to COVID-19, given the cases, for the IID, CAR, BYM, CAR+ and BYM+ models. On the other hand, each model results in negative posterior credible intervals for the effects of the diploma on the number of cases. The diploma variable is used as a proxy to the socio-economic situation of each borough in Montreal.

            "text": "We believe that there is an interest to the data analysis conducted in this paper as we are able to provide an estimate of the correlations between the cases and deaths due to COVID-19 within, and across, boroughs. Fitting separate models for cases and deaths, or even joint models that assume parameters to be independent a priori, such as in the Simple model, impose independence between cases and deaths. Our proposed approach allows the data to drive the inference procedure, and if there is correlation between the two outcomes, this can be estimated through the marginal correlations computed from the results shown in Table  1 . Note that in terms of WAIC, we find that the Simple model performs worse than the five other models that include latent effects which allow for marginal correlations between cases and deaths both within and across boroughs. Finally, we find that the correlation between the cases and deaths due to COVID-19 within and between boroughs is always negative. This may be due to the aggregation of cases and deaths over time. We only have available aggregated data, which may yield different correlations than what would be observed at a certain time or through a temporal analysis. Looking at aggregated provincial time series of cases and deaths due to COVID-19, the number of cases and deaths were positively correlated at the beginning of the pandemic. We hypothesise that the estimated negative correlation between cases and deaths are related to different policies that were instituted throughout the pandemic and, moreover, due to the fact that people started being vaccinated. For instance, in the province of Quebec, the number of cases increased from 573 to 1683 between March 15th, 2021, and April 15th, 2021, whereas the vaccination coverage for the population aged 80 and older increased from 57.9% to 91.1% in the same period (Institut national de sant\u00e9 publique du Qu\u00e9bec, 2021). It can be observed in the aggregated time series that in this period, the daily number of deaths somewhat stabilised at low numbers.",
