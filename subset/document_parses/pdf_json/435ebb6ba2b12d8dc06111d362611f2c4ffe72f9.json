Its outbreak began on their impact on society to guide and inform solutions and countermeasures. Early evidence suggests older age and the presence of underlying comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer, [1] smoking, obesity, [2] and male gender, [3] predisposes individuals to infection and an increased risk of death. It is now known that the virus inflicts harm irrespective of age or health status. It is therefore important to fully identify genetic, psychological, environmental, and biological risk factors that may influence the course and severity of the disease. [4] Deficiencies in minerals and vitamins have been reported to be a predisposing factor in a variety of diseases. [5] Vitamin D, in particular, has been studied for decades with a more recent emphasis on its role, in deficient states, in cancers, neuropsychiatric disorders, autoimmune diseases, [5] and chronic conditions such as bone metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory tract infections (RTIs), diabetes mellitus, hypertension and in viral infections. [6] High serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] have been associated with reduced risk of dengue, hepatitis, herpesvirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus infections, and pneumonia. [6] The exact mechanisms of the interplay between Vitamin D and viral disease development are not fully poorly understood but are thought to involve the induction of an anti-viral state, functional immunoregulatory features, interaction with cellular and viral factors, induction of autophagy and apoptosis, and genetic and epigenetic alterations. [7] Now, with the emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19, the influence of Vitamin D status in infected individuals on the clinical outcomes is an area of interest. COVID-19 incidence has first ranked between others in Iran as an Eastern Mediterranean Region countries. [8] The incidence rate, severity, and death risk of influenza, pneumonia, and the current COVID-19 may reduce by optimal levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. [6] As Vitamin D suboptimal levels in Iranian general population was reported in over 70%. [9] The present study was aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 suffered patients 25(OH)D serum concentration which is not reported yet.",

[6, 7] On the other hand, the previous studies have reported on an association between respiratory diseases [10] [11] [12] and a lower level of serum Vitamin D Chen et al. proposed several mechanisms at the molecular level [10] in the relationship between Vitamin D and pathological respiratory distress. Jolliffe et al. reported a broad and consistent relationship between lower levels of Vitamin D and a higher susceptibility to acute respiratory infection in a systemic review, although, the authors were unable to conclude that Vitamin D supplementation has a protective effect against acute respiratory infection. [11] However, Martineau et al. concluded that Vitamin D supplementation was safe and effective against acute RTI, particularly in patients with severe Vitamin D deficiency. [12] In another systematic review and meta-analysis, Pham et al. showed that Vitamin D plays a critical role against acute RTI risk and its severity, particularly in individuals with Vitamin D deficiency. [13] It is worth noting that previous studies proposed that the Vitamin D has an important immunomodulatory role in the optimal function of the immune system. [8, 9] The steroid hormone may act against related pathogens and reduce the inflammatory responses. [14] [15] [16] Vitamin D has a role in the production of some antimicrobial peptides such as defensins and cathelicidin and thus can play a role against microbiological pathogens. [17] Journal of Research in Medical Sciences | 2021 | 4 Recent studies show that the mortality rate in people with COVID-19 occurs at a higher rate in older patients. [1] Kim et al. demonstrated an association of low serum level of Vitamin D with frailty in elderly people. [18] On the other hand, frailty was considered as a strong predictor of mortality rate in older patients. [19] This association was independent of gender, age, other morbidities, and even functional status of involved older adults. [19] As a result, frailty can be considered as an important mediator between lower levels of Vitamin D and higher mortality rate in older patients. On the other hand, the recent studies showed the cardiovascular comorbidities are common findings in patients with COVID-19, where myocardial injury occurs in more than 25% of acute ill patients, and also it is related to a higher risk of death in involved patients. [20] This injury may occur in two patterns, including acute myocardial injury and injury due to illness intensification. [20] Our study showed that a lower level of serum level of Vitamin D is associated with a higher mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 independent of age and sex. This preliminary study, to the best knowledge of the authors, is the first to evaluate the association between serum level of Vitamin D and mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 disease. We suggest that the role of Vitamin D in SARS-Cov-2 infection be fully explored in infection and at all stages of disease in well-designed clinical studies.",
