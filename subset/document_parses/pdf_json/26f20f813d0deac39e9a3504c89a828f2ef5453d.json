The USA is also suffering from a catastrophic death toll from COVID-19. Several studies are providing preliminary evidence that short-and long-term exposure to air pollution might increase the severity of COVID-19 outcomes, including a higher risk of death. In this study, we develop a spatiotemporal model to estimate the association between exposure to fine particulate matter PM2.5 and mortality accounting for several social and environmental factors. More specifically, we implement a Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial regression model with random effects that vary in time and space. Our goal is to estimate the association between air pollution and mortality accounting for the spatiotemporal variability that remained unexplained by the measured confounders. We applied our model to four regions of the USA with weekly data available for each county within each region. We analyze the data separately for each region because each region shows a different disease spread pattern. We found a positive association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and the mortality from the COVID-19 disease for all four regions with three of four being statistically significant. Data and code are available at our GitHub repository.",

The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths vary spatially and temporally and can be affected by many factors, some local some global. There is a large body of literature that investigates the key biological, socioeconomic, and environmental factors that might increase the degree of severity of the health outcomes after having contacted COVID-19 (Karmakar et al. 2021; Webb Hooper et al. 2020; Yancy 2020; Abdelzaher et al. 2020; Ali and Islam 2020; Fiasca et al. 2020; Giani et al. 2020) . Concerning the environmental factors, it is well established that short-and long-term exposure to air pollution increases the risk of several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, irrespective of COVID-19 (Jiang et al. 2016; Lelieveld and M\u00fcnzel 2019) . We and others Liu et al. 2020; Ogen 2020; Jiang and Xu 2021; Yongjian et al. 2020; Conticini et al. 2020; Comunian et al. 2020) have hypothesized that exposure to air pollution increases the severity of COVID-19 outcomes, because air pollution can affect our immune, respiratory and cardiovascular system. This is a rapidly evolving area of research, see, for example (Bhaskar et al. 2020) for a review of the epidemiological studies on this topic.",

To address this scientific question, we need to overcome several challenges. These include: 1) a large number of zero counts, especially at the beginning of the pandemic; 2) complex spatiotemporal variation that remained unexplained after having accounted for several measured confounders; and 3) computational feasibility. To overcome the challenges listed above and many others, we introduce a Bayesian model with multivariate spatiotemporal distributions of random effects while accounting for several measured socioeconomic and demographic factors. We modeled the COVID-19 death counts via a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution (Neelon et al. 2019) . Since the frequentist approach to fitting the ZINB model is challenging for longitudinal, spatial, and spatiotemporal data, particularly when the model includes multivariate spatial random effects, we have chosen a more tractable Bayesian approach proposed by Neelon et al. (2019) .",

We incorporate the spatial and spatiotemporal information into the model by assigning a multivariate intrinsic conditionally autoregressive (ICAR) prior structure (Banerjee et al. 2014) to the random effects. Additional time-fixed effects are also considered. Then, we analyze the effectiveness of the zero-inflated model compared to an ordinary negative binomial model. also considered a ZINB model at a county level to investigate the association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and COVID-19 deaths using an ecological and cross-sectional study design. These authors also considered state-specific random effects to capture variation between states. While investigated global association by using the data over most of US counties, no spatial dependence nor temporal dependence was assumed in the model, which is the main difference from our modeling. Instead, we decided to analyze spatiotemporal county-level data within regions consisting of multiple states that are geographically connected. This can account for heterogeneous dynamics of the spread of disease across different regions of the USA. For our analysis, we consider four regions: Mid-Atlantic (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), Pacific (California, Oregon, and Washington), South Atlantic (Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina), and Midwest (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) . The results of our model show an overall positive association between long-term exposure to the (PM2.5) and the mortality from the COVID-19 disease, which matches with other previous studies (Bhaskar et al. 2020) .",

Instead of considering the ratio of a COVID-19 count to a county-level population size, the county-level population size was considered as an offset variable in the model to remove the obvious effect of the county-level population size on the COVID-19 death counts. For spatiotemporal models, we computed 23 weekly COVID-19 death counts from March 23 to August 31, 2020 by aggregating daily counts from Monday to Sunday without overlapping. For spatial models, which we consider for comparison, we used cumulative counts since the beginning of the study period.

This can be doable but a single model may not be able to capture heterogeneous effects that we found in this study. Also, handling a spatial dependence model with a large number of spatial regions brings an additional computational burden. On the other hand, we can extend the current model with a spatiotemporally varying coefficient model to capture heterogeneous effects by states or by county so that we can investigate the whole data into one model framework. A modified spatial dependence modeling such as allowing spatial dependence only within state to increase computational efficiency can be also considered. We plan to investigate such extension as a future study.",

COVID-19 changed economic environment as well as people's life styles in many ways, which cause large variations (either up or down) in PM levels during a short-term period Venter et al. 2020 ) As our focus is longterm effect of PM2.5 on COVID-19 death counts, these short-term changes of PM levels were not considered in our analysis. Thus, our findings are restricted to the association between long exposure to PM2.5 and COVID-19 death counts, in particular, aggregated death counts over counties and weeks.",

            "text": "Finally, as we have mentioned earlier, this study contributes toward the possibility of the hazards of PM2.5 on COVID-19-positive cases and related mortality. Specifically, we believe that as we have incorporated the \"zero-inflation\" part to the model, it will allow to make inference in early stages of the pandemic of this kind. Nevertheless, we assent that the claim on the higher risk of a COVID-19 death in polluted counties is open to debate as our findings (positive association) do not imply causation. It is also acknowledged that the findings in this paper are limited as they depend on several factors such as the data structure, models and inference methods. There have been about only two years since the coronavirus outbreak began; even so a heavy contribution from several genre of research related to this pandemic-which is a great reflection of the fact that researchers around the world are trying to infer on the connection between the air pollution and its association with the deaths related to COVID-19. However, we are in a urgent need of more research to be done, at the granular level with more complexity in the data and in the modeling. As we are working on this problem, as a statistician and data scientist, it is believed that there is an immediate need of more patient-level data (which is not easy to access because of the issues related to data confidentiality, data sharing, and other related things) than the kind of data publicly available these days. That also makes us believe that as more similar findings are accumulated by other researchers, our claim would become much more stronger.",
