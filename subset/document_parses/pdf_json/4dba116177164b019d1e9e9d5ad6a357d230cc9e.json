Our hypothesis was that in primary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) MV would enhance inflammation and edema in the abdomen. Methods: Thirteen piglets were randomized into two groups (SB and MV) after the induction of ARDS by lung lavage and 1 h of injurious ventilation. 1. SB: continuous positive airway pressure 15 cmH 2 O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) 0.5 and respiratory rate (RR) maintained at about 40 cycles min \u2212 1 by titrating remifentanil infusion. 2. MV: volume control, tidal volume 6 ml kg \u2212 1 , positive end-expiratory pressure 15 cmH 2 O, RR 40 cycles min \u2212 1 , FIO 2 0.5. Main outcomes: abdominal edema, assessed by tissues histopathology and wet-dry weight; abdominal inflammation, assessed by cytokine concentration in tissues, blood and ascites, and tissue histopathology. Results: The groups did not show significant differences in hemodynamic or respiratory parameters. Moreover, edema and inflammation in the abdominal organs were similar. However, blood IL6 increased in the MV group in all vascular beds (p < 0.001). In addition, TNF\u03b1 ratio in blood increased through the lungs in MV group (+ 26% \u00b1 3) but decreased in the SB group (\u2212 17% \u00b1 3). Conclusions: There were no differences between the MV and SB group for abdominal edema or inflammation. However, the systemic increase in IL6 and the TNF\u03b1 increase through the lungs suggest that MV, in this model, was harmful to the lungs.",

An increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) affects lungs [4, 5] producing atelectasis [6] , impaired function [7] and, indirectly, inflammation and edema [8] . On the other side, an increase in thoracic pressure due to MV [9] may have an effect on inflammation and edema in the abdominal compartment. In fact, the decrease in venous return related to high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation [10] has been well described. In addition, a reduction on portal flow due to a vasoconstrictive reaction related directly to PEEP [11] has also been described. Consequently, MV can affect hemodynamics both systemically and locally (e.g., by enhancing hepatic production of inflammation mediators [12] ).",

The hallmark of this model is a systemic inflammatory response with a substantial increase in inflammatory markers and the development of edema. Thus, these studies report the combined effect of endotoxemia and MV on abdominal edema (ascites) and inflammation. However, available data are confounded by differences in respiratory mechanics. The most important differences found in earlier research are related to a different respiratory rate (not controlled in spontaneous breathing [SB] animals) and in PEEP level application. Hence, the effect of mechanical ventilation contra SB on abdominal inflammation and edema in a non-septic model has not been investigated.",

Moreover, increased capillary leakage was not found, as estimated by hemoglobin concentration and wet-dry weight.

Indeed, this contention mirrors clinical reality. Because ARDS is clinically caused by an underlying inflammatory condition (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia, trauma or pancreatitis), the augmentation of the pulmonary inflammation by VILI could disseminate systemically and enhance inflammation in compromised abdominal organs (such as the liver or the bowel) causing multiple organ failure [22, 23] . Inarguably, multiple organ failure is the most common cause of death in ARDS [24] .",

A lower PEEP would theoretically improve the lymphatic drainage through thoracic duct and reduce the splanchnic venous stasis and thus decrease edema formation. In a previous study PEEP in a SB group was set a 5 cmH 2 O and edema formation was significantly higher with MV than with SB, even when the groups had the same low PEEP level. PEEP was found to worsen edema further. That no difference was found between the SB and MV groups with a high PEEP level may indicate that high PEEP impairs edema clearance in the same way, no matter the ventilation mode. Moreover, in several studies RR was higher with SB, and it is known that diaphragm movement creates a pump effect on the thoracic duct [25] . Thus, the increased RR in the SB group could have been the result of an edema-diminishing/lymph drainageenhancing factor.",

The study aimed to examine whether \"protective\" MV would induce splanchnic inflammation under non-septic ARDS conditions; however, in human patients ARDS is always due to an underlying, usually severe, inflammatory condition. Second, the observation time may have been too short to detect a full response in abdominal edema and inflammation. Nevertheless, 6 h of observation should have been enough time to see a signal in the cytokine response. Finally, we did not sample lung tissue.
