While numerous studies are devoted to the deterministic regime of an established epidemic, mathematical descriptions of the initial phase of epidemic growth are comparatively rarer. Here, we review existing mathematical results on the size of the epidemic over time, and derive new results to elucidate the early dynamics of an infection cluster started by a single infected individual. We show that the initial growth of epidemics that eventually take off is accelerated by stochasticity. As an application, we compute the distribution of the first detection time of an infected individual in an infection cluster depending on testing effort, and estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern Alpha detected in September 2020 first appeared in the UK early August 2020. We also compute a minimal testing frequency to detect clusters before they exceed a given threshold size. These results improve our theoretical understanding of early epidemics and will be useful for the study and control of local infectious disease clusters.",

A quantitative understanding of epidemic dynamics is necessary to improve control measures. Deterministic models are a suitable tool to describe the epidemiological dynamics once a large number of individuals has been infected. During the early phase of an epidemic in a local infection cluster however, stochastic effects cannot be neglected. These stochastic effects are due to the initially low number of infected individuals, and to the inherent stochasticity of the transmission process. Understanding and quantifying these stochastic effects will help, for example, assess the risk of new infection clusters emerging or estimate the size of a cluster associated with a new variant when such a variant is detected.",

It is therefore important to use biologically realistic distributions of transmission times [7] , rather than assuming mathematically convenient but biologically unrealistic exponential distributions. A constant infectiousness over the duration of an individual's infection leads to the predominantly used framework of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), while non-constant infectiousness can be captured by a partial differential equation. In addition to the added biological realism, a time-varying infectiousness of infected individuals can also properly capture the dynamical consequences of abrupt changes in transmission rate [6, 8] .

Stochasticity in transmission does not merely add noise to the dynamics, but also causes a systematic deviation from the deterministic description, which underestimates the initial growth of an establishing epidemic [10, 11] . This is in contradiction to a common misconception that stochasticity generally slows down the initial epidemic growth rate. We quantify the deviation between the deterministic and observed stochastic growth rates by conditioning the individual-based process on survival. After initial stochastic effects, the process converges to exponential growth with an asymptotic growth rate, denoted r, derived from the reproduction number R and the transmission rate. The distribution of time since infection in the stationary regime is exponential with parameter r, the asymptotic growth rate.",

Overall, there is large variation in the epidemic sizes between different trajectories, as shown by the broad light shaded region corresponding to the 90% inter-quantile range of the simulated trajectories. To model the number of secondary infections, we have used the Poisson distribution in the figure because the adjustment of the transmission rate does not result in explicit expressions if a negative binomial distribution is used.

First, we use the approximation of the epidemic size (equation (2.8)) to estimate the probability distribution of the emergence time of the Alpha variant, first detected in the UK in September 2020. The distribution of the emergence time also provides insight into the probability distribution of the size of the cluster when the variant was first sampled. As a second application, we estimate the minimal testing frequency necessary to detect new emerging clusters before they exceed a certain size (on average). This prediction is especially relevant when the number of infected individuals is rare. This lineage was first detected in the UK from a sample that was collected on 20 September 2020 [19] and has rapidly become a major variant of concern due to its increased transmissibility [20] and pathogenicity [21] . Here, we develop a method to estimate the date of the first infection of an individual with the Alpha variant and the distribution of the size of the Alpha cluster on the day when the sample was taken in September, based on the dynamics of the epidemic size of a local cluster. Our analysis requires the effective reproduction number, estimated to be R = 1.5 for the Alpha variant in November 2020 in the UK [20] , and the probability for a sample taken in the UK to be sequenced, which was around 4.2% in October 2020 [22] . We will use this value in our analysis, keeping in mind that this might be an underestimate because the number of cases were lower in September so the percentage of samples that could have been sequenced was potentially higher. Since only reported cases can be sampled, we additionally account for underreporting of cases. We assume that around 25% of all infections are detected [23] . Lastly, we need to define a distribution for the time that passes between infection and sampling of an infectious individual. We assume that the time from infection to sampling is a gamma distributed random variable (but any distribution would work) with a mean of 7 days and a standard deviation of 2 days. The parameter values (table 1) are chosen such that they give a probability of sampling and sequencing an infected individual up until 3 days of their infection that is less than 1%, and a probability of sampling an infected individual after 10 days of their infection that is less than 10%.

The mean size of the cluster with the Alpha variant at the first sampling time (obtained from stochastic simulations) consists of 159 individuals, yet again with a large standard deviation of 158 individuals. For example, the 95-percentile of the simulations predicts a cluster size of 476 infected individuals with the Alpha variant by the time of the first sampling of the variant.",

Therefore, we now ask whether repeated random testing in the population is a more feasible strategy to contain an infection cluster. Specifically, how often should we randomly test the population to detect a cluster before it exceeds a certain size? As a numerical example, we will use a threshold cluster size of 30 infected individuals. We assume that testing is applied populationwide at random, independently of the infection state of an individual. The probability to test positive depends on the time since infection of an individual [25] [26] [27] . We denote the probability to test positive by a rapid test if the infected individual has been infected a days ago by Q(a) (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 in  \u00a7S7) .",

This is a known effect [10, 11] , yet cannot be captured by deterministic epidemiological models. One important consequence of this theoretical underestimation of classically used models is that parameter inference during the early phase of an epidemic of, for example, the basic reproduction number, will result in an overestimation of the true value [17] . We provide a new mathematical description of the expected epidemic size over time that could be used in statistical inference during the early phase of emerging epidemics.",

While in principle applicable to any type of detection event, as for instance the first death or the first hospitalization event, we have focused on dating the emergence of the Alpha variant that was first sampled in the UK on 20 September 2020. Our analysis is appropriate for clusters that descend from a single infected individual, and as long as population immunity is low enough for the supply of susceptible individuals to be unlimited. The Alpha variant was first detected in England in September 2020 and likely emerged there once, so our analysis can be applied to it. It would not apply, for example, to the Delta variant in the UK, unless the cluster linked to the first importation of the variant could be identified-and so the date of importation could be estimated. On average, we find that the Alpha cluster was started 46 days before its detection, which means that the variant was likely present in the UK on 4 August 2020. Usually, phylogenetic methods are used to date the evolutionary history of mutations [28] . In this particular case, a phylogenetic approach is difficult because of the large divergence between Alpha and non-Alpha variants sampled at a similar time [19] . Indeed, we did not find a published estimate of the date of emergence of the Alpha variant based on a phylogenetic analysis. In an attempt to date the origin of SARS-CoV-2, a combination of phylogenetic and epidemiological methods has been used to obtain a more complete picture of the very early dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic [29] . Our new description for early epidemic growth provides a formal non-spatial description of the individual-based simulations that were used in [29] to date the very first COVID-19 case.",

The previously proposed method [30] inevitably results in an overestimate of the actual epidemic size. Previous research has also shown that if the probability of detection since infection were constant over time, which is not the case in our setting, the cluster size at detection would be geometrically distributed [31, 32] . Whether the distribution of cluster sizes at detection is a geometric distribution if the detection process is not constant in time, is an open question.

Currently (May 2021), aside from vaccination campaigns, frequent testing is seen as a possible solution to relax COVID-19-related restrictions in the short term. Our modelling approach gives an estimation of the minimal testing frequency per day to detect epidemic clusters of a certain size, for example small enough for manual contact tracing to be feasible. The minimal testing frequency depends on the test that is employed. In our numerical example, we have used the detection probability estimated for rapid tests, which were collected during the early phase of the epidemic in the UK in 2020 [27] . Since then, tests have improved so that our estimation of the minimal testing frequency is very likely an overestimate. We find that for a cluster size to be below 30 infected individuals (on average), each day around 0.13% of a total population would need to be randomly selected for testing, i.e. independently of the individual's infection status. Pooled sample testing strategies could be a solution to reduce the number of testing kits needed, and is a particularly reasonable option when the prevalence of infected individuals in a community is close to zero [33] .",

As an application, we approximated the probability distribution for the timing of a first infected individual in an epidemic cluster. This distribution can be used to estimate, for example, the emergence of new variants of a pathogen, like the Alpha variant. In addition, we derived the minimal testing frequency to detect clusters below a certain size.
