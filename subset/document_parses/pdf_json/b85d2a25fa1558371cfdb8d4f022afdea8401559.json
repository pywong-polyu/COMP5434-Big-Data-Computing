However, compliance with these guidelines has been inconsistent. This correlational study examined whether individual differences in risky decision-making and motivational propensities predicted compliance with COVID-19 preventative behaviors in a sample of US adults (N = 404). Participants completed an online study from September through December 2020 that included a risky choice decision-making task, temporal discounting task, and measures of appropriate mask-wearing, social distancing, and perceived risk of engaging in public activities. Linear regression results indicated that greater temporal discounting and risky decision-making were associated with less appropriate mask-wearing behavior and social distancing. Additionally, demographic factors, including personal experience with COVID-19 and financial difficulties due to COVID-19, were also associated with differences in COVID-19 preventative behaviors. Path analysis results showed that risky decision-making behavior, temporal discounting, and risk perception collectively predicted 55% of the variance in appropriate mask-wearing behavior. Individual differences in general decision-making patterns are therefore highly predictive of who complies with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.",

            "text": "In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, normal social activities like going to the mall or meeting with friends engender a certain level of risk. COVID-19, or coronavirus, is a contagious respiratory virus that spreads through close-contact airborne and droplet transmission [1] . To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that people wear face masks, avoid nonessential indoor activities, engage in social distancing by staying at least six feet apart from other people when in public places, and avoid inperson gatherings [2] . However, Americans have exhibited mixed responses to these guidelines with some individuals strictly adhering to these recommendations while others choose not to heed them. Indeed, a simple trip to the grocery store could become a highly polarizing event. For example, if a store required face masks to enter, it is not uncommon to see people wearing their masks incorrectly on their chin or removing them upon entry. Some people may silently feel outraged towards people that are not complying with CDC guidelines, while others may feel a sense of solidarity in defying this 'new norm'. The factors that predict whether or not individuals will engage in COVID-19 preventative behavior are not well understood. Some have proposed that compliance with mask-wearing and social distancing may be based less on scientific findings and more on political affiliation [3, 4] . Others have suggested that younger adults may feel invincible, thinking that they will not get sick from COVID-19 [5] ; thus, another view is that age may be a factor that affects compliance. However, empirical research examining decision-making factors that influence compliance with mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines is lacking. Therefore, in addition to demographic factors, this study seeks to examine whether certain decision-making constructs, such as risky decision-making and temporal discounting, are predictive of compliance with appropriate mask-wearing and social distancing behaviors.",

Below we define each of the four constructs examined in this study and describe how they may be related to COVID-19 preventative behavior.",

For example, a decision-maker might choose between an alternative that has a 100% probability of providing $5 or an alternative that has a 50% probability of providing $20 but also a 50% probability of yielding $0. The decision to comply with social distancing guidelines can be framed as a decision under risk. A decision-maker can choose the safe option of maintaining one's health by choosing to wear masks and social distance. Alternatively, a person could choose the risky option of interacting with others, in which he or she benefits from the enjoyment of social interactions at the possible cost of contracting COVID-19 and/or infecting others. While there is an element of uncertainty in knowing exactly who is infected in a given setting, each state's public health department makes its daily infection rates publicly available.",

Sensitivity to expected value can provide objective information about decision-making behavior that maximizes the likelihood of reward [7] . Choosing options with higher expected values reflects increased sensitivity to differences in expected value between choice options [7, 8] . As evidenced by performance on decision-making paradigms such as the Iowa Gambling Task [9, 10] and the Cups Task [7, 8] , this increased sensitivity can lead to reward maximization [7, 8] . People do not always base decisions solely on reward maximization however and instead, frequently choose options that maximize certainty over larger, uncertain gains (risk aversion) [11] . Psychological and economic studies have shown that risk preferences are often not monotonic, and risky decisions can change under different conditions [12] [13] [14] . Individual differences in risk aversion have been observed due to such factors as age, gender, and personality [15] [16] [17] . Given that reward sensitivity and risk level can differentially influence decision-making, it is important to consider how both factors may affect COVID-19 preventative behavior. This study seeks to determine whether increased risky decision-making may be associated with decreased mask-wearing and social distancing behavior.",

People tend to perceive the risk of a phenomenon as high when it is outside of one's control, may have catastrophic potential or fatal outcomes, or when it is a new risk [18] . Risk perception is also influenced by the affect heuristic, in which people's positive or negative feelings towards an activity or phenomenon guides their evaluation of its risk [19] . When people believe that they can feel pleasure from engaging in an activity, such as engaging with friends despite being amid a pandemic, the perceived risk of that activity may be low. On the other hand, when individuals have a first-hand negative experience with a potentially risky event, such as watching someone pass away from COVID-19 complications, then they may feel more negatively towards that event and perceive the risk as high. When risk perception is high, people should want to see that risk minimized [20, 21] . However, it is unclear whether that also means that they are willing to take action to mitigate that risk themselves. In evaluating the perceived risk of COVID-19, there are clear opposing forces at play-the high benefit of social interactions may decrease the perceived risk of COVID-19, but the risk of a new, potentially fatal virus may increase the perceived risk. It is expected that individuals with first-hand COVID-19 experience will have higher risk perception and that higher risk perception will enhance COVID-19 preventative behavior.",

The optimism bias reflects the belief that negative events have a lower likelihood of affecting oneself compared to other people, while positive events are more likely to affect oneself [22, 23] . This bias in risk perception occurs when people attempt to predict the likelihood of future events occurring and result in a disconnect between perceived and actual risk. The optimism bias was observed during risk evaluations for the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 [24, 25] . Similarly, it is reasonable to predict that, on average, individuals may perceive that their risk of contracting COVID-19 may be lower than the risk of one's peers contracting the virus.",

The subjective value placed on reward options tends to decline as the time delay for those rewards increases. For example, given the choice between receiving a small amount of money now (e.g., $5 now) or a larger amount of money after a time delay, such as getting $10 after one month, many people would prefer the former option [27] . From an economic perspective, such decisions are 'irrational' because the objective value of the delayed option is larger than the immediate option. However, from a psychological perspective, immediate rewards elicit more tangible positive emotions in the present compared to imagining how one might feel in the future [28, 29] . Representations of future rewards also tend to be more abstract, while immediate rewards are more concrete and vivid [30, 31] . Individual differences in temporal discounting have been shown to predict maladaptive health behaviors, including drug and alcohol use, unhealthy eating, general prophylactic health behaviors, and lack of exercise [32] [33] [34] [35] .",

Previous research with H1N1 responses showed that people who perceived the risk of contracting H1N1 as high exhibited low risk-taking behaviors and high avoidance behaviors, like avoiding heavily populated areas [36, 37] . Some studies showed that people who exhibited more signs of worry about contracting the virus tended to engage in more preventative measures [36, 38] . Another study indicated that people who resided in areas with a high concentration of the virus reported the belief in a higher likelihood of catching the virus but showed no signs of a higher degree of engagement of preventative behaviors [39] . In terms of demographics, risk-aversive behavior was associated with older age [37] and larger household size [39] . Additionally, previous research indicates that preventative behaviors decreased over time [37, 39] , suggesting a decrease in risk perception and a subsequent increase in risky behaviors. While some research on preventative behaviors during the H1N1 pandemic exists, measures of risk-taking behaviors and delayed discounting and their relationship to H1N1 responses are far scarcer. This fundamental gap in research with prior pandemics motivated the design of the present study on COVID-19 preventative behaviors.",

We anticipated an exclusion rate of 15% due to missed attention checks, incomplete responses, or duplicate responses. The goal was therefore to recruit at least 200 participants. This study was pre-registered through the Open Science Framework (OSF): https://osf.io/kavxr. The data are also available through OSF: https://osf.io/xy6aj Participants This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Clemson University (IRB Approval Number 2020-220) before procedures were implemented. Participants were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and data collection occurred in two waves: the first wave (N = 220) occurred from 9/7/2020-9/11/2020, and the second wave (N = 200) occurred from 12/29/2020-12/30/2020. Study participation was voluntary. A total of 420 participants were recruited to complete the study online. Previous work has shown that several experimental cognitive psychology paradigms conducted MTurk have a high degree of reliability with laboratory-based results [48] . The typical risky decision-making trends in which individuals tend to be more risk-seeking in loss contexts and risk-averse in gain contexts have also been observed in MTurk samples with minimal differences in effect sizes compared to studies performed in a laboratory [49] . Therefore, there is evidence that MTurk is a reliable way to collect data using standard decision-making paradigms.",

Although participants were prevented from taking the study with the same MTurk Worker ID more than once, we identified several cases of duplicate IP addresses. Three attention check questions (e.g., \"If you are reading this question, please choose Option C\") were included throughout the study. These questions were modeled after instructional manipulation checks from previous research with unsupervised participants [49, 50] . Previous psychology research using MTurk and other online platforms have recommended using such attention check questions to improve the reliability of the data [49] [50] [51] .",

Mask-wearing behavior, interpersonal social interactions, social distancing activities, optimism bias towards coronavirus, and perceived risk of engaging in public activities were included as outcome measures. Covariates in the study included age, political affiliation, geographic region, income level, negative financial experiences due to COVID-19, and personal health experience with COVID-19 (e.g., knowing someone who became ill or died from COVID-19, contracting COVID-19 themselves). Geographic region was a non-significant predictor in all analyses and was trimmed from all models for simplicity.

A significant body of research comparing the effects of real to hypothetical rewards has demonstrated that temporal discounting rates are highly similar under both conditions [54] [55] [56] [57] , which suggests that hypothetical rewards are a valid proxy for incentivized rewards in temporal discounting experiments. As such, participants were asked questions about non-incentivized, hypothetical situations regarding whether they would prefer a certain amount of money now or a larger sum after a certain number of days. Four time-delays (7 days, 30 days, 180 days, and 365 days) were presented in random order, and the starting amount was $5. Each question increased the previous monetary amount by $5 until reaching $30 for the instant reward choice. An example question was \"Would you rather have $5 now or $30 after 7 days?\". Participants' indifference points, or the smallest sum of money for which they first indicated their preference for the instant gratification reward over the delayed reward, was then recorded. To evaluate the overall preference for instant gratification against delayed gratification, an area under the curve (AUC) approach was employed. Smaller AUC values indicate a stronger preference for immediate gratification over larger delayed rewards.",

When a risky option has a higher expected value than a safe option, it is advantageous to choose the risky option. The results indicated that risky choices in these advantageous contexts were not predictive of compliance behavior. Instead, greater risk-taking in disadvantageous contexts in which the expected value for the risky option was lower than the safe option predicted diminished compliance behavior. This finding suggests that individuals who are less sensitive to changes in expected value and exhibit less adaptive risky decisionmaking behavior are less likely to engage in mask-wearing and social distancing during the pandemic. Individuals who chose the risky option more frequently in equal expected value contexts (when the expected values for the risky and safe options matched) behaved similarly to those who chose more disadvantageous risky choices. However, the magnitude of the relationship between risk-taking and noncompliant behavior was greater in the disadvantageous contexts than in the equal contexts. It should be noted that the average percentage of risky choices across all participants in equal and disadvantageous contexts was low-less than 20%. Moreover, over half (57%) of participants chose the safe option on all disadvantageous trials, and 47% chose the safe option on all equal expected value trials. The relationship between risktaking and compliance behavior appears to be driven by a minority of participants, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Nevertheless, the behavior of even a minority of individuals can have substantial impacts during a pandemic. Recent estimates indicate that approximately 10% of infected individuals account for 80% of COVID-19 transmission [75] . Though a minority of individuals engage in equal and disadvantageous risky decision-making, the corresponding decrease in compliance with mask-wearing and social distancing observed in this study could have wide-ranging consequences for spreading COVID-19. Furthermore, previous work has shown that temporal discounting is associated with maladaptive health behaviors, including unhealthy eating and engaging in risky sexual activities [33] [34] [35] . Our findings build on this prior work by showing that temporal discounting is also predictive of engagement in COVID-19 preventative behaviors. Thus, this work provides empirical evidence that individual differences in risk-taking and motivation influence compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.",

Our findings are consistent with this research; on average, individuals underestimated their likelihood of contracting COVID-19 compared to their peers by 7.9%. No relationship between risk-taking behavior or temporal discounting was associated with the magnitude of the optimism bias in this study. While it was anticipated that a stronger optimism bias would be associated with reduced compliance with COVID-19 preventative behavior, correlational results suggest an opposing view. The optimism bias was associated with increased social distancing and mask-wearing behavior, which was unexpected. However, concern for others has been associated with increased generosity towards strangers [76] . It is, therefore, possible that increased risk perception of spreading COVID-19 to others may increase concern for others, leading to increased mask-wearing and social distancing to protect others. This explanation is speculative, and future research is needed to replicate this relationship and further examine the role of the optimism bias in COVID-19 preventative behaviors.",

This observed relationship is also in line with prior work showing that when people perceive an event as high risk, they want the risk reduced and support the establishment of risk-reduction regulations [20, 21] . The desire for a risk to be reduced is not the same as taking action to reduce the risk yourself though, and it was unclear whether heightened risk perception would be associated with actual increases in COVID-19 preventative behavior.

From another perspective, however, this result may have implications for risk compensation, which proposes that individuals adapt their behavior based on their level of the perceived risk of that behavior, typically behaving in a more risk-taking way when perceived risk is low [77] . This theory has been observed in safety contexts in which having more protective measures in place, such as safety equipment [78, 79] , increases people's risk-taking behavior because these protective measures decrease one's perceived level of risk. Applied to COVID-19 preventative behavior, it is possible that if people perceive the risk of social activities as lower when others are engaging in prophylactic behaviors-wearing masks or social distancing, then they may be more willing to empirically engage in those social activities. Future research is needed to examine risk compensation in the context of COVID-19 preventative behavior.",

Exploratory analyses examining the effect of political affiliation alone on mask-wearing and social distancing showed that Democrats and Independents engaged in more social distancing and appropriate mask-wearing behavior than Republicans (see S1 File). However, political affiliation was not significant in the regression model, which suggests that political affiliation is not predictive of mask-wearing and social distancing over and above the behavioral decision-making factors of risk-taking, temporal discounting, and perceived risk. In other words, risk-taking and temporal discounting are stronger predictors of mask-wearing and social distancing than political affiliation. Outside of political affiliation, the results indicated that those that participated in the study in December reported increased mask-wearing and social distancing than those that participated in September. This result is consistent with research from the COVID States Project [53] showing that mask-wearing behavior has increased since the pandemic began. Therefore, while political affiliation may be a divisive factor in terms of COVID-19 risk perception, the data suggest that, on the whole, individuals' mask-wearing and social distancing behavior increased between September and December 2020.",

This finding diverges from previous research showing a positive relationship between worry and prosocial behavioral changes [36, 38, 42] .

The results showed that risk perception and engagement in non-essential social activities mediated the relationship between decision-making and mask-wearing behavior. Specifically, individual differences in risky decision-making predicted both perceived risk and actual risk-reduction behavior. Risky decisionmaking predicts reduced risk perception which, in turn, leads to diminished mask-wearing behavior. One possible explanation for this relationship is that individuals who regularly make risky choices may not view the COVID-19 pandemic as perilous relative to some of the other risks they have taken. The path model has demonstrated that the relationship between temporal discounting and mask-wearing behavior is mediated by engagement in non-essential social activities, but not risk perception. People who are more motivated by immediate gratification engage in more non-essential social interactions to experience the pleasure of those activities and interactions at the expense of long-term public health consequences. Engaging in more of these immediately rewarding social activities may mean that these individuals encounter more incidents in which masks and social distancing should be employed, yet they choose to engage in less appropriate mask-wearing behavior. Risky decision-making behavior, temporal discounting, and risk perception collectively predicted 55% of the variance in appropriate maskwearing behavior. Individual differences in general decision-making patterns are therefore highly predictive of who complies with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.",

Some individuals who report lower adherence to preventive measures may have been disregarding such guidelines throughout the entire pandemic duration. However, others may have been rigidly following guidelines early in the pandemic but may have begun to disregard the warnings due to a type of \"quarantine burnout\" in which people have simply run out of willpower to enact safe practices every time they leave their house. This idea fits with our finding that instant gratification may influence COVID-19 compliance behaviors. While people may still believe that COVID-19 is a serious risk, the value of long-term health and engaging in COVID-19 preventative behaviors may decline as the time duration of the pandemic increases.",

As previous work has shown that responses to the coronavirus vary across countries [40] , the present results may not extend to other countries or cultures with more collectivist values.",

Moreover, as with many studies that utilize self-report measures, social desirability biases may have influenced participants' risky choices or disclosure of mask-wearing and social distancing behavior. This study was also conducted online, and as such our findings may not generalize to individuals with limited internet or computer access. The online nature of the study means that experimental control of the study environment was limited. We also note that other factors outside of this study including personality [43] , line of work, mental health, and emotional states [42] may also play a role in COVID-19 preventative behavior. These other unexamined factors may covary with risk-taking or temporal discounting, which has the potential to inflate the observed estimation of effect sizes observed in this study. We therefore caution that the study effect sizes may represent an upper bound of the overall effect of risky decision-making and temporal discounting on COVID-19 preventative behavior. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the observed effects in this study show associations, rather than causal effects.",

This information may provide insight into ways to increase compliance with these guidelines. While public health guidelines and messaging need to emphasize the risks of COVID-19, it is also important to convey activities and opportunities that can be immediately rewarding. This approach may provide an appropriate outlet for those with more risk-taking tendencies and those who seek out immediate rewards. ",
