Establishing the potential utility of a given DHT could aid in identifying how it could be best used and further opportunities for healthcare improvement. We propose a metric, a Utility Factor Score, which quantifies the benefits of a DHT by explicitly defining adherence and linking it directly to satisfaction and health goals met. To provide data for how the comparative utility score can or should work, we illustrate in detail the application of our metrics across four DHTs with two simulated users. The Utility Factor Score can potentially facilitate integration of DHTs into various healthcare settings and should be evaluated within a clinical study.",

The range of options within current DHTs provides opportunity to custom fit user needs and comfort levels. The presence of DHTs in daily life and the funding involved in their development therefore suggest that these tools will only continue to grow in number, specificity, and scope. The following categories may be useful for initial classification [8] : ",

Current approaches draw from theoretical models of technology and/or psychology and have primarily focused on predicting adoption or use. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) assumes that the decision to use a specific object is based on its perceived ease of use as well as the perceived usefulness of the object [9] [10] [11] . Since its inception, TAM has undergone several iterations, most recently the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology which improved predictive ability by including social variables [11] . However, several recent studies modified the original TAM to explore acceptance of DHTs and related this to intention to use rather than actual use [12, 13] . Another defined use minimally (at least once) although the focus of this study was not solely on use [11] . Critiques of TAM include the interchanging of terms like acceptance, adoption, and use, and direct use (particularly consistent use) is not typically measured [12] . Moreover, because TAM was developed for measurement of acceptance in environments where technology use is mandatory, it is unclear how this may impact this model's utility.",

Some reports have suggested wearable technology use declines or ceases after six months, with similar estimates for smartphone apps [17, 18] . The current literature evaluating wearable devices indicates little benefit of the devices on chronic disease health outcomes [19] . Any attempt to quantify the utility of a DHT must consider how much and what type of use is necessary to achieve a goal. Another gap is related to satisfaction. Most phones come preprogrammed with healthoriented applications (e.g., Apple Health, Samsung health). If someone is satisfied with a product, they may be more likely to recommend it to others which may indicate a higher likelihood of becoming socially acceptable (a component of both TPB and TAM).",

We also suggest that the goal or \"outcome\" is what primarily should drive the weighting approach and secondarily healthcare practitioner or consumer preferences. For example, a goal of a DHT (like Headspace) to help reduce anxiety may have more frequent adherence needs than another DHT to help reduce weight that might be daily. This would therefore require a change in the adherence weighting. Because we consider the weight of each variable's contribution, different scores could be considered a \"good\" score for DHTs themselves and the specific goals attained. For example, one score could New value = (value \u2212 min)\u2215(max \u2212 min) * 100 Fig. 1 Utility Factor Score. Adherence is defined as the amount of use per digital health tool (DHT). Health goals defined as type of health goal met. Satisfaction defined as whether a user would recommend a specific DHT be considered \"good\" for a phone application aimed at reducing anxiety whereas a \"good\" score for a wearable designed to aid in weight loss might be different. These scores could be obtained from users during regular visits to their healthcare practitioners and then averaged across different tools and goals.

For example, though User 2 had a markedly lower utility score (0.5) for the mySgr DHT vsUser 11 (23.6). User 2 experienced a goal of 1 h on average per day in the number of hours with blood sugar in the normal range (70 to 99 mg/dL) vs. User 1's 10 h. Similar comparisons may be made for Headspace and the role of the goal of numbers of hours slept on average per day (User 2's utility score of 48.6 vs User 1's utility score of 16.7). In establishing these scores a patient/user should have sufficient experience with a given DHT and suggest that 2-4 weeks of routine would allow the time necessary to become comfortable with the device and troubleshooting a routine. We also suggest several approaches to store user metrics for a particular DHT including 1) an application itself where one would peruse a list of DHTs which are identified by the particular goal in mind; 2) the UF as a score that is advertised with an application (i.e., Apple App Store or Google Playstore); and 3) as a tool associated with facility or a health care system or (i.e. Veterans Healthcare Administration).

And, despite the popularity of DHTs, few studies assess how satisfaction relates to health goals. We propose defining use, and linking it directly the types of health goals met and to adherence and satisfaction elements through the creation of a novel Utility Factor score that should quantify a DHT's ability to provide benefit to and inform consumers. Our simulations suggest that sustained attention should be made to the goals or outcomes achieved rather than simply satisfaction and adherence when evaluating DHTs. One advantage of our approach is its applicability to different types of DHTs with different health goals. The generalizability of defining utility as a function of health goals met, satisfaction, and adherence allows consumers and healthcare practitioners to select and deploy from a wide array of DHTs to address their needs. In summary, the Utility Factor Score can potentially facilitate integration of DHTs into various healthcare settings and should be evaluated within a clinical study. A clinical study would help elucidate many of the \"nuts and bolts\" details associated with use of the scoring algorithm, namely how to define G, how heavily to weight x,y,z, and who keeps the results data.",
