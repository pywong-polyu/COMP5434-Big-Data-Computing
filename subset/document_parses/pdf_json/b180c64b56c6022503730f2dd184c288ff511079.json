Herein, using K18-hACE2 mice, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and encephalitis is associated with mortality in these mice. Intranasal infection of K18-hACE2 mice with 10 5 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 100% mortality by day 6 after infection. The highest virus titers in the lungs were observed on day 3 and declined on days 5 and 6 after infection. By contrast, very high levels of infectious virus were uniformly detected in the brains of all the animals on days 5 and 6. Onset of severe disease in infected mice correlated with peak viral levels in the brain. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited encephalitis hallmarks characterized by production of cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and neuronal cell death. SARS-CoV-2 was also found to productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain by this route after intranasal infection. Our data indicate that direct infection of CNS cells together with the induced inflammatory response in the brain resulted in the severe disease observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice.",

K18-hACE2-transgenic mice were originally developed for the study of SARS-CoV-1 pathogenesis. hACE2 expression in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice is driven by the human cytokeratin 18 (K18) promoter. It was recently reported that intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 results in a rapidly fatal disease in K18-hACE2 mice [22] [23] [24] [25] . These studies were focused on describing the acute lung injury in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice that was associated with high levels of inflammatory cytokines and accumulation of immune cells in the lungs [22] [23] [24] [25] . In these published studies, neither infectious virus nor viral RNA was detected in the olfactory bulbs or brains of the majority of the infected animals, indicating restricted neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice. In the present study, we show that intranasal infection of six-week-old K18-hACE2 mice by SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe neurological disease, with the brain being a major target organ for infection by this route of infection, and neuroinflammation and neuronal death contributing to the infection-associated morbidity and mortality. The data also suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be trafficked to the brain via the olfactory bulb with subsequent transneuronal spread, as has been reported for other coronaviruses [26, 27] .",

The protocol was approved by the GSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol number A20044). Six-week-old hemizygous K18-hACE2 mice were infected with 10 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 under ABSL-3 containment by intranasal inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) was isolated from an oropharyngeal swab from a patient in Washington, USA (BEI NR-52281) [28] . Animals in the control group received equivalent amounts of sterile PBS via the same route. Roughly equal numbers of male and female mice were used. Animals were weighed and their appetite, activity, breathing and neurological signs assessed twice daily [29, 30] . Mice that met the human endpoint criteria were euthanized to limit suffering. In independent experiments, mice were inoculated with PBS (Mock) or SARS-CoV-2 intranasally, and on days 1, 3, 5 and 6 after infection, animals were anesthetized using isoflurane and perfused with cold PBS; then, respiratory (nasal turbinate and lung) and other tissues (spleen, heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, eye, olfactory bulb and brain) were collected and flash frozen in 2-methylbutane (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) [31] [32] [33] . Alternatively, mice were perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and tissues were harvested and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) as described previously [31, 34] .",

High virus levels were observed in the lungs on day 1, reached peak levels on day 3 and declined on days 5 and 6 after infection ( Figure 1C,D) . In contrast, virus was not detected in the brain on day one after infection, but was present by day 3. Very high levels of viral RNA and infectious virus were detected in the brains of all the animals by days 5 and 6 after infection ( Figure 1E ,F).

In the olfactory bulbs and eyes, low levels of viral RNA were detected on days 1 and 3 after infection, with very high levels of viral RNA detected in all the animals on days 5 and 6 after infection, indicating productive infection within the olfactory system ( Figure 2 ). By contrast, little if any virus was detected in the serum of infected mice at any time after infection. Since the K18 promoter is known to be active in the epithelium of multiple organs of K18-hACE2 mice [27, 36] , we also evaluated viral RNA levels in other peripheral organs.

There was a slight increase in RNA levels on day 3 and/or 5 in each of these organs, suggesting limited virus replication at these sites ( Figure 2 ).

In these studies, viral RNA was undetectable in the brains of the majority of the infected animals, indicating a limited role of brain infection in disease induction. An important distinction between our study and others is that we detected high infectious virus titers in the olfactory system and brains of 100% of the infected K18-hACE2 mice. This phenotype was not consistently observed in the aforementioned K18-hACE2 mouse studies [22] [23] [24] [25] . Moreover, none of the published studies evaluated the extent of neuroinflammation and neuropathology at the later stages of infection. Our results showed that the inflammatory response was more pronounced in the brain than in the lungs on days 5 and 6 after infection. Although both our study and the previous studies infected mice via the intranasal route, the other studies used older (7-to 9-week-old) K18-hACE2 mice and a lower viral dose (10 4 PFU), and in one study, only analyzed samples 3 days after infection [22] . In our study, six-week-old K18-hACE2 mice were infected with 10 5 PFU. However, unpublished data from our laboratory demonstrated that six-week-old K18-hACE2 mice infected with a lower viral dose (10 3 PFU) also exhibit a similar phenotype, suggesting that the brain is a major site of infection following infection by the intranasal route, regardless of the virus dose used. Additional studies are needed to clarify the parameters that differentially affect tissue tropism, routes of virus dissemination and mechanisms of lung and brain injuries in K18-hACE2 mice following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent studies have suggested that humans have a higher chance of developing a brain infection if they are infected intranasally with a high dose of virus [40] .",

            "text": "Alterations in smell and taste are features of COVID-19 disease in humans [8, 41] . Pathological analyses of human COVID-19 autopsy tissues detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in endothelial cells within the olfactory bulb [41, 42] . Our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb in intranasally infected K18-hACE2 mice. Virus infection of cells in these tissues in humans may explain the loss of smell associated with some COVID-19 cases [41] . The detection of virus replication in these tissues suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can access the brain by first infecting the olfactory bulb and then spreading into the brain by infecting connecting brain neuron axons. This hypothesis is consistent with previously published reports that neurotropic coronaviruses infect olfactory neurons and are transmitted to the brain via axonal transportation [8, 26, 27, 43] . Many viruses, such as HSV-1, Nipah virus, rabies virus, Hendra virus and influenza A virus, have also been shown to enter the CNS via olfactory sensory neurons [44] [45] [46] [47] . Another route by which a virus can gain access to the brain is via the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, we could not detect any virus in the serum of the infected mice at any time after infection, suggesting a limited role of BBB disruption in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion. This finding is in agreement with previously published studies that detected little or no virus in the blood of K18-hACE2 mice after infection with SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 [22] [23] [24] [25] 27, 36] .",
