A growing body of literature documents the prevalence of SSF intake in children, adolescents, and adults, likely caused by the high content of added sugars, especially sucrose or fructose, which induce strong positive hedonic stimulation of the sweetness quality sensors [3] . The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends reducing the energy provided by free sugar in SSF to less than 5% of the daily energy intake for optimal health benefit [4] . Recent literature on this topic has indicated that SSF intake in children, adolescents, and adults exceeds the intake recommended by the WHO. In the United States, a survey showed that nearly 64% of young people, aged 2-19 years, drink sugar-sweetened beverages every day [5] , which contributes to 8.4% of their total daily energy intake. Studies conducted by Brand-Miller and Aburto showed that sugar-sweetened beverage intake contributes to 5.5% and 8.3% of the total energy intake in children from Australia and Mexico, respectively [6, 7] . An increasing trend in sugar-sweetened beverage intake, equivalent to 6.5% of the total daily energy intake, was also observed among adults in the United States [8, 9] . Overconsumption of SSF has been shown to induce uncontrolled liver uptake of fructose, which leads to hepatic lipid accumulation and dyslipidemia, reduces insulin sensitivity, and elevates uric acid levels [10] . This dysregulation is related to a series of diseases, including weight gain and obesity [11] , metabolic syndrome [12] , type 2 diabetes [13] , cardiovascular disease [14] , fatty liver [15] , and hyperuricemia [16] .",

            "text": "Previous research established a critical role for screen time, including television viewing, in children's SSF intake [17] . Prolonged television viewing time was positively associated with sugar intake [18] . With the advent of the Internet era, however, the usage of mobile phones has surpassed that of viewing television [19] . Few studies have suggested that the increase in mobile phone usage is linked to increased intake of SSF [20] . Yet, the amount of time spent using mobile phones alone does not fully reflect the physical, psychological, and behavioral characteristics of mobile phone users. The Mobile Phone Addiction Index (MPAI), developed by Leung [21] to characterize mobile phone addiction symptoms and provide a comprehensive assessment of addiction level, has been widely applied in various studies around the world [22, 23] . This methodology, consisting of a 17-item MPAI scale, was used to categorize the four mobile phone addiction symptoms, including \"inability to control craving\", \"feeling anxious and lost\", \"withdrawal/escape\", and \"productivity loss\". To the best of our knowledge, until our present study, no research applied this methodology to explore the relationship between the MPAI and SSF intake.",

These factors influencing SSF intake were also included in our research. Meanwhile, a lot of discussions have focused on SSF intake in children and adolescents.

The information on intake frequency (none, less than once a month, 1-3 times a month, 1-3 times a week, 4-6 times a week, once a day, 2 times a day, 3 times a day, and above) was converted into the number of intakes per day, corresponding to the following values: 0; 0.02; 0.07; 0.29; 0.71; 1; 2; and 3. Finally, the number of intakes per day and the amount per intake were used to calculate, in grams, the total daily intake of CB, OSBB, and sugar/chocolate.

To help students better distinguish among the different types of physical activities, we made an example diagram for each type of physical activity. The IPAQ, which has widespread application in the international arena, can be used to measure the overall weekly physical activity of the public [33] . We used the following values to analyze each type of physical activity from the questionnaire: walking = 3.3 metabolism equivalents (MET); moderate-intensity activity = 4.0 MET; and vigorous-intensity activity = 8.0 MET. The formula of IPAQ was as follows: the total physical activity (MET/min/w) = the MET value of physical activity \u00d7 the amount of time spent on physical activity per day (min/d) \u00d7 the number of days of physical activity per week (d/w) [34] . We converted the continuous variables corresponding to the total physical activity into three categorical variables according to Kyu's classification, which uses cutoff values of 600 and 4000 MET/min/w [35] as follows: low total physical activity (<600 MET/min/w), moderate total physical activity (600-4000 MET/min/w), and high total physical activity (\u22654000 MET/min/w).",

To date, most studies have addressed these issues in children or adolescents, but few have focused on college students [36, 37] . Compared with children and adolescents, college students may consume higher SSF because of their characteristic independence and immaturity. Yet, little data related to college students have been available, and this topic has needed more attention. In summary, even among medical college students with relatively high nutrition health literacy, the intake of SSF is still not optimistic. The mean intakes of CB, OSBB, and sugar/chocolate were, respectively, 65.66 mL/d, 74.20 mL/d, and 4.96 g/d in male participants, and 30.42 mL/d, 71.48 mL/d, and 4.99 g/d in female participants.

In China, the number of mobile phone users has reached 847 million and is still growing [38] . Although mobile phones bring convenience, some of their hazards are also becoming increasingly apparent. Soni et al. [39] demonstrated that excessive use of mobile phones can develop into serious sleep and behavior problems, and our research also confirmed this finding. The most important finding of this study was that the MPAI was positively associated with CB and OSBB, regardless of sex, and with sugar/chocolate intake in women. This finding is in keeping with and confirms the results obtained in another study [17] . The use of the MPAI allowed us to evaluate the physical, psychological, and behavioral characteristics of mobile phone users more comprehensively than if we had used the sole amount of time spent on mobile phone as a parameter. There are two possible interpretations of our results. On the one hand, users of various electronic equipment, such as phones and television, might be more exposed to SSF commercials [40, 41] . College students who use mobile phones for longer may have more opportunities to buy SSF products, which might increase their SSF intake. On the other hand, as mentioned in the literature, participants of all ages choose SSF products as snacks rather than fruits, when viewing electronic equipment for an extended period of time [42] . Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the association between these behaviors, however, requires further investigation.",

Generally, with the increase in age, the level of education, experience and knowledge will increase accordingly, and people will become more mature and care about their health, thus decreasing their intake of SSF. Consistent with a previous study [43] , with age, the intake of OSBB significantly decreased in both sexes, whereas the intake of sugar/chocolate significantly decreased in women only. This finding suggests that age is negatively associated with SSF intake and that SSF intake in women is more susceptible to age than in men. Presumably, with age, the education level and dietary knowledge of college students improve [44] . Women also are more concerned about their appearance than men [45] , which causes them to reduce their SSF intake.",

The application capacity of the NLAQ was negatively associated with sugar/chocolate intake in both sexes, which was in line with the results obtained by Buja et al. [46] . However, the comprehension capacity of the NLAQ was positively associated with sugar/chocolate intake in men; this may be explained by research conducted by Prada et al. [47] , which indicated that participants with higher education understand the definition of free sugars better but do not necessarily apply this knowledge in practice. This behavior can be assimilated to that of smokers, who know that smoking is harmful to their health but continue to smoke because of the direct pressure exerted by their peers or the social environment [48] . This could explain why the male participants with a higher comprehension capacity had a high intake of sugar/chocolate. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the most important measure to reduce SSF intake in medical college students of different sexes is to improve their capacity to apply dietary health knowledge to their lives.",

Based on the result of this study, the mean of total expenditure for this study population was 2160.39 CNY/month. The mean of total expenditure for Chinese college students was about 1700 CNY/month according to a research report published in 2020 [49] , and the total expenditure of college students in Shanghai is higher than the national level in China. This study supported evidence from previous observations [27] that the participants consumed higher SSF when they had more pocket money in high-consumption areas. College students in highconsumption areas are more likely to buy SSF products when they have more money at their disposal. Furthermore, this study revealed that compared with low physical activity, high physical activity increased the intake of sugar/chocolate in male students. This result aligned with a previous study [28] , which demonstrated that boys who spent less time performing moderate and high-intensity physical activity reported lower consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and sugar than those who spent more time performing moderate and high-intensity physical activity. This result may be explained by the fact that vigorous-intensity exercise consumes a lot of energy [50] . In this context, sugar/chocolates are important sources of fast energy replenishment [51] .",
