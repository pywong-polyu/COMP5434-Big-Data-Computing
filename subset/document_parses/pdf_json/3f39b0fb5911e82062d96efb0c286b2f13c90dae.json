Aerosol-generating procedures are thought to increase the risk of infection to healthcare providers [4] . Tracheal intubation is one of the highest risk aerosolgenerating procedures performed due to direct exposure to the airway and potential patient coughing during induction [4, 5] and is of particular concern to frontline anaesthetic, emergency, and intensive care teams. This has created a race to manufacture aerosol containment devices including improvised protection strategies for use during tracheal intubation. There has been significant promotion of these devices on social media, resulting in rapid proliferation and discussion globally [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Whilst these innovations aim to reduce aerosol dispersal, many have not been tested and are presented as viable options with only short reports and correspondence being cited in peer review literature. Currently, the use of aerosol containment devices is not recommended by any international PPE guideline [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

Airborne particle counter flow rate was set to 2.83 l.min -1 , with detection of the ambient air occurring in 1 s sweeps.

Evidence for the safety and efficacy of these devices is lacking. Many international organisations have released consistent recommendations in the appropriate use of PPE based on the modes of viral transmission. None of these recommendations include these novel devices [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The dispersal of droplets and airborne particles from the patient depends on the aerosol (size, flow rates, turbulence, physiochemical properties) and patient (position, lung function) characteristics [18] [19] [20] . It is not clear in the manufacturing specifications of these novel devices that variables such as these have been fully considered in addition to the variability of employing these devices. The use of such devices adds to the complexity of an already complex procedure (tracheal intubation following local COVID-19 protocols including airborne PPE use) with the potential to compromise the safety of both the laryngoscopist and the patient [21] .",

Spikes of airborne particles were clearly seen on the time series graph, coinciding with patient coughing. We hypothesise that these represent particles escaping from the arm access holes in the aerosol box as a result of the Bernoulli principle. This was demonstrated in a recent simulation study by Dalli et al. [24] where photographic images showed that substantial amounts of air moved out of aerosol boxes into the operating theatre during coughing. These data may be extrapolated to assess the utility of aerosol containment devices for tracheal extubation, where coughing is far more likely. However, this was not the objective of this study and further trials would need to be conducted.",

The sealed box with suction appears to maintain airborne particle count at baseline but only with the use of ongoing suction. We hypothesise that the efficacy of suction depends on the negative pressure generated, relative to the volume of the sealed box, the potential leak of the sealed box, and the length of time it takes for the air within the sealed box to become saturated with aerosol. While the sealed box was effective at maintaining environmental airborne particle counts, its design renders tracheal intubation mechanically impossible. It does, however, demonstrate the degree of enclosure necessary to eliminate particle contamination.",

There was significant variability in the airborne particle in the aerosol box, no intervention group, and vertical sheet setups compared to the other methods. This suggests that the level of laryngoscopist exposure is unpredictable and likely influenced by the aerosol containment device set-up and the volume, negative pressure generated from suction and frequency of patient coughing. To better assess variability, an increased number of subjects would be required, yet such variability suggests an inability to fully predict airborne particle contamination based on device alone. This experiment also did not assess the particle count for individuals at the side of the bed or elsewhere in the room. Given airborne particles are known to spread over distances greater than 1.5 m [1, 2, 23] , this is especially pertinent for the laryngoscopist's assistant, who is often standing very close to the patient's head during tracheal intubation and extubation.",

A sealed box with suction appears to decrease airborne particle exposure of the laryngoscopist, although whether it hinders assistance or execution of tracheal intubation remains a point of study. Further large-scale studies are needed to examine aerosol containment devices in this context, as well as others, such as tracheal extubation. The use of any aerosol containment device has been eliminated from our intubation protocols until their safety can be properly established. ",
