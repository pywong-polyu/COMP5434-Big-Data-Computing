Using two-wave panel survey data in Singapore, we found that information overload is associated with news fatigue as well as with difficulty in analyzing information. News fatigue and analysis paralysis also subsequently led to news avoidance, which increased belief in COVID-19 misinformation. However, this link is present only among those who are frequently exposed to misinformation about COVID-19.",

Inaccurate claims about the origin of the virus, home remedies to kill the virus, as well as about COVID-19 vaccination went viral on social media during the pandemic. A number of factors has been examined that may help explain why some individuals believe in misinformation, such as repeated exposure to the misinformation (Fazio et al., 2015; Pennycook et al., 2018) and confirmation bias, or when the fake news aligns with an individual's pre-existing beliefs (Cha et al., 2020; Ling, 2020 ). An important factor that some studies have explored is information overload (Bawden and Robinson, 2020) . For example, Apuke and Omar (2021) found in a study involving social media users in Nigeria that information overload was related to frequency of sharing fake news related to COVID-19. Lazer et al. (2017) also argued that information overload, coupled with limited individual attention, may prevent adequate assessment of information on social media, which may contribute to misinformation. However, the pathway between information overload and believing in wrong information has not been sufficiently explored.",

News plays an important role in keeping the public informed about various issues and occurrences. By being informed, citizens can hopefully make better decisions, from whether they should bring an umbrella today to whether they should support a political party. This is why news is considered integral to a functioning democracy-people need regular access to accurate and reliable information to be able to responsibly participate in public affairs (Schudson, 2008) . And yet, as fake news rose to buzzword status, news organizations in many parts of the world are seeing continuous decline in readership. While part of it comes from intense competition, part of it also comes from an increasing number of people actively avoiding the news.",

Information overload is particularly relevant to the small city-state of Singapore, which has universal internet access and high levels of internet and social media use (Statista, 2019) . The Singapore Government also turned to social media platforms, such as the messaging app WhatsApp, on top of traditional news media, to update residents about number of COVID-19 cases and new regulations (Tandoc and Lee, 2020) . While Singapore has a very small traditional news media market, dominated by one company that controls all newspapers and another company that controls all broadcast channels-both of which have strong ties with the government-Singapore residents also easily get their news from international sources, such as the BBC (Tandoc, 2021) . Building on the growing body of work on information overload and news avoidance (e.g. Edgerly et al., 2017; Holton and Chyi, 2012; Park, 2019; Skovsgaard and Andersen, 2020; Song et al., 2016; Van Den Bulck, 2006) , especially during the COVID-19 pandemic (De Bruin et al., 2021; Ytre-Arne and Moe, 2021) , and using a two-wave national survey conducted in Singapore, a small nation that recorded among the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Asia, this current study revisits the link between information overload and news avoidance during the pandemic, and how this link may also affect belief in misinformation about COVID-19.",

            "text": "Humans are said to be cognitive misers. Our capacity to process stimuli is limited, so our \"basic tendency is to default to processing mechanisms of low computational expense\" (Stanovich, 2018: 424) . Such limited capacity becomes salient in the context of information abundance, which can make individuals feel overloaded with information, or what others referred to as information overload. This situation occurs \"when informationprocessing demands on the individual exceed their capacity to process the information, rendering them unable to process all informational inputs\" (Pentina and Tarafdar, 2014) . Studies have explored potential causes of information overload, particularly in the context of news. For example, Pentina and Tarafdar (2014: 213) identified the following reasons for information overload in the context of online news: \"the sheer number and variety of news sources, the limited time available to process them, and the increasingly un-organized and non-verified content that is available from peer-produced and peercurated sources such as blogs and social networks.\" Information overload is related to how individuals navigate the presence of multiple choices. While having options is often a positive experience, the presence of too many options at some point can become cognitively challenging for individuals. Edgerly (2017: 362) argued: \"When presented with many options, individuals find it hard to actively compare and evaluate attributes across options and, as a result, will take themselves out of the decision-making process.\" The negative impact of being confronted by an overload of choices, or what Scheibehenne et al. (2010: 409) referred to as the \"choice overload hypothesis,\" has been investigated across different contexts. For example, D'Angelo and Toma (2017) found that online daters who had chosen their respective dates from a set of 24 potential partners reported feeling less satisfied with their choice after a week compared with those who had chosen their dates from a set of only six options. Choosing places to travel or making decisions on online shopping were also found to be hampered by the presence of too many choices (Chen et al., 2009; Park and Jang, 2013) .",

(2016) proposed a theoretical model to examine the consequences of news overload. Through an online survey of 1200 adults in South Korea, they found that the higher the level of perceived news overload an individual reports, the more likely the individual to also suffer from analysis paralysis and news-related fatigue (Song et al., 2016) . Analysis paralysis refers to the \"inability to make decisions\" in the midst of too much information (White and Dorman, 2000: 160) ; Song et al. (2016) operationalized this in their model as an individual's self-reported difficulty in processing information. News fatigue, on the other hand, refers to \"the subjective, self-evaluated feeling of being tired of news consumption\" (Song et al., 2016 (Song et al., : 1179 . They found that news overload led to news fatigue, but not to analysis paralysis; they also found that news fatigue is correlated with analysis paralysis (Song et al., 2016) . However, the study focused on general news and not on a specific news topic, which could explain why it did not find a link between news overload and news paralysis. This current study thus adopts the theoretical model earlier proposed by Song et al. (2016) and examines it in the specific context of COVID-19-related news. Indeed, studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic have documented experiences of information overload due to the sheer volume of COVID-19-related information. For example, interviews with media consumers in Norway revealed how some experienced feeling that information about COVID-19 was \"just too much\" and that they found difficult to keep up (Ytre-Arne and Moe, 2021: 1748). Thus, guided by previous research on information overload during the COVID-19 pandemic (De Bruin et al., 2021; Ytre-Arne and Moe, 2021) and the framework earlier proposed by Song et al. (2016) , we are focusing on COVID-19-related news and hypothesize that:",

They observed that: \"Despite increasing attention to the concept, scholars are far from reaching consensus on the extent of news avoidance\" (Skovsgaard and Andersen, 2020: 460 ). An earlier iteration was \"newscast avoidance\" which was coined in the context of political activists shunning daily television newscasts because they are dissatisfied with the political developments being reported (Grupp, 1970) . In a study of television news exposure of secondary school students in Belgium, Van den Bulck (2006) proposed four types of television news exposure that also brings in the element of intentionality: intentional news selection, unintentional news selection, intentional news avoidance, and unintentional news avoidance. While the unintentional news avoider \"watches the news rarely, not because they do not want to but because structural factors pull them away from the news,\" the intentional news avoider \"does not like the news and consciously seeks to avoid watching it\" (Van Den Bulck, 2006: 248) . This distinction between intentional and unintentional news avoidance is important: \"Understanding the underlying causes for these different types of news avoidance is crucial for understanding that they demand solutions at different levels\" (Skovsgaard and Andersen, 2020: 460) .",

In proposing their model, Song et al. (2016 Song et al.

Another study in South Korea also found that information overload directly led to news avoidance even in the context of social media (Park, 2019) . This is also consistent with what other studies during the pandemic found, that information overload is linked with news avoidance (De Bruin et al., 2021; Ytre-Arne and Moe, 2021).

(2016) found that those who actively avoid the news were more likely to engage in news curation, which refers to using news aggregators to select and limit the news stories they receive. Edgerly et al. (2017) also found that news avoiders tend to have the lowest levels of political participation. However, does avoiding the news, which contains factual reports, lead to belief in misinformation? A survey of students, faculty, and staff members in two universities in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic found that information overload was positively related to sharing of unverified information (Laato et al., 2020) . Sharing an article, however, may not necessarily mean believing in the article . Therefore, this current study builds on these previous studies and examines whether news avoidance is also positively related to believing in COVID-19 misinformation. While studies have distinguished between misinformation and disinformation by defining the former as inadvertent dissemination of inaccurate information and the latter as the intentional creation and propagation of falsehoods (Tandoc et al., 2017; Wardle, 2017) , we are using the general term of misinformation, since it is beyond the scope of our study to scrutinize the intention behind the dissemination of falsehoods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fake news refers to a specific type of misinformation that uses the format and language of real news, but since in this study we showed participants summaries of fake news narratives, instead of the whole fake news story, we use the more general term misinformation. Thus, we also predict that:",

            "text": "News outlets in Singapore, just like in many other countries, devoted much of their day-to-day coverage to reporting about the developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, avoiding the news may not necessarily mean avoiding all information about COVID-19 altogether, including both accurate and inaccurate information about the pandemic. For example, interviews with young adults in Singapore at the earlier stages of the pandemic showed that while some participants said they actively avoided news related to the pandemic, they still heard about it from interpersonal discussions with friends and family, in person as well as online, like in their family groupchats, where some received inaccurate information forwarded by their parents . Such finding is consistent with the conceptualization of information avoidance as not referring to a successful complete avoidance of a particular information, but to very low levels of exposure due to intentional avoidance and potentially unintentional exposure (Skovsgaard and Andersen, 2020) . When individuals actively avoid news about COVID-19, and yet still potentially get exposed to other types of information about COVID-19, what kinds of information these might be? Some may be getting exposed to misinformation instead, which may lead them to develop misbeliefs (see Drummond et al., 2020; Pennycook et al., 2018) . We argue, therefore, that news avoidance may lead to belief in misinformation, but only among those who frequently get exposed to misinformation. Since this plausible moderated effect has not been explored, we propose the following question: RQ1. Does exposure to misinformation moderate the link between news avoidance and belief in misinformation?",

This is in consideration of the fact that information about COVID-19 did not only come from news sources, as the Singapore Government was also proactive in disseminating information to the public through its WhatsApp alert service and online sites (Ministry of Communications and Information, 2020). The news industry in Singapore is also relatively small, dominated by only two media companies. Therefore, we decided to measure information-and not just news-overload. We adapted eight items from the information overload scale from Jensen et al. (2014) and the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) questionnaire in the United States to assess feelings about the overwhelming amount of information on COVID-19. We slightly modified the statements to contextualize them. On a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree), participants reported their level of agreement with statements, including \"There is not enough time to do all of the things recommended to prevent the COVID-19\"; \"No one could actually do all of the COVID-19 recommendations that are given\"; \"I forget most of the COVID-19 information right after I hear it\"; and \"It has gotten to the point where I don't even care to hear new information about the COVID-19.\" The scale is reliable (\u03b1 = 0.87 at Wave 1, \u03b1 = 0.89 at Wave 2) ( Table 2) .",

Recent studies measured news avoidance in different ways, such as by measuring usage of different news sources (e.g. Edgerly et al., 2017) . However, Van den Bulck (2006: 236) argued, in the specific context of television news use, that \"watching a program is not necessarily an expression of preference and not watching is not always an expression of avoidance.\" Thus, other studies measure news avoidance by specifically asking the extent to which individuals actively avoid the news (e.g. Song et al., 2016) . For our study, we adapted one item derived from prior research on information avoidance (Howell and Shepperd, 2016; Miles et al., 2008) to specifically focus on news about COVID-19. On a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree), participants reported their agreement with the following statement: \"I intentionally avoid news about COVID-19.\"",

In the context of a global health crisis, such as what the world witnessed with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also important for individuals to know about important and accurate information that they can use to protect themselves and their loved ones. However, studies have documented that some individuals actively avoid the news Pentina and Tarafdar, 2014) . While the nature of news is partly to blame, such as its tendency to focus on negative stories, many studies have focused on the role of information overload (Pentina and Tarafdar, 2014) . Exposed to an abundant supply of information, some individuals might feel overwhelmed, leading them to actively avoid news instead. This current study finds support for this hypothesis Figure 2 .

Our study based on a two-wave panel survey found that information overload triggered news fatigue, which then led to news avoidance, consistent with what Song et al. (2016) had found. Our analysis also found a significant link from information overload to analysis paralysis to news avoidance, which Song et al. (2016) had hypothesized but did not find to be a statistically significant pathway. More importantly, we found a significant direct cross-lagged effect of information overload on subsequent news avoidance.

First, we examined our proposed expanded model of the antecedents and consequences of news avoidance within the specific issue of COVID-19. While it is a timely and globally relevant issue, news avoidance has also been conceptualized as a type of general news behavior; for example, Skovsgaard and Andersen (2020: 463) defined news avoidance as \"low news consumption over a continuous period of time caused either by a dislike for news (intentional) or a higher preference for other content (unintentional).\" Thus, future studies should also test whether our expanded model also holds in the long-term and with regards to a general news behavior, not just on a specific issue. For example, an individual might shun health-related news but might religiously follow business news. Second, our expanded model builds on an earlier model proposed by Song et al. (2016) and focuses on information overload as a predictor of news avoidance; future studies might expand these models by also accounting for other factors that lead to news avoidance, such as perceiving news to be too negative or irrelevant. Third, we relied on a two-wave panel survey, which allowed us to measure our predictor variables at an earlier time than our dependent variables; and yet the survey method also relies heavily on the ability and willingness of respondents to accurately report their attitudes, beliefs, and behavior. Fourth, we believe that it is important to continue exploring the consequences of news avoidance in terms of what people know-news is a source of accurate information, and if they actively avoid the news, how does it affect what they know about the world around them? We tried to address this question by examining impact on belief in misinformation, but future studies can also examine impact on other forms of learning from the news, such as on subjective knowledge and even knowledge miscalibration. Finally, our study was conducted within the context of Singapore, a small but technologically advanced nation, as well as during the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. While these contexts allowed us to keep our investigation focused, future studies should revisit the patterns we have uncovered here across different socio-political and temporal contexts. Still, despite these limitations, we hope that our findings can contribute to expanding and deepening what we know about the causes and effects of news avoidance as well as the role it plays in the process of misinformation.",
