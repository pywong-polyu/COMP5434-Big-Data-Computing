The cytokine storms mediated by overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines have been observed in patients with COVID-19, which is associated with the mortality and severity of COVID-19. IL-1\u03b2 is thus a potential therapeutic target that can be inhibited by canakinumab to control cytokine storms. Through this mechanism, use of canakinumab may have prognostic 3 benefits regarding patient outcomes with COVID-19 infection and serve as an additional treatment modality. Thus, we aim to perform a meta-analysis in the literature to evaluate the relationship between canakinumab administration and patient outcomes following COVID-19 infection.",

By inhibiting IL-1\u03b2, a key inflammatory response mediator in the cytokine storm triggered by infection by COVID-19, there is a decreased likelihood of systemic hyperinflammation, a well-known predictor of all-cause mortality 10, 11 . C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory biomarker that serves many functions during episodes of acute inflammation, including promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhancing leukocyte function and activating the complement cascade 12 . Higher serum concentrations of acute phase reactants indicate more severe inflammatory episodes, allowing for CRP to be used as a marker of inflammation in COVID-19 infection and extrapolated to determine potency and response to canakinumab. Furthermore, by limiting the level of acute inflammation and propensity for the activation of a cytokine storm, canakinumab is thus potentially able to mitigate and even prevent immune-mediated tissue damage and organ dysfunction, both factors which improve overall mortality 13, 14 . These restrictions of inflammatory activity are supported by the negative association of canakinumab and serum CRP levels in COVID-19 patients, an outcome that is well documented for other indications of canakinumab as well 15, 16 . Altogether, canakinumab serves as a 6 powerful anti-inflammatory therapeutic option that is able to specifically target and limit inflammatory mechanisms.",
