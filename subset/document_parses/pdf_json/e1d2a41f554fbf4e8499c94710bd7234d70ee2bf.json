            "text": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit regenerative and reparative properties. However, most MSC-related studies remain to be translated for regular clinical usage, partly due to challenges in pre-transplantation cell labelling and post-transplantation cell tracking. Amidst this, there are growing concerns over the toxicity of commonly used gadolinium-based contrast agents that mediate in-vivo cell detection via MRI. This urges to search for equally effective but less toxic alternatives that would facilitate and enhance MSC detection post-administration and provide therapeutic benefits in-vivo. MSCs labelled with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have shown promising results in-vitro and in-vivo. Thus, it would be useful to revisit these studies before inventing new labelling approaches. Aiming to inform regenerative medicine and augment clinical applications of IONP-labelled MSCs, this review collates and critically evaluates the utility of IONPs in enhancing MSC detection and therapeutics. It explains the rationale, principle, and advantages of labelling MSCs with IONPs, and describes IONP-induced intracellular alterations and consequent cellular manifestations. By exemplifying clinical pathologies, it examines contextual in-vitro, animal, and clinical studies that used IONP-labelled bone marrow-, umbilical cord-, adipose tissue-and dental pulp-derived MSCs. It compiles and discusses studies involving MSC-labelling of IONPs in combinations with carbohydrates (Venofer, ferumoxytol, dextran, glucosamine), non-carbohydrate polymers [poly(L-lysine), poly(lactide-co-glycolide), poly(L-lactide), polydopamine], elements (ruthenium, selenium, gold, zinc), compounds/stains (silica, polyethylene glycol, fluorophore, rhodamine B, DAPI, Prussian blue), DNA, Fibroblast growth Factor-2 and the drug doxorubicin. Furthermore, IONP-labelling of MSC exosomes is reviewed. Also, limitations of IONP-labelling are addressed and methods of tackling those challenges are suggested.",

However, only a few have been translated successfully into regular clinical practice [6] . While this is partly due to the unavailability of sufficient number of MSCs for clinical utility [21] and the risks and side-effects posed by MSCs post transplantation [22, 23] , this is also due to the issues encountered during pre-administration labelling procedures that subsequently affect MSC detection, homing, and therapeutic potential. Notably, the healing benefit of MSCs is dependent on their ability of homing at target sites [23] where these cells secrete trophic and immunomodulatory molecules [3] . This raises the significance of pre-transplantation labelling procedures to achieve maximum therapeutic efficiency. Moreover, the transplanted MSCs must effectively differentiate at the target site to execute their regenerative function, but MSC differentiation ability in-vivo could be low. For successful homing and differentiation in-vivo, the preadministration approaches require multi-step and complex in-vitro methodology, which is yet to be perfected. These aspects collectively challenge the detection and retention of transplanted MSCs and thereby hamper their frequent clinical usage.",

MSC labelling with IONPs is based on this principle. Essentially, entry of IONPs inside the cells increases cellular/tissue iron content (Fig. 1) . Upon exposure to a magnetic field, these labelled cells/tissues create and increase localised inhomogeneities in the magnetic field by inducing a negative contrast i.e., a darker area (spots) in regions where iron is accrued. This increases the visual contrast between different tissues and thereby aids in cell visualisation and tracing of transplanted cells in-vivo via MRI.

This MSC tropism and homing involves chemokines released from tumours that attract and recruit MSCs with corresponding receptors (Fig. 2) [49]. For example, glioma cells release many chemokines and growth factors including stromal cellderived factor-1 (SDF-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), VEGF, IL-8 and neurotrophin-3. These chemokines support MSC tropism for gliomas [50] by pairing with receptors on MSCs (Fig. 2) . Examples of cytokine-receptor pairs implicated in MSC tumour tropism are SDF-1 & C-X-C motif chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4), VEGF & VEGFR, MCP-1 & C-C motif chemokine receptor (CCR2), epidermal growth factor (EGF) & EGFR, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) & c-Met [51] . These pairs have also been implicated in MSC tropism towards injury/inflammation sites (Fig. 2) . However, in the MSCs, expression levels of receptors like CXCR4, CCR1 or c-met can be low. Therefore, several studies have been conducted to improve their expressions in MSCs to enhance MSC migration [2] .",

            "text": "Injury-induced release of cytokines e.g. SDF-1 can upregulate CXCR4 on MSC surfaces and this can promote chemotaxis i.e. migration of regenerative cells and homing of MSCs into target sites [5, 52, 53] . Likewise, Fig. 1 Iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP) endocytosis and enhanced detection via MRI. IONPs can be taken up into endo/lysosomes by receptor-mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis, or pinocytosis. A clathrin-mediated and actin-dependent endocytosis of IONPs in MSCs has been reported. IONPs localise within lysosomes and around the nucleus. After degradation and metabolism, iron inside these particles is incorporated into the cellular iron pool. Total cellular/tissue iron content is increased, which facilitates detection via MRI [27, 28, 30, 33] \u2022 USSPIONPs have a longer half-life in blood than SPIONPs, so these cater to a wider spectrum of imaging application such as tumour perfusion imaging, atherosclerotic plaque imaging, MR angiography, and the imaging of liver, lymph node and bone marrow. \u2022 Also, USSIONPs are not linked with a risk of developing nephrogenic sclerosis, which is particularly useful for patients with renal insufficiency and the approach is considered much safer than using gadolinium chelates for MRI [34]. Activation of this pathway regulates the production of IL-4 and other cytokines. Genetically modified MSCs that secreted IL-4 (antiinflammatory) in response to NF\u03baB activation demonstrated great immunomodulatory ability and mitigated the pro-inflammatory response of macrophages [45] . ALP: Alkaline phosphatase; CCL21: C-C motif ligand-21; CXCR: C-X-C motif chemokine receptor; EGF: Epidermal growth factor; EGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor; FGF: Fibroblast growth factor; HIF1-\u03b1: Hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha; IL: Interleukin; MCP-1: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; PPAR\u03b3: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; SDF-1: Stromal cell-derived factor-1; TIMP-1: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor as shown in Fig. 2 , IONPs can increase MSC expressions of CXCR4 and the migration-related proteins CCR1 and c-Met [2] . Essentially, intracellularly delivered iron ions (due to IONP treatment) induce low levels of ROS [54, 55] , which can elevate CXCR4 in MSCs [55] [56] [57] , amongst other MSC alterations (Fig. 2) . Similarly, IONPs induce elevation in MSC EGFR and this supports MSC tumour tropism (towards tumour EGF) (Fig. 2 ) [58] . Ironion-induced ROS also upregulates hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) expression in MSCs, which in turn, can elevate MSC secretion of paracrine factors like VEGF (supports angiogenesis during wound repair) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (supports angiogenesis) [59] . Essentially, HIF-1\u03b1 acts as a transcription factor, binds to VEGF promoter and induces VEGF expression [56, 60, 61] . Although MSCs exhibit tropism towards malignant tumours and are therefore considered as vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic materials, the exact function of MSCs following homing into tumours remains to be fully elucidated. Studies have reported both protumour and anti-tumour potential of MSCs [62] . The anti-tumour MSC mechanisms possibly involve inhibition of angiogenesis and Wnt, Akt and NF\u03baB signalling, and increased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [63] , while MSC pro-tumour effects [5] involve promotion of tumour growth and metastasis, as observed in hepatocellular carcinoma in-vivo [64] . Notably, iron-loading has shown to elevate mesenchymal and metastatic markers in HepG2 cells [65] . Therefore, iron-labelling of MSCs can further increase the pro-tumour potential of the MSCs. Thus, this approach must be executed with extreme caution.",

These lead to altered MSC responses that are manifested as enhanced MSC migration towards tumour or injury, reduced inflammation and apoptosis, promotion of MSC osteogenic differentiation and reduction in MSC adipogenic differentiation (Fig. 2) . IONP-labelled MSCs can produce increased levels of IL-4 ( Fig. 2 ) in addition to elevation in other anti-inflammatory chemokines, thereby facilitating reduction in inflammation. While both IONP-labelled and unlabelled MSCs can show increased expression of TGF-\u03b2 expression that affects the wound healing process, serum levels of VEGF and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 have been higher in rats treated with IONPlabelled MSCs than rats treated with unlabelled MSCs [57] , thereby demonstrating the healing effect exerted by labelled MSCs (Fig. 2 ).",

Accordingly, human MSCs were labelled with Venofer and transplanted into degenerated intervertebral discs in patients.

This can be expected because stimulation of osteogenesis can inhibit adipogenesis, but on the other hand this defies observations where excess iron has shown to favour adipogenesis over osteogenesis [3] . This indicates that both free iron (which generates ROS and affects cell signalling pathways) as well as iron bound to moieties like sucrose (as in this case) can determine MSC differentiation. Regardless, in-vitro, these cells released exosomes in the conditioned medium, which, in combination with 5-fluorocytosine, caused tumour cell death in a dose dependent manner and demonstrated great therapeutic capability. When applied intranasally in rats, labelled cells successfully migrated to intracerebral glioblastoma, thus proving the capability of this method in tumour tracking [67] , thereby promising targeted therapy for tumours.",

In this approach, MSCs retained their native features including cell size, recovered their phagocytic ability and showed ferumoxytol uptake that was comparable to that obtained by using transfection agents [74, 76] .

Brain iron accumulation is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis [82, 83] . Chung Khurana et al. (2013) . Prior to administration, MSCs could be labelled with IONPs ex-vivo or in-vivo, as depicted in the figure. Essentially, in the in-vivo labelling approach, ferumoxytol was taken up by rat reticuloendothelial system and labelled BM-MSCs were obtained from the rat. The label was retained in the cells throughout the steps of harvesting and ex-vivo expansion. Compared to unlabelled control cells, in-vivo-labelled MSCs showed higher iron content and shorter T2 relaxation times upon transplantation into rats with osteochondral knee defects. In-vivo labelling approach is more effective, and it reduces the risks of contamination and biological alterations that can occur during the ex-vivo labelling procedures. However, in-vivo methods of labelling present limitations, as discussed in the review that dextran-coated IONPs can enhance the therapeutic benefits of MSCs in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. IONP-dextran-labelled human BM-derived MSCs migrated towards the sites of damaged dopaminergic neurons in the mice brain. Also, these dextran-coated IONPs improved the ability of MSCs to rescue host dopaminergic neurons, increased MSC migration ability (due to elevated CXCR4, EGFR and IL-15R) (Fig. 2 ) and enhanced MSC differentiation into dopaminergic-neuron-like cells to replace the damaged neurons and secrete neurotrophic factors [5] . Similarly, MSCs appeared as a promising modality for Alzheimer's disease when human Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs were labelled with dextran-coated IONPs and magnetically delivered to the hippocampus of a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. These rats showed memory and cognitive improvement [77] .",

This difference was attributed to the pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic nature of macrophages in liver pathologies. Thus, data indicated that the hepatic niche can determine the outcome of the transplanted cells and therefore it should be altered for better clinical outcomes [86] .

Proliferation of IONP-labelled transplanted cells allows distribution of particles between the daughter cells leaving only a small percent of cells containing the particles after a few cycles. Xu et al. attempted to tackle this by exploiting two properties of nanoparticles: a) polystyrenebased microparticles exhibit a strong signal, and b) bigger particles show slower exocytosis rate. They hypothesised that 1-2 \u03bcm-sized particles with strong MRI signal would decrease particle exocytosis and enable better and longer longitudinal tracking of MSCs. Accordingly, biodegradable poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles loaded with IONPs were used to label MSCs. In-vitro and in-vivo experiments (in mice) revealed enhanced cellular localisation of iron, which increased the signal to noise ratio and offered better detection via MRI. Larger particle size increased resident time within the cells and provided longer detectable time of labelled MSCs in comparison to IONPs alone. This occurred without compromising MSC viability, proliferation, migration and homing at the sites of inflammation [97] .",

This reminds us of the iron-induced upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway components TGF-\u03b2 receptor-2 and p-Smad-2 observed in murine hepatic stellate cells [102] . Thus, the aforementioned elevation in p-SMAD-1/5 in MSCs could be due to the iron component in \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 @Ru and \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 @se. MSC differentiation into osteoblasts was induced without cell cycle arrest or oxidative stress. However, Fe 2 O 3 @Ru diffused more effectively in the cytoplasm, localised in the nuclei of MSCs, strongly induced osteogenesis and inhibited adipogenic differentiation [101] . Indeed, where MSCs were cultured with Fe 2 O 3 @Ru, p-SMAD-1/5 was further upregulated and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) (adipogenic marker) was downregulated (Fig. 2) . This indicated that Fe 2 O 3 @Ru-mediated preferential osteogenic differentiation of MSCs could be regulated by the BMP-SMAD-1/5 pathway [101] , which usually modulates the upregulation of osteogenic genes and down-regulation of adipogenic genes [3, 101] .",

Labelled MSCs were introduced in mice through the carotid artery to visualise these cells in the brain tumour of mice and assess MSC homing via MR and photoacoustic imaging. After 72 h of injection, the photoacoustic signal emitted from the tumours of labelled MSCs was more enhanced than tumours with unlabelled MSCs. MRI matched the results of photoacoustic imaging and showed significant progressive (over time) hypointensity of the tumour with gold-coated IONP-labelled MSCs. Histological examination revealed co-localisation of GFP fluorescence and iron, which indicated that gold-coated IONP-labelled MSCs carried the IONPs even after 72 h of injection. Notably, during initial in-vitro experiments, lipofectamine was used as a transfection agent which enhanced the uptake of gold-coated IONPs and did not affect viability but decreased proliferation. Lipofectamine was not used in subsequent in-vivo experiments because it further decreased proliferation of labelled MSCs and reduced MSC viability over time [92] , thereby providing an example of the disadvantage of using transfection agents.",

Im et al. aimed to mitigate these limitations by exploiting the ability of endocytosed IONPs inside the endosomes to undergo degradation into ions due to the low pH of the endosomes. Thus, they designed pH sensitive nanoparticles that allowed endocytic release of iron ion inside the MSCs. High-passage-number (P12) MSCs were treated with goldiron nanoparticles. Intracellular iron ions elevated MSC HIF-1\u03b1 expression, which in turn elevated VEGF expression (essential for wound healing). This resultant iron-ioninduced upregulation of VEGF expression in these high-passage-number labelled MSCs was comparable to the amount released by low-passage-number MSCs without the goldiron nanoparticle treatment. Administration of this highpassage-number-derived labelled conditioned medium into a mouse model of skin wound led to better angiogenesis compared with the group injected with unlabelled conditioned medium from high passage MSCs. Results obtained were similar to that in mice injected with conditioned medium from low passage MSCs; the results were enhanced angiogenesis, re-epithelization and tissue remodelling [103] . This study introduced a new approach of using MSC conditioned medium instead of MSCs to mediate MSC therapeutics.",

Like others, Kim et al. used the principle of stimulating gene expression via intracellular ions and hypothesised that the combination of two metal ions, zinc and iron (dual ion delivery system) will induce zincion-mediated osteogenesis and iron-ion-mediated paracrine secretion by the MSCs. Thus, aiming to improve the osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs and promote angiogenesis simultaneously, zinc-based IONPs were synthesised. These were dissolved in a weak acid that mimicked low pH within the endosomes. In-vitro, zinc-IONP-labelled MSCs showed enhanced osteogenic expression (RUNX-2 and ALP) and increased secretion of VEGF (angiogenic paracrine factor) (Fig. 2) . The concurrent intracellular release of zinc and iron ions modulated the subtle increase in ROS in the MSCs without causing cytotoxicity. This augmented MSC osteogenic potential and promised useful applications of this approach in future [104] . Notably, if MSC therapeutic efficacy is to be enhanced via delivery of intracellular ions, then it is crucial to adjust the concentrations of the ions delivered. This is because intracellular ion homeostasis is essential for cell viability and functionality. For example, high zinc ion concentration can dysregulate intracellular iron ion homeostasis, cause cellular iron overload and induce iron-ion-mediated cell death called ferroptosis [105] .",

Rat BM-MSCs were co-labelled with Feridex (withdrawn from market) and DAPI using poly-L-lysine as transfection agent. When labelled cells were transplanted via hepatic artery into rat livers, cells could be detected invivo via MRI for up to 7 days post transplantation [118] . In another study, rabbit MSCs were co-labelled with IONPs and DAPI and transplanted via intravenous injection into rabbits with liver tumours to assess MSC tumour-homing capacity via MRI. Histological analysis revealed that IONP distribution, as visualised via Prussian blue stain, matched with the DAPI stained fluorescent nuclei i.e. iron co-localised with DAPI.

In dealing with cancer, there are issues such as drug-induced resistance, therapeutic inefficacy to tumours, systemic toxicity and lack of a system that allows regulated drug release to tumorous tissues. To overcome some of these issues, complexes including a combination of IONPs and dugs have been designed. A combination of lipids, doxorubicin (drug), gold nanorods and IONPs form a complex called LDGI. MSCs were successfully labelled with LDGI for photoacoustic imaging, targeted photothermal therapy and chemotherapy in mice models of breast cancer, aiming to apply this targeted therapy to human breast cancer. Invitro, the label was successfully taken up by the MSCs and did not alter cellular functions. Labelled MSCs maintained tumour tropism and the IONPs in the LDGI complex were found to upregulate CXCR4 on the MSCs (Fig. 2) [124] . In vivo, the complex provided a means of releasing the drug doxorubicin to promote cell apoptosis (via chemotherapy) and allow photothermal therapy simultaneously upon light irradiation. The MSC-LDGI complex was the most efficient in inhibiting tumour growth [124] , which promised a clinically translatable drug delivery system via the MSCs.",

In-vitro, cell division can cause the dilution effect and lead to progressive decline in labelling with increasing culture time [35] . For example, citrate-coated-IONP-labelled adipose-derived stem cells retained their ability of multilineage differentiation in-vitro, but the percent of labelled cells decreased during the 4-week in-vitro expansion [38] .

Moreover, IONP uptake by MSCs is IONP-size dependent. For example, human foetal MSCs labelled with 600-nm microgel iron oxide particles (amongst a range sizes) showed 3-6-fold higher iron-loading than Ferucarbotran without affecting MSC proliferation or tri-lineage differentiation. In a rat photothrombotic stroke model, labelled MSCs successfully migrated from contralateral cortex to the site of stroke injury and showed 5-7 times higher MRI sensitivity than detection by Ferucarbotran. Also, it showed low cell toxicity, thus making this approach useful for tracking MSCs using clinical MRI scanners. However, due to necrosis and inflammation in the rat models, the transplanted human MSCs could not survive beyond 12 days [135] . Determination of long-term effects is pending.",

Thus, dentalpulp MSCs showcase their neural crest origin and differ slightly from the MSCs of these three sources [141] . BM-MSCs and neural stem cells are similar in their migration capacity and tropism for brain tumours [142, 143] . Also, both BM-MSCs and adipose-tissue-derived MSCs show pericyte-like characteristics and show similar tumour migration abilities. Thus, either could be used for targeting glioma [144] .

            "text": "Yet another interesting question is whether iron labelling works equally well for MSCs derived from different sources. This depends on the parameter being assessed and the MSCs being compared. For instance, in an in-vitro study, both adipose-tissue-derived MSCs and BM-MSCs could be IONP-labelled and then tracked with equal ease. Their responses to IONP-labelling were similar; both showed decrements in differentiation potential (adipogenic and osteogenic) following IONP-labelling, an increment in iron content, and a decrement in cell viability with increasing concentration of IONPs [145] . Another in-vitro study compared IONP-labelled MSCs from adipose tissue and Wharton's jelly. Here, IONP-labelled adipose-tissue-derived MSCs showed better proliferation and lower senescence than unlabelled counterparts and Wharton's jelly MSCs. IONPlabelled Wharton's jelly MSCs showed reduced viability in comparison to unlabelled Wharton's jelly MSCs. But this was not the case with adipose-tissue-derived MSCs. Also, IONP-labelling and magnetic field exposure promoted chondrogenesis in human adipose-tissue-derived MSCs but not in Wharton jelly MSCs [146] . Essentially, the chondrogenic potential of MSCs obtained from one source could be enhanced with magnetic stimulation but this did not occur in the MSCs from another source. Based on this data, adiposetissue-derived MSCs would be more suitable than Wharton's jelly MSCs for cartilage engineering. This clearly indicates that the source of MSCs determines its potential therapeutic usage, and IONP-labelling may (or may not) have differential effects on MSCs from different sources; conclusion on the latter will depend on the parameter being examined.",

For labelling, IONPs can be complexed with carbohydrates, non-carbohydrate polymers, elements, compounds, stains, drugs, growth factors and DNA; the latter in combination with IONPs acts as a DNA nano-vector.

When Wharton's jelly MSCs were used to ameliorate acute myocardial infarction, gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI, echocardiography, and ECG-gated single photon emission computed tomography were used. The approach was found to be safe and effective [159] . In all these studies, the focus was on directly examining the primary and secondary clinical outcomes post transplantation rather than detecting the location, survival, and differentiation of MSCs at the target site and then relating this to the clinical outcome. Indeed, MRI was used in some studies, but this was to examine alteration, regression, or amelioration of the condition/tissue following treatment.

However, this is dependent on several factors such as donor's age, patient's health and MSC reaction at the target site.

Setting up more pre-clinical trials in small animals would be one step forward. Another step would be to use CRISPR/ Cas9 technology for gene editing. The usage of this technology has shown promising results in various degenerative diseases [160] and can now be more frequently applied than before in pre-clinical trials. In the past, a large proportion of MSC studies focussed on and explored their osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic potential aiming to ameliorate various conditions. Success has been achieved with this, for example, in ameliorating knee osteoarthritis and spinal cord injury.

            "text": "There are some generic problems associated with post-transplantation tracking following cell-based therapies. Utilising histopathology might be the gold standard for preclinical studies involving small animals, but it is labour intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors and bias. For studies in humans, biopsy-driven tissue histopathology is neither always possible nor advisable or necessary, particularly, with the advent of non-invasive approaches that show successful in-vivo cell imaging. Another issue relates to the imaging approach itself. There are several imaging modalities that facilitate in-vivo imaging, for example, MRI, bioluminescence imaging, reporter gene labelling via fluorescence, fluorescent dyes, ultrasound, quantum dots and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). However, all these present some limitations. For example, PET and MRI are more expensive than others and there is variability in sensitivity [167] . There are challenges in using the methods used too. Cells can be difficult to track with optical imaging if there has been direct labelling with fluorescent probes because the signal decreases in the tissue with time. It is even more challenging when the tissue is located deep within the body. Thus, long-term cell monitoring can be difficult. Radionuclides are high-energy particles that are less prone to attenuation in tissues. A combination of radionuclide-labelling and PET imaging is often used in clinical settings, but it can detect both dead and live cells giving an incorrect account of viable cells. MRI certainly offers an advantage by allowing MSC visualisation immediately after transplantation but there are issues such as signal dilution over time and the signal may not necessarily match with cell viability of transplanted cells due to non-specific particle uptake and signal retention by dead cells [168] .",

Labelling can be achieved by transfection with a reporter gene, but over time the gene may be silenced leading to reductions in signal and product of the reporter gene. This can be misinterpreted as cell death. Indeed, constitutive mammalian promoters (ubiquitin and \u03b2-actin) are being utilised because these are believed to be more resistant to gene silencing. This approach has shown success [171] . However, there are concerns over reporter genes being integrated at random sites in the genome and this may alter MSC characteristics.

In theory, the body should be able to accommodate this subtle level of change in iron levels without causing major undesirable physiological outcomes. Iron oxide labelling of neural stem cells do cause alterations in the expression of some genes, including some iron-related genes [172] but these are believed to be temporary.

Since these do not show a great ability to be internalised by the cells, transfection agents are being used to achieve better cellular uptake.

Whether this would occur in humans needs to be investigated. One way to investigate the effect of IONP loading on MSCs is to ascertain endogenous ferritin levels in MSCs from different sources and determine the range of ferritin increment following IONP-labelling. This is particularly relevant when using iron oxide for labelling MSCs. While iron is necessary for cellular functions, excess iron is toxic and can feed into the Fenton reaction to generate reactive oxygen species. If in excess, these can cause cellular damage. Ferritin is the iron storage protein that can accommodate large amounts of iron ions and thereby reduce the possibility of excess-iron-induced damage. Examining the basal and IONP-induced ferritin levels in MSCs from different sources would better inform the IONP dosage to be used. Optimal IONP dosage would prevent excess-iron-induced damage to MSCs and help retain MSC viability and characteristics so that the cells function optimally following transplantation. This needs to be tested for MSCs from all sources because their ironholding capacities may differ.",

Prior to administration, MSCs could be labelled with IONPs ex-vivo or in-vivo, as depicted in the figure. Essentially, in the in-vivo labelling approach, ferumoxytol was taken up by rat reticuloendothelial system and labelled BM-MSCs were obtained from the rat. The label was retained in the cells throughout the steps of harvesting and ex-vivo expansion. Compared to unlabelled control cells, in-vivo-labelled MSCs showed higher iron content and shorter T2 relaxation times upon transplantation into rats with osteochondral knee defects. In-vivo labelling approach is more effective, and it reduces the risks of contamination and biological alterations that can occur during the ex-vivo labelling procedures. However, in-vivo methods of labelling present limitations, as discussed in the review",

            "text": "Selected structural and functional characteristics of IONPs Core: contains thousands of iron atoms that collectively increase localiron concentration enabling the detection of low numbers of cell populations that contain these particles. \u2022 Ligands: include silica, citrate, dextran or carboxydextran, chitosan, gelatin or starch that generally prevent particle aggregation and provide hydrophilicity and stability to the internal magnetic core[27, 35]. Usually, IONPs with a particle diameter > 50 nm are considered as superparamagnetic IONPs (SPIONPs) and those with diameter < 50 nm are considered as ultrasmall SPIONPs (USSPIONPs) [36]. Magnetism and colloidal stability \u2022 Particles are colloidally stable[27, 37]   \u2022 When exposed to a magnetic field, IONPs show superparamagnetism i.e., a strong response (magnetic properties) and thereby high sensitivity in detection via MRI. \u2022 Due to the magnetic properties, an external magnetic field can be used to direct IONPs to specific sites within the tissue, which facilitates targeted delivery of therapeutic agents [38]. \u2022 When the magnetic field is removed, IONPs lose their magnetisation vector, become highly dispersed,show no magnetism at room temperature. There is almost no particle self-aggregation and phagocytic uptake is prevented.At physiological level \u2022 Most IONPs are phagocytosed by the liver Kupffer cells. This promotes their utility for liver imaging [34]. \u2022 Generally, nanoparticles with less than 10 nm are eliminated via the renal system whereas those with size greater than 200 nm are phagocytosed. Both events are not beneficial for biomedical applications [37]. Biodegradability IONPs remain in the circulation for a long time but are biodegradable in nature i.e., get cleared from the circulation by opsonins. Essentially, opsonins activate the complement system and tag the IONPs to be engulfed/degraded by the phagocytic cells [39]. However, inorganic non-biodegradable IONPs may remain in the environment for long periods, leading to prolonged exposure to human with unidentified consequences. Half-life",

            "text": "Notable features of IONP-labelling of MSCs Parameter Features of IONP-labelling of MSCs MSC viability IONPs seem to be non-toxic and do not elicit other side-effects [40]. IONPs generally do not affect MSC viability, proliferation and differentiation potential [27]. However, the long-term effects of these on MSC functions are yet to be fully understood. MSC differentiation For successful therapy, the transplanted IONP-labelled MSCs must retain viability and differentiation capability in-vivo. IONP-labelling to human bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) showed retention of surface markers, MSC trilineage differentiation capacity, and ability to differentiate into cardiac and neuronal cell lineages in-vitro [41]. MSC migration MSCs show migration to injury sites, but the efficiency is low [42]. In rats with inflamed ear, injection of IONP-labelled MSCs showed improved migration of labelled MSCs to the site of inflammation. Essentially, IONPs enhanced MSC migration to injury sites and facilitated healing, thereby showing the potential for improved clinical efficacy. However, in-vitro, these cells showed variable differentiation depending on the type, duration and intensity of the magnetic field applied to these cells; shorter and longer exposure times with low intensity magnetic field promoted adipogenesis and osteogenesis, respectively [46]. Although adipose-derived stem cells have shown promising results including neurocognitive improvement in animal models [47], these cells can confer malignant features to cervical cancer cells [48]. Therefore, its clinical usage (with or without IONP-labelling) for tumour treatment needs further investigation.",
