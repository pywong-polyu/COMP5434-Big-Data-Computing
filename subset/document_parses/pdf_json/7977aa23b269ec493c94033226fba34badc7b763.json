Most of the drive for repurposing is the high cost of developing a drug, and the very long time it can take to determine the safety and specificity of a completely new drug. The timeline for any new cancer drug to go through enough clinical trials to obtain approval can be years, or even decades. Even for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which may affect about 0.2% of the population during their lifetime, over a decade was required for one of the first therapeutic KIs, Gleevec, to become standard of care. For smaller patient pools or drugs with less clear results in treatment, the delay can be even longer. Approval of omacetaxine, a plant alkaloid that inhibits protein translation, for treating TKIresistant CML took more than 30 years. 1 A phase 1 trial (NCT02081378) for asciminib (an allosteric inhibitor of the ABL kinase) to treat TKI-resistant CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), began in 2014, is ongoing in August of 2020 with an estimated completion date of 2024.",

Indeed, the first chemotherapy drugs might be regarded as repurposed chemical weapons, arising as they did from research on the 'mustard gas' (which has no relation to mustard and is liquid at room temperature) that caused so many deaths and chronic illness in the wars of the 20th century. While treating survivors of these attacks, doctors realized that the toxins, in addition to their vesicant (i.e. blister-inducing) activity, might have antitumor potential. In the medical equivalent of beating guns into plowshares, in this case converting a toxic compound to a therapeutic one, chemists and doctors worked together in a decade-long search for compounds with lower toxicity and enhanced cytostatic activity, with the hope of finding treatments to prolong the lives of their cancer patients. 2 After many explorations of conjugates with different biological molecules, two alkylating agents, chlorambucil (Leukeran) and busulfan (Myleran) (Fig. 1) , were developed to treat chronic lymphocytic and myeloid leukemias (CLL and CML). Despite the advent of many other chemotherapies, these simple drugs continue to be used to this day.",

No chemotherapy has ever achieved this lofty goal. Unlike the careful design of, for example, drugs targeting phosphorylation cascades 4,5 and orally available TKIs, 6 there is no clear cellular target for most early therapies. Chemotherapy infusions cannot be typically done at home, as there is risk of anaphylaxis and many are so toxic that accidental extravasation 7 can lead to difficult to treat blisters. Directing treatments to specific organs often leads to the escape of a few wayward bandits, abnormal cells that will eventually find their way into another tissue and reinitiate tumorigenesis. Oncologists are thus always on the lookout for drugs with fewer side effects that can be used to treat cancer as a chronic disease or even prevent it. 8, 9 Drugs designed to treat many different indications have been introduced into cancer therapy 10 and hundreds more have been reported to inhibit the growth of tumor cells in culture (see https://depmap.org/repurposing for the growth inhibitory activity of approved drugs against 578 human cancer cell lines. 11 ).",

            "text": "Metformin (Fig. 2) traces its roots to a plant extract whose primary ingredient was guanidine, used throughout the Middle ages to treat diabetes symptoms. 12 Metformin was first synthesized in 1922, but due to the advent of insulin, only advanced as 'Glucophage' 30 years later when it was approved in France. It has become the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Pertinent to this review, metformin is playing an increasing role as a cytostatic cancer treatment, thanks to its low toxicity (its primary adverse event (AE) is the rarely occurring lactic acidosis.) The first cancer trials arose from reports that diabetics taking metformin daily had lower rates of breast 13 and other cancers, augmented by studies showing cells from metformin-treated diabetics do not grow well in culture. 14 The cytostatic effects reported led to introducing metformin as an adjunct therapy for different types of cancers, some of which have reported remarkable success. In a recent phase II trial, 139 lung adenocarcinoma patients, whose tumors contained driver epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, were treated with TKIs (erlotinib hydrochloride, afatinib dimaleate or Gefitinib at standard dosage) plus or minus 500 mg/day of metformin (i.e. well within the normal dosage for treating diabetes). Adding metformin increased the progression-free survival (PFS) by about a third; it nearly doubled overall survival (OS). 15 Metformin also improved PFS and OS in advanced, previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) when used in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy with or without the anti-VEGF inhibiting antibody, bevacizumab (Avastin) in two phase II studies. These included 33 non-diabetic patients of whom 70% had some history of smoking, with KRAS, EGFR and LKB1 mutation prevalence of 48, 26 and 8.3%, respectively. The PFS and OS for metformin-treated patients were especially improved in those with KRAS mutations. This suggests that determining molecular subgroups should be used to guide therapy in the future, especially in light of the paucity of direct KRAS inhibitors. 16 As exciting as these results are, metformin does not always improve survival. 17 The effects seen in the various clinical trials, many of which are ongoing, are patient specific. Several metabolic pathways altered by metformin treatment may account for the heterogeneity in response. It might be logical to assume that the overall effect of metformin, by lower circulating glucose concentration, would specifically starve tumor cells (which have an enhanced metabolic need for glucose), leading to decreased proliferation and metastasis. Various other explanations have been given for its observed effects in diabetes and in preventing cell growth, 18 whereby the inability of metformin to enter many cells has not always been accounted for in studies of its effects on metabolism. 19 One is that metformin can metabolically reprogram cancer cells by activating 5 AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), by increasing the ratio of AMP to ATP to some extent in cells (whereby the ratio was much higher after Rosiglitazone treatment). Other studies attributed the lower rates of breast cancer to metformin's role in controlling fatty acid oxidation. 20 Identifying the patients most likely to be helped relies on accurately identifying the cells most affected by metformin and determining if those types predominate in the patient tumors. A study of normal murine mammary cells indicated that metformin had the highest effect on hormone receptor positive luminal cells, where it decreased the total cell number, progenitor capacity and DNA damage. The authors suggest that identifying this type of cells in humans would indicate those most likely to benefit from metformin treatment. 21 To shed further light on this question, whole transcriptome RNA sequencing 22 of 40 breast cancer patients before and after 13-21 days of dose escalating metformin (from 500 mg/day to 1500 by day 6, which is still within the dose range for diabetes treatment) revealed that patients' profiles correlated with an optimal antiproliferative response. One commonality was that metformin treatment increased glucose flux in the tumor (as measured by 18-fluorodeoxy glucose uptake via PET-CT) as well as in other tissues.",

The drug's side effects, including peripheral neuropathy, stopped its approval in the USA. However, thalidomide was only withdrawn worldwide in 1962 after it was linked to severe birth defects. As discussed elsewhere, 23 even after this withdrawal, thalidomide remained in clinical use for treating Hansen disease (leprosy). The major use of thalidomide and its derivatives for many years was immunomodulatory. There are now a variety of thalidomide-related compounds to choose from that have been designed to specifically control different pathways in immune cells.

Targeted PDE4 inhibitors are in preclinical trials for cancer. 28 ,29 At this point, the mechanistic basis for using the thalidomide drug family in cancer becomes confusing, as they have pleiomorphic effects. For example, their anti-inflammatory activity has been linked to their ability to inhibit secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and other cytokines. 30, 31 Anti-TNF antibodies such as Humira have revolutionized the treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis; however, inhibiting TNF may enhance inflammatory central nervous system syndromes such as multiple sclerosis. 32 A recent discovery suggests another reason for thalidomide-related compounds' action in cancer cells: their ability to bind cereblon, 33 a protein involved in limb outgrowth. The devastating teratogenic effects of thalidomide when taken in early pregnancy have also been linked to this binding. Even more intriguing are current attempts to manipulate thalidomide's binding to cereblon to induce specific protein degradation in cancer cells. 34 Early results indicated that thalidomide induced specific degradation of repressors in T-cells that can lead to activation and increased IL-2 secretion, thus providing another way to stimulate the immune system to fight cancer cells. 35 ",

They have also been tested for a variety of blood and solid cancers. IFN-\u03b1 was used for many years to treat hairy cell leukemia, 40 CML and myelofibrosis 41 ; it may still be resorted to alone or as adjunct therapy for CML patients resistant to multiple TKIs. 1 A recent paper reported deep molecular remission in four of nine CML patients treated with Imatinib plus Ropeginterferon-\u03b12b, with few AE. 42 IFNs have also been suggested to enhance treatment with temozolomide by inhibiting the MGMT repair enzyme. 43 However, chromosome instability in AML has been shown to directly upregulate IFNstimulated genes, 44 suggesting that IFN itself will not be helpful in treatment. The cost, need for injection or infusion, and side effects of IFNs suggest they could be replaced with small molecule, intracellular inducers, such as STING activators, 45, 46 which may also require injection, or with compounds that may activate select steps in the IFN-induced pathways.",

Many FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs have severe side effects, ranging from blistering at the site of infusion to hair and teeth loss. While cooling the scalp or chewing ice during the infusion can partially control these side effects, 64 additional anti-inflammatory compounds are being sought. The orally available inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and kinases are easy to administer, but they may induce side effects such as nausea, 65,66 which may require co-treatment with antiemetics. However, use of proton pump inhibitors, used to control GERD symptoms in as many as 30% of cancer patients, has been shown to limit the effect of chemotherapy and worsen OS. 67 Especially patients with cardiac problems may benefit from co-treatment during chemotherapy with drugs such as \u03b2-blockers and aspirin. 68, 69 Lowdose aspirin has long been recommended both to control inflammation and inhibit coagulation and was previously recommended to control stroke and heart attack incidence. However, ASPREE, a 4.7-year placebo controlled trial of >19 000 individuals older than 65-70 determined there was no advantage of taking aspirin. The risk of being diagnosed with stage 3 or 4 cancers and increased mortality was higher in the aspirin-treated patients than in the placebo group. 70 The usefulness of \u03b2-blockers to control tumor growth especially has been explored as propranolol decreased proliferation, migration and invasion of triple negative breast cancer cells in vitro. 71 Topical treatment with the \u03b2-blockers propranolol and timolol is a validated treatment for complicated infantile hemangiomas. 72, 73 There are also many studies indicating that \u03b2-blockers can control the growth of vascular sarcomas and other endothelial cell tumors. 74 Their use in other cancers has shown less benefit. Multiple retrospective studies of patients treated with combination therapies including \u03b2-blockers have shown little indication of overall efficacy in ovarian cancer, 75 lung cancer 76 or in preventing cancer recurrence. 77 However, \u03b2-blocker co-treatment with anthracyclines can significantly reduce chemotherapy cardiotoxicity and preserve left ventricle function. 78, 79 Furthermore, topical treatments with propranolol and timolol, such as those developed for infantile hemangiomas, can also shorten the recovery time when applied to painful swelling around the nails that can develop after treatment with EGFR inhibitors. 80 Another repurposed drug, dexrazoxane, may be superior for this use. Originally developed as an antimitotic, dexrazoxane, the (+)-enantiomorph of razoxane, has now been approved by the FDA for repurposing as a cotreatment to prevent anthracycline-induced extravasation injuries 81 and cardiomyopathy. Dexrazone's effect may be due to its ability to inhibit the formation of a toxic iron-anthracycline complex. 82 A recent multicenter study 83 of over 1000 AML patients treated with daunorubicin or mitoxantrone showed that cotreatment with dexrazone significantly lowered cardiac problems and also reduced treatment-related mortality. Dexrazone cotreatment is also used for immunosuppressive purposes.",

            "text": "While the examples here show the positive side of repurposing, it should be noted that not all chemotherapy agents can be re-used for every cancer. Combining therapies does not always bring better results. For example, recent results of a breast cancer trial 101 indicate that adding the anthracycline Epirubicin (+5-fluoruracil and cyclophosphamide) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (including trastuzumab and pertuzumab) had little effect on event-free survival but increased AE, including two women who developed acute leukemia. As chemotherapy may primarily act in breast cancer by inducing terminal menopause, adding it to treatments designed to reduce estrogen levels may be superfluous. A 1999 study of metastatic (stage IV) melanoma showed there was no survival advantage to combining dacarbazine with cisplatin, carmustine and tamoxifen compared to high-dose dacarbazine alone. Only 25% of the patients on either regimen survived more than a year. 102 Fortunately, new immunotherapy drugs, such as a combination of CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors (ipilimumab and nivolumab), have revolutionized the outlook for patients with metastatic melanoma. A recent report showed 1-year survival exceeded 80%, with 4-year rates >50%. 103 A second caution is that while many FDAapproved compounds have been found to have antitumor cell activity in vitro in 'high-throughput' screening, moving them into human treatments is difficult. Not every new combination of drugs can be tested in a random control trial; the costs, not to mention the lack of suitable patients, would be prohibitive. Improving selection from 'shot in the dark' assays of whole cells requires better understanding of why a given drug is cytostatic, and skepticism is called for when effects in culture require unrealistically high concentrations. For example, emetine, better known as an active ingredient of Ipecac syrup used to induce vomiting, binds ribosomes 104 and has been reported to selectively kill AML cells. 105 Whether its side effects can be overcome sufficiently to justify testing as a cancer therapeutic is not currently clear.",

Another major difficulty in repurposing compounds is the need to assemble a proper patient pool for a blinded control study. One must take into account that cancer patients, especially those who are older, have additional disease, or have survived many different treatments and accompanying AE, are fragile. For example, a paper reporting a complete response to Ipilumab therapy following treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors ended by reporting the patient's death from side effects of the therapy. 107 Many trials, even of new drugs, are abandoned because they do not meet their target patient pool within a reasonable time frame, or the company funding it changes direction. Dosages that may be well tolerated in trials conducted using healthy subjects or when used for treating the diseases, the drug was originally intended for may not be achievable in cancer patients. Combination therapies only complicate these problems. However, individual treatments with older drugs can lead to remarkable cures. 108 Still, the best approach for a patient who has no clear alternative therapy may be to recommend an ongoing trial. Another alternative, for patients with genetic markers that correlate with the anticipated activity of a test intervention, is the N-of-1 trial. 109 Here, the patient serves as his/her own control.
