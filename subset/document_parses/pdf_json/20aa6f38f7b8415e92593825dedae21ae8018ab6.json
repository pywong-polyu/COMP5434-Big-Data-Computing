Their use during the COVID-19 pandemic could be one of the key points to reduce the risk of transmission both in healthcare and other public spaces. It is recognized that UVC light can stop microbial growth, and its physical approach is considered a good compromise between cost and effectiveness, which is why it is progressively becoming more and more widespread in healthcare and at home [19] . In addition, the introduction of standards such as E3131/18 (Standard Practice for Determining Antimicrobial Efficacy of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Against Microorganisms on Carriers with Simulated Soil) by The American Society for Testing and ISO 15714:2019 (Materials and the Method of Evaluating the UV dose to Airborne Microorganisms Transiting In-Duct Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Devices) will standardize tests and comparisons. There are many fields of UVC applications. The main one is the disinfection of hospital or public environments and fomites [20] , but the possibility of using them to disinfect and re-use PPE in case of shortages during the pandemic has also been considered [14] . Finally, the possibility of inactivating the virus in biological samples and transfusion material has been assessed [21, 22] .",

Given the known toxicity of mercury, the Minamata Convention on Mercury was signed by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) in 2013, and, from 2020, mercury-containing products will be banned, and new alternative UV devices should be used [25] Among them UVC LEDs have become an alternative by solving some of the limitations of mercury lamps: a reduced size allows for a greater field of application and the absence of a warm-up time, as they are minimally affected by operating temperatures, allows for faster times of use and avoids the heating of irradiated materials [23] .",

The wavelengths of the chip are centered around the maximum biocidal efficacy values of the UVC radiation (264 nm) [27] . Although there is still little evidence available, all three previous UVC technologies have proved effective in reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2, but our work is the first to test this chip technology on this emerging viral pathogen.

The new UV chip technology was effective in reducing vital SARS-CoV-2 to 3.2 Logs (99.94%) after 3 min from a starting titer of 7.2 Logs requiring about 15 mJ/cm 2 , and 35 mJ/cm 2 should be sufficient to have a reduction of TCID 50 equal to 5.7 Log (99.9998%). Figure 6 suggests that the maximum reduction achievable with the experiment (5.7 Logs) could have been achieved with irradiation times of less than 10 min and presumably just over 6 min. These results appear to be slightly better than similar studies. For example, Fischer et al. reported a reduction of 4 Logs (99.99%) starting from 4.5 Log TCID 50 /mL in 50 uL inoculated on stainless steel with 330 mJ/cm 2 exposure to UVC 260-285 nm [30] . According to Heilingloh et al., UVC 254 nm exposure produced a reduction of 6.7 Log TCID 50 /mL in 600 uL of viral suspension inoculated in 24 well plates with exposure to 1048 mJ/cm 2 [19] , and a deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode with 280 \u00b1 5 nm, tested by Inagaki et al., generated an abatement of 3.2 Log PFU/mL starting from 4.3 Log PFU/mL in 150 uL spread on a 60 mm petri dish and exposed to 75 mJ/cm 2 [22] . Hebling et al., from a review of the literature on other coronaviruses, have estimated that a dose of 3.7 mJ/cm 2 with an upper limit of 10.6 mJ/cm 2 is required for a 90% reduction of the coronavirus [5] . Different wavelengths may have a different efficacy on SARS-CoV-2; UVC radiation near 264 nm appears to have superior efficacy than higher wavelengths [27] . It should also be considered that the device we tested also has peaks in the UVA and UVB range that contribute to the virucidal effect albeit to a lesser degree; in fact, Heilingloh et al. reported the reduction of 1 Log at 365 nm with 292 mJ/cm 2 . However, Kitagawa et al. reported slightly better results: a 222 nm UVC light (0.1 mW/cm 2 ) reduced viable SARS-CoV-2 by 2.51 Log 10 in 30 s [31] . The effects may vary depending on the substrate considered. The radiation dose is lower in transparent substrates and thin layers, while the protein components of organic substrates, larger thicknesses, and the porosity of objects may shield the penetration of rays. In this regard, our study was carried out in a laboratory condition on a contaminated drop and not on objects taken in real public or hospital environments; however, the inoculated viral titer was very high and probably higher than what can be found in real conditions. UVC can be used to disinfect the FFP mask but a higher radiation dose is required due to the porosity of the material and the possible presence of substrates [14] . The distance of the sample from the light source can affect the experiment because the sample can be heated or can evaporate and thus the effects of UV can be overestimated; although high and prolonged temperatures are required to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 [5] . The chip tested does not heat up during operation, so the above effects, as well as damage to exposed materials caused by heat, can be considered negligible. Further studies will also be carried out to evaluate the impact of the geometry of the object on the distribution of light irradiation: larger objects can make shadows, which can decrease the reflected light, but for objects with a smaller surface the direct and reflected virucidal activity can add up and other light paths, which are difficult to identify, can increase the effect.",

Mercury technology, although still widely used, as mentioned above, will soon be replaced due to the toxicity of the metal. LEDs, pulsed-xenon UV devices, and novel chips are the main contenders. The chip, which does not even contain quartz, provides a wider diffusion and energy homogeneity of light in the space and is not affected by working temperatures. The wavelengths of the chip are centered around the maximum biocidal efficacy values of the UVC radiation (264 nm) but can cover multiple wavelengths, expanding the field of effectiveness, which is comparable to xenon technology although some lengths fall outside the UVC range. The device, which is a pre-industrial prototype, can be used in the disinfection of many objects, including medical devices of which phonendoscopes [32] can only be an example. In addition, it can also be used outside the strictly medical field in public places and even in homes.",
