Aiming at optimizing learning outcomes, we have combined theoretical instruction and practical training. From a theoretical educational perspective, trainees undergoing the presented curriculum have their existing knowledge challenged (dissonance), refine their knowledge and skills through completion of tasks, test and retest hypotheses in action, are then offered feedback, and finally reflect upon the process during the consolidation phase. [14] In this model of adult learning by Taylor et al, [14] simulation-based methodologies offer participants safe training opportunities to develop, test, and We have included further educational strategies such as repetitive practice, cognitive interactivity, multiple learning strategies, and dedicated feedback into our curriculum, all of which should improve the effectiveness of the educational intervention. [15] Participants had to repeatedly don/doff the PPE and to collect naso-/oropharyngeal swabs for RT-PCR testing. Cognitive interactivity, that is, \"training that promotes learners' cognitive engagement\" [15] was achieved through hands-on practice, multiple repetitions, task variation, and multiple learning strategies such as theoretical instruction, interactive skill demonstration, technical skills training, and simulator-based practice. Through learning and reflective feedback offered by peers, we expect an increase in learner engagement, which is a crucial aspect of effective learning. [16] A systematic literature review found positive results in 7 of 8 included studies evaluating the use of peer feedback for the development of professional behavior at the undergraduate level, concluding that \"peer feedback in collaborative learning is feasible and may be useful\". [17] Assessment can be understood as the measurement of learning outcomes and is \"the DNA of any formal education\". [18] To formally assess procedural proficiency and communication skills following our simulation-based training (ie, level 3 \"shows how\" on the learning assessment pyramid [19] ) and to minimize assessment bias, we have used a practical assessment with standardized, predefined learning goals in the form of an OSCE. According to Norman [20] \"the objective structured clinical examination . . . has come to dominate performance assessment\" and OSCEs may be best suited to identify poor performance. [21] Although all of our participants had undergone formal emergency medical training, we observed that structured theoretical and practical instruction in current hand hygiene guidelines [22] was an essential part of the program. Using a fluorescent-marked solution and ultra-violet light, participants were offered direct visual feedback on the quality of their hand hygiene technique and, thus, could improve on their performance.",

Repetitive training may be one strategy to reduce the risk of self-contamination when doffing the PPE and, therefore, every training participant was asked to don and doff the PPE completely at least 3 times during our 1-day training program.",
