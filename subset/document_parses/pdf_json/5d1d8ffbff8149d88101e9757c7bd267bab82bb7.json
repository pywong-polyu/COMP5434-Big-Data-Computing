Proper specimen collection is important for the diagnosis [3] . Studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid could be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, saliva, blood, urine, and anal swabs/feces of COVID-19 patients [4] , and the positive detection rate of sputum was the highest, followed by nasopharyngeal swabs [5] . However, not all patients are able to produce sputum, especially elderly patients and patients with endotracheal intubation, which makes it difficult to extract sputum. In addition, the high viscosity of sputum makes it difficult to extract nucleic acids. Therefore, most specimens collected at present are nasopharyngeal swabs. However, poor quality of nasopharyngeal swabs collection could contribute to false-negative results, and it has been reported that the rectal/anal swabs from some patients who in the recovery stage were persistently tested positive after the nasopharyngeal testing was negative [6, 7] . Thus, further research is needed to establish which specimen types are most suitable for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection.",

As shown in Fig. 1a , two patients had positive anal swabs but negative nasopharyngeal swabs, and one patient had only a positive anal swab among all specimens. Three patients had positive saliva specimens but negative nasopharyngeal swabs, with one of them having no other positive specimens. One patient was tested positive only in the blood. Of the two patients with positive urine nucleic acid, one patient had no other positive specimens and the other was also positive for the saliva and urine specimens. As shown in Fig. 1b , the mean viral loads of nasopharyngeal swabs, anal swabs, saliva, blood, and urine specimens were 16,224 \u00b1 67,507, 20 \u00b1 26, 5677 \u00b1 13,647, 16 \u00b1 9, and 5.1 \u00b1 0 copies/test, respectively. Figure 2a demonstrates the relationship between anti-N IgM/IgG antibody levels and days after symptoms onset.

All patients had positive anti-N IgG (100%), but no significant correlation was observed between anti-N IgM/IgG levels and days after symptoms onset. Figure 2b shows the relationship between anti-S-RBD IgG antibody level and days after symptoms onset; 7 patients (19%) had an anti-S-RBD IgG titer of less than 1:640, and again, no significant correlation between anti-S-RBD IgG level and days after symptoms onset was observed. (S/CO ratio \u2265 1), there is a tendency for the antibody level to decrease as viral load increased. Whereas the anti-N IgG level did not have a significant correlation with viral load, and the IgG level was extremely low in a patient with a viral load greater than 10 5 copies/test. Figure 3b shows the anti-S-RBD IgG level in relation to nasopharyngeal swab viral load, and again, no significant correlation was observed between the anti-S-RBD IgG level and viral load.",

            "text": "The results of nucleic acid testing of specimens showed that the positive detection rate of nasopharyngeal swabs was the highest, and the average viral load of nasopharyngeal swabs was also the highest. This finding is consistent with the results of existing reports [4] . Research has pointed out that viral infection may damage the gastrointestinal tract, so in the later stages of the disease, the virus may be detected in anal swabs [12] , and anal swabs/ fecal specimens may remain positive after the nasopharyngeal swabs become negative [13, 14] . The present study also observed this phenomenon, and the positive detection rate of anal swabs was relatively high, reaching 24%. A previous study has shown that the positive detection rate of saliva specimens is high, up to 61.5% [15] . The study found that viral nucleic acids could be detected in posterior oropharyngeal saliva specimens, and a better positive percent agreement was observed in specimens obtained within 7 days after symptoms onset. However, the positive detection rate of saliva specimens in our study was only 16%, which may be related to the sampling method and the day of specimen collection [16] . In summary, our results showed that the nasopharyngeal site is the best for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, the results also suggested that nucleic acid testing for convalescent patients should be done in nasopharyngeal swabs plus other specimens to get a more accurate diagnosis of full recovery from coronavirus infection since other specimens from patients with negative nasopharyngeal test result were tested positive in this study. It is recommended to test anal swab, because in this study, except for nasopharyngeal swabs, SARS-CoV-2 was mostly detected in anal swabs. Moreover, several studies have characterized the presence of live virus in feces [17] [18] [19] , indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted by fecal route. Notably, Wang et al. [19] failed to isolate virus in feces specimens collected at later time points of disease onset. Therefore, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in different specimens at different time points needs further investigation to better guide the clinical management of COVID-19 patients.",

The duration of IgM is short as the IgM level attenuates after reaching the peak at 14 days (9-23 days) while the duration of IgG is longer than IgM [20] .

This study analyzed the nucleic acid positive detection rate and viral load of different types of specimens from COVID-19 patients and studied the relationship of antibody levels with days after symptoms onset and viral load. The findings of this study provided the scientific basis for understanding the antibody responses and improving viral nucleic acid sampling and detection.
