In general, children experience a mild form of COVID-19 and have a much lower risk of severe forms than other age groups, according to some reports from multiple countries. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Throughout the pandemic, some cases were reported from various countries describing pediatric patients with unusual febrile disease, acute abdominal conditions, encephalopathy, elevated inflammatory markers, and multisystem involvement. [12] [13] [14] [15] The emerging disorder was termed \"pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2,\" or PIMS-TS. 14, 15 This new syndrome was termed as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) from The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). 16, 17 In recent studies, patients who met this definition were reported. 12, 13 Currently, there are insufficient data on the effects of both the COVID-19 infection and the pandemic period on pediatric rheumatic patients. To address this gap, in this study, we present our experience in children with rheumatic disease during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

A total of 4,470 patients (3, 122 in the outpatient clinic, 38 by consultation, and 1,310 via telemedicine) at our clinic during the pandemic were screened. We evaluated 1,310 patients by telemedicine (as reported by parents via phone consultation and was applied a questionnaire form including both for primary disease and suspected symptoms of COVID-19 with global patient/parent activity scores). If there was any suspicion about the disease, the patient was invited to the hospital. A child who met at least one of the following criteria was considered to be a COVID-19-positive patient: (i) The patients who were admitted to the hospital with symptoms of fever and acute respiratory infection (cough and/or respiratory distress) that were not explained for any other reason, and who needed to be hospitalized; (ii) The patients who had at least one of the symptoms of fever, cough or respiratory distress, as well as a history of contact with a patient with COVID-19 infection. 18 The criteria used for the diagnosis of MIS-C as follows (one had to meet 1 + 2 + 3): (i) A children presenting with fever (>38.0\u00b0C for \u226524 h), laboratory evidence of inflammation, and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization with multisystem (>2) organ involvement (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic or neurological); (ii) No alternative possible diagnoses or no obvious microbial cause of inflammation; and (iii) Positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serology, or antigen test; or exposure to a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case within the four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. 16, 17 The presence of at least one of the RT-PCR or antibody test positivity were required as the inclusion criteria. A contact history to a patient with COVID-19 infection was also required for inclusion, in the absence of positive laboratory or imagining result for COVID-19, in patients with a pre-diagnosis of MIS-C. Finally, a total of 87 patients (50 males, 37 females; median age: 12 years; range, 6.6 to 16 years) suspected of having COVID-19 at our pediatric rheumatology clinic were included ( Figure 1) Demographic features, medical histories, clinical symptoms, laboratory results, thoracic computed tomography (CT) findings, and clinical outcomes of patients were retrieved from the medical records. Respiratory samples from the all patients were analyzed with next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods for SARS-CoV-2. Thoracic CT examination was done using the Optima\u2122 CT 660 SE as 128 unit (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) device, both lung parenchyma (-700 to +1500 HU) and mediastinal area (+50 to +350 HU) were scanned. Thoracic CT was performed in a supine position without using a contrast agent. In patients who could cooperate, the shooting was done at the end of inspiration.",

Previous studies reported that there were both antirheumatic drugs and the disease might increase susceptibility prone to infections in patients with JIA. 21 However, some reports in adult patients with rheumatic diseases showed that the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) had a protective effect on the evolution of severe forms. 22, 23 In a report, a case with mild symptoms who used anti-IL-1 blockers during the COVID-19 pandemic was presented. 24 However, a study done in China found that rheumatic patients infected with COVID-19 might present with more severe symptoms, compared with non-rheumatic patients. 6 In the current approach guideline, pediatric rheumatic diseases and rheumatic drugs do not pose an increased risk for COVID-19, glucocorticoid therapy can be modified in case of infection, and existing bDMARD treatments should not be discontinued. 25 In this study, there were 31 JIA patients among COVID-19-suspected patients; these were 1.6% of all JIA patients evaluated during this period. Sixteen of 31 patients were receiving a biologic with or without methotrexate. Most of the patients using a biologic (76.9%) had to be hospitalized to receive treatment. In our cohort, while all patients with IL-1 blockers were hospitalized, this rate was 50% in patients treated with anti-TNF. It was seen from adult studies that patients with and without the rheumatic disease had similar clinical features and hospitalization rates. Besides, the rheumatic patients required intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation more often than the others. 5, 6 Ye et al. 6 reported from China that respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic patients infected with COVID-19. In our study, mild-to-moderate involvement on thoracic CT was observed in patients with or without using biological therapy. Our results do not support the protective role of biological drugs, similar to adult studies reported previously. 26 However, during the pandemic period, we can suggest that there is no risk of side effects that would require the cessation of these medicines.",

Five of the patients who received biological treatment and evaluated with suspicion of COVID-19 infection had MIS-C (27.7%); this rate was found to be 1.3% among all patients receiving biological treatment.
