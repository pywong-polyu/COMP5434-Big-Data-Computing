The main objective of this study was to review the applied wearable smart sensors for disease control and vital signs monitoring in epidemics outbreaks. A comprehensive search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Library, PubMed and Google Scholar databases to identify relevant studies published until June 2, 2020. Main extracted specifications for each paper are publication details, type of sensor, disease, type of monitored vital sign, function and usage. Of 277 articles, 11 studies were eligible for criteria. 36% of papers were published in 2020. Articles were published in 10 different journals and only in the Journal of Medical Systems more than one article was published. Most sensors were used to monitor body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure. Wearable devices (like a helmet, watch, or cuff) and body area network sensors were popular types which can be used monitoring vital signs for epidemic trending. 65% of total papers (n = 6) were conducted by the USA, Malaysia and India. Applying appropriate technological solutions could improve control and management of epidemic disease as well as the application of sensors for continuous monitoring of vital signs. However, further studies are needed to investigate the real effects of these sensors and their effectiveness.",

Focusing on disease prevention and early detection of high-risk disease disabilities is one of the main goals of using physical sensor networks (Majumder et al. 2017) . Todays, the smart systems and developed tools have significantly increased for the instant monitoring among the patients and controlling their conditions (Gries et al. 2018) . The ability of such smart systems in storing and transferring data is of great importance in different branches of healthcare (e.g. Telemedicine) (Ha et al. 2018) . Wearable systems are mainly used for monitoring the symptoms and status of patients, follow up, telemedicine, monitoring of nursing and medical team systems, surgery robots, and many other systems (Lin et al. 2018; Majumder and Deen 2019) . However, wearable sensors have received tremendous attention over the past decade, mainly concentrated in the healthcare industry. Such products attempt to apply physical signals such as heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, respiratory rate and body motion to extract clinically relevant information (Nag et al. 2019) . Wireless body sensor networks (WBAN) include a number of heterogeneous biological sensors (Richesson et al. 2019) . The sensors of such networks are placed on different areas of the body and these sensors can be worn or implanted on the body of the person. Each of these sensors requires specific requirements to identify and record symptoms (Rajan et al. 2018; Rezayi et al. 2019) .",

Consequently, according to the reviewed articles, sensors will be able to raise the ability obtaining massive amounts of information or big data and enhance precision and accuracy. These sensors or mini devices also reflect the developmental tendency of modern sensors. Moreover, artificial intelligence is a novel stimulus for smart sensors, which gets sensors to think and learn and feed more efficient results back.

Anyway, Given that these tools can reduce the presence of patients outside the home due to the possibility of patient care at home and reduce patient traffic to the hospital and thus reduce interactions between people and also have great potential to identify, these tools are expected to be widely used in this area (Mohammed et al. 2020) . Given the high cost of manufacturing and networking sensors, it can be argued that one of the main reasons for the low number of studies in this field is to provide funding for the construction of sensors and body networks (Dias and Paulo Silva Cunha 2018; Steinhubl et al. 2016) .",

In these type of smart devices, real-time data sent to healthcare providers simultaneously to track patients (Al-Janabi et al. 2017) . Besides, with the new pandemic of COVID-19, researchers used wearable sensors for early detection of infected patients. In reviewed articles, two kinds of sensors were introduced (Chung et al. 2020; Mohammed et al. 2020) . Researches applied wearable sensors to detect vital signs of patients, especially body temperature and respiratory rate. Consistent and accurate recording of vital signs in patients who suffered from COVID-19 is essential due to drastic changes in patients' signs and symptoms (Wang et al. 2020) . The application of such sensors empowered clinicians for early diagnosis of new coronavirus to decrease its mortality. According to the positive outcomes of using sensors in similar pandemic diseases such as Ebola, it seems that using wearable sensors could be beneficial in patients who are hospitalized at home for remote vital sign monitoring to pass undesired changes to their physicians immediately.",

Dias and Paulo Silva Cunha conducted a study of vital signs that are necessary for monitoring and concluded that heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation and body temperature are valuable vital signs (Dias and Paulo Silva Cunha 2018) . These vital signs are essential for assessing a person's health status and can be used to identify clinical deterioration. In patients with COVID-19, fever is one of the most common symptoms in these patients (Tabata et al. 2020) . Fever is one of the common clinical symptoms that appear when infectious diseases occur. It can be very helpful in diagnosing infectious diseases (Plaza et al. 2016) . Heart rate is a standard vital sign that its monitoring can provide information about the body's physiological state (Plaza et al. 2016) . Blood pressure monitoring is one of the most important indicators in determining a person's cardiovascular status (Dalvi et al. 2020) . Wearable sensors can be used to monitor these vital signs and help determine the health status of patients and thus can be effective in diagnosing diseases, especially in measuring wearable IoT sensor body temperature in infectious diseases and they can be very helpful to patients and health care providers. The study had several strengths, including searches on various databases; Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Library, PubMed, and Google Scholar. We also did not impose any time constraints on the article search process, and the articles presented at the conferences were also reviewed. The limitation of this study was to exclude non-English language studies.",

By applying a systematic approach, the authors provide a wide overview to use sensors that could monitor vital signs and disease progression through the epidemic. The survey showed that wearable sensors had the greatest potential in controlling and diagnosing the early signs of the disease in relation to epidemic diseases. Hence, applying appropriate technological solutions could improve control and management epidemic disease as well as the application of sensors for continuous monitoring vital signs. However, further studies are needed to investigate the real effects of these sensors and their effectiveness.",
