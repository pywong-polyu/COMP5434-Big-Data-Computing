This study examines the effects of two positive psychological resources on the mental health of Indian citizens during the early days of the lockdown. The effects of psychological capital (PsyCap) and internal locus of control on psychological distress of people via affect balance were tested. Data were collected through an online survey from 667 participants. Psychological distress was assessed using the GHQ-12, and affect balance was assessed as the preponderance of positive over negative affect. Results reveal that psychological capital and internal locus of control were negatively associated with psychological distress. In addition, affect balance mediated the relationship between psychological capital and psychological distress and the relationship between internal locus of control and psychological distress. Thus, both the psychological resources through affect balance acted as buffers protecting people from mental health deterioration during COVID-19 lockdown. However, the direct and indirect effects of psychological capital on psychological distress is stronger than that of internal locus of control. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.",

One of the major challenges during COVID-19 has been the phenomenon of physical distancing Okabe-Miyamoto, Folk, Lyubomirsky, & Dunn, 2020; Tran et al., 2020) . Since the early months of 2020, stringent lockdowns imposing restrictions on travel and social gathering became common in several countries. India was among the first nations to restrict international travels in January 2020 (DNA Web Team, 2020) . This was gradually followed by regional lockdowns and curfews in severely affected areas of the country. On 22 March 2020, a 14-h voluntary lockdown was observed (The Indian Express, 2020). Finally, the Government of India announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown from 24 March, 2020 (when the data was collected the lockdown was declared for 21 days, after that it was further extended till May 3, 2020). Workplaces, educational institutions, places of worship, shopping centers, and other commercial centers were to remain closed and railways and airlines services suspended. People were allowed to go out only for buying essential commodities during scheduled hours or else face punitive measures. The lockdown of such a scale and strictness, in spite of the adverse effects on the economy, hinted at the severity of the crisis.",

            "text": "Lockdowns, though potentially effective in controlling disease outbreaks, can be unsettling for people (Madhav et al., 2017) . Restrictions on day-to-day functioning, separation from loved ones, impending economic crises, impact on education and career, and lack of recreational activities, along with continuous hygiene practices, can cause mental health problems in anyone experiencing confinement (Pan American Health Organization, 2009; Vieira, Franco, Restrepo, & Abel, 2020) . Furthermore, the term 'lockdown' has negative connotations being associated with imprisonment and infringement of personal liberty (Arora, Jha, Alat, & Das, 2020; Pfefferbaum & North, 2020) . During COVID-19 lockdowns too, the disruption of personal and professional lives have been associated with several mental health issues (Odriozola-Gonz\u00e1lez, Planchuelo-G\u00f3mez, Irurtia, & de Luis-Garc\u00eda, 2020; Pandey et al., 2020; Zhang, Wang, Rauch, & Wei, 2020) . The most commonly reported were feelings of loss of control, depression, and anxiety-and stress-related conditions such as panic disorder, worry about own health and that of loved ones, and difficulty in sleeping or concentrating (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Le et al., 2020; Pierce et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2020; Tee et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b; Xiong et al., 2020) . In India, even before the nationwide lockdown was declared, people had been exhibiting anxiety-related behaviors in anticipation of a long-term shutdown. This was evident in panic buying and mass exodus of people toward their hometown since the beginning of March 2020 (Mukherjee, Bailay, & Shrivastava, 2020) .",

            "text": "The COVID-19 mental health discourse indicates that, as stressors cannot be avoided due to the pandemic mitigation measures, maintaining positivity can prevent mental health problems (Hagger, Keech, & Hamilton, 2020; Shacham et al., 2020) . In previous disease outbreaks of SARS (2002 SARS ( -2003 and HIV-AIDS, positive psychological resources such as locus of control, optimism, and resilience were found to be associated with both well-being and reduced mental illness (Chakraborty, 2020; Folkman & Moskowitz, 2000; Taylor, Helgeson, Reed, & Skokan, 1991) . In line with such findings, this paper examines the associations of two positive psychological resources, PsyCap and internal locus of control with mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in India. These resources enable positive reappraisal and other forms of adaptive coping during adverse events (Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007) and are positively associated with well-being and negatively associated with mental health problems. This research examines whether individuals high in PsyCap and internal locus of control experience less psychological distress due to affect balance or the experience of more positive over negative emotions. Such an examination would be useful as presently people are experiencing more negative and less positive emotions which is causing psychological distress (Government of India, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, except one study (Kim, 2020) , the role of these resources has not yet been examined in relation to mental health issues during COVID-19 (Rajkumar, 2020; Vindegaard & Benros, 2020) .",

They are thus able to positively reappraise adverse situations and reframe goals to address the demands of changed circumstances (Luthans et al., 2007; Manuti, 2014) . During lockdowns, rather than being passively locked inside homes, people were engaging in various activities which can be viewed as expressions of PsyCap resources (Vibha, Prabhu, Kamath, & Pai, 2020) . People were cheering each other through music and dance from their balconies (Locker & Hoffman, 2020) , sharing humorous content and stories of recoveries on social media (WHO, 2020), reaching out to socioeconomically disadvantaged sections, frontline workers, and isolated individuals (Ajmal, 2020) , and pursuing old hobbies. Thus PsyCap can enable individuals to engage in contextually relevant activities to adapt to the changed circumstances rather than dwelling on the negative implications of traumatic events (Schaubroeck et al., 2011; Vibha et al., 2020) . Furthermore, individuals with high PsyCap engage in more health promoting behaviors and gather more social support (Fang et al., 2020; Krasikova et al., 2015) . This might make adverse situations appear less threatening (Manuti, 2014) , and lessen anxiety about health risks, economic difficulties, and isolation during the lockdown (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).

The beliefs of control over consequences influence the actions people take to influence their conditions (McClure, Walkey, & Allen, 1999) . Individuals with internal locus of control consider it their personal responsibility to influence life circumstances through proactive behaviors and personal choices (Heinstrom, 2010; Wallston, 2015) . Even during disasters, when exercising control over global causes is not possible, individuals with internal locus of control engage in precautionary behaviors such as buying insurance (McClure et al., 1999) . In the current pandemic too the scope of personal control is low as the spread of infection also depends upon the behaviors of others. However, individuals with internal locus of control can engage in precautionary behaviors like washing hands, using masks, maintaining social distance to protect themselves from chances of contagion. Such efforts may make these unpredictable situations appear less threatening (Heinstrom, 2010) . Hence, it is expected that:",

Affect balance is a preponderance of positive affect over negative affect, and is a component of subjective well-being (Diener & Lucas, 1999) . According to the dual continua model, affect balance is a correlated but separate continua from psychological distress and has an adaptive role during stress (Diehl & Berg, 2011; Keyes, Dhingra, & Simoes, 2010; Machado, de Oliveira, Peregrino, & Cantilino, 2019; Westerhof & Keyes, 2010) .

This may be because the patterns of appraisal and coping reported by internals are more adaptive (Heinstrom, 2010; Peacock & Wong, 1996) . Even in adverse situations, internals may react to problems more constructively and proactively search for solutions (Gianakos, 2002; Kulshresta & Sen, 2006; Ng, Sorensen, & Eby, 2006) . For example, at the workplace, people with internal locus of control believe that they themselves control their work roles and such beliefs give rise to positive affective reactions (Ng et al., 2006) . Furthermore, in Asian population, though responsibility for success and failure is shared with others, when attributions of success are made to oneself it leads to positive affect (Yeo et al., 2017) . Therefore, during the lockdown, the belief that efforts can bear positive consequences, may form the basis of affect balance (Avey et al., 2011) and reduce psychological distress.

This research will facilitate an understanding of the associations of these two control-related psychological resources with mental health in a situation where the perceptions of control are severely challenged. There is already considerable research on prevalent mental health problems and risk factors for mental health deterioration during COVID-19 lockdowns (Rajkumar, 2020; Vindegaard & Benros, 2020) .

Internal locus of control, affect balance, gender, and age were observed variables. Psychological distress was a second-order variable with three first-order factors: social dysfunction, anxiety and depression, and loss of confidence. Gender and age were modelled as control variables to partial out their effect on affect balance and psychological distress. Gender was a categorical variable (1 = male, 2 = female) and age was a continuous variable. The maximum likelihood method of covariance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypotheses.",

Internal locus of control was positively related with positive affect and affect balance but inversely related with negative affect and psychological distress and its dimensions. Positive affect was positively related with affect balance and inversely related to negative affect and psychological distress and its dimensions. Affect balance was inversely related to psychological distress and all its dimensions. Psychological distress and its three dimensions were positively related with each other. Though correlation supported the hypothesized direct relations, the relations were bidirectional, therefore path analysis was carried out. Table 3 presents CFA results. All the items and the firstorder factors had significant loadings (p \u2264 .001) on the respective variables. Each variable had acceptable convergent validity (average variance extracted) > .50 and acceptable composite reliability > .70 (Hair Jr, Matthews, Matthews, & Sarstedt, 2017) . CFA models for all the variables had acceptable fit indices. The square roots of the average variance extracted (bold-faced values in the diagonal of Table 2 ) are all greater than their respective off-diagonal elements. This establishes the discriminant validity of the first-order factors.",

People high in PsyCap and internal locus of control reported low levels of psychological distress. Out of the two independent variables, PsyCap had stronger negative association with psychological distress than internal locus of control. Affect balance mediated the relationships between PsyCap and psychological distress, and that of internal locus of control and psychological distress. However, PsyCap had a stronger indirect effect on psychological distress through affect balance than internal locus of control. Recent studies emphasize the role of PsyCap in preventing psychological distress during COVID-19 (Dimino, Horan, & Stephenson, 2020; Kim, 2020) . Findings of this study provide empirical evidence that people high in PsyCap experienced low psychological distress during the early phases of lockdown in India. PsyCap fosters positive outcomes not only in organizations but also in multiple life domains such as interpersonal relationships (Avey, Wernsing, & Luthans, 2008) and academic performance (Finch et al., 2020) . Thus, PsyCap can be valuable in managing distress during lockdown as all spheres of life have been affected and personal and professional lives have overlapped (Wallace & Patrick, 2020) . Just as PsyCap prevents burnout (Moyer, Aziz, & Wuensch, 2017) and facilitates positive attitudes toward organizational change (Avey et al., 2008) , it may enable individuals to overcome distress associated with changed work-life settings during the lockdown.",

This may be because the strength of relationship between internal control and psychological distress depends on the nature of the stressor during periods of prolonged uncertainty. The negative associations are stronger for stressors perceived to be controllable than for those perceived to be uncontrollable (Papanikolaou et al., 2013; Peacock & Wong, 1996) . Furthermore, when stressors are not completely controllable, a mix of external and internal locus of control may be more useful (April, Dharani, & Peters, 2012) . Such evidence suggests that as the stressors experienced during the lockdown are not fully controllable, internal locus of control is only moderately effective in arresting mental health deterioration. The lockdown was initially declared for a limited time of 21 days, and there were some areas of personal control such as taking care of personal hygiene. Therefore, internals might have perceived some opportunities for control which arrested psychological distress to some extent.",

Earlier studies have found strong direct associations of PsyCap with well-being, in spite of the presence of intervening variables like coping (Rabenu et al., 2016) .

Affect balance denotes an individual's reactions to current events (Diener & Lucas, 1999) . Therefore, the mediation results show that PsyCap and internal locus of control are associated with affective reactions of people to the lockdown which further affects mental health problems. Control related psychological resources may sustain good mental health (Seligman, Steen, Park, & Peterson, 2005) and different resources can be salient for well-being in different life circumstances (Diener & Fujita, 1995) . The findings provide evidence that PsyCap and internal locus of control are associated with affect balance during uncertain life circumstances and thereby are valuable resources for adjusting to pandemic mitigation measures.",

Though both the resources negatively predicted psychological distress, PsyCap had stronger direct and indirect effects on psychological distress than internal locus of control. This can be because people with more resources are expected to experience more well-being (Hobfoll, 2011) . PsyCap as a resource caravan enables individuals to draw from multiple resources and can have stronger influence on psychological outcomes than individual resources such as internal locus of control. Furthermore, PsyCap provides the belief in one's abilities to overcome adversities while internal control provides the belief that one is responsible for one's life outcomes (Wallston, 2015) . In a situation such as a sudden lockdown the scope of control over consequences is limited. This might explain the weaker direct and indirect associations of internal locus of control with psychological distress via affect balance as compared to PsyCap. Therefore, the belief in one's abilities to steer ahead in spite of difficulties may be more predictive of well-being and psychological distress, than feeling responsible but not finding enough opportunities to exert control.",

The findings also lend empirical support to the ongoing discourse on the benefits of positivity in managing mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak (Hagger et al., 2020; WHO, 2020) . The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Government of India, 2020) has indicated the role of perceptions of control and positive emotions in managing mental health during the lockdown. This study provides evidence that during COVID-19, interventions to build psychological resources may prevent the loss of well-being and thereby prevent psychological distress. As PsyCap emerges as a stronger protective measure against psychological distress than internal locus of control, interventions should aim to make individuals feel efficacious and build their ability to look for alternate pathways to reach their goals in their day-to-day lives. Interventions can help more internally oriented individuals to identify the aspects of their lives they might be able to control. These findings have implications for psychotherapy interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and psychoeducation which have been employed to develop adaptive attributes during COVID-19 (Ho, Chee, & Ho, 2020) .",

Second, the use of convenience sampling and self-selected participants limits the generalization of the findings. Third, the sample consisted of the Indian citizens only, hence findings cannot be generalized to people in other countries with differing levels of COVID-19 severity. Fourth, the indirect effects in the study are moderate in size which indicates the possible presence of other mediators. Therefore, other mediators such as coping styles can be examined in future researches to understand the mechanisms through which PsyCap and locus of control reduce psychological distress. Future researchers can test this model adopting a longitudinal design which allows the assessment of mental health outcomes at different phases of the lockdown and can also make cross country comparison. This will provide more robust evidence on the role of PsyCap and internal locus of control in protecting against psychological distress.",

To this end, to the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the earliest studies to present empirical evidence of the role of different types of control resources, PsyCap and internal locus of control in managing mental health during a COVID-19 lockdown. The final solution to COVID-19 pandemic is out of sight.
