Biodegradable and biocompatible pH-sensitive chitosan-grafted polyacrylic acid (CTS-g-PAA) hydrogel was synthesized by grafting an acrylic acid monomer onto chitosan at the presence of methylene bisacrylamide as a cross-linking agent and ammonium persulphate as an initiator. FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the properties of the obtained hydrogel. The synthesized hydrogel is suitable for the delivery of many hydrophilic drugs or species. Using a multi-walled carbon nanotube modified-glassy carbon electrode (CNT-GCE), the loading and release conditions of Nile Blue (NB) as an electroactive compound were evaluated utilizing the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The effect of various parameters on the electrochemical signal of NB was investigated, and the optimal conditions for the efficient performance of hydrogel to delivery of NB were obtained. The electrocatalytic current values show linear dependence to NB concentration in the range of 0.098 -0.971 lM while the detection limit of this electrochemical platform was 12.3 nM. The unique proposed hydrogel with the electroactive NB has a broad range of possible applications in biosensors for signal enhancement and bioanalysis.",

            "text": "Hydrogels are cross-linked, three-dimensional polymer networks. Since they contain multiple hydrophilic groups, they have a high affinity for water, allowing them to absorb large quantities of water, up to more than 20% of their weight. They can also adsorb other bodily fluids [1] . Due to the formation of physical or chemical bonds between polymer chains, they are insoluble in water. These polymer networks are cross-linked via physical or chemical interactions. Chemically cross-linked hydrogels are typically made by photo, thermal, or initiated free-radical polymerization, while physically cross-linked networks are made through non-covalent interactions at the molecular level [2] . In addition, these polymer networks have a wide range of applications, ranging from daily life to advanced large industries [3] . Their physical properties such as permeation, swelling, surface specifications, and mechanical strength can be adjusted by structural modifications [4] . Based on the preparation source, hydrogels are divided into two natural and synthetic categories [5] . Hydrogels based on natural polymers have recently attracted a lot of interest due to their controlled delivery of bioactive molecules, biocompatibility, and tissue engineering capabilities [6] . Chitosan is a natural linear copolymer of glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine obtained by deacetylation of chitin, which is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature after cellulose [7] . It is a weak base that has a solubility in an acidic (pH \\ 6.5) medium and is insoluble in water and other organic solvents [8] . Because the synthesized hydrogel has several intrinsic properties such as sensitivity to pH, biocompatibility, low toxicity, biodegradability and, bioadhesion, so it can be applied in various domains such as biomedical, biological, pharmaceutical, and analytical fields [9] . Modified chitosan hydrogels are excellent carriers for delivering a variety of drug molecules [10] . Many studies have been published on chitosan hydrogel modifications and their applications in the delivery of various compounds, as described in ref [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . One of the main challenges in biomedical sciences in the diagnosis of severe diseases such as cancers is the existence of their relevant biomarkers at extremely low concentrations in the early stages of the disease, which are below the detection limits of many analytical techniques. Signal enhancement using drug carriers such as liposomes, hydrogels, polymersomes etc. [17, 18] is one of the most effective ways to improve these techniques' detection limits. These carriers can be loaded with a variety of marker molecules, and they are connected to the detection system using a suitable detection strategy. The related analytical signal of the released indicators is then recorded by providing optimal conditions for the release of the maximum number of indicator molecules. The obtained signal is proportional to the biomarker concentration in these biosensors. Instead of one or more indicator molecules, millions of indicator molecules are released from a single drug carrier which is recorded for each biomarker molecule. As a result, identification of such biomarkers at very low concentrations may be possible, increasing the chances of early diagnosis of diseases.",

Esmaeel Alipour et al. used dopamine-loaded liposome as a signal enhancer in the detection of oligonucleotides [19] . Mohammadreza Alizade-ghodsi and co-workers presented an electrochemical method based on signal amplification using liposome as a carrier for the detection of human telomerase activity [20] . More information about these carriers for electrochemical signal enhancement and also their applications in biomarkers detection are in ref [21] [22] [23] [24] . Since the carrier systems may load large amounts of electroactive indicators, it appears that by releasing a large amount of them (via physical or chemical changes), the electrochemical signal obtained can be amplified by several orders of magnitude. This strategy is critical for the sensitivity of electrochemical biosensors that are used to determine the key biological species. This study aimed to see if the pHsensitive CTS-g-PAA hydrogel could be used to load and release NB as an electroactive indicator by considering the prospect of being used as a carrier device for signal enhancement. The synthesized hydrogel was characterized and the differential pulse voltammetry studies were performed using the carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrode to assess the loading and release amounts of NB. In addition, the electrocatalytic activity of NB toward the modified electrode was studied in detail. ",

Furthermore, besides using filter paper, it was washed with distilled water until it was adjusted to the neutral pH. Subsequently, DMF was utilized as a dispersing solvent for obtaining a homogenous and relatively uniform suspension of CNTs for further modification of the electrode surface. In this regard, the black powder was dried in an oven for one day, and 4 mg of the nanotube powder and 2 mL DMF was stirred ultrasonically for 2 h. Finally, modification of electrode was performed by applying 4 lL of prepared CNTs on its surface followed by rinsing with distilled water for 20 min.

Thus at a given concentration of supporting electrolyte and increasing amounts of NB, DPVs were recorded using NB-CNT-GCE and their calibration curves were obtained. The magnitude of the calibration curve slopes was used to determine the best supporting electrolyte concentration.

Since the slope of this diagram (0.0601) is nearly identical to Nernst's slope, it is assumed that the number of electrons and protons shared in NB is the same. Following that, the effect of buffer type on the NB peak current was investigated. In the presence of various NB concentrations, the DPVs of the NB were obtained using three different 0.1 M buffers (brittonrobinson, phosphate, and Tris) with pH = 7. The slope of the calibration curve while using the phosphate buffer was noticeably higher than that of the others (it is approximately more than twofold the slope related to the britton-robinson buffer).

Figure 3A shows cyclic voltammograms of CNT-GCE in a 1 mM NB solution containing 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7) and 0.025 M NaCl, with scan rates ranging from 10 to 200 mV/s. Both Anodic and cathodic peak currents of NB are increased simultaneously by scan rates. The kinetic polarization of the electron transfer mechanism is indicated by an increase in anodic peak potential and a decrease in cathodic peak potential at higher scan rates. The diagram of cathodic peak currents of NB versus scan rates (inset x) and also versus the square root of scan rates (inset y) using the CNT-GCE is shown in the insets of Fig. 3A . The cathodic peak current variations are almost linear against both scan rate and root square of scan rate at the studied potential scan rates. Further studies have also confirmed that at lower scan rates the cathodic peak currents show a better linear correlation with scan rate. It means that at lower scan rates, adsorption controls the current. On the other hand, the peak current variations have better linearity versus the root square of scan rate at higher scan rates (Fig. 3B) , implying that the current is diffusive at higher scan rates. Figure 3C demonstrates the plot of log I versus log m at the scan rates ranging from 10-200 mV/s. It should also be noted that the slope of the described plot is approximately 1 for adsorptive currents and about 0.5 for diffusive currents. So, according to the slope of the plot in Fig. 3C , the electrode reactions are under the influence of both adsorption and diffusion at the studied scan rates. However, the adsorption one makes a larger contribution to the overall current.",

Signal amplification is one of the effective strategies for achieving this aim. Recently carrier systems have attracted much attention for their applications as signal amplifiers [19, 29, 30] . They can encapsulate various types of markers like enzymes, dyes, electrochemical or chemiluminescent compounds, and so on. The ability to load millions of marker molecules into a single carrier molecule causes the analytical signal to increase for many orders of magnitude, resulting in the detection of lower concentrations of intended analytes (analyte concentration is proportional to analytical signal). As a result, determining the conditions under which the greatest number of marker molecules can be loaded onto these carriers and then released, is becoming increasingly important.",

In contrast with the chitosan (Fig. S5A) , several new peaks were observed from the FT-IR spectrum of CTS-g-PAA hydrogel (Fig S5B) . Two peaks at 1546 cm -1 and 1401.2 cm -1 can be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of -COOgroups, respectively. In addition, a peak of 1691 cm -1 can be specified to the symmetric vibration of the C = O group of hydrogel structure. A peak at 1740 cm -1 is attributed to the amide group, because of cross-linking effect. A wide absorption peak at 3429 cm -1 is due to the vibration of the -OH group. In addition, a low-intensity absorption peak at 2880-2921 cm -1 corresponds to the C-H group [31, 32] . A comparison of the two FTIR spectra confirms the formation of the proposed hydrogel. The surface morphology of the resultant hydrogel was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure S6 shows the SEM image of the synthesized hydrogel before ( Figure S6A ) and after loading of NB ( Figure S6B ). The SEM results showed the wrinkled sheet morphology of the synthesized hydrogel. The existence of cavities on the hydrogel surface and in the internal zones exhibited a porous structure. Cavities cause a larger adsorption capacity at hydrogel which can be seen in the synthesized CTS-g-PAA hydrogel.",

According to this analysis, the obtained NB concentration within the cell was 0.37 lM. Thus, the amount of NB into the d-filtrate solution was estimated to be 55.87 lM that is equivalent to the 5.587 mM in the 120 mL of filtrate ethanol (equivalent to 670.44 lmole which is not loaded, see Sect. 2.2.2). As a result, from the total sum of 1.954 mmoles used during the hydrogel synthesis, 1.283 mmoles of NB were successfully loaded into the hydrogel structure (% Loading = 65.7).

Since the swelling of hydrogels is dependent on the electrostatic repulsion of charged species in hydrogel structure, any condition that reduces this repulsion, such as pH, counter ions, and ionic pressure, affects the degree of swelling. The significant changes in swelling are due to the existence of a variety of pH-dependent interactions in its environment. Since the amine groups of chitosan (C-2) protonated at low pH, the chain-chain electrostatic repulsion (between NH 3 ? -NH 3 ? ) increased, increasing the osmotic pressure within the hydrogel. Clions neutralize ammonium ions at very low pH (pH = 4) and cause the effective repulsion to decrease. Similarly, at pH = 6, the ionization of carboxyl groups (-COO -) increases the hydrogel swelling by establishing the electrostatic repulsion. The presence of counter ions (Na ? ) at pH = 8 -12 restricted the swelling capacity. As a result, large ionic concentrations at low and high pH resulted in an increased ionic strength, which was accompanied by a reduction in the osmotic pressure difference between the hydrogel and its surroundings, causing the swelling to decrease.",
