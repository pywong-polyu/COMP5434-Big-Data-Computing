            "text": "Objective This cross-sectional study quantified differences in (a) social determinants of health (SDOH) and perceived changes in SDOH during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and (b) COVID-19 psychosocial impacts across four groups: (a) non-Hispanic White (NHW) parents of children with asthma, (b) Black, Indigenous, or other People of Color (BIPOC) parents of healthy children, (c) BIPOC parents of children with asthma, and (d) NHW parents of healthy children (referent). The NIMHD Framework was used to identify SDOHs that may change for families during COVID-19. Methods Parents were recruited via Prolific (N \u00bc 321) and completed questions about COVID-19 family impacts on employment, income, access to food and healthcare, and psychosocial functioning, including discrimination. It was hypothesized that NHW families of children with asthma and BIPOC families would endorse greater negative outcomes relative to NHW parents of healthy children. Results BIPOC families experienced greater food insecurity and discrimination relative to NHW parents of healthy children. When compared with the NHW healthy group, COVID-19 resulted in greater parent-reported resource losses for both BIPOC groups and greater reductions in healthcare access for both asthma groups. Children with asthma and BIPOC children had greater distress surrounding COVID-19. BIPOC and NHW parents of children with asthma reported greater worries about resource losses due to COVID-19. Conclusions The pandemic is widening inequities for BIPOC families, especially for families of children with asthma. These results highlight the need for interventions that address the needs of underserved communities, providing the infrastructure, policies, and supports needed to reduce health inequities during and after COVID-19.",

The psychosocial burden of COVID-19 seems to be especially heavy for parents (Patrick et al., 2020) , particularly parents of children with pre-existing medical conditions (e.g., asthma; P\u0131nar Senkalfa et al., 2020; Tural et al., 2020) , and Black, Indigenous, or other People of Color (BIPOC) populations (Abrams & Szefler, 2020a; Fortuna et al., 2020) . COVID-19 is shedding a glaring light on the existing racial and health inequities in the United States, with BIPOC populations experiencing greater financial, physical, and mental health burdens during COVID-19 (Abrams & Szefler, 2020a; Fortuna et al., 2020) . Specifically, BIPOC individuals are disproportionately suffering from COVID-19 (Abedi et al., 2020; Laurencin & McClinton, 2020) , a trend mirrored among children, with BIPOC children experiencing higher COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations (Kim et al., 2020) .",

Emerging research has demonstrated that the following factors contribute to increased COVID-19 risk: prepandemic income disparities (Tai et al., 2021; U.S. Department of Labor, 2020) , poorer/ denser housing conditions (Brangin, 2020; Dutko et al., 2013; Hooper et al., 2020; Khunti et al., 2020) , employment in service jobs or as essential workers (Laurencin & McClinton, 2020; Tai et al., 2021) , healthcare access difficulties, lack of health insurance, mistrust of medical providers, housing and food insecurities, and barriers to accessing COVID-19 information (e.g., reduced technology access; Artiga et al., 2020; Bergstresser, 2015; Cholera et al., 2020; Hooper et al., 2020; Tai et al., 2021) ; Supplementary Material 1).Thus, SDOH are critical factors to consider when examining enhanced COVID-19 risk among BIPOC families; however, many important SDOH are also deteriorating during the pandemic, creating greater risk for BIPOC families. BIPOC families are experiencing more employment loss, financial hardships, and food insecurity during the pandemic relative to non-Hispanic White (NHW) families (Karpman et al., 2020) .

The aim of the current cross-sectional, online study was to quantify group differences in (a) SDOH, including perceived changes in income, parental employment, food security, and mental health and medical care during COVID-19, and (b) COVID-19 psychosocial impacts, e.g., worry about COVID-19 and worry about finances, across four groups of parents: (a) NHW parents of children with asthma, (b) BIPOC parents of healthy children, (c) BIPOC parents of children with asthma, and (d) NHW parents of healthy children (referent group) . The NIMHD Health Disparities Research Framework (Alvidrez et al., 2019 ; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, 2017) was used to identify important SDOH factors that may change (i.e., worsen) for families during COVID-19. It was hypothesized that NHW healthy families would have less mental health concerns, less exposures to detrimental SDOH, and less changes to SDOH during COVID-19 relative to NHW families of children with asthma, BIPOC families of healthy children, and BIPOC families of children with asthma, with the largest differences existing between the NHW healthy families and BIPOC families of children with asthma. This study also investigated how parental history of having COVID-19 and child history of COVID-19 testing (due to low numbers of COVID-19 diagnoses) would relate to psychosocial outcomes; it was hypothesized that these experiences would each be related to elevated mental health concerns.",

This study recruited four groups of parents (N \u00bc 321) from June 2020 to August 2020: (a) NHW parents of children with asthma (n \u00bc 62, 18.7%), (b) BIPOC parents of children with asthma (n \u00bc 91, 27.5%), (c) BIPOC parents of healthy children (n \u00bc 100, 30.2%), and (d) NHW parents of healthy children (n \u00bc 68, 20.5%; referent group). Inclusion criteria included parents aged !18 years, and parents as the legal guardian who lived with a child between the ages of 5-17 years. To identify eligible participants for each group, participants first completed a screener that assessed parent age, legal guardianship, and living with a child between the ages of 5-17 years; race/ethnicity and presence of child chronic medical conditions (e.g., asthma and other chronic medication conditions). Screener information from participants eligible for the study was exported and sorted based on group inclusion criteria. Parents who lived with a child with asthma (ages 5-17 years old) were eligible for one of two asthma groups (i.e., NHW or BIPOC parents with a child with asthma).",

Because there was no prior psychometric data available, exploratory factor analyses and other analyses (e.g., internal reliability) were conducted to establish how data about child past week emotional experiences and past week concerns surrounding COVID-19 from this measure should be used for primary analyses. Detailed descriptions of these analyses and the results are presented in Supplementary Material 2. Based on these analyses, two subscales of the past week emotional experiences due to COVID-19 (i.e., diminished positive emotional experiences (Cronbach's a \u00bc .82) and negative emotional experiences (Cronbach's a \u00bc .94)) and three subscales from the past week concerns about (Mehta, 2020) . Questions from the Coronavirus Impacts and Pandemic Stress module included assessed if the parent had been diagnosed with COVID-19; if COVID-19 had changed household income and access to food (response options : 0 \u00bc No to 3 \u00bc Severely/ Frequently) or access to medical and mental healthcare (response options : 0 \u00bc None to 4 \u00bc Severely); and if there had been any household stress/discord (response options: 0 \u00bc None; 1 \u00bc Household members occasionally get short-tempered with one another; 2 \u00bc Household members frequently get short-tempered with one another; children get into physical fights; 3 \u00bc Household members frequently get short-tempered with one another; adults in home throw things or harm one another).

            "text": "This study provides preliminary evidence that families of children with asthma and BIPOC families are experiencing greater amounts of COVID-19-related burdens relative to NHW parents of healthy children. Specifically, BIPOC families (of children with and without asthma) experienced more past year food insecurity and discrimination. COVID-19 has resulted in more parent-reported resource losses for both BIPOC groups and reduced healthcare access for both asthma groups; children with asthma and BIPOC children had more psychological distress surrounding COVID-19. Further, BIPOC and NHW parents of children with asthma were more worried about COVID-19 resource losses. The impacts of COVID-19 on families appear to be wide-reaching, negatively affecting parent and child mental health, and key drivers of overall physical health. Multilevel interventions, potentially guided by the NIMHD Health Disparities Research Framework (Supplementary Material 1) , are needed to support the psychosocial and resourcerelated well-being of families of children with asthma and families of color (Alvidrez et al., 2019 ; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, 2017). Racial inequities pervaded the United States before the pandemic, and COVID-19 health disparities are likely to widen for BIPOC families without proper intervention tactics (Tai et al., 2021) . This study illustrated that BIPOC families are experiencing significantly greater resource losses, healthcare access difficulties, and discrimination during the pandemic. Based on past year experiences, BIPOC families of children with asthma also experienced more food insecurity. Food insecurity may be impacted by the loss of school-based lunches: 45% of lower income BIPOC youth rely on free/reduced priced lunches for adequate nutrition compared with 8% of NHW youth (Snyder & Musu-Gillette, 2015) . These findings are consistent with other research that has documented greater income loss, employment loss, and food insecurity among BIPOC individuals during the pandemic (Karpman et al., 2020) . Results also highlight the potential consequences of ongoing structural racism (see Supplementary Material 1) .",

This pattern coincides with other research which documented that COVID-19 resource losses were associated with poorer parental and child psychological functioning (Gassman-Pines et al., 2020; Patrick et al., 2020; Russell et al., 2020) . This is the first study to investigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 among children with asthma and families of color. Our results are consistent with prior studies that found increased psychological distress among children with cystic fibrosis (P\u0131nar Senkalfa et al., 2020) and other chronic lung diseases (Tural et al., 2020) compared with healthy controls during COVID-19. Findings of this study also illuminated that BIPOC children (with and without asthma) appear to have experienced greater distress, including more worrying about resource losses during the pandemic relative to NHW healthy children. According to the NIMHD Health Disparities Research Framework, elevated mental health concerns and increased exposure to detrimental SDOH are contributors to health disparities (Alvidrez et al., 2019) , suggesting that BIPOC children are particularly in need of additional supports during the pandemic to buffer their current exposure to drivers of health inequity. There were few differences in parental psychological functioning between groups; however, BIPOC parents and NHW parents of children with asthma were more worried about resource losses due to COVID-19 compared with NHW parents of healthy children. This is an important finding because poorer parental psychological functioning during the pandemic has been correlated with more parent-child conflicts (Russell et al., 2020) and poorer child psychological outcomes (Romero et al., 2020) . The lack of other differences in parental mental health points to the resilience of BIPOC parents and parents of children with asthma; this individual/familial resilience, and potential community resilience, may buffer against other risks. Future research should investigate possible mechanisms supporting these families' resilience (e.g., social support and cultural involvement/enculturation) to inform disparity reduction interventions. Overall, these findings add to our limited understanding of how COVID-19 is affecting families of children with asthma (Hepkaya et al., 2020) , and highlights resilience and the need for resource supports among BIPOC families and families of children with asthma.",

The cross-sectional design of this study limits our understanding of the longitudinal impact of COVID-19 and precludes our ability to determine causal relations. Although the use of crowdsourcing methods have demonstrated comparable results to in-lab methods (Edgar et al., 2016) and allowed for nationwide recruitment of individuals from diverse backgrounds, there are also sample limitations. Our sample had higher levels of education and income than found in the general population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020) , which limits the generalizability of findings (e.g., families with lower education/income and families living in rural/underserved areas). Importantly, the disparities found in the current sample may be even more pronounced among a sample with greater representation of families from rural areas, with lower education/income, and from underserved areas. The use of parentproxy for assessing child psychosocial functioning is another limitation; shared method variance and parental worry may have influenced parent-proxy reports of child psychosocial functioning. Future research should incorporate both child and parent report of psychological COVID-19 impacts to increase generalizability. Several questions that assessed parental COVID-19 concerns lacked appropriate psychometric support from prior literature; however, our factor analytic approach may offset this concern. Future psychometric validation studies should be conducted on these parental COVID-19 concerns items. Another limitation is that we did not examine current asthma symptoms, severity, morbidity, or duration/type of asthma treatment; future research should investigate how these variables relate to family well-being during the pandemic (e.g., access to medical care, parent and child mental health). Last, it remains unclear how prepandemic levels of SDOH and psychological functioning influenced current pandemic levels.",

This study utilized a diverse sample of caregivers from underrepresented backgrounds, including BIPOC families and male caregivers, both populations who are largely understudied or limited in previous pandemic psychosocial research. Findings add to our limited understanding of how COVID-19 is affecting families of children with asthma and BIPOC families, and highlight the importance of enhancing resource supports for families of color and families of children with medical conditions. Future research should identify how SDOH and COVID-19 distress is associated with broader parent and child psychosocial functioning among families of children with asthma and BIPOC families, and how the pandemic may be influencing general family functioning (e.g., changes in school programming during the pandemic may influence parental stress, which in turns affects child psychosocial functioning).",
