However, neurological symptoms such as memory loss, sensory confusion, cognitive and psychiatric issues, severe headaches, and even stroke are reported in as many as 30% of cases and can persist even after the infection is over (so-called 'long COVID'). These neurological symptoms are thought to be caused by brain inflammation, triggered by the virus infecting the central nervous system of COVID-19 patients, however we still don't fully understand the mechanisms for these symptoms. The neurological effects of COVID-19 share many similarities to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's in which the presence of cytotoxic protein-based amyloid aggregates is a common etiological feature. Following the hypothesis that some neurological symptoms of COVID-19 may also follow an amyloid etiology we performed a bioinformatic scan of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, detecting peptide fragments that were predicted to be highly amyloidogenic. We selected two of these peptides and discovered that they do rapidly self-assemble into amyloid. Furthermore, these amyloid assemblies were shown to be highly toxic to a neuronal cell line. We introduce and support the idea that cytotoxic amyloid aggregates of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are causing some of the neurological symptoms commonly found in COVID-19 and contributing to long COVID, especially those symptoms which are novel to long COVID in contrast to other post-viral syndromes.",

As the proteome of SARS-COV-1 and SARS-COV-2 possess many similarities 13, 14 we propose amyloid nanofibrils formed from proteins in SARS-COV-2 may be responsible for the neurological symptoms in COVID-19. Further, there is evidence that SARS-COV-2 is neuroinvasive with either the full virus 15, 16 or viral proteins 16 being found in the CNS of mouse models and the post-mortem brain tissue of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, amyloid forming proteins from the SARS-COV-2 virus in the CNS of COVID-19 infected patients could have similar cytotoxic and inflammatory functions to amyloid assemblies that are the molecular hallmarks of amyloid related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (A\u03b2 , Tau) and Parkinson's (\u03b1-synuclein).",

If the proteome of SARS-COV-2 does contain amyloid forming sequences, this raises the question \"what is their function?\" To this end, there are a number of potential roles for amyloid assemblies in pathogens generally 17 and specifically in coronaviruses such as SARS-COV-2. The simplest is that amyloid is an inflammatory stimulus 18 , and pro-inflammatory cytokines can up-regulate expression of the spike protein receptor ACE-2 such that intercellular transmissibility of SARS-COV-2 is increased 19 .",

            "text": "It is also possible that amyloid assemblies in coronaviruses might have a role in inhibiting the action of the host antiviral response. Mitochondrial antiviral-signalling proteins (MAVS) are activated during viral infections, this activation is a binary effect where nearly all the MAVS in a cell are activated in quick succession, this triggers the cell to process antiviral molecules such as type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. 23 It is believed that this rapid activation occurs by a catalytic prion-like process where the MAVS self-assemble into fibrillar structures on the surface of the mitochondria. Amyloids formed by the SARS-COV-2 proteome may interact with the prion-like MAVS, binding to and inhibiting their self-assembly. This would prevent the binary activation of the MAVS and inhibit the antiviral signalling effects. Such an inhibitory mechanism based on co-assembly or amyloid self-recognition would closely resemble action of peptide inhibitors which have been developed as potential anti-amyloid therapies for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. 24 Similar co-assembly mechanisms between murine cytomegaloviruses and human RIPK3 kinase have been seen by Pham et. al. 25 These hybrid amyloids are also proposed to inhibit the signalling capabilities of the host protein.",

Such lipid droplets have been found to play vital roles in controlling the antiviral immune response through modulation of type-1 interferon and viral replication rates in a number of different viral infections including Furthermore, the importance of lipidic structures (extracellular vesicles, lipid droplets etc) in the antiviral response is becoming more apparent. 30, 31 Therefore, as amyloids are well known to be efficient binders and disrupters of lipid membranes 32-35 , it is entirely possible that amyloids in viral proteomes may have evolved to disrupt the membrane of antiviral lipid bodies either destroying them totally, or reducing their antiviral properties.",

By sequence and length they appear to be largely unstructured, making them good candidates for amyloid formation in vivo. We performed a bioinformatic screening of the ORF proteins to look for potential amyloidogenic peptide sequences. This analysis was used to select two subsequences, one each from ORF6 and ORF10, for synthesis. The synthesised peptides were both found to rapidly self-assemble into amyloid assemblies with crystal, needle and ribbonlike morphologies. Cytotoxicity assays on neuronal cell lines showed these peptide assemblies to be highly toxic at concentrations as low as 0.0005%.",

ORF8 and ORF10 are the only two coded proteins present in SARS-CoV-2 which do not have a homologue in SARS-CoV. 39 While long-term consequences from SARS-CoV were severe, including tiredness, depression, and impaired respiration, few or zero unequivocally neurological post-viral symptoms were recorded from the (admittedly quite small) set of documented cases. 40 2/13",

Due to the fact ILLIIM contains no charged sidechains, synthesising capped sequences to high purity would have been very challenging, therefore only the RNYIAQVD sequence remained capped and the ILLIIM sequence had regular carboxyl and amino termini. Self-assembly was initiated by dissolving the peptides at 1 or 5 mg mL \u22121 in hot PBS (80 \u2022 C); the peptide solutions were vortexed vigorously and held at 80 \u2022 C for three hours to ensure maximum dissolution.

Application of the ZIPPER tool to ORF-6 provides more than 10 choices of six-residue windows of the sequence predicted to be highly amyloidogenic (1a), while ORF10 shows only 3 such highly amyloidogenic sequence windows (1b). In order to narrow down our search for candidate peptides we also used the TANGO algorithm, which operates in a similar manner. For ORF6 there are two regions that are predicted to be highly aggregation prone, I 14 LLIIMR and D 30 YIINLIIKNL. The region I 14 -R 20 overlaps almost perfectly with the hexapeptide I 14 LLIIM identified by ZIPPER. The region 30-40 also contains multiple hits in ZIPPER, but as this study was limited to two candidate peptides we chose ILLIIM as our first candidate as it closely resembles the sequence ILQINS from Hen Egg White Lysozyme which has previously been seen to be highly amyloidogenic (the mutation TFQINS in human lysozyme is disease-linked). [53] [54] [55] Looking now at the TANGO plots for ORF-10 the main aggregation prone sequence is residues F 11 TIYSLLLC, although there are no high stability hexapeptides in this sequence predicted by ZIPPER. The octapeptide R 24 NYIAQVD was chosen due to its zwitterionic residue pair R-D which physically should strongly enhance interpeptide association, despite being too far apart in the sequence to trigger the highly local bioinformatics algorithms. Encouragingly ZIPPER also predicts the hexapeptide NYIAQV contained within RNYIAQVD to be highly amyloidogenic. Based on the outputs from ZIPPER and TANGO and also on experience of making and studying amyloid we selected RNYIAQVD and ILLIIM to be synthesised and their amyloid forming capability investigated.

This population of longer fibrils correlates with the observation from figure 2 that for RNYIAQVD longer, thinner assemblies are favoured (self-assembly via fibril extension) over the wider shorter assemblies more commonly seen for ILLIIM (assembly via lateral association of protofilaments). Analysis of the persistence length of the fibrils (figure S9) showed that whilst both peptides formed very straight linear fibrils, the stiffness of RNYIAQVD (\u03bb = 41.92 \u00b5m) is greater than that of ILLIIM (\u03bb = 31.96 \u00b5m). Figure 4 shows the radially averaged 1D SAXS plots for ILLIIM and RNYIAQVD at the lower concentration studied (at the higher concentration, sedimentation made recording X-ray scattering spectra impossible). In the central part of the scattering curve the ILLIIM assemblies produced a slope with a q \u22122 dependence which is consistent with the form factor of an infinite 2D surface. 53 Together with the AFM and TEM data this implies a wide flat ribbon architecture similar to that seen in related amyloidogenic short peptides. 53, 56 RNYIAQVD however, displays a q \u22124 dependence in the (later) central part of the scattering curve, appearing more towards the high-q limit. Porod's law indicates that q \u22124 scaling (at high q but still less than 0.1\u00c5 \u22121 ) is consistent with any aggregates having sharp and well-defined flat (2D) surfaces but does not otherwise specify shape 57 . Figure 4b shows the CD spectra of mature assemblies (> 5 days), of both peptides. Assemblies of ILLIIM display a quite simple spectrum indicating dominance of \u03b2 -sheets, with a minimum between 225-230 nm and a strong maximum at 205 nm. 53 The CD spectra of RNYIAQVD are less obvious and seem to resemble the typical spectra of a random polypeptide coil, except in that there is a well-defined minimum at 203 nm (a typical random coil is < 200 nm) and additional shoulder appears at around 215 nm.",

            "text": "To further investigate the predicted secondary structure of both peptide assemblies we employed the secondary structure prediction software BeStSel (figure S8). 45, 58 As expected from the classic shape of the spectra the predicted secondary structure of ILLIIM is exclusively made up of \u03b2 -sheets ( 49 %) and \u03b2 -turns (51 %). Interestingly, the BeStSel analysis predicts a mixture of right twisted and left twisted \u03b2 -sheets, with a slight preference of left twist (30 % of the total structure) compared to right twist (19 %) . RNYIAQVD however, appears to be composed of a more complex mixture of secondary structures, that are still dominated by \u03b2 -sheets and \u03b2 -turns (42 %). The remainder was composed of helical signal (23 %) and further backbone conformation which could not be assigned (35 %) . Interestingly almost all of the \u03b2 -sheets in RNYIAQVD are predicted to be right-handed, with only 0.9 % displaying a left handed twist. Part-helical CD spectra do not necessarily imply helical structure, especially considering that a single octapeptide cannot literally be 23% helix (two residues). Backbone conformation as reported by CD correlates through sheet structure to assembled tertiary structure but no single level of organisation exclusively dictates any other, this is especially true in the case of coupling the twist of a peptide strand to the overall twist of the aggregate, which can relax to meet surface and shape-driven constraints through intersheet and interchain as well as intrachain degrees of freedom. 53 The amyloid nature of the two assemblies is further confirmed by the WAXS spectra (figure 4d) of the peptide assemblies which possessed a number of strongly diffracting Bragg peaks. Both peptides have a clear peak at 1.38 \u00c5 \u22121 corresponding to a d-spacing of 4.6 \u00c5 which is very indicative of an amyloid assembly composed of extended beta sheets. 59 ILLIIM also has a very strong Bragg reflection at 0.58 \u00c5 \u22121 (11 \u00c5) corresponding to a typical intersheet spacing given moderately bulky hydrophobic sidechains forming a steric zipper. RNYIAQVD has a number of well-defined Bragg peaks in between 0.3-0.8 \u00c5 \u22121 which are consistent with a mixture of first and second order reflections corresponding to an amyloid-like 3D symmetry. Discovery of sub-\u00c5ngstrom resolution structures from solution WAXS is not at this time a very tractable problem, however given the simple nature of the scattering from the ILLIIM system it was possible to prepare an atomistic model matching the observed peaks. The sheet-like shape factor and the presence of peaks at roughly 2\u03c0/4.6 \u00c5 \u22121 and 2\u03c0/11 \u00c5 \u22121 indicate assembly dominated by the hydrogen bonding axis (with the typical parallel beta sheet period of \u22484.8\u00c5) and by a sidechain-sidechain hydrophobic zipper interface. A candidate structure of size 6\u00d750\u00d71 peptides was constructed following this geometry and found to reproduce the observed WAXS and to fully exclude water at the steric zipper ( figure 5) .",

Both peptides show rapid assembly kinetics reaching a plateau after 30-60 minutes. This behaviour is typical of amyloidogenic short peptides, which can assemble very rapidly without the lag phase typically seen in the amyloid kinetics of longer polypeptide sequences. 53, 60 This is unsurprising as the short peptides have no additional non-amyloidogenic sequence to reduce the assembly kinetics of the peptides. The ThT signal for ILLIIM at 5 mg mL \u22121 plateaus at about 300 a.u., this is slightly stronger than the maximum signal generated from mature fibrils of the somewhat homologous peptide ILQINS, which was around 250 a.u. 51, [53] [54] [55] suggesting that the amyloidogenicity of the two peptides is comparable. RNYIAQVD, whilst showing similar ThT values at low concentrations (1 mg mL \u22121 ), generated a ThT signal nearly 3 times as large at 5 mg mL \u22121 suggesting that the assembly of this peptide is highly concentration dependent. For reasons yet unknown, it seems that RNYIAQVD appears to reach a maximum ThT value and then begin to drop, this can be seen at both concentrations but is most obvious at the higher concentration. This could be due to a reversible self-assembly as seen in other functional amyloids, 56, [59] [60] [61] , or to self-quenching of the amyloid bound aromatic ThT molecules, or simply to a reduction of exposed ThT-binding sites as larger aggregates with a lower surface area to volume ratio come to dominate the solution.",

            "text": "Cytotoxicity of both studied peptides also began to drop slightly (without strong statistical significance) at the highest concentrations tested (vide infra, figure 6 ), together with the drop in ThT response this supports the existence of a kinetically or thermodynamically available aggregate structure with reduced 'amyloid activity'. This is reminiscent of strongly amyloidcorrelated diseases such as AD, where the toxicity of amyloid can vary dramatically, with the relation between the amount of amyloid deposited to the progress of the disease being idiosyncratic and highly non-linear. 62 ILLIIM and RNYIAQVD peptide assemblies are both highly toxic towards the neuroblastoma cell line Given the physical evidence, and the discussions referred to in the Introduction of various means by which SARS-COV-2 and other viral infections could enhance their fitness (to the detriment of the host) by production of amyloidogenic peptides, we hypothesised that the SARS-COV-2 viral transcript fragments ILLIIM and RNYIAQVD are toxic to human neurons. This is in particular supported by the previously reported neuroinvasive capabilities of of SARS-COV-2, 15, 16 the noted similarities of the symptoms to a (hopefully transient form of) Alzheimer's disease 5 and the previous detection of amyloid assemblies driven by other viruses. 17 To investigate this further we performed cytotoxicity assays of the two peptide sequences against a human derived neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) often used as a model cell line for studying Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases. 63 We found that both assemblies were highly toxic after 48 h incubation with the peptide assemblies. Concentrations as low as 0.05 and < 0.04 mM (for RNYIAQVD and ILLIIM respectively) were seen to kill > 50% (IC50) of the cell lines ( Figure 6 ). This toxicity in relation to concentration is similar to that reported for A\u03b2 42 64 although expression levels and time-envelopes (sudden for COVID versus chronic for AD) are likely to be very different. The toxic nature of these amyloid assemblies warrants further investigations into the potential presence of amyloid aggregates from SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS of COVID-19 patients, and the potential responsibility of amyloid for some of the neurological symptoms observed. a) The two major peaks (dark grey) agree well, and some agreement in second order peaks (light grey) is also present. b) The modelled 2D structure (parallel \u03b2 hydrogen bonding axis goes into page). Hydrophobic sidechains form a typical amyloid steric zipper. It is not proved that the solution structure is strictly 2D, however the modelling does show that the SAXS/WAXS is consistent with an absence of full 3D symmetry in solution. ",
