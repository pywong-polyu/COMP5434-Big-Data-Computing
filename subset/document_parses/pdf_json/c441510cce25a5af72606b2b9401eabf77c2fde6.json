The evolution of infection mechanisms is a research topic in areas such as virology and ecology. Mathematical modelling has been an essential tool to obtain a better systematic and quantitative understanding of the processes of parasitic infection that are difficult to discern through strictly experimental approaches. In this article we review recent attempts using mathematical models to discriminate and quantify these infection mechanisms. We also emphasize the challenges that these models could bring to new fields of study such as social sciences and economics.",

Because viruses are the most abundant and simple entities on the planet, they are often used as models to study the evolution of parasitic infections. In particular, parameters such as replication, mortality rate of the infected host, infection rate (absorption rate), among others, have been suggested as possible control parameters used by parasites to optimally infect hosts [3] [4] [5] [6] . This paper reviewed the different mathematical models that describe the traditional and recently proposed infection mechanisms. In addition, we reviewed how these are used in the optimal dispersion of infections through susceptible host populations.",

This theory states that natural selection maximizes the number of secondary infections resulting from infection of a susceptible host through free channels that do not involve direct contact between infected and susceptible hosts [7] . One way of doing this is by the evolution of the infection rate, which is the probability of a parasite infecting a host after direct contact. In restricted environments, the classical theory predicts that a parasite will evolve to an infinite maximum infection rate. However, experiments using bacteria as a host and viruses as parasites show the unexpected appearance of viruses with a moderate or intermediate infection rate [8, 9] . How and under what conditions this intermediate rate evolves is still an open question. The proposed section reviews the classical and recent models that try to explain this phenomenon It has been suggested that infection channels between infected and susceptible hosts may provide an advantage, either by allowing parasites to evade the host's immune response [10] , reducing antiviral drug activity [11] , or simply having a more efficient mode of infection.",
