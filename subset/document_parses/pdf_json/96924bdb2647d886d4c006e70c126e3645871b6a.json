This research aimed to analyze the science and health-related hoaxes that were spread during the pandemic with the objectives of (1) identifying the characteristics of the form and content of such false information, and the platforms used to spread them, and (2) formulating a typology that can be used to classify the different types of hoaxes according to their connection with scientific information. The study was conducted by analyzing the content of hoaxes which were debunked by the three main fact-checking organizations in Spain in the three months following WHO's announcement of the pandemic (N = 533). The results indicated that science and health content played a prominent role in shaping the spread of these hoaxes during the pandemic. The most common hoaxes on science and health involved information on scientific research or health management, used text, were based on deception, used real sources, were international in scope, and were spread through social networks. Based on the analysis, we proposed a system for classifying science and healthrelated hoaxes, and identified four types according to their connection to scientific knowledge: \"hasty\" science, decontextualized science, badly interpreted science, and falsehood without a scientific basis. The rampant propagation and widespread availability of disinformation point to the need to foster media and scientific caution and literacy among the public and increase awareness of the importance of timing and substantiation of scientific research. The results can be useful in improving media literacy to face disinformation, and the typology we formulate can help develop future systems for automated detection of health and science-related hoaxes.",

This phenomenon reached such levels that the World Health Organization (WHO) described it as a \"massive infodemic,\" and warned the world of its dangers as it prevents the public from accessing the much-needed reliable information about the disease [1] . It is well known that many of the hoaxes were focused on scientific and health-related topics [2, 3] . However, the relationship between scientific information and the characteristics of these hoaxes has not been elucidated. For the first time in contemporary history, a pandemic of this magnitude was experienced, and all media outlets across the globe disseminated a huge amount of \"express science\" that gave rise to a problematic relationship between science and society. A lot of information was based on preprints of scientific publications that had not yet undergone a peer-review process, and this contributed to public misinformation.",

Subsequently, another preliminary, unreviewed article written by a group of French scientists suggested that nicotine could have preventive and healing effects against COVID-19. The researchers themselves warned people against jumping to premature conclusions and urged them to make a distinction between nicotine and tobacco, a product that contains thousands of toxic substances.

Exaggerations, which accounted for 13.90% of the total, were hoaxes in which facts were represented disproportionately.

This preliminary article was withdrawn by the authors within three days of being published after errors were discovered in their bioinformatics analysis and interpretation. However, it was one of the most talked about hoaxes on social networks at the time and promoted the false notion that SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered in a laboratory. On other occasions, disinformation was generated when politics and scientific fraud came together. One of the most prominent cases is the hydroxychloroquine treatment scandal. Preliminary studies had shown that this compound inhibits viral replication in vitro [55] . These findings indicated that hydroxychloroquine was one of the first antivirals to be tested in severe COVID-19 cases. French microbiologist Didier Raoult, advisor to the French government in the fight against the pandemic, promptly claimed that this compound was an effective treatment for COVID-19 in humans. The WHO even included the medication in its international clinical trial. The issue was further clouded by US President Donald Trump's revelation that he was taking hydroxychloroquine to protect himself from coronavirus. To complicate matters further, an article published in The Lancet warned that hydroxychloroquine was not only useless, but also associated with adverse effects and an increased risk of death [56] . However, the study did not follow experimental protocols and a group of scientists questioned its results. The work could not be independently verified; therefore, The Lancet was forced to retract the article. The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine became a political issue, with some \"in favor\" and others \"against\" the treatment, based primarily on ideological rather than scientific reasons.",
