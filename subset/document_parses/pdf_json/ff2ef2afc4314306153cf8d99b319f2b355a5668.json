Methods: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. Results: A total of 663 patients with COVID-19 were included, while 67 patients with T2DM accounted for 10.1% of the total. Compared with patients with COVID-19 without T2DM, those with T2DM were older (aged 66 years vs 57 years; P < 0.001) and had a male predominance (62.7% vs 37.3%; P = 0.019) and higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (61.2% vs 20.6%; P < 0.001) and urinary diseases (9% vs 2.5%; P = 0.014). Patients with T2DM were prone to developing severe (58.2% vs 46.3%; P = 0.002) and critical COVID-19 (20.9% vs 13.4%; P = 0.002) and having poor therapeutic effect (76.1% vs 60.4%; P = 0.017). But there was no obvious difference in the mortality between patients with COVID-19 with and without T2DM (4.5% vs 3.7%; P = 0.732). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that T2DM was associated with poor therapeutic effect in patients with COVID-19 (odd ratio [OR] 2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-8.66; P = 0.04). Moreover, having a severe and critical COVID-19 condition (OR 3.27; 95% CI, 1.02-9.00; P = 0.029) and decreased lymphocytes (OR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.10-2.34; P = 0.016) were independent risk factors associated with poor therapeutic effect in patients with COVID-19 with T2DM.",

Excessive fluctuations in blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes can cause glucose, fat, and protein metabolic disorders with long-term hyperglycemic conditions, which lead to a decline in the body's immune function and reduction in respiratory organ function. Thus, intrapulmonary infection is very common and prone to severe pneumonia in patients with diabetes (7) . The severe stress response triggered by severe pneumonia will lead to proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory balance disorders in the body. The immense release of catecholamines and glucocorticoids induces blood glucose elevation, further aggravating the infection, leading to a vicious cycle of the disease. When it becomes severe, pneumonia is a threat for patients with diabetes (8) . Severe pneumonia and diabetes induce each other; diabetes will promote the onset of pneumonia, and the patient's infection is difficult to control.",

The criteria used to define CT findings as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" was based on interim guidelines for COVID-19 (trial implementation of the revised fifth edition) from the National Health Organization and Commission of China (9) . When chest CT finding showed the following features, it was defined as normal: no enlargement of 2 hilus pulmonis; unobstructed trachea and bronchi; clear blood vessels; no enlarged lymph nodes in mediastinum; no abnormalities in pleura, ribs, and soft tissues of the chest wall; and no hydrothorax. Otherwise, chest CT images were regarded as abnormal. CT images were independently reviewed by 2 radiologists, and all discrepancies were resolved by consensus. CT images with the following features were defined as pneumonia: multiple small, patchy shadows and interstitial changes or multiple ground-glass opacity and infiltrating shadow in the lungs. When chest CT images showed pneumonia was just on 1 side of lungs, it was defined as \"single side,\" and when chest CT images showed bilateral pneumonia, it was defined as \"double sides. \" The disease severity is determined based on the interim guidelines for COVID-19 from the National Health Organization and Commission of China and the WHO (9, 10) . According to the patient's symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, and imaging results at admission, the disease severity of patients with COVID-19 (patient condition) is classified into the following 4 types of conditions: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Patients with mild clinical symptoms and no finding of pneumonia on chest CT image were considered as having a mild condition. If patients had a fever or respiratory symptoms, they were classified into the moderate condition. Once the patients had 1of the following 3 symptoms, they were treated as severe: respiratory disorders and respiratory rate more than 30 times per minute, blood oxygen saturation of fingertips below 93% at rest, or partial arterial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen \u2264300 mmHg. Patients with 1 of the following 3 serious situations were considered as critical: respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, state of shock, or other organ failure requiring treatment in the intensive care unit. The criteria of therapeutic effect are based on interim guidelines for COVID-19 (trial implementation of the revised fifth edition) from the National Health Organization and Commission of China (9) . When the patient had 1 of the following conditions during follow-up, the patient's therapeutic effect was considered as improvement: (1)Body temperature returned to normal (below 37.3\u00b0C) for at least 3 days, and respiratory symptoms improved significantly (disappeared or obviously relieved); (2) gradual reduction of pulmonary inflammation according to lung CT image analysis (obviously reduced shadow area); (3)negative results in 2 consecutive tests for SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction detection (sampling time at least 1 day apart). Otherwise, the patient's therapeutic effects were regarded as having no improvement.",

T2DM can activate the inflammatory response downstream of nuclear factor-\u03baB and accelerate atherosclerosis. Long-term, high-glucose stimulation will lead to increased expression of endothelin-1 and its receptors, which may cause cardiovascular complications in patients with T2DM. Studies have shown that the prognosis of T2DM-related heart disease was worse than in patients without T2DM with heart disease (16) . Furthermore, patients with T2DM with urinary diseases such as urinary infections are also significantly higher than those without T2DM. Patients with T2DM are prone to infections of various systems, therefore urinary system infection is one of the most common infectious diseases (17) , which is also consistent with our conclusions. The main mechanisms are as follows. First, hyperglycemia is conducive to the growth and reproduction of pathogenic bacteria. Second, hyperglycemia causes cell dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and internal environment disturbances to promote the occurrence and spread of infection. Finally, the decrease in granulocyte function and humoral and cellular immune functions also play an important role in causing urinary system infection (18) . The most common symptoms at admission for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in our study were fever (79.5%), cough (61.8%), fatigue (31.4%), and expectoration (25.0%). Additionally, the initial symptoms of some patients were diarrhea, dizziness, and fatigue. The previous research indicated that the most common clinical symptoms of patients infected with SARS-CoV were fever (99%), nonproductive cough (69%), myalgia (49%), and dyspnea (42%) (19) . It is evident that the clinical manifestations of patients with SARS-CoV-2 are different among patients, and the rate of patients with fever as the onset symptom was lower than for those with SARS-CoV infection. However, there was no significant difference in clinical manifestations between patients with and without diabetes.",

            "text": "Patients with T2DM with COVID-19 are prone to a severe state, and the therapeutic effects are much poorer than in patients without T2DM. The possible explanations are as follows. First, the pulmonary vascular bed and alveolar surfactants in patients with diabetes are often damaged. On autopsy results of patients with T2DM, thickening of the alveolar epithelium, pulmonary capillary basal layer, and pulmonary microangiopathy are often observed, and patients with diabetes often have significant decline in lung function (22) . Second, hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency in patients with diabetes will reduce synthesis of proinflammatory factors such as interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin 15 (IL-15) and have influence on downstream acute inflammatory responses. Therefore, it will impair the host's innate and humoral immunity (22) . It has been found that the inflammatory substance interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and oxidative stress marker human 8 isoprostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-iso-PGF2\u03b1) in patients with T2DM are significantly higher than in those without diabetes (23) . Diabetes also impairs the function of macrophages and lymphocytes, which reduces the immune response and makes individuals more susceptible to infections (24) . Third, chronic disease (such as diabetes) and infectious diseases and their complications share several common characteristics such as endothelial dysfunction, proinflammatory status, and innate immune response (25) (26) (27) . When viral infection is severe, the excess of cytokines related to the conversion of T-helper type 1 (Th1) to Th2 and the cytokine synthesis disorder caused by metabolic diseases may cause damage to the endothelium and lead to a series of subsequent complications (27) . Innate immune changes and the transformation of Th1 (the microbicidal effect of interferon-\u03b3) to Th2 (anti-inflammatory IL-4, -5, -10, and -13) make the virus presentation stronger in patients with diabetes, therefore fatal allergy can be observed in virally infected patients with diabetes (28) .",

However, our study also has some shortcomings. First, there were only 3 deaths in patients with T2DM. It was impossible to make a multivariate regression analysis with mortality as the dependent variable, so we conducted multivariate regression analysis with therapeutic effect (no improvement) as the dependent variable. Second, we acknowledge the limitation that there were a number of covarying differences between control participants and the individuals with T2DM because of the individual differences in the patients. Third, there is increasing evidence supporting that obesity is one of the important risk factors for COVID-19, especially in the T2DM population. However, in this study there is an absence of data on body mass index (overweight or obese) since we did not collect enough data on body mass index or factors of being overweight and obese to analyze. And last, our study is a singlecenter study.",
