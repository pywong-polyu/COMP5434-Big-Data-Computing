            "text": "This study explores the stories of eight women supervised by probation during the first national lockdown in the United Kingdom in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Probation quickly implemented an exceptional delivery model to protect the health and safety of staff and service users. Covid-19 has highlighted societal disparities across the world, it can be suggested that this has hugely impacted the lives of women and further extending the gender inequality gap. Although acknowledging that this is a small-scale study, it does provide a platform for women to voice and share their experiences of both problematic challenges encountered and the opportunities embraced during the first national lockdown. Firstly, the importance of supervisory relationships kept women feeling connected, emotionally supported and provided a source for practical advice. Secondly, the experiences of lockdown were felt differently dependant on the vulnerabilities and complexities of women; in short, the greater the priority need the more issues and obstacles women encountered. Thirdly, remote probation supervision was regarded as the safest and appropriate way to approach the unchartered waters of Covid-19. And finally, there was shared optimism to return to 'normal' face-toface supervision, re-engage with services that had been paused or interrupted to aid recovery and rehabilitation.",

            "text": "There has been a surge of interest recently into the impact of Covid-19 ranging from bio-medical to social behavioural research. It is therefore an optimum time to explore the impact of Covid-19 in a probation setting. In particular to focus on the experiences of women. This exploratory study has been conducted to provide an in-depth insight into the journey of eight women supervised by a community rehabilitation company (CRC) during the Covid-19 pandemic. Providing a platform for women to ensure that their voices are heard and listened to by the criminal justice system. The following literature review summarises the key messages when working with women in a criminal justice setting, a brief reflection on the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequential changes it brought to probation practice. This will highlight the current gaps in our existing knowledge and justify the need for further research on both women and the impact of Covid-19 on operational practice in probation. The findings discuss five emerging themes that outline the stories of eight women, sharing both the problematic challenges encountered and the opportunities embraced during the first national lockdown. This will add to the existing and growing literature on the impact Covid-19 has had on probation, a service that has had to rapidly respond and change operational practice over the past year. Furthermore, it begins to shed some light on essential lessons learnt on remote supervision to aid recovery and rehabilitation.",

            "text": "The failings of the criminal justice system to address the needs of women have had a long and persistent history. Over a decade ago the Corston report (2007) called for radical changes and highlighted the failings of the criminal justice system in meeting the specific and unique needs of women on probation. Key messages were that 'equal treatment of men and women does not result in equal outcomes' and 'a distinct approach [to women] is required' (Corston, 2007: 16/3) . The 43 recommendations the report made remain essential to provide a holistic and individualised approach for women on probation (Gilbert and O'Dowd, 2019) . In 2017, 'the Corston report 10 years on' outlined the progress that had been achieved. It identified a clear 'stagnation and loss of momentum in fully implementing the Corston report's recommendations' (Women in Prison, 2017: 27) . However, there was recognition that the 'policy rhetoric surrounding women in the criminal justice system has remained strong' (Women in Prison, 2017: 27) . For example, in 2018 Corston's recommendations were incorporated into the 'female offender strategy' (Ministry of Justice, 2018) . This strategy set out an aspirational commitment towards the complex needs and vulnerabilities of women on probation. However, some commentators regarded the strategy as both implausible and inadequate (Booth et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Women in the criminal justice system are often characterised by a complex set of vulnerabilities in both the prevalence and complexity of their needs (Ministry of Justice, 2018) . Women differ in a number of important ways from their male counterparts, with the majority convicted for 'non-violent, low level persistent offences' (Ministry of Justice, 2018: 5) because of this, women are more likely to receive short sentencing decisions (Earle, 2017; Masson, 2019; Prison Reform Trust, 2019) . Women's histories are regularly characterised by experiences of oppression and abuse (Pollock, 1998; Cabinet Office Social Exclusion Unit and Ministry of Justice, 2009) and in adulthood homelessness and substance misuse (Pollock, 1998) . Their problems can be further aggravated by their roles as mothers (Gelsthorpe et al., 2007) . These experiences have all been identified as key issues in producing and sustaining criminality in women (Bloom et al., 2004) . Over recent years the emergence of the 'feminist pathway research' or 'gendered pathways research' has gathered pace (Nuytiens and Christiaens, 2016) . Providing the opportunity for probation officers to work in a gender-specific service (Holtfreter and Wattanaporn, 2014) supporting women to deal with past trauma, addictions and mental health concerns (Golder et al., 2015) to build resilience and autonomy (Bartlett et al., 2015) . However, as discussed earlier with little systemic change the women's review and strategy remain as relevant and poignant today as it did over a decade ago.",

In February 2020, the first UK transmission of the virus was confirmed. To contain the spread of the virus the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson imposed regulations and restrictions and by late March the Government announced the first national lockdown. Covid-19 is one of the biggest public health challenges of modern times. Throughout 2020 and into 2021 Covid-19 related deaths sharply peaked and troughed in the UK. The pandemic has deepened pre-existing inequalities exposing vulnerabilities in social, political and economic systems (United Nations, 2020) . This has confirmed that 'the impact of Covid-19 has replicated existing health inequalities and, in some cases has increased them' (Public Health England, 2020: 4) . Although the broader impact of Covid-19 remains to be seen, the gendered consequences of the unfolding crisis are stark and already clearly visible. 'The impacts of Covid-19 are exacerbated for women and girls simply by virtue of their sex' (United Nations, 2020: 2). The imposition of restrictions, combined with family commitments, economic uncertainty and increased risk of domestic abuse caused by the pandemic, may further worsen the inequalities women face. As the first lockdown was imposed in early March 2020, some women found themselves in extremely vulnerable situations at home with little access to support services.",

In response to the pandemic, exceptional delivery arrangements were introduced across probation to protect the health and safety of probation officers and people on probation. The exceptional delivery model and 'roadmaps' were arguably drawn up in haste (HMPPS, 2020) and significantly changed the nature of probation practice during lockdown. In line with government restrictions, probation implemented social distancing measures, scaled back face-to-face supervision, established emergency plans to transfer offender supervision to remote telephone contact and applied doorstop visits for high-risk cases. For women identified as high risk of harm, probation increased their monitoring, conducted socially distanced doorstop visits, and made assessments about their living conditions. Those identified as most at risk were placed in alternative accommodation for their own safety. There was a tendency to rely on remote supervision contact for the majority of cases. 'Like in many aspects of our lives, technology is being deployed to bridge the gap in face-to-face contact' (Carr, 2020: 96) . Some probation activity, such as unpaid work, was unable to be completed and rehabilitative activity requirements were often interrupted due to restrictions and operational changes. Interest in the impact of Covid-19 on probation practice has been steadily growing (Dominey et al., 2020; HMPPS, 2020; McGreevy, 2020; McNeill, 2020) .",

As advised by HMPPS, remote data collection methods were prioritised, and the research comprised semistructured telephone interviews. This project was commissioned by a CRC to understand the impact of remote supervision on women. Throughout the spring of 2020, six probation officers acted as gatekeepers to the fieldwork, utilising their professional judgement to invite women on their caseload who were actively engaging with the CRC. If a person was interested in taking part, a time and date for the telephone interview were scheduled. A total of eight participants were recruited based on the gatekeeper's assessment of suitability. The information sheet and ethical statement were discussed verbally, any questions or queries answered, and verbal consent taken. The interviews were recorded with the participants' permission and lasted an average of 98.46 min, with a time range of 61.24-135.59 min. All participants had a 15 min debrief session to make sure that they felt comfortable with the subject area of the interview, gauge their overall experience of taking part in the study and to check whether any additional support was needed post-interview. Thematic analysis was used by the researcher (Woolford) to analyse the transcripts. The researcher was able to construct open questions, allowing interviewees the freedom to respond. This provided a 'therapeutic' way of generating a wealth of data from the participants (Braun and Clarke, 2006; Howitt, 2010) . Interviews were read and re-read to ensure familiarisation whilst documenting initial codes identifying interesting features of the data. The researcher then went back to the data to refine and define key themes which had emerged. The quotes that most clearly illustrate the themes and sub-themes were selected and used to organise the findings. The results form the basis of a discussion on the impact of Covid-19, remote supervision and the exceptional delivery model. The small and selective sample size is recognised by the researcher to limit the generalisability of the results as the views expressed in this study may not represent the general caseload of women supervised by a CRC. Despite these limitations, the small in-depth study captured richly textured data exploring the individual journey and story of each participant. The chosen sampling technique provided additional screening to protect and safeguard both the participants and the researcher from harm.",

Some of the participants recognised that probation officers had to work really hard to facilitate 'open', 'honest', 'frank' and 'truthful' remote supervisions.

Similarly, (Amanda) explained 'it's easy to share over the phone when things are going well but it's much harder to share when things are going badly and without visiting the centre it is easier to hide'. The openness of the participants clearly went back to the therapeutic relationship established with their probation officer. As (June) stated 'to make any progress you have to trust your probation officer'. There was a strong emphasis on women's welfare and wellbeing during the pandemic. The women commended the probation officers for being 'genuine', 'caring', and 'accessible' throughout the lockdown. The complexities and vulnerabilities of the participants meant that the probation service also provided an outlet for significant emotional strain. All of the participants discussed feelings of 'relief', 'lower levels of stress and anxiety' after their telephone catch-up with probation. 'After a call with [my probation officer] I feel emotionally lighter, less tense and I feel positive about the rest of my day' (June).

However, there was a sense of enthusiasm to return to face-to-face supervision at the women's centre. The majority of participants said that they were 'now ready' as well as 'enthusiastic', 'keen' and 'looking forward' to going back to the women's centre. The main reasons given were to meet up with a friend they had made through probation; face-to-face contact with their probation officer and getting on with their probation order. 'I am 100% ready to go back to group, see the girls and start having discussions with staff' (June). The participants reflected on the 'long' and 'hard' road of lockdown with a hope for returning to the women's centre bringing a sense of normality. 'When I am back doing group, I will feel that the worse of lockdown is over' (Beatrice). Many of the women were looking forward to completing the activities attached to their probation order or the voluntary courses identified by their probation officer. 'Listening and sharing experiences made me feel like I wasn't alone in dealing with these issues' (Leona). During lockdown, the peer support and shared experiences delivered in the women's centres were not available. Therefore, it could be questioned whether the women were receiving enough wrap around support especially in relation to maintaining healthy relationships with partners.",

Therefore, returning to a form of 'normal' probation practice was vital to give women the knowledge and skills to identify potentially toxic and dysfunctional relationships. As (Davina) said, she was really looking forward to attending the empowerment course at the women's centre as it would 'help me learn to recognize the signs of when I'm in another abusive relationship'. In terms of future victimisation, the limited availability of rehabilitative activities during remote supervision could be a serious concern in relation to the safety of vulnerable and potentially at-risk women. The value of the interventions, activities and courses is clearly described below: I loved attending the group work with the other girls \u2026 it made me feel as though I am not alone. I listen to other people sharing their experiences and I feel much better about myself \u2026 especially when talking about past bad relationships, I don't feel so stupid anymore (Amanda).",

The model was also reliant on people on probation having access to digital platforms.

The participants discussed both the problematic challenges and opportunities embraced through the restrictions imposed during the pandemic whilst being supervised by a CRC. Similar to the findings of HMIP (2020), the experiences of remote supervision varied between people depending on personal circumstances, complexities and vulnerabilities. The most common type of contact used during remote supervision with people on probation was via telephone by probation officers working from home (HMIP, 2020) . The supervision process focused on offering practical support to service users, such as food deliveries or accessing medication (McGreevy, 2020; McNeill, 2020) .

Research has consistently identified that women on probation 'tend to have a history of unmet personal, health and structural needs, compounded very often by substance misuse and childcare responsibilities' (Sheehan et al., 2010: 349) . Therefore, community-based services should be based on relationships between staff and women (Malloch and McIvor, 2011; Malloch et al., 2008) . Building therapeutic relationships support women to deal with past victimisation, abusive relationships and mental health concerns. The supervisory relationship is pivotal in building engagement and compliance (McNeill and Robinson, 2013; Weaver and Barry, 2014) . A successful approach to supervising women is 'characterised by openness, trust and a degree of reciprocity' especially during Covid-19 'receiving valued practical assistance and support' from their probation officers (Malloch and McIvor, 2011: 334) . In general, women on probation said that the level of respect, communication, support, and encouragement provided by their probation officers can make the difference between their success and failure. This style of working is effective because it brings the women on board reflecting their own hopes and aspirations. 'Evidence adds up to a need to work with women in non-authoritarian co-operative settings, where women are empowered to engage in social and personal change' (Gelsthorpe, 2011: 131) . However, there are limited assurances that positive relationships with people on probation are at the heart of practice (Burnett and McNeill, 2005; Canton, 2012; Trotter, 1999) .",

The pandemic drove new digital technology as a way of working for probation. However, digital exclusion has only been made worse by this. Although the CRC did make arrangements to provide mobile phones for women, there was a basic assumption that people would be able to access or use the information technology equipment. In addition, women with more complex needs and vulnerabilities perceived deterioration in their emotional wellbeing through remote supervision. Characteristics include strained relationships, feelings of isolation, children in care and those shielding or vulnerable to Covid-19. These findings were mirrored by previous literature, with people on probation encountering significant increases in mental health difficulties (Musimbe-Rix, 2020) with a reduction in the number of support services available during the pandemic, such as mental health or substance misuse provisions (HMIP, 2020) . Without access to facial cues and body language, this could potentially limit the professional judgement of the level of need and risk. As Dominey et al. (2020) suggested remote supervision meant that 'communication was harder and important messages were often missed'. This may have led to missed opportunities to support women in addressing or challenging their offending behaviour or monitoring a potential escalation in risk.",

Further exacerbating the pressures on an understaffed workforce, Phillips (2020) reminds us that 'around 2000 staff had to stop working due to sickness or the need to self-isolate'. Specifically reflecting on supervising women, previous literature has recognised that women have high levels of need and would require more frequent contact than men (Malloch and McIvor, 2011) . The 'type of frequency, regularity and volume of contact was welcomed' by people on probation (HMIP, 2020: 29) . This study highlights that during the pandemic telephone supervision was often more frequent with the women. However, this could potentially leave high expectations of their probation officers (Malloch and McIvor, 2011) . Understandably, balancing work and home life was a constant pressure on probation officers that increased the potential for them to experience burnout. As well as potentially leaving staff open to the blurring of professional and personal boundaries (McNeill, 2020) . However, there have been concerns raised from probation officers working remotely from home including overworking, issues of confidentiality, inviting trauma into their homes and maintaining boundaries.

The participants welcomed the opportunity for telephone appointments as there was less interference in their home life, they did not have to re-organise their routine and for health and safety concerns. Durnescu (2010) described 'the requirements to attend appointments with a certain regularity' (p. 535) as the deprivation of autonomy and travel time. For women not considered high risk or high need, this was not a requirement during lockdown. Similarly, other studies have found the negative consequences of compliance in travelling to an office location that would be 'harder to reach by public transport' (Phillips et al., 2020: 269) or where people are expected 'to travel as far as 200 km for their appointment' (Durnescu, 2010: 537) .",

            "text": "The study presents a timely and in-depth exploration of the stories of women supervised by a CRC during Covid-19. In response to the pandemic an exceptional delivery model was rapidly introduced across the probation estate to protect both probation officers and people on probation. The global impact of Covid-19 has arguably aggravated gender inequalities faced by women across the world and therefore could have had a negative impact upon the emotional and mental wellbeing of women who rely on probation services. The aim of this study was to bring to light the voices of women supervised by probation during lockdown. The existing literature extensively evidences the need for women on probation to receive gender-specific care. However, there still remains a massive gap in provisions and policies implemented are still largely inadequate in meeting the needs of women. The women in this study discussed both problematic challenges and the potential to embrace opportunities of remote supervision. Similar to the previous literature, the more vulnerable and complex women were, the more obstacles, difficulties, and deterioration in mental health were experienced. The relationship between probation officers and the women was instrumental during the pandemic in providing support and practical advice. Remote supervision provided greater flexibility for women to engage with probation services. However, this resulted in additional pressures on workloads, the potential to miss information and greater difficulty in monitoring risk and vulnerabilities. In general, remote supervision was perceived as the most appropriate, safe and suitable way to negotiate through the unchartered waters of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although there was an enthusiasm to return to 'normal' probation practice to continue on their road to recovery and rehabilitation. Further larger studies are needed, with a particular focus on women to inform policy and practice during unchartered times of a pandemic.",
