Obesity, also known as the pandemic of the 21st century, has been evolving as an adverse prognostic marker. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of being SARS-CoV-2-positive (46%), as well as hospitalization (113%) and death (48%) due to COVID-19. It is especially true for subjects with morbid obesity. Also, observational studies suggest that in the case of COVID-19, no favorable \"obesity paradox\" is observed. Therefore, it is postulated to introduce a new entity, i.e., coronavirus disease-related cardiometabolic syndrome (CIRCS). In theory, it applies to all stages of COVID-19, i.e., prevention, acute proceedings (from COVID-19 diagnosis to resolution or three months), and long-term outcomes. Consequently, lifestyle changes, glycemic control, and regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway have crucial implications for preventing and managing subjects with COVID-19. Finally, it is crucial to use cardioprotective drugs such as angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers and statins. Nevertheless, there is the need to conduct prospective studies and registries better to evaluate the issue of obesity in COVID-19 patients.",

Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT-1) blockade by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) or inhibition of angiotensin II formation by ACE inhibitors, frequently administered in obese subjects with arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, may theoretically predispose to an increase in transmembrane ACE2 levels with a simultaneous decrease in soluble ACE2 levels. Nevertheless, there is a broad agreement amid professional medical societies in Europe and America to carry on with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway inhibitors in subjects currently taking these medications. Zhang et al. proved that subjects treated with ACE inhibitors/ARB characterized a 63% lower risk of COVID-19 death than subjects who did not receive ACE inhibitors/ARB [21] . Statins are emerging as another group of drugs that could reduce the risk of unfavorable outcomes in subjects with COVID-19.

Also, glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) may play an important role in obese patients with COVID-19. These drugs have been initially used in diabetes treatment but now are also used in the management of obesity itself. GLP-1RAs exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, exert pulmonary protective effects, and have a beneficial influence on, gut microbiome [23] . However, in some animal studies, GLP-1RAs increased ACE-2 levels promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection [24] . Therefore, further well-conducted clinical studies are still in need.",

Subjects with overweight and obesity outface a higher risk of detrimental COVID-19 complications, like hospitalization, intensive care management, and death. This is especially true for subjects with morbid obesity. Also, observational studies suggest that in the case of COVID-19, no favorable \"obesity paradox\" is observed. Inflammatory state, a hallmark of aging and obesity, may play a crucial role in promoting an unfavorable COVID-19 course. Lifestyle, glycemic control, and regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway have important implications for preventing and managing subjects with COVID-19. And it is crucial to use cardioprotective drugs such as ACE inhibitors/ARB and statins. Nevertheless, there is the need to conduct prospective studies and registries better to evaluate the issue of obesity in COVID-19 patients.",
