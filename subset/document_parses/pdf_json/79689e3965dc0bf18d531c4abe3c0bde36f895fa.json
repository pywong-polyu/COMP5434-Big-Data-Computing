            "text": "Background: Acute Heart Failure (AHF) is a potentially lethal pathology and is often encountered in the prehospital setting. Although an association between prehospital arterial hypercapnia in AHF patients and admission in highdependency and intensive care units has been previously described, there is little data to support an association between prehospital arterial hypercapnia and mortality in this population. Methods: This was a retrospective study based on electronically recorded prehospital medical files. All adult patients with AHF were included. Records lacking arterial blood gas data were excluded. Other exclusion criteria included the presence of a potentially confounding diagnosis, prehospital cardiac arrest, and inter-hospital transfers. Hypercapnia was defined as a PaCO 2 higher than 6.0 kPa. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were 7-day mortality and emergency room length of stay (ER LOS). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. Results: We included 225 patients in the analysis. Prehospital hypercapnia was found in 132 (58.7%) patients. Inhospital mortality was higher in patients with hypercapnia (17.4% [23/132] versus 6.5% [6/93], p = 0.016), with a crude odds-ratio of 3.06 (95%CI 1.19-7.85). After adjustment for pre-specified covariates, the adjusted OR was 3.18 ). The overall 7-day mortality was also higher in hypercapnic patients (13.6% versus 5.5%, p = 0.044), and ER LOS was shorter in this population (5.6 h versus 7.1 h, p = 0.018). Conclusion: Prehospital hypercapnia is associated with an increase in in-hospital and 7-day mortality in patient with AHF.",

This covers a population of 500\u2032000 persons. This physician-staffed prehospital system has already been described in prior studies [14, 23] . Briefly, a SMUR unit is called whenever a critical situation, such as severe AHF, is identified. These units can either be dispatched by the emergency medical call center or requested by the paramedics already on site. The paramedics and physicians who staff this unit are trained to provide prehospital NIV (defined as application of bilevel positive airway pressure) and perform arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis [23] . Even though venous blood gas analysis could also be considered to assess capnia [24] , the current prehospital treatment protocol requires arterial blood to be drawn if prehospital physicians decide to perform an analysis of blood gases. In our system, ABG analysis is strongly encouraged whenever NIV is initiated in the prehospital setting and physicians are only allowed one attempt at drawing arterial blood, in one minute at most.",

Confounders were selected based on the literature and physiological plausibility. The adjusted OR with its 95% confidence interval is reported.

After excluding 572 patients ( Fig. 1) 225 patients (28.2%) were included in the analysis. The main exclusion criteria was a lack of ABG (448 patients). The rationale for no ABG being performed was unknown in most cases (291/448, 65%). Documented reasons for absence of ABG were a failed attempt by physician or collection of a venous sample (78), technical failure of the analyzer (31), medical decision (45), and patient refusal [3] . Baseline patient characteristics are described in Table 1 . Overall, patients had a mean age of 83.9 years (with 27.6% of them being 90 years or older), and 58.7% of them had prehospital hypercapnia. Patients without hypercapnia had a median PaCO 2 of 5.1 kPa (IQR: 4.7-5.6), compared to 7.4 kPa (IQR: 6.6-8.9) for patients with hypercapnia. Most baseline characteristics were otherwise similar between groups. Female patients, which represented 63.6% of the population, were more likely to be hypercapnic (69.7% versus 54.8%, p = 0.023). Hypercapnic patients had higher diastolic blood pressures (103.6 mmHg versus 93.7 mmHg, p = 0.036) and were more likely to have abnormal GCS scores (62.1% had a normal GCS versus 81.7%, p = 0.002). They were also more likely to be treated by NIV in the field (93.9% versus 74.2%, p < 0.001).",

Theoretically, higher blood pressures could potentially contribute to an increased risk of pulmonary edema and thus a decrease of CO 2 clearance and oxygen uptake, a pathophysiologic process that has already been theorized to explain hypercapnia in AHF [27] . The resulting hypoxemia could therefore contribute to the increased mortality rate. Another hypothesis is that higher blood pressure are found in sicker patients given their higher sympathetic stress. This study reports a higher proportion of hypercapnic patients compared to in-hospital studies, as well as a higher rate of hypoxemic patient [21, 22] . Even though some initially hypercapnic patients might have normalized their PaCO 2 and PaO 2 after prehospital treatment, a selection bias cannot be ruled out. Indeed, the SMUR units are only called to attend to the sickest patients with AHF, while patients with milder symptoms can be managed by paramedics only. The subset of patients examined in the present study is rather limited, and most patients admitted in the ED for heart failure are not breathless at rest [28] . Nevertheless, patients with AHF taken care of by prehospital teams deserve special consideration as they are usually critically ill and therefore more likely to require advanced therapies. This theory is supported by the overall mortality rate which was also slightly higher than the rates reported in larger cohort studies [5, 9] .",

The most likely explanation is that given the worse clinical status of these patients, clinicians can rapidly decide upon admission disposition and therefore need less time and data to make their admission decision. Thus, prehospital PaCO 2 could be used as a tool to improve patient disposition and reduce the time spent in the ER. Further prospective trials, which could compare ER LOS depending on the systematic analysis of prehospital ABG, could be designed to investigate the clinical applicability of this finding.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, as already mentioned above, SMUR units are probably called to help manage the sickest of AHF patients, thereby inducing potential selection bias. Another potential selection bias is related to the local AHF treatment protocol, which strongly recommends performing ABG analysis whenever NIV is considered, but also acknowledges that physicians should not waste time before initiating treatment. Therefore, several AHF patients who would otherwise have met the inclusion criteria could not be analysed because an ABG was not performed. Consequently, even though the population should not be markedly different, the risk of bias still exists. Another limitation is the lack of information regarding the fraction of inspired oxygen when ABG was performed. This potential confounder could not be assessed in our study given its unreliable reporting in the prehospital medical file. We were also prevented from determining the effect a normalization (or even a decrease) of PaCO 2 might have on mortality as in-hospital ABG analysis was missing in 33% of all analysed cases. Other potential variables of interest, such as volume status, left ventricular ejection fraction, and troponin were not reported as they were inconsistently recorded and as the high proportion of missing data would have prevented their interpretation. In addition, although the study was adequately powered to show a difference in mortality, the sample size was too small to adjust for many covariates. Therefore, only the most clinically relevant covariates were chosen for adjustment, and residual confounding resulting in overestimated or underestimated results cannot be excluded. Even though usual, prehospital and in-hospital medication could have influenced the patients' outcome, such data was not straightforward to retrieve and its reliability would have been limited. We therefore refrained from extracting and including this data, which would have been difficult to analyse given the limited sample size. Even though there is little reason to believe that different treatments would have been given according to the prehospital PaCO 2 values, a bias linked to differences in the choice of medications cannot be formally excluded. Likewise, the analyses regarding effect modification by sex should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size. Finally, the generalization of these results is limited by the fact that this was a monocentric study performed in a supervised and physician-staffed prehospital system. Due to the exclusion of respiratory distress aetiologies other than AHF, our findings cannot be transposed to other populations.",
