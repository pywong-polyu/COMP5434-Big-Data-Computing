This study aimed to evaluate rhinitis (allergic and non-allergic) in the first 18 months of life, its link with other atopic manifestations and the role of respiratory viruses. Methods: Subjects (n = 1237) of the Singapore GUSTO birth cohort were followed up quarterly until 18 months of age with questionnaires to screen for rhinitis symptoms lasting at least 2 wk and with monthly calls to positive subjects to detect prolonged/ recurrent rhinitis symptoms (total duration \u22654 wk). Anterior nasal swabbing for molecular-based virus detection was conducted during these visits and near (within a month) rhinitis episodes. Skin prick testing to common environmental and food allergens was conducted at the 18 month visit. Results: Prolonged/recurrent rhinitis was significantly associated with history of parental atopy (mother: aOR = 2.17; father: aOR = 1.82) and atopic comorbidities of eczema (aOR = 2.53) and wheeze (aOR = 4.63) (p < 0.05), though not with allergen sensitization. Although the frequency of nasal respiratory virus detection during scheduled quarterly visits did not differ between prolonged/recurrent rhinitis and matched controls (p > 0.05), virus detection was higher in swabs obtained within a month following rhinitis episodes in prolonged/recurrent rhinitis subjects compared with scheduled visits (adjusted p = 0.04). Conclusions: Based on the duration of rhinitis symptoms, this study defined a subset of early childhood rhinitis which was associated with atopic predisposition and comorbidities.

Whilst it has been shown that respiratory viruses shedding may persist beyond 2 wk of onset of symptoms in 25% of children aged 2-9 yr old (28), respiratory virus shedding rarely persists beyond 2 wk following the start of respiratory infections in infants (29) . This persistence of virus shedding observed in our prolonged/recurrent rhinitis subjects may be an inherent inability of the subjects in clearing respiratory virus infection, or that prolonged/recurrent rhinitis subjects were more susceptible to new infections following each rhinitis episode. On the other hand, it is also possible that respiratory viruses play a role in the symptomatology of prolonged/ recurrent rhinitis in this age group.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 844, "end": 848, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our observations mirror studies on the role of respiratory viruses in early childhood wheezing, where HRV was also reported as the most frequently detected virus in the Perth (30), WHISTLER (31) and the COAST (25) cohorts. These studies showed that rhinovirus-associated wheeze was a risk factor of subsequent asthma. While not statistically significant, our study observed numerically higher rate of wheezing in subjects with positive respiratory viruses detection among wheezing subjects. The notion that HRV-related prolonged/recurrent rhinitis might also predispose to wheezing deserves further evaluation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We also looked into the seasonality of nasal swab HRV detection rates.

HRV subtyping was also conducted in our subjects but no statistical difference between case and control was found (data not shown). Further follow-up of this cohort would be required to determine whether a subset of the prolonged/recurrent rhinitis subjects would progress to allergic rhinitis in later childhood as this would suggest that respiratory viruses may play a role in the development of subsequent allergic rhinitis. In conclusion, our data suggest that epidemiological studies on rhinitis in this age group should focus not just on the presence of symptoms but also on its duration, as rhinitis which lasted for at least 4 wk in duration was associated with eczema, wheezing and parental histories of atopy. Respiratory viruses may also play a role in the development of early-onset prolonged/recurrent rhinitis. Whether this entity is a precursor of later childhood allergic rhinitis will require longer follow-up. This study substantiates the need for further studies in the management of rhinitis in young children, which is hitherto an unmet need.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 105, "end": 109, "text": "(33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 110, "end": 113, "text": "34)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma (ARIA) 2008*", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Bousquet", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Khaltaev", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Cruz", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "Allergy", "volume": "63", "issn": "", "pages": "8--160", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "The atopic march: what's the evidence?", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Ker", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": ["V"], "last": "Hartert", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2009, "venue": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "volume": "103", "issn": "", "pages": "282--291", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "The atopic march: progression from atopic dermatitis to allergic rhinitis and asthma", "authors": [{"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Zheng", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Yu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Oh", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Z", "middle": [], "last": "Zhu", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2011, "venue": "Allergy Asthma Immunol Res", "volume": "3", "issn": "", "pages": "67--73", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Prevalence of allergy-related symptoms in Singaporean children in the second year of life", "authors": [{"first": "T", "middle": ["N"], "last": "Tan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Lim", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Van", "middle": [], "last": "Bever", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": ["H"], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Pediatr Allergy Immunol", "volume": "16", "issn": "", "pages": "151--157", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Cohort Profile: growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort study", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Soh", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Tint", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Gluckman", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "Int J Epidemiol", "volume": "43", "issn": "", "pages": "1401--1410", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Allergic Rhinitis: Clinical Development Programs for Drug Products", "authors": [{"first": "Drug", "middle": [], "last": "Food", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Administration", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2000, "venue": "Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Respiratory viral pathogens among Singapore military servicemen 2009-2012: epidemiology and clinical characteristics", "authors": [{"first": "X", "middle": ["Q"], "last": "Tan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "X", "middle": [], "last": "Zhao", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "BMC Infect Dis", "volume": "14", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Screening respiratory samples for detection of human rhinoviruses (HRVs) and enteroviruses: comprehensive VP4-VP2 typing reveals high incidence and genetic diversity of HRV species C", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Wisdom", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Leitch", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Gaunt", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Harvala", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Simmonds", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2009, "venue": "J Clin Microbiol", "volume": "47", "issn": "", "pages": "3958--67", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Cytokine response patterns, exposure to viruses, and respiratory infections in the first year of life", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Copenhaver", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Gern", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Z", "middle": [], "last": "Li", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "volume": "170", "issn": "", "pages": "175--80", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF9": {"ref_id": "b9", "title": "Does allergic rhinitis exist in infancy?
