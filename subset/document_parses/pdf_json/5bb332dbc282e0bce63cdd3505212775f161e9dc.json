Given the high availability of cameras, lenses, and accessories in the market and the different objectives sought when shooting, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make a one-size-fits-all recommendation. Each medical specialty will find a particular set of equipment with features that makes it best suited for their particular requirements. This chapter will deal with some basic knowledge on cameras, lenses, flashes, and other useful accessories to help make a start with the right foot on medical photography. Seasoned photographers will certainly need more in-depth information on photographic equipment. Here we will focus on digital photography and its use in detail (macro), portrait and full body. Special equipment (e.g., ophthalmology, dental, and endoscopy) will be dealt with in specific chapters.",

Suggestions are based on the authors' personal use, experience, and knowledge; any mention of brands is only done with the intention of helping the reader better understand the different options when choosing photographic equipment. As this chapter is written during the first part of year 2019, most of the models shown here reflect what the market offered at that time. It is impossible for a chapter on photographic equipment not to become obsolete in just a few years (or months!). As technology evolves, new models become available. It is to the reader to adapt the subjacent message of what makes a better medical photographic equipment to the upcoming models. Your first camera will probably not be your last one. You will upgrade into new models, change manufactures, and probably change technology. Just to say that the authors of this chapter are from the analogic era of photography! For those passionate for technology and for those that make use of technology just to improve the quality of people's lives (including their own), there is an exciting journey ahead of us. Let's go for it.",

They have smallersized sensors compared to interchangeable-lens cameras. Most bridge cameras pack a 1 in. sensor (sized 12.8 \u00d7 9.6 mm, crop 2.7) or smaller. With a DSLR-style handling, they feature automatic and manual shooting modes and a full range of creative controls. Today's bridge cameras have evolved in image quality due to better sensor and software technology, even bypassing high-end interchangeable-lens cameras in some aspects. These high-tech small sensors can be quite fast when reading information which allows shooting video speeds of up to 14 frames per second in 4 K or 960 fps in SD mode.

DSLR cameras inherit the optic design of old times 35 mm film reflex. In DSLRs the photographer can view the scene through the lens in the optical viewfinder (OVF). An array of mirrors and a system for synchronizing shutter opening with a moving mirror allows the photographer to see the scene when not shooting or the sensor to see it when shooting. In a CSC camera, the imaging sensor is always exposed to light, giving the photographer a digital preview of the image either on an electronic viewfinder (EVF) or on a rear LCD screen.

Today, within professional photographers, CSCs are competing strongly for the market of interchangeable-lens cameras; mirrorless cameras seem to be the wave of the future. Having most of the features of DSLR cameras, mirrorless cameras are smaller and lighter, and the camera-lens system is a little less expensive than with DSLR cameras. One small disadvan-tage of CSCs could be the need for more spare batteries given that powering a screen continuously takes up a lot of power.

Although ideal for video, their average still resolution of 12 MP (best adventure cameras are in the range of 8-16 MP) and hands-free operation makes them a good compromise solution for taking acceptable quality images (or videos) under very adverse conditions. For field hospital situations, forensic medicine and even for recording surgical procedures in operating theaters (ORs), adventure cameras can be a practical solution to capture medical images that could not be equally done using DSLR/CSC cameras.

Today, in smartphone times, there might still be a few medical applications that would benefit from instant paper processing of images such as in field hospitals and situations where the availability of an instant hard copy of an image can make the difference. A patient with a skin lesion in the scalp or back might appreciate an instant photo given by the physician. In the case of chemical photo processing, attention should be placed to the quality of the instant (self-developing) photo-paper; given that there are almost no adjustments allowed to the user, the quality of the instant photo-paper should be a concern (look for freshly stored film from a reputed brand). When it comes to digital-instant cameras (such as the Polaroid Snap), there is only one photo-paper option, the proprietary Polaroid Snap paper.",

The ideal focal length has to do with the shooting distance: being too close can make proper lighting difficult; being too far can produce more camera movement due to the longer and heavier lens. The need for lighting can induce the choice of a certain macro focal length. A 40-60-mm macro lens could be a good choice for shooting handheld at natural light-illuminated subjects.

They increment the angle of vision of the subject and the perspective and are mostly used in landscape photography, large areas, and small spaces where it is needed to incorporate as much vision as possible. As they distort the reality, they are used mainly for creative photography or photography in confined spaces where distortion is not an issue; they are not used in medical photography. Traditionally, the photographs obtained by using superwideangle lenses were circular not rectangular. Today, depending upon sensor size, wide-angle photographs can be either circular or rectangular (Canon EF 8-15 mm f/4 L Fisheye USM). For full-frame cameras, the 8-mm \"fish-eye\" has a field of view angle of 180\u00b0. Other common superwide-angle lenses are 15 mm for 110\u00b0 diagonal field of view, 20 mm for 95\u00b0 diagonal field of view, and 24 mm for 84\u00b0 diagonal field of view. A fish-eye is an ultrawide lens that has an angle of view in the 180\u00b0 range. Its convex external element captures light from all 180\u00b0. A fish eye adds barrel distortion to the image (parallel lines in real life become bended as parenthesis in the photo). There are two types of fish-eye lenses: circular fish-eyes and full-frame (or diagonal) fish-eyes. Circular fish-eyes produce a circular image within a black background, whereas fullframe fish-eyes produce a cropped rectangular image which is the size of the sensor. In the circular fish-eye, the angle of view (e.g., 180\u00b0) is always the same in all directions; in a full-frame fish-eye, the angle of view (in this case 180\u00b0) refers to the diagonal of the rectangular image (in the 180\u00b0 full-frame fish-eye, the angle of view will be 100\u00b0 vertical and 150\u00b0 horizontal) ( Fig. 11.12 ) [6] . Typical focal lengths for circular fish-eye are 8 mm and 10 mm; 16 mm for full frame. It is a type of lens used for imaging operating theaters or hospital halls.",

Here, we assume market's tacit convention and stick to the zoom denomination regardless of focus stability throughout the range. Some compromise in image quality has to be assumed when using zooms. Zooms are very practical to use but at the expense of loss of image resolution at their maximum aperture, especially at the extremes of their focal-length range.
