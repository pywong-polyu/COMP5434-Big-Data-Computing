Such variants that evade detection by nucleic acid-based tests are subject to selective pressure, enabling them to spread more efficiently. Here, we report a variant-tolerant diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 using a loop-mediated isothermal nucleic acid-based amplification (LAMP) assay containing highfidelity DNA polymerase and a high-fidelity DNA polymerasemedicated probe (HFman probe). In addition to demonstrating a high tolerance to variable SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences, the mechanism also overcomes frequently observed limitations of LAMP assays arising from non-specific amplification within multiplexed reactions performed in a single \"pot\". Results showed excellent clinical performance (sensitivity 94.5%, specificity 100%, n = 190) when compared directly to a commercial gold standard reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the extracted RNA from nasopharyngeal samples and the capability of detecting a wide range of sequences containing at least alpha and delta variants. To further validate the test with no sample processing, directly from nasopharyngeal swabs, we also detected SARS-CoV-2 in positive clinical samples (n = 49), opening up the possibility for the assay's use in decentralized testing.",

As an alternative, isothermal NAA, including loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), has been used in point-of-care testing for infectious diseases. 5,9\u221213 To date, only a few LAMP assays have been approved for clinical application 14 due in part to their low tolerance to highly variable target sequences, frequent non-specific amplification, 15, 16 and the limitations associated with multiplexing in a single reaction, which is challenging to achieve 17 at high sensitivities (e.g., <10 4 copies per milliliter) 18 without complex molecular designs. 19\u221221 We previously developed a mismatch-tolerant LAMP method that improves the amplification efficiency of highly variable target sequences for human RNA viruses such as HIV-1, 22 Dengue virus, 23 and SARS-CoV-2. 24, 25 In this study, we demonstrate a multiplex LAMP system that uses a high-fidelity DNA polymerase-mediated fluorescent probe (HFman probe) to improve specificity and, importantly, in contrast to other amplification strategies (e.g., SHERLOCK 4 ), allows us to realize single-pot multiplex detection without the need for RNA extraction (sample processing) or indeed a separate reverse transcription (RT) step.",

Principle of the multiplex real-time RT-LAMP. The specific fluorescent signal of the multiplex real-time LAMP is mediated by a small amount of high-fidelity DNA polymerase with the HFman probe. For simplicity of illustration, only one probe molecule is shown in this figure, but other fluorochromes (e.g., FAM, CY5, and HEX) with different fluorescence wavelengths can be used to label different probes for different targets in a multiplexed format. During the initial LAMP phase, the primers bind to the target sequence to start the LAMP process (a). After a dumbbell structure is formed, its loop regions provide binding sites for the HFman probe that has the same sequence as the loop primer (LF or LB) (b,c). The HFman probe is recognized and cleaved by high-fidelity DNA polymerase when it specifically hybridizes to the loop region without (b) or with a mismatch with the loop region (c) to release the fluorescent signal and to expose free 3\u2032-OH for further extension by Bst DNA polymerase. (d) Hybridized FIP/BIP and LF/LB/HFman probes initiate DNA extension by Bst DNA polymerase. Newly synthesized DNA strands form dumbbell structures to start self-priming extension. During the extension, the fluorescence signal increases exponentially as the fluorophore is released from its quenching pair in the HFman probe.",

This result indicates that in spite of the fact that the RT enzyme is an error-prone polymerase and can extend from a mismatched base, mismatches at the 3\u2032-end of the primer still reduced cDNA synthesis efficiency. When the high-fidelity DNA polymerase was added to the RT reaction, the obtained cDNA generated substantially lower Ct values (about 1.1\u22123.4 lower Ct) for three aB3-Mut primers than the cDNA from RT reaction without high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Figure 2a) , implying an improvement of about 2.1\u221210.8 times in the cDNA product by the addition of high-fidelity DNA polymerase.

Given that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 patients is in the range of 10 3 to 10 9 copies per mL, 29\u221231 the multiplex RT-LAMP assay was sufficiently sensitive to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical situations. 32 To test whether the HFman-based pipeline improved the specificity of the multiplex RT-LAMP, we performed SYTO-9-based (nonspecific DNA binding fluorescent dye) and HFman probebased multiplex RT-LAMP reactions using RNase-free H 2 O (non-template control, NTC). Non-specific amplification (Tt values: 21.8\u221238.0) occurred in the RT-LAMP reaction with SYTO-9, but no amplification signal was observed in the reactions with HFman probes (Figure 3b ).",

Although the RT-qPCR methodology is accepted as the golden standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it needs to be performed in well-found laboratories with specialized equipment and trained healthcare staff. As previously stated, positive results for the two different genes of SARS-CoV-2 are required for the diagnosis of COVID-19. To facilitate the diagnosis and screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have developed a simple, rapid, variant-tolerant, and sensitive point-of-care assay that does not require specialized equipment or sample preparation. 24, 25, 38, 39 One major reason why LAMP is considered inferior to qPCR is its specificity, accuracy, and multiplexing capacity, which are often reduced through non-specific amplification and/or by non-specific interferents (e.g., non-specific doublestranded DNA binding dyes) (Table S3) . 6, 15, 40, 41 Furthermore, the low detection accuracy of LAMP is also associated with its high vulnerability to mismatches between a large number of LAMP primers and the targets. 22, 23 In this study, we developed an HFman probe-based real-time LAMP method to overcome many of these shortcomings of LAMP, using high-fidelity DNA polymerase to recognize and cleave the HFman probe and release a fluorescence dye from its quenched counterpart. Because the HFman probe can be labeled by different fluorophores and because the specific binding of the HFman probe to the target sequence is a prerequisite for the recognition and cleavage by high-fidelity DNA polymerase to release fluorescent signal, our LAMP system showed excellent specificity and enabled the multiplex detection of different targets in a single-tube reaction.",

[22] [23] [24] 38 We also demonstrate that the high-fidelity DNA polymerase can recognize and remove the 3\u2032 mismatched base on a DNA\u2212RNA duplex, with the inclusion of the enzyme in the RT reaction increasing cDNA products, giving a consistent amplification efficiency (similar Tt values) for a number of variants carrying one or more mutations to the 3\u2032-end of the primer sequences. Table S2 provides information (where available) on the variants present in the clinical samples analyzed in this work, showing the capability of our assay to detect all of them, including alpha (B.1.1.7) and delta (B.1.617.2). Although gamma (P.1) and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants form one mismatch at the middle of the ORF gene LF primer and the 3\u2032-end third last site of the E gene F2 primer, respectively ( Figure S15 ), the variant-tolerance feature of the system enables effective detection of these variants. 22 These results indicate that our HFman probe-based LAMP method is especially suitable for the detection of highly variable RNA viruses that contribute to most emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g., AIDS, ZIKA, influenza, and COVID-19) and which have shown \"diagnostic escape\". 3, 42 Our realtime RT-LAMP achieves higher sensitivities and specificities and better tolerance to highly variable sequences, as well as the capacity for single-pot multiplex detection (Table S3 ) when compared to the mismatch-tolerant and conventional LAMP methods.",

Evaluation of the Multiplex RT-LAMP Using Extracted Clinical Samples. To verify the diagnostic accuracy of the multiplex RT-LAMP assay, 190 nasopharyngeal swab (NP) samples were extracted and analyzed (Figure S10). For comparison, two approved commercial RT-qPCR kits were used for the first batch of 99 clinical samples (Figure S11), and only the BioPerf kit was used for the second batch of 91 samples. Among 190 NP samples, the BioPerf kit detected 87 samples positive for both ORF and N genes of SARS-CoV-2, and an additional three samples positive only for the N gene with high Ct values (35.8\u221239.2) (Figure S12). The multiplex RT-LAMP assay detected 81 samples positive for both the ORF and E genes of SARS-CoV-2 and an additional five samples positive only for E or ORF (Figure S12). Among 100 double-negative samples by the BioPerf RT-qPCR assay, one sample (no. 31) was detected as ORF gene positive by the multiplex RT-LAMP assay and further confirmed as ORF gene positive by another RT-qPCR assay (BioGerm kit) (Figure S11), thereby being considered as a weak positive sample. Using a single gene as an output (samples positive for either ORF or N genes by the RT-qPCR assay), 91 samples (including sample 31) were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive. The BioPerf RT-qPCR assay and the multiplex RT-LAMP assay detected 90 and 86 positive samples, showing the sensitivities of 98.9 and 94.5%, respectively (Table 2). 22 SARS-CoV-2 variants/lineages were identified from the 53 positive samples, with the alpha variant and the B.1 lineage as the most commonly identified variants/lineages",

Because of the inhibition of VTM on the reaction (Figure S8a and Supporting note results), only 6 \u03bcL of NP-VTM samples (about equal to 2.4 \u03bcL extracted RNA, half of the RNA amount used in the RT-qPCR assay) was directly inputted in each 25 \u03bcL multiplex RT-LAMP reaction.
