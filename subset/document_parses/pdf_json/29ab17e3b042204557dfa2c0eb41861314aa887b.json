Patients with increased cTnI had more comorbidities, greater impaired respiratory exchange and higher inflammatory markers on admission than those with normal cTnI. Furthermore, they died more (73.9% vs. 37.3%, P < 0.001) over 15 (6\u221225) days of hospitalization. The association of elevated cTnI with mortality was confirmed by the adjusted Cox regression model (HR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.06\u22122.52, P = 0.039) and was linear until 0.3 \u03bcg/L, with a subsequent plateau. Of 191 (55.7%) patients with a second cTnI measurement, 49 (25.7%) had an increasing trend, which was not associated with mortality (univariate HR = 1.39, 95%CI: 0.87\u22122.22, P = 0.265).",

During COVID-19, cardiac stress and damage may arise because of a variety of mechanisms, including type 2 ischemia, hypoxia, sepsis and systemic inflammation, pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, cardiac adrenergic hyperstimulation during cytokine storm syndrome, and myocarditis. [2, 8] A rise in cTn may be also due to pre-existing cardiac disease and concomitant comorbidities. [9] Irrespective of the underlying causes, evidence of cardiac injury at the time of admission for COVID-19 has been associated with a more severe clinical course and higher mortality. [2, 6, 8, 10] Limited data also indicate that a rising trend of cTn levels during the hospitalization identifies a subset of COVID-19 patients with worse outcome. [10, 11] Nonetheless, the specific impact of cTn measurement has not been investigated yet in the elderly. This lack of evidence has potential practical implications, since COVID-19 patients older than 60 years of age need hospitalization more often than younger ones, [12] [13] [14] and thereby, are more likely to be tested for cTn.",

            "text": "In this study, we show that an initially increased cTn value portends a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in subjects older than 60 years with COVID-19. In the population examined, an increased cTnI concentration within three days from the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred a 60% higher risk of all-cause in-hospital death. By contrast, a further elevation in cTn over the following 48 h did not provide additional prognostic information. CV involvement is common in COVID-19 and has been pointed out as one of the factors contributing to the dismal prognosis that many patients face. [1] The elevation of markers of myocardial injury, especially cTn, has drawn much attention, since it can be readily assessed and is clinically relevant. [2, 4, 7, 8] Several authors have reported that an increase in cTn concentrations portends a higher risk of in-hospital death. [3] [4] [5] [6] 10, 11, [18] [19] [20] This evidence has been gathered by analyzing various cohorts with important differences, for instance in the severity of COV-ID-19 and, thus, the intensity of treatments, in ethnicity and in the burden of comorbidities. [9] Therefore, it is assumed that the results of these studies can be generalized to all patients hospitalized for COVID-19. [8] However, data about the value of cTn specifically in elderly subjects admitted for COVID-19 are scarce. This lack of information is remarkable, considering the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in which old individuals are the most affected and often need hospitalization. [13, 21, 22] Our results confirm that cTnI elevation is an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in elderly patients hospitalized for COVID-19, like it is in younger ones. The cohort we investigated was particularly old. In fact, the median age was 75 years, whilst the mean or median age in the other investigations of cTn in COVID-19 was \u2264 70 years (Supplementary Table 3 ). Furthermore, almost 1 in 2 patients died during the hospitalization. A similar proportion of deaths has been described for critically ill COVID-19 Italian patients with a median age of 63 (56\u221269) years. [23] We believe that the comparable mortality of our patients, who were admitted to the ICU only in about 20% of cases, is explained by the substantially older age. It is notable that, even within this vulnerable population, an initial increase in cTn identified a frailer group with worse prognosis. The mechanisms leading to cTn elevation during COVID-19 are manifold and likely often concomitant. [24] Autopsy studies indicate that myocardial ischemia due to plaque rupture, coronary artery spasm or direct injury, or microthrombi are rare in COVID-19, [25] and the pathogenesis of cardiac damage has been primarily ascribed to other events. [4, 9, 10, 19] First, the heart may suffer from severe hypoxia in the contest of acute respiratory insufficiency. Second, hyperinflammation and sepsis with cytokine storm may directly affect cardiomyocytes, up to causing stress cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. Third, cardiac injury may develop following pulmonary thromboembolism. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can localize to the myocardium, although an ensuing inflammatory infiltrate has not been demonstrated. [18] The elderly may be more prone to all these events because of the reduced resistance of the aging heart to stressors and of concomitant asymptomatic or overt cardiac disease. Other authors found a continuous relationship between cTn concentrations and mortality. [6] Moreover, in subjects admitted for COVID-19 younger than those evaluated by us, the trend between two measurements of cTn obtained at the beginning of the hospitalization may help better stratifying the risk of death. [21] By contrast, in our cohort, the troponinmortality risk curve plateaued after a relatively low level and the changes in cTn did not refine prognostication. Thus, our analysis suggests that the presence, but not the entity of cardiac injury corresponds to worse outcomes in elderly patients hospitalized for COVID-19, and that multiple determinations of cTn may be of value only if clinically motivated.",
