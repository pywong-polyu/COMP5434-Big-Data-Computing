We report the sequencing, genomic characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of five SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from patients in Pakistan.

The genome is about 30kb and encodes sixteen nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP16) and four structural proteins (nucleocapsid, envelop, membrane, and spike glycoprotein). The spike (S) protein is involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells through binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S protein interacts with ACE2 receptor that eventually leads to the fusion of virus to host cell membranes [3] . Recently, the detection of a D614G mutation in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent global spread has received tremendous attention. The D614G mutation has been shown to be present in the S2 domain of spike protein and is critical for cleavage of S1 facilitating the fusion of virus with host cell membrane [4, 5] . However, the role of D614G mutation in the emergence of a more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2 was first highlighted by Korber et al. through the development of an analysis pipeline [4] . Since the initial report, several studies on the role of D614G amino acid change in enhanced infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 have been documented [6] [7] [8] . The G614 variant which arose in Europe during February 2020, rapidly spread to other parts of the world occurring in over 74% of all published sequences by June 2020 [9] .",

In Asia, the L clade was found at a frequency of 48% in January and 2% in July whereas the S clade which was commonly circulating in January (31%), almost disappeared after August. Unlike the L and S clades, the G clade sequences were reported at low frequency during January-February 2020 and progressively increased with a peak in June (25%), following with constant detection till December 2020 (17%). The G clade along with GH and GR started emerging on a global scale during March 2020.

The iVar consensus command was run with the following parameters: minimum quality (Default: 20), minimum frequency threshold (Default: 0.03), minimum depth to call a consensus (-m 2), and a character to call in regions with coverage lower than the specified minimum depth (-n N). Minor viral variants were assessed using bam files using the same parameters (samtools mpileup -A -d 6000000 -B -Q 0 piped to ivar variants (-q 20 (default) -t 0.03 (default) -m 2).

For further classification of SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in Pakistan, all available sequences were categorized into clades defined by the Nextstrain (https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/tutorials/SARS-CoV-2/steps/naming_clades. html). The Nextstrain classification has grouped SARS-CoV-2 strains into five major global clades: 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C. Phylogenetic analysis based on the whole genomes showed that three strains NIH-45090, NIH-45143, and NIH-45579 belong to 20A clade and clustered with strains from Oman, Slovakia, United States and Pakistani strain EPI_ISL_513925. The other two strains (NIH-44905 and NIH-HAS001) grouped into 19B clade along with viruses from India and Oman (Fig 2) . Based on analysis of available sequence data from Pakistan, we have observed 8 separate introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Pakistan (the earliest sequence is from March 12, 2020). Most of these clades consist of a single sequence, except for the two clades presented here, and a third monophyletic clade from Lahore collected on November 5, 2020. Our analysis suggests multiple importations of SARS--CoV-2 into Pakistan and provides evidence of clustered outbreak/community transmission.",

The amino acid (a.a) changes between SARS-CoV-2 strains in the current study and the reference virus NC_045512 were also determined. Overall, eleven missense mutations were found among the Pakistani strains of clade GH. Five missense mutations were common in all the strains, three in ORF1ab polyprotein (a.a Q2702H, L3606F, P4715L), one in surface glycoprotein (a.a D614G), and one in ORF3a protein (a.a Q57H).

In the present study, three strains (NIH-45090, NIH-45143, and NIH-45579) belong to the GH clade, while two strains (NIH-HAS001 and NIH-44905) clustered in S clade which is very rare in Asia. The global distribution of these clades between January-December 2020 showed that GH was found at low frequency during the start of the pandemic (January-February 2020). However, increased frequencies were reported in March (21%), April (26%), and May (30%). The GH clade strains peaked in June (31%) in agreement with our findings and showed constant presence during July-October 2020. A second rise in infections due to GH clade was observed during November-December 2020 (35% and 45% respectively). On the contrary, S clade was dominant during January-February 2020 (42% and 30% respectively) and since then has shown a rapid decline and was reported with a frequency of 1% in November 2020 (https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/phylodynamics/). According to the Nextstrain classification and phylogenetic analysis, Pakistani strains (NIH-45090, NIH-45143, and NIH-45579) of 20A clade were closely related to the strains from Oman, Slovakia, United States, and indigenous strain EPI_ISL_513925. Similarly, the Pakistani strains of 19B clade were closely related to the strains from India and Oman. We assume multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 strains into Pakistan particularly through international travelers. Eight independent events of importation were observed (based on the analysis of available sequence data from Pakistan) mainly from the neighboring countries especially Oman where a large proportion of Pakistani people are settled and employed for years. These findings suggest that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan was influenced by very frequent and recurrent introductions through international travelers that lead to the circulation of different clades over time. Although the interventions at a national scale such as bans on indoor and outdoor gatherings may help to restrict and combat the community transmission chains, the frequent introductions through international travelers have also impacted the transmission dynamics. The limited sample size and genomic information available warrants further epidemiological and genomic surveillance for the more accurate estimation of SARS-CoV-2 diversity and transmission behaviors across the country.",

            "text": "Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a major target for drug and vaccine design because of its involvement in-recognition of host cell receptor, attachment, and entry [21, 22] . Notably, we have found a D614G (aspartic acid to glycine) mutation in the envelope spike protein of indigenous strains (NIH-45090, NIH-45143, and NIH-45579). Moreover, the D614G change was accompanied by three characteristic mutations: 241C>T, 3037C>T, and 14408C>T. The haplotype containing these four mutations has now become the most prevalent form globally; before March, the haplotype was found in 10% of global sequences but increased substantially to 67% during March and 78% between April-May 2020. During the initial outbreak in China, nearly all the strains had aspartic acid at position 614; however, later strains with glycine 614 emerged in Europe, followed by North America, Oceania, and Asia [4] . Recently, Korber et al., reported that the G614 form is more infectious, and infected patients had a higher upper respiratory tract viral load; however, association with disease severity was not observed [4] . In vitro studies conducted by Li et al., involving pseudoviruses showed that the D614G mutation was responsible for increased infectivity [23] . Similar findings have been reported where the G614 mutant showed the highest cell entry among the spike variants [7] as well as efficient infection of 293T-ACE2 cells compared to D614 pseudovirus [6] . Moreover, experimental work by Hou et al., demonstrated that the D614G substitution enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, competitive fitness, and transmission in primary human cells and animal models [24] . In another study, an increased case fatality rate reported in European countries and the East Coast of the United States was correlated with the increased prevalence of the G614 variant [25] . In Pakistan, an upsurge in COVID-19 cases (n = 141,010 cases out of total 213,470; 66%) and deaths (n = 2,852 deaths out of total 4,395; 64.8%) were reported during the month of June 2020 compared with those reported during February-May 2020 (72,460 confirmed cases and 1,543 deaths). This substantial increase in numbers of cases and deaths may indicate widespread circulation of the G614 variant, which needs to be further investigated [4, 25] . Although the D614G mutation is increasingly reported in strains worldwide, we have found a novel mutation D830A (aspartic acid to alanine) in strains NIH-44905 and NIH-HAS001 of clade S. Additional molecular epidemiological studies are needed to monitor the circulation of the G614 and A830 variant strains in Pakistan, which might also help to clarify the impact of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants that might affect disease severity and clinical management. Furthermore, tracking mutations in spike glycoprotein of SARS--CoV-2 is important due to its role in host cell receptor binding and entry as well as eliciting neutralizing antibodies. Since the detection and global spread of the G614 variant, a major concern has been on the impact of D614G mutation on the effectiveness of vaccines as most of the vaccines have been designed using the D614 virus (Lurie et al., 2020). This concern has been addressed by the findings of Weissman et al., which showed that the variant with D614G mutation does not escape neutralization but rather is neutralized at a higher level by serum from vaccinated mice, non-human primates, and humans [26] . However, continuous surveillance of genetic variations in spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detect any escape mutants and for future vaccine development programs.",

Both the clades showed missense mutations in the spike gene; however, clade S had less overall variability compared with the Wuhan reference strain than the GH clade strains. This highlights the fact that circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains in Pakistan have evolved and have sequence variations compared with the early ancestors. Therefore, we recommend whole-genome sequencing of indigenous strains prevalent in different regions of the country to understand virus evolution and to identify strains with unique mutational patterns.",
