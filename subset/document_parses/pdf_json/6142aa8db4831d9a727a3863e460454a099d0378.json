Here, our integrated copy number and transcriptome analysis of 302 TNBC patients reveals that gene alpha-endosulfine (ENSA) exhibits recurrent amplification at the 1q21.3 region and is highly expressed in TNBC. ENSA promotes tumor growth and indicates poor patient survival in TNBC. Mechanistically, we identify ENSA as an essential regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis in TNBC that upregulates the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBP2), a pivotal transcription factor in cholesterol biosynthesis. We confirm that ENSA can increase the level of p-STAT3 (Tyr705) and activated STAT3 binds to the promoter of SREBP2 to promote its transcription. Furthermore, we reveal the efficacy of STAT3 inhibitor Stattic in TNBC with high ENSA expression. In conclusion, the amplification of ENSA at the 1q21.3 region promotes TNBC progression and indicates sensitivity to STAT3 inhibitors.",

It is characterized by negative estrogen receptor (ER) and progestogen receptor (PR) expression and the lack of overexpression of HER2 (also defined by lack of ERBB2 amplification) 1 . Compared to other forms of breast cancer, TNBCs exhibit more aggressive clinical characteristics, including younger age of onset, larger tumor size, higher tumor grade, and more significant metastasis potential 2, 3 . Patients with TNBC have an increased risk of distant recurrence and death within 5 years of diagnosis, and the peak of distant recurrence occurs at~3 years 2, 4 . Although chemotherapy remains the standard of care for TNBC, a subset of patients shows limited responsiveness and develops advanced diseases due to a lack of effective targeted therapy and predictive markers in this heterogeneous disease 5, 6 . To solve this problem, investigators have made great efforts to elucidate the molecular nature of TNBC and seek options for molecularly targeted therapy [7] [8] [9] .",

As a hallmark of cancer, CNAs are ubiquitous in cancers and are the most common type of somatic genetic events 10, 11 . Altered expression of oncogenes or tumor suppressors mediated by CNA is linked to the development, clinicopathological characteristics, and prognoses of cancers 12, 13 . According to a previously defined oncogenic signature across human cancers, breast cancer falls into a class where recurrent CNAs are predominant over mutations 14 . Understanding the phenotypic effects and underlying mechanism of CNAs in breast cancer has brought advantages in targeted treatment, as highlighted by the application of trastuzumab-based therapy in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer 15 . In breast cancer, tumorigenesis driven by genomic instability is most prevalent in basal-like subtype breast cancers (most of which are TNBC), where tumors exhibit extensive CNAs 16, 17 . Our previous study on a Chinese TNBC cohort revealed recurrent copy number gains in chromosomes 1q, 8q, and 10p and copy number deletions in chromosome 8p 7 . Although some reported oncogenes and tumor suppressors are affected by the most frequent CNAs, many new CNA-affected genes in TNBC remain unexplored.",

ENSA (alpha-endosulfine) was found to be amplified at the 1q21.3 locus in more than 18% of patients, and its amplification was correlated with increased expression in TNBC. ENSA could promote tumor growth by promoting the cholesterol biosynthesis program in TNBC. At the molecular level, the transcriptional activation of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBP2) by phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) played a critical role in ENSA-induced cholesterol metabolism dysregulation. Consequently, hindering STAT3 phosphorylation resulted in tumor inhibition in TNBC with high ENSA expression. These findings uncovered the mechanism by which high ENSA amplification might promote TNBC progression and suggested potential therapeutic targets.",

            "text": "Integrated DNA copy number and transcriptome profiling reveals amplified ENSA at the 1q21.3 region in TNBC. To identify dysregulated gene expression programs driven by CNAs in TNBC, we first integrated gene-level CNA data and RNA-seq data of 302 female patients from the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) TNBC cohort to screen CNA-affected oncogenes with the criteria listed in Fig. 1a . A total of 41 genes located in several recurrent CNA regions were found (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Among them, ENSA and Golgi phosphoprotein 3 like (GOLPH3L), located at the 1q21.3 peak, were the most frequently amplified genes in TNBC (amplification in 18.5% and copy number gain in 57.6% of patients), followed by genes at the 1q43 and 10p15.1 loci (Fig. 1a) . In the TCGA database, the 1q21.3 segment was also frequently amplified in approximately 11% of all breast cancer patients (Fig. 1b) and predicted worse disease-free survival and disease-specific survival (Fig. 1c) . However, amplification of the 1q43 and 10p15.1 regions showed no prognostic significance ( Supplementary Fig. 2a) . We further investigated the difference in 1q21.3 alteration between different subtypes of breast cancer in the TCGA cohort. We found a higher amplification frequency in the TNBC (27.7%) and basal-like (32.6%) subtypes (Fig. 1d) , which implies that this amplicon is more critical in TNBC than in other subtypes. To identify potential tumor-promoting genes in the 1q21.3 locus of interest, we performed survival analysis of ENSA and GOLPH3L in the Kaplan-Meier plotter database and observed that elevated expression of ENSA, not GOLPH3L, was linked with poor relapse-free survival in TNBC and basal-like breast cancer (Fig. 1e, f) . However, ENSA expression did not predict the survival outcomes of patients with other breast cancer subtypes, further suggesting its importance in the TNBC subtype (Supplementary Fig. 2b ). ENSA expression was upregulated in several tumors and was markedly upregulated in breast cancer (Supplementary Fig. 2c ). Its expression was higher in tumor tissues than in paired normal tissues and increased along with genetic amplification in TNBC (Fig. 1g, h) . These results suggest that ENSA is amplified at the 1q21.3 region and is highly expressed in TNBC with clinical prognostic value.",

To determine the roles of ENSA in TNBC, we knocked down its expression using shRNA and restored the expression of its most common transcript in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells, two TNBC cell lines with relatively high expression of ENSA ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3a) . ENSA downregulation markedly impaired the cell growth and colony formation of TNBC cells (Fig. 2b, c) . However, the growth of ENSA-depleted luminal and HER2 cells was only slightly inhibited, less than the results shown in TNBC cells ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ). In addition, overexpression of ENSA in TNBC cells attenuated the suppression of cell growth and colony formation induced by ENSA silencing in vitro (Fig. 2d , e, and Supplementary Fig. 3c ). ENSA knockdown also caused pronounced apoptosis among TNBC cells but had almost no effect on cell cycle progression ( Fig. 2f and Supplementary  Fig. 3d, e) . These results suggest the critical role of ENSA in promoting the growth of TNBC cells.",

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the cholesterol pathway was the most enriched downregulated pathway in ENSAsilenced cells (Fig. 3a, b) . GO analysis also indicated that the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was strongly suppressed by ENSA knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 4a ). In addition, GSEA revealed an upregulated apoptosis pathway in ENSA-silenced cells, in accordance with the proapoptotic phenotype induced by ENSA depletion (Fig. 3c) . We further explored the correlation between ENSA expression and cholesterol biosynthesis pathway activity in the FUSCC TNBC cohort using gene set variation analysis. We found a significant positive association between (Fig. 3g, h) . In addition, ENSA knockdown caused a significant decrease in free cholesterol content in TNBC cells (Fig. 3i) . We next examined whether the ENSA knockdowninduced phenotype was attributable to cholesterol depletion. The addition of cholesterol (2.5 \u03bcg/ml) partially attenuated the inhibition of cell growth and increased apoptosis in ENSA-depleted TNBC cells ( Fig. 3j and Supplementary Fig. 4e , f). Together, these findings support the notion that ENSA might promote the growth of TNBC cells by regulating cellular cholesterol biosynthesis.",

            "text": "To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the ENSA depletioninduced phenotype in TNBC cells, we performed transcription factor (TF) analysis of the RNA-seq data and hypothesized that STAT3 was a key TF responsible for the downstream alteration (Fig. 4a) . In TNBC cells, p-STAT3 (Tyr705), but not p-STAT3 (Ser727) or total STAT3, was markedly decreased upon ENSA knockdown (Fig. 4b) . Overexpression of ENSA restored the level of p-STAT3 (Tyr705) (Fig. 4c ). Next, we confirmed the involvement of STAT3 in ENSA knockdown-induced growth inhibition by overexpressing STAT3 in ENSA-silenced TNBC cells to induce the constitutive activation/phosphorylation of STAT3. Our results showed that the overexpression of STAT3 could partially attenuate TNBC cell growth inhibition induced by ENSA depletion (Fig. 4d, e) . In mouse mammary fat pad xenografts, ENSA knockdown resulted in a significant reduction in the tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 cells, which could be completely rescued by overexpression of ENSA and mostly rescued by overexpression of STAT3 (Fig. 4f , g, and Supplementary Fig. 5a ). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of p-STAT3 (Tyr705) significantly decreased upon ENSA silencing. However, in ENSA-depleted TNBC tumors, overexpression of either ENSA or STAT3 increased p-STAT3 (Tyr705) staining ( Fig. 4h and Supplementary  Fig. 5b ). In accordance with the proapoptotic phenotype induced by ENSA depletion in vitro, IHC staining of cleaved caspase 3 displayed a corresponding change in each group of xenografts ( Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 5c ). In addition, we also observed decreased lung metastasis incidence in the ENSA-depleted group ( Supplementary Fig. 5d ). Taken together, these data suggest the critical role of ENSA-STAT3 signaling in promoting the growth of triple-negative tumors.",

We next questioned whether activated STAT3 participated in ENSAinduced alterations in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. The prediction from the JASPAR database showed that STAT3 was likely to bind to the promoter of SREBP2 (Fig. 5a ). ChIP-seq data analysis from GSE152203 also showed a STAT3-binding peak in SREBP2 in MDA-MB-231 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ). Using a ChIP assay, we confirmed that STAT3 occupied a site in the promoter region of SREBP2 (Fig. 5b) . Moreover, STAT3 silencing in TNBC cells suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of SREBP2 ( Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 6b ). These results indicate that STAT3 could bind to the promoter of SREBP2 and alter the expression of SREBP2 at the transcriptional level in TNBC cells. We next validated that the promoter activity of SREBP2 was restrained by ENSA depletion and rescued by STAT3 overexpression based on the luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 5d ). Consistently, the expression level of SREBP2 and enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis decreased after ENSA knockdown, but this effect was reversed by the overexpression of STAT3 (Fig. 5e ). In addition, the cellular free cholesterol levels, which were decreased with ENSA depletion, could also be restored by overexpression of STAT3 ( Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 6c ). In mouse mammary fat pad xenograft models, the expression of SREBP2 and FDPS decreased after ENSA knockdown and was restored when exogenous STAT3 was overexpressed ( Supplementary Fig. 6d) .",

As ENSA regulates the activity of STAT3, we sought to evaluate whether ENSA could be a therapeutic marker of STAT3 inhibitor sensitivity in TNBC cells. We used Stattic as a small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 activation. Compared to the ENSA knockdown group, the control group with higher ENSA levels was more sensitive to Stattic and exhibited significantly reduced growth after Stattic treatment ( Fig. 6a , b, and Supplementary Fig. 7a, b) . In organoids derived from three TNBC patients with diverse levels of ENSA expression, we also found that the sensitivity of organoids to Stattic increased along with the increase in the Table 1 . We next explored the sensitivity of TNBC cells to Stattic in xenograft models and found significantly impaired sensitivity to Stattic when ENSA was depleted ( Fig. 6f , g, and Supplementary Fig. 7d , e). To further explore the drug response in patients with TNBC, we constructed seven minipatient-derived xenograft (mini-PDX) models, as reported previously 24, 25 , and measured the response for Stattic normalized to vehicle treatment (Fig. 6h) . The clinicopathological features of these TNBC models are shown in Supplementary 543, 553) showed higher sensitivity to Stattic than those with relatively low-ENSA expression (554, 584, 552) (Fig. 6i , j, and Supplementary Fig. 7f, g) . Together, the results from our TNBC cell lines, organoids, animal models and mini-PDX models strongly suggest that ENSA expression can be a biomarker for effective treatment with STAT3 inhibitors.",

Multivariable analysis showed that ENSA expression still showed prognostic value for relapse-free survival (P = 0.04) and tended to correlate with worse overall survival (P = 0.07) after adjustment for age, tumor size, and lymph node status (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 ).

The IHC results showed that ENSA expression was positively correlated with p-STAT3 (Tyr705), SREBP2, and HMGCR ( Fig. 7f and Supplementary Fig. 8b ). In addition, the survival analysis of SREBP2 expression showed that high SREBP2 expression was correlated with worse relapse-free survival of TNBC patients in internal and external cohorts ( Supplementary Fig. 8c, d) .

In this study, we found significant amplification of the chromosome 1q21.3 region in TNBC, and gene ENSA at this locus was highly expressed. ENSA regulates TNBC cell growth in vitro and in vivo through STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation of SREBP2 and downstream cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 7g) . TNBC exhibits high genomic instability, resulting in frequent CNAs at the chromosome level. Identification of the CNA-driven phenotype and the underlying mechanisms provides new insights into the pathogenesis of TNBC and facilitates the discovery of therapeutic treatments. The gain of 1q is one of the most frequent genomic imbalances in breast carcinomas and exhibits a higher CNA frequency in basal tumors than in luminal tumors [26] [27] [28] . Our previous research on the FUSCC cohort also indicated the widespread occurrence of 1q amplification in Chinese TNBC patients 7 . Here, we further showed that 1q21.3 was the exact region that harbored the highest frequency of gains in the 1q chromosome band (>18% in FUSCC TNBC patients), and this alteration frequency was just below that of the 8q amplicon (where MYC is located). Based on the analysis of the TCGA breast cancer cohort, we found amplification of the 1q21.3 region in all breast cancer subtypes, but the amplification rate was higher in TNBC than in other subtypes, which suggests the significance of this amplicon in TNBC. Evidence has indicated that CNAs promote the progression of tumors by altering the expression of genes within those affected genomic regions 29 . For example, 1q21.3 amplification upregulates the expression of several encompassing genes that form a regulatory loop to drive tumor growth 30 . Herein, we utilized copy number and gene expression data of primary tumors, including 88 paired tumor tissues and peritumor tissues from the FUSCC TNBC cohort, to discover potential oncogenes within amplicons. Among the 41 candidates identified, ENSA was located in the frequently amplified 1q21.3 region and indicated a poor prognosis in TNBC.",

            "text": "The ENSA-encoding protein belongs to the highly conserved c-AMP-regulated phosphoprotein (ARPP) family and was initially identified as an endogenous ligand for the sulfonylurea receptor that modulates insulin secretion and glucose metabolism 31, 32 . It has previously been shown that in Xenopus egg extracts, ENSA and its close relative ARPP19 are substrates of great wall (GWL) kinase and act as competitor inhibitors to prevent PP2A-B55 from dephosphorylating substrates such as cyclin B-CDK1, which results in mitotic entry 33, 34 . A subsequent study on human cells identified the ability of ENSA to control the length of the S phase 35 . While GWL and PP2A have been heavily studied, the genomic alteration and molecular function of ENSA have rarely been reported in the context of cancer 36 . To test these findings, we generated ENSA knockdown TNBC cells and found that these cells exhibited pronounced growth inhibition. Surprisingly, altered expression of ENSA did not significantly influence the cell cycle distribution of TNBC cells at the S phase or G2/M phase, which implies that the function of ENSA is context-dependent. Interestingly, cholesterol The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is a critical metabolic pathway responsible for de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and the production of other metabolites, such as isoprenoids, dolichol, and ubiquinone, to support multiple cellular processes 37 . The importance of the MVA pathway and its metabolites in supporting cancer cell survival and growth has been increasingly appreciated 38 . Cholesterol is a vital metabolite for the biological functions of mammalian cells. Its concentration at both the cellular and systemic levels has been linked to many diseases, such as obesity, heart disease and cancer. Several groups have addressed the relationship between hypercholesterolemia and increased breast cancer risk based on clinical data 21, 39, 40 . Importantly, 27-hydroxycholesterol is a key molecule that links hypercholesterolemia with breast cancer pathophysiology 20 . In addition to systemic cholesterol, dysregulated cellular cholesterol, derived from increased biosynthesis or uptake, fuels the malignant phenotypes of cancer cells, including proliferation, antiapoptosis, migration, stemness, and immune escape [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Several other MVA pathway metabolites and enzymes have also been identified as oncogenic. For example, MVA-derived farnesyldiphosphate and geranylgeranyl-diphosphate are critical for the isoprenylation of proteins, supporting their proper localization and function in cancer cells 38 . Metabolite quinone coenzyme Q is involved in cancer cell energy metabolism 47 . High-resolution CRISPR screens also identified several MVA pathway enzymes essential for the survival of cancer cells 48 . In the current study, we found significantly decreased concentrations of cholesterol and suppressed expression of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes upon ENSA silencing. However, the addition of cholesterol alone was not able to completely rescue impaired cell growth induced by ENSA depletion, implying the possibility of other MVK pathway enzymes or metabolites regulating ENSA-induced cell growth. Together, these results suggest the importance of the MVK pathway, primarily cholesterol biosynthesis, in the regulation of TNBC growth by ENSA. De novo cholesterol biosynthesis is mainly controlled by SREBP2, the pivotal transcription factor for genes encoding enzymes involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis program 49 . SREBP-2 is synthesized as a 125 kDa inactive precursor and sequentially cleaved into the NH2-terminal form with nuclear translocation and transcription factor activity 50 . It was previously found that SREBP2 was altered by several oncogenic pathways, including p53, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and AMPK [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . However, the relationship between STAT3 and cholesterol biosynthesis remains unclear. Only a few studies have described a decrease in the mRNA expression of SREBP1/2 with the deletion of STAT3, but there is limited knowledge on the underlying mechanism 56,57 . Intriguingly, we used ChIP-qPCR to identify that STAT3 bound directly to the promoter sequences of SREBP2 and promoted the transcription of SREBP2 in TNBC cells. The decrease in tumor growth and the expression of SREBP2 by ENSA silencing could be abolished by ectopic STAT3 expression, which confirmed the central role of STAT3 in cholesterol biosynthesis in TNBC. Additionally, the STAT3-independent pathway cannot be neglected since ectopic STAT3 expression alone could rescue most of but not all the growth inhibition induced by ENSA depletion. Other important oncogenic pathways, such as the MYC pathway, were also enriched in ENSA-depleted TNBC cells. Taken together, ENSA might promote TNBC progression through multiple pathways, of which the STAT3-SREBP2 axis was the most important.",

            "text": "The phosphorylation level of STAT3 can be regulated in different ways. On the one hand, phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 by tyrosine kinases such as JAK and SRC or at Ser727 by JNK and other MAPKs results in its activation in cancer. On the other hand, inhibition of negative regulators such as PIAS3, SOCS1 and 3 and several cellular phosphatases (SHP1 and 2, PTPRD, PTPRT, PTPN1 and 2, DUSP22) can also lead to STAT3 activation in cancer. To determine how ENSA impacts the phosphorylation of STAT3, we focused on PP2A, a serine/threonine phosphatase whose functions can be suppressed by direct interaction with ENSA. It has been reported that pharmacologic inhibition of PP2A induces the phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine residues in T cells and vascular smooth muscle cells 58, 59 . Unlike previous studies, we found that genetic inhibition of the PP2A catalytic subunit in control or ENSA knockdown TNBC cells could alter the phosphorylation of STAT3 at the Tyr705 residue instead of the Ser727 residue, which implied that ENSA-PP2A affects p-STAT3 (Tyr705) expression in TNBC cells. The reason the observations for PP2A were different in our study might be related to the distinct cellular context, and PP2A might indirectly impact the tyrosine residue of STAT3 in TNBC cells. The underlying mechanism by which ENSA-PP2A acts on the tyrosine residue of STAT3 remains to be addressed in the near future.",

Firstly, one cell line derived xenograft models and a limited number of mini-PDX models might not fully represent tumor features in vivo, more preclinical models are needed to verify the conclusions of this study. Secondly, while mini-PDX models could overcome the time-consuming disadvantage of traditional PDX models and retained the accuracy and efficiency in drug sensitivity testing, they still have some limitations compared to PDX models. Unlike PDX models which represent a more realistic tumor microenvironment, tumors grown as mini-PDXs lack interactions with human microenvironmental components due to the removal of blood cells and fibroblasts in the sample preparation process 60 . Thus, the involvement of microenvironmental components in ENSA-induced tumor progression and drug sensitivity deserve further investigation in proper preclinical models.",

For IHC, 8 pairs of primary TNBC tissues and adjacent normal tissues and primary TNBC specimens from 138 female patients (average age: 54 years), who underwent surgery at FUSCC from 2010-2013 were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. The procedures for IHC were as follows: paraffinembedded sections were deparaffinized at 60\u00b0C for 4 h and then subjected to xylene and a graded series of alcohol. For antigen unmasking, the slides were heated with citrate or EDTA antigen retrieval solution. After cooling, the slides were blocked with blocking solution (2% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C. The sections were covered with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (GeneTech) at RT for 30 min and then developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine substrate (Gene-Tech). The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with a graded series of alcohols and then mounted with coverslips and mounting medium. The staining density was measured using a Leica CCD camera DFC420 connected to a Leica DM IRE2 microscope (Leica Microsystems Imaging Solutions Ltd.). Some staining images were scanned by PANNORAMIC MIDI (3DHISTECH Ltd.) and viewed with CaseViewer (v2.4). The IHC scores were calculated by multiplying staining intensity (0 = no, 1=weak, 2=moderate, 3=strong) with percentage of positive staining (0 = negative, 1 \u2264 10%, 2 = 10-50%, 3 \u2265 50%). Acquisition of all clinical samples was approved by the Ethics Committee of FUSCC (Protocol number: 050432-4-1911D) and agreed to by each patient via signed informed consent.

Correlation coefficients were calculated using the Spearman test. Two-tailed P-values were given. g Proposed working model. In TNBC, ENSA is amplified, highly expressed and inhibits the function of PP2A, resulting in STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation and activation. STAT3 activation induces SREBP2 transcription to upregulate cellular cholesterol biosynthesis and facilitate tumor progression. Inhibition of STAT3 signaling with Stattic might serve as an effective treatment strategy for 1q21.3-amplified and ENSA-highly expressed TNBC. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
