Shortage of resources such as healthcare personnel, overwhelmed hospitals, overcrowding, lack of funds, 'infodemic' and a clear sense of leadership are some of the factors that worsen the situation in developing countries [1] . From the very beginning of this pandemic there was a global effort to develop an effective vaccine as a potential solution to curb the pandemic. In the last few months, a number of vaccines have been developed and approved by various regulatory authorities around the world. However, the development of effective vaccines is only the first in a long series of steps towards developing global herd immunity and halting the pandemic. Furthermore, these vaccines are associated with numerous concerns such as unexplained illnesses, clot formation, lack of trust in manufacturing companies and a rapid, unconventional mode of development. The procurement, allocation, distribution, administration and uptake of vaccines will be essential steps in the process. Developing countries are likely to face challenges at each step in the process. Since a majority of the global population resides in these nations, challenges in vaccination here need serious consideration. ",

Lessons learnt in prior pandemics led to establishment of international collaborations such as CEPI which were quickly able to support vaccine R&D. Decades of research into vaccine technology such as genome sequencing, previous mRNA vaccine candidates, adenovirus vectors, etc., have been instrumental in the successful development of COVID vaccines.",

Scaling up production is a monumental challenge with multiple components manufactured at different locations globally. Supply chain disruptions of any component in manufacturing or packaging could set back production efforts. Vaccine production capabilities are also unevenly distributed. However, partnerships have emerged between vaccine developers and manufacturers to scale up production rapidly. For example, Oxford-AstraZeneca has projected a production of approx. 3 billion doses of vaccine in 2021 with manufacturing partnerships in various nations, most notably with Serum Institute of India, which is planned to manufacture 1 billion of these doses [16, 17] .",

Fortunately, an alliance of 190 nations led by international organizations such as CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), GAVI (Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance), UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) and WHO (World Health Organization) has been set up to improve global vaccine access. The aim of the organization, COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX), is to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world [21] .

These resources -surveillance networks, trained personnel, and operation centers-can be utilized in supporting COVID-19 vaccination efforts [34] . Ongoing polio vaccination campaigns in Pakistan means that healthcare workers are already present in and familiar with local communities, which could be utilized not just for vaccine delivery but also to boost uptake by targeted messaging from trusted sources.
