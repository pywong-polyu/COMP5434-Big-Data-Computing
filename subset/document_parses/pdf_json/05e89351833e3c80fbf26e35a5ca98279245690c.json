Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging has been proposed as a screening tool as it is a much cheaper and easier to apply imaging modality than others that are traditionally used for pulmonary examinations, namely chest x-ray and computed tomography. Given the scarcity of expert radiologists for interpreting POCUS examinations in many highly affected regions around the world, lowcost deep learning-driven clinical decision support solutions can have a large impact during the on-going pandemic. Motivated by this, we introduce COVID-Net US, a highly efficient, self-attention deep convolutional neural network design tailored for COVID-19 screening from lung POCUS images. Experimental results show that the proposed COVID-Net US can achieve an AUC of over 0.98 while achieving 353\u00d7 lower architectural complexity, 62\u00d7 lower computational complexity, and 14.3\u00d7 faster inference times on a Raspberry Pi. Clinical validation was also conducted, where select cases were reviewed and reported on by a practicing clinician (20 years of clinical practice) specializing in intensive care (ICU) and 15 years of expertise in POCUS interpretation. To advocate affordable healthcare and artificial intelligence for resource-constrained environments, we have made COVID-Net US open source and publicly available 6 as part of the COVID-Net open source initiative. 6 https://github.com/maclean-alexander/COVID-Net-US/ arXiv:2108.03131v1 [eess.IV] 5 Aug 2021 2 A.

While vaccination efforts have certainly been shown as effective in mitigating further spread of COVID-19, screening of individuals to test for the disease is still necessary to ensure the safety of public health, and the gold-standard of this screening is reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [17] . With RT-PCR being laborious and time-consuming, much work has gone into exploring other possible screening tools, namely using chest x-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) to observe abnormalities in images, and extending from needing to have radiologists analyze the images and make diagnoses to using automated models to screen for the presence of COVID-19 [16, 8] .",

Typically, POCUS devices are mobile and do not have large computational resources available on-board mandating computationally lightweight solutions. In addition, POCUS analysis is typically performed on video rather than still images. Thus any solution must also operate in real-time.",

The goal with COVID-Net US is to design a highly efficient yet high performing deep neural network architecture that is small enough to be implemented on low-cost devices allowing for limited additional resources needed when used with POCUS devices in low-resource environments. More specifically, we employ a collaborative human-machine design approach. We leverage human knowledge and experience to design an initial prototype network architecture. This prototype is subsequently leveraged alongside a set of operational requirements catered around low-power, real-time embedded scenarios to generate a unique, highly customized deep neural network architecture tailored for COVID-19 case detection from POCUS images via an automatic machine driven design exploration strategy. This combination of human and machine driven design strategy results in a highly accurate yet efficient network architecture. Finally, to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed COVID-Net US for edge devices, we evaluate its practical performance by deploying it on a Raspberry Pi with a 1.5 GHz ARM Cortex 72 CPU with 4GB memory. To advocate affordable healthcare and artificial intelligence for resource-constrained environments, we have made COVID-Net US open source and publicly available as part of the COVID-Net open source initiative 7 [16, 8, 21, 7] for accelerating the advancement and adoption of deep learning for tackling this pandemic.",

The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their VGG-16 inspired model not only in identifying COVID-19 but also by deploying it on a Raspberry Pi . Although the study does not report the memory footprint or latency of the proposed model, a standard VGG-16 architecture consists of 134 million parameters and requires 15 billion FLOPS for inference [14] . While it is possible to run this model on a Raspberry Pi, the inference will be far from real-time. The protocol for physician analysis of an ultrasound examination consists of them analyzing the video taken by the POCUS device, often from various views and positions [1] . It is likely that for effective automatic analysis, many frames from a single video, or possibly multiple, will need to be processed by a given architecture, so to be feasibly implemented it will need to perform this analysis in as close to real time as possible. Thus, a goal of this study is to develop the architecture such that not only is it effective in terms of the accuracy metrics but also efficient both in size of the resulting architecture and efficiency of model processing time to facilitate affordable use on low-cost embedded processors to better facilitate for widespread use in highly affected regions around the world.",

Generative synthesis aims to find an approximate solution to the above expression through an iterative process. The ultimate goal of this study is to produce an efficient and accurate network architecture that can be employed on ultrasound machines and detect COVID-19 in real-time. To this end, we formulate 1 r (\u00b7) in terms of parameter count (< 1M), number of FLOPS (< 1B) and area under the curve (AUC) (>0.9). Figure 2 describes the resulting network. Several interesting observations can be made from the resulting architecture. First, we can note that that network design is comprised of a different number of macro-architectures including pointwise convolutions, attention condensers and standard convolutions. This high macro-architecture diversity is a direct result of using machine-driven design strategy to identify an architecture design specifically for identification of COVID-19 in ultrasound images. Secondly, we note that the use of depthwise convolutions leads to a very computationally light-weight design. This lightweight design is the result of imposing constraints on the parameter count and the number of FLOPS. Finally, we note that the architecture relies heavily on attention condensers. Attention condensers were originally introduced in [18] and have demonstrated themselves to be a highly efficient mechanism for self-attention [3] . Visual attention condensers produce a compressed embedding that represents the spatial and cross-channel activation relationships. This compressed representation yields selective attention which improves representational capability while exhibiting low architectural complexity.",

During generative synthesis, the inquisitor I probes the connections in the network N (here, COVID-Net US) iteratively with the generator G to identify the factors in the input to the network that are affecting the decision-making process of N .

NetScore is based on an analysis of many publicly available deep neural network architectures, and is described as useful in evaluating the effectiveness of architectures in practical contexts on edge devices, which describes well the use case of analyzing POCUS images in low-resource situations. Table 1 presents the accuracy results and the architecture and computation complexity results (NetScore, number of parameters, FLOPs, and Latency in ms on a Raspberry Pi). In terms of performance on the desired task, namely the AUC of the resulting model during testing, both the ResNet-50 and the COVID-Net US network architecture designs performed well with both achieving AUC values higher than 0.9, with COVID-Net US reaching above 0.98, comparable to the related works. Since the datasets used by each work are different, comparison of the exact performance values across studies is difficult, and in future work, studies that release their training code such as [2] and [4] will be tested to better compare the results of our training methods and analyze the sensitivity and positive predictive value of the architectures. As such, the effectiveness of the resulting architecture is consistent with the related works in suggesting that automated detection systems can be successful in identifying cases of COVID-19 infections from ultrasound examination, and thus prove effective as a complementary COVID-19 screening tool, particularly where RT-PCR tests or CXR or CT examinations could be difficult due to resource or time constraints.",

As desired, the utilization of a machine-driven design exploration strategy to determine the best micro and macro-architecture designs resulted in the proposed COVID-Net US outperforming ResNet-50 across all metrics in this area. The NetScore achieved by COVID-Net US was 82.53 compared to 49.03 as achieved by ResNet-50; in the original study, examined Fig. 3 . Examples of ultrasound images with annotations of signs used by radiologists for scoring the examinations, on a scale from 0 to 3 with 0 being normal and 3 being the most severe [15] . A score 1 example is shown on the left, with red arrows pointing to indentations in the pleural line. The central image shows a score 2 example with breaking points in the pleural line annotated, as well as \"white lung\" artefacts extending further down. Score 3 is shown in the right image, with significantly discontinuous pleural lines with a large area of white lung. models ranged from around 30 to 80 on this scale, showing that this difference is significant. COVID-Net US exhibits various macro-architectures which work in tandem for greatly reduced architectural and computational complexity. The result is a highly efficient architecture that requires just 65K parameters (353\u00d7 fewer than ResNet-50), 596M FLOPS (62\u00d7 lower than ResNet-50) and exhibits an on-device latency of just 216 ms (14.3\u00d7 lower than ResNet-50) on a Raspberry Pi. The small size and low latency of the proposed architecture enable them to be deployed on POCUS devices without significant hardware cost.",

Figure 4 then shows examples of the output from GSInquire for selected test images from COVIDx-US, with the critical factor regions highlighted. Note that the regions identified as quantifiably important for COVID-Net US when making classifications line up well with the areas annotated by radiologists based on their experiences. While this does not prove that COVID-Net US is making the exact same decisions as those radiologists, is does suggest two things; first, it confirms that the architecture is learning to examine features within the region of interest of the images, rather than unrelated regions or possible artefacts beyond the extent of the relevant content; and second, that since the architecture is focusing on the same regions as radiologists it is likely making clinically relevant decisions helping clinicians to trust the results of those decisions, supporting the notion that such models can be relied upon to automate the screening process for COVID-19 using ultrasound images.",

It was observed in all three cases that the critical factors leveraged by COVID-Net US correspond to pleural line irregularities, specifically hypoechoic areas and breakages in the normally smooth contoured pleural surface (subpleural consolidations) associated with lung pathology consistent with SARS-CoV-2 induced lung inflammation and pneumonia. As such, it was demonstrated that the identified critical factors leveraged by COVID-Net US are consistent with radiologist interpretation.",

Experimental results show that COVID-Net US achieved a higher accuracy than the ResNet-50 in terms of AUC score, while having significantly lower architectural and computational complexity, making it much more feasible of an architecture in low-resource contexts.

The ability for COVID-Net US to allow for point-of-care ultrasound devices to act as a COVID-19 screening tool with less of a need for radiologist oversight for analysis means that contexts where current commonly used tools, namely RT-PCR, CXR, and CT, are rare or unavailable due to resource constraints can hopefully improve their ability to screen for the disease. Whether that is in contexts with time constraints, such as emergency situations, or with resource constraints, such as developing countries, they will be able to benefit from this tool and protect individuals from further detrimental effects. We look forward to this work expanding the capabilities of the general COVID-Net initiative to provide support to clinicians and researchers alike.",
