However, it is unclear whether asthma is associated with poor clinical outcomes in COVID- 19 . Although a few studies did not find a significant association between asthma and critical outcomes in COVID-19 patients (1-5), they did not characterize asthma in detail, including clinical and inflammatory phenotypes. A recent large population-based study in UK reported a higher risk of death in patients with severe asthma who developed COVID-19 disease (6) , with another study indicating that those with chronic lung disease also had a poorer outcome (3) . Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that asthma heterogeneity, particularly severity, is an important factor in understanding the risk of fatal outcomes in COVID-19 among asthmatic patients.",

The next step for entry into the cell depends on the spike protein being degraded by host cell enzyme proteases, such as transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin also known as PACE (Paired basic Amino acid Cleaving Enzyme) (8, 9) . Because this is the way by which SARS-CoV-2 infects and actively replicates in respiratory tract epithelial cells that expresses ACE2 receptors, we tested the hypothesis that the expression of these entry points for the virus may be different by asthma severity, and/or by clinical or molecular phenotypes.",

The factors that determine the clinical picture are slowly becoming apparent, but elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that must be the defining factors for all clinical disease has not been achieved, especially in the context of individual chronic diseases, like asthma, and the various phenotypes of this condition that varies from mild to very severe. Analysing three cell compartments (biopsies, brushings, and sputum cells) this study provides compelling evidence for over expression of the factors that may determine the entry of the SARS-CoV2 into cells, ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in severe asthma. In contrast, their expression in mild to moderate asthmatics compared to mild-moderate asthma was similar to healthy controls. Together, these observations suggest that patients with severe asthma, and not those with mild disease, have the pathobiological substrate that determines the strength of infection by SARS-CoV-2. Our findings also suggest that the associations between SARS-CoV2 infection and asthma are likely to be complex, and support the epidemiological observation (6) that severe asthma may increase the risk of severe morbidity or mortality if infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus with increased probability in males, OCS users or those with comorbid nasal polyps.",

Further analysis suggested that several factors including male gender, OCS use or comorbid nasal polyps have a higher expression of these genes in sputum, bronchial biopsies or bronchial brushings. We also found that a specific molecular cluster (TAC2) in asthma, characterized by predominant sputum neutrophilic inflammation and inflammasome activation (12), had a higher expression of ACE2 and furin, than the other TACs. It was followed by TAC1, a predominantly sputum eosinophilic phenotype with the highest enrichment of gene signatures for IL-13/Type-2 (T2) inflammation, and lowest in TAC3, with a paucigranulocytic sputum associated with mild eosinophilia and increased metabolic and mitochondrial function genes.",

By contrast it was only the severe non-smoking asthmatics that had increased gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in sputum, a difference that was not evident when mild/moderate and severe asthma were all included as a mixed asthma population in a previous study (17) .",

It is this uniform approach that gives confidence in the observation that the levels of ACE2, TRPMSS2 and furin are higher in severe asthma compared to mild moderate asthma, particularly in males, with nasal polyps or on oral corticosteroid therapy, and those with an eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation.
