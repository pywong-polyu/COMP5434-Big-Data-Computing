Using a multiple probe across three tasks design, we examined the effects of parent-created and parent-implemented VP and error correction strategy on teaching three daily living tasks to a 14-year-old child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Following a one-time training and continuous coaching, a parent successfully created a VP intervention for all three tasks and implemented VP with error correction with high fidelity. Following the intervention implementation, the child with ASD learned to complete daily living tasks with high levels of accuracy and maintained task completion at a 1-week follow-up.",

            "text": "Daily living skills are functional skills that are critical for success in adult life to function independently, and acquisition of such skills is a priority for parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; Heiman 2002) . The ability to complete daily living skills independently can improve a person's quality of life, increase autonomy, and reduce dependence on family members and caregivers in daily life (Howlin and Moss 2012) . Daily living skills include a range of skills necessary for independent living, such as cooking skills, self-care skills, household tasks, community skills, and many others. While there are several instructional strategies that can be effective in teaching daily living skills (Steinbrenner et al. 2020) , video-based intervention (VBI) has gained increased attention due to unique features of VBI that can cater to the learning characteristics of students with ASD. VBI involves video-recorded instruction modeling the task completion, which a student can watch on an electronic device (e.g., computer, tablet, or a mobile phone). While there are procedural variations of VBI, such as in the type of model, or silent or audio narration of steps, VBI has been effective in teaching daily living skills to students with ASD (Aljehany and Bennett 2019; Domire and Wolfe 2015; Hong et al. 2016 ). There are several features of VBI that can make it effective for the acquisition of daily living skills. VBI can be used to provide individualized instruction via modeling with visual presentation and explicit instruction. Unlike in vivo modeling, VBI can provide instruction with limited distracting external stimuli by muting excess background noise and zooming in on only the relevant features of the target task (Hughes and Yakubova 2016) . These features, along with the visual nature of VBI, can help accommodate for difficulties with executive functioning skills and information processing (Fleury et al. 2014 ).",

Video prompting involves a video recording of the target task, displaying the completion of the task in a step-by-step manner and may or may not involve explicit instruction with voice-over narration. When using VP, a student watches each VP clip, corresponding to each step of the task, and then completes that step prior to watching the next VP clip. Thus, VP can be used as a teaching intervention or self-instruction and self-prompting strategy (Shepley 2017; Shepley et al. 2018 ) and decrease adult prompt dependency of students with ASD (Hume et al. 2009 ).",

Video prompting has been most effective for initial functional skill acquisition, particularly, the rapidity of skill acquisition and maintenance, when it was used with other instructional strategies, such as a prompting hierarchy, self-monitoring, and other strategies (Gardner and Wolfe 2015; Seaman-Tullis et al. 2019; Yakubova et al. 2019) . In terms of prompting hierarchies, a system of least prompting (SLP) and most-to-least prompting strategies are commonly used to correct student errors during VP instruction. Although both prompting hierarchies can be effective in preventing future errors and promoting skill acquisition, SLP tends to be an effective strategy for faster skill acquisition compared to most-to-least prompting (Finke et al. 2017; Libby et al. 2008; Yanardag et al. 2011) . While meta-analyses and systematic reviews of research examining the effects of VP in teaching functional skills to students with ASD and intellectual disability (ID) found it moderately effective (Aljehany and Bennett 2019; Park et al. 2019) , VP was most effective when used with error correction procedures, particularly, for secondary schoolage children with ASD and co-occurring ID (Aljehany and Bennett 2019) .",

Few studies examined the effects of non-researcher-created and implemented VP when teaching daily living skills in a school setting. For example, Johnson et al. (2013) trained a teacher to implement VP to teach daily living skills to students with ASD; however, the VP intervention was created by researchers. Seaman-Tullis et al. (2019) trained a teacher how to create a VP intervention and implement baseline and intervention with VP and error correction to teach a task of filling an envelope to a student with ASD. While these studies and past reviews of the VP literature found VP to be effective in improving a variety of daily living skills among students with ASD, no evidence exists on the effects of VP that is created and implemented by parents in a home setting. Examining the effects of VP to teach daily living skills with authentic intervention agents and settings (i.e., family members in a home environment where the skill is practiced and used) is critical to improve functional independence of children with ASD as they grow into adults. VP, as an evidence-based practice (EBP), can be used to provide explicit instruction in a visual format and can be created using everyday technology without requiring specialized technical training. Additionally, VP is customizable and can be created for a particular task and individual, thus, individualizing the learning experience. Yet, scarcity of research that extends VP research to examining the effects of parent-created and implemented VP in home settings is concerning.",

Cruz-Torres et al. (2020) trained parents how to access and open the application that hosted the VP clip on a device, provide their child with a verbal cue to play each VP clip and complete that step of the task, and implement error correction with praise. The authors taught parents to use error correction in the form of (a) telling the child that he/she completed the step incorrectly and asking him/her to watch the video again and (b) completing that step out of the child's view if the child continued to make an error for two consecutive times within the same session. Additionally, parents were asked to provide social praise for each correctly completed step of the task to teach daily living skills to their children at home. Although this suggests that parents can successfully implement VP with error correction and social praise in home settings with their children, the research in this area remains limited. Furthermore, we were not able to identify any studies in which parents implemented VP that they had created to teach daily living skills to their child with ASD. Together, the effectiveness of parent-created and parent-implemented VP, particularly self-prompted VP, in home settings remains a gap in the existing literature.",

The parent created one VP video for each of the three selected daily living tasks (confirming an appointment, flossing, frying an egg) based on the task analysis steps determined by the parent and research team. For each step, Nora recorded voice-over narration of herself reading the task analysis step, which was followed by the recording of her modeling the step, and then a 5-s pause (blank screen) during which her son could pause the VP to complete the step he just watched. The parent filmed the VP from third-person perspective so that her body (not just her hands) was visible in each video to model the steps. In addition, each of the VP videos were filmed in the same settings (i.e., living room table, bathroom, kitchen) and using the same materials that Kaleb would use during intervention. Each of the VP videos were filmed on a smartphone and uploaded to the mobile application (app) VivaVideo (https ://www.vivav ideo.tv; QuVideo Inc. 2020) to further edit and add voice-over narration. VivaVideo is a free video editing mobile application available on iOS and Android platforms. It was user-friendly for beginners to learn how to upload clips, edit, trim, and insert pauses in between each step of the task analysis to make it a VP clip. The completed VP videos were uploaded to a laptop computer for Kaleb to watch during intervention. The laptop computer was used according to Kaleb's preference; however, these VP clips could be used on many handheld electronic devices too. The duration of the VP was 2 min and 33 s for confirming an appointment, 3 min 44 s for flossing, and 5 min for frying an egg.",

For verbal prompts, Nora read the task analysis step aloud. For model prompts, she performed a live model of how to complete the step. For physical prompts, she used hand-over-hand guidance to help Kaleb correctly complete the step. Nora had to use physical prompting only one time for one task throughout the intervention phase. Kaleb willingly accepted the physical prompting due to his challenge with fine motor skills and the nature of the task that involved fine motor skills. By adding SLP, Kaleb was less likely to experience frustration from repeatedly struggling with the same step over multiple sessions, primarily due to the impairment in fine motor skills.

Then, the research team worked with Nora to select three daily living tasks of confirming an appointment, flossing, and frying an egg. These tasks were selected because they were named by the parent as tasks Kaleb could not currently complete but had expressed interest in learning how to complete. In addition, these tasks had similar levels of complexity, without the potential for crossover effects. The parent had not previously taught her son how to complete these tasks. Further, the parent was told not to ask her son to practice these tasks outside the study sessions. After the selection of tasks, the research team wrote accompanying task analyses, which Nora reviewed and further edited based on her knowledge of her child's abilities, and the materials and settings in their home.

This resulted in 100% IOA per task per each phase. During the parent training session, the research team reviewed a procedural reliability checklist with the parent and provided copies to take home. The procedural reliability checklist included the following steps for Nora to complete during study sessions: (1) ensure all materials are available, (2) provide direction to complete the task, (3) give your child the device with the VP (for intervention), (4) tell your child to watch the VP (for intervention), (5) ensure that your child watches the VP (for intervention), (6) do not provide assistance or error correction (for baseline or follow-up sessions), (7) if your child looks at you or asks for confirmation, only provide neutral responses, such as \"try your best,\" (8) if your child requires assistance during intervention, tell him to watch the VP clip again, (9) if your child requires further assistance during intervention, provide SLP, and (10) provide your child with verbal praise at the end of each task.

Tau-U is widely used as a non-parametric measure of effect size in SCRD studies, although it has inherent limitations and does not capture the individual variability within a phase and immediacy of effect. We interpreted Tau-U results using Parker and Vannest (2009) guidelines: The range score of Tau-U is 0 to 1.0 and can be defined as weak effect (0-0.65), medium to high effect (0.66-0.92) and strong effect (0.93-1.0). To calculate the Tau-U effect size, we used an online effect size calculator for SCRD data (http://www.singl ecase resea rch. org/calcu lator s/tau-u; Vannest et al. 2016 ). Figure 1 demonstrates the percentage of steps that Kaleb completed independently (without SLP) for each of the three tasks. The mean percentage of steps that required SLP during intervention per task, and the number of sessions required to reach mastery criterion are displayed in Table 3 . Table 4 presents the steps correctly completed by the parent for creating VP clips. Table 5 includes Tau-U scores for all skills. Effect size calculation resulted in a Tau-U score of 1 between baseline-intervention and baseline-follow-up phases for each of the three skills. Readers should use caution when interpreting Tau-U results, as Tau-U is supplementary to visual analysis. While Tau-U results show overall strong effects of the intervention, they do not communicate the variability in the completion of each task. For the confirming an appointment task, Kaleb had a mean baseline performance of 30.77% with a low, completely stable trend across the three baseline sessions. Once intervention was introduced, Kaleb demonstrated an immediate increase in percentage of steps completed independently, with a relatively stable trend across the six intervention sessions. Kaleb demonstrated a mean of 92.31% independent task completion during intervention, ranging 85-100%, with a mean change of 61.54% from baseline and no overlapping data points. During follow-up, Kaleb's mean independent task completion was 92.31%, ranging 85-100%, with a relatively stable trend. For follow-up, Kaleb performed the task with the VP only (no SLP), with the option to use the VP as needed. Across the three follow-up sessions, Kaleb chose to use the VP only for certain steps, correctly performing an average of 5.7 out of 13 steps without using the VP (range = 1-10).",

Across the three follow-up sessions, Kaleb chose to complete each of the three sessions without the use of the VP. He correctly performed an average of 13 out of 15 steps without the VP per each follow-up session.",

He reported that it was easy to use VP, and that he would be interested in using VP to learn new tasks in the future, depending on the specific task (i.e., a task he was interested in learning). He reported that he did not really like learning the flossing task, in particular, as the fine motor aspect was challenging. Nora reported that she liked using VP because it was helpful in thinking about how to break down the steps to the task. She noted that this helped her to become more aware of the systematic process of breaking every task into the smallest manageable steps. Nora explained that creating the VP required a lot of work upfront, but that it ultimately freed her from providing live modeling and prompting during the task, which helped her to be more patient, letting her son complete the steps at his own speed. She stated that she was interested in using VP in the future to teach other tasks, especially given the decrease in community-based learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, she expressed her interest in teaching Kaleb more independent living and transition skills, such as cooking, cleaning, and grooming skills, to further promote independence and to ensure that he not only completes tasks but does so with a high level of quality. When asked about the drawbacks, Nora reported that the preparation work and learning curve associated with using the video-editing software required a substantial amount of time and energy, but now that she had learned to use it, it may be quicker in the future. In terms of the implementation, she stated that the handouts and guidance from the research team were helpful, but that implementing three different tasks, all in different phases with different procedures and experimental design schedules sometimes got confusing. Nevertheless, she still completed the study procedures with high fidelity, and looked forward to using VP in the future without the constraints of following an experimental design.",

The parent was able to independently create high quality VP clips for three daily living tasks and implement the VP intervention with error correction with high accuracy of fidelity. The adolescent with ASD acquired three target skills following the use of VP with error correction and continued to complete tasks with high levels of accuracy during a follow-up assessment. Social validity interviews indicated that both the parent and adolescent participants valued the use of VP in teaching daily living skills and noted their desire to continue making new VP clips to teach or learn, respectively, further daily living and self-care skills. The findings from this study indicate that parent-created and implemented VP combined with SLP can be an effective strategy to help adolescents with ASD acquire daily living skills in an authentic setting. This study makes a novel contribution to this line of literature by examining the effects of parent-created and parent-implemented VP, adding to the scarce research on the effects of parent-implemented VP to teach daily living skills to children with ASD (Cruz-Torres et al. 2020) and to the evidence-base on the effects of VP to teach daily living skills to students with ASD without a co-occurring diagnosis of ID (Aljehany and Bennett 2019) . It is important to note that parent implementation of VP involved the parent providing directions for the child to watch the VP to complete each task step so that the child operated the VP clip as an independent self-prompting strategy. Although many studies that used VP to teach daily living skills to students with ASD have used instructor-operated (Domire and Wolfe 2015) or parent-operated VP (Cruz-Torres et al. 2020) , training students with ASD to use VP as a selfprompting device could add to increased independent functioning when completing daily living tasks. Equipping parents with the skills necessary to create and implement VP can be valuable in helping improve the functional independence of adolescents with ASD as they start to prepare for transition into adult life.",

Although Fig. 1 does not indicate which steps required error correction, the data reflecting Kaleb's accuracy of independent task completion with VP show the immediate effects of VP on his skill acquisition. The mean percentage of steps that required error correction was very small, ranging from 7.7 to 10.8% across three tasks. Most of the error correction that Kaleb required in the hierarchy of SLP were level one (verbally instructing him to watch the VP clip again) and level two (verbally prompting him on the completion of the task step). On only a few occasions, Kaleb needed modeling and physical prompting due to his challenges with gross motor and fine motor skills. More specifically, he required in-vivo modeling prompt once during the frying an egg task to learn the correct dial placement for \"medium low\" on the gas stove and required a number of in-vivo modeling prompts during the flossing task to demonstrate how to hold the floss correctly to reach his back teeth. Kaleb only received one physical prompt throughout the intervention phase, again to demonstrate the correct way to hold and manipulate the floss. This may be due to challenges Kaleb experienced with fine motor skills. He willingly accepted his mother's hand-over-hand guidance, and subsequently performed this step better in future sessions.",

While he chose not to use VP during frying an egg task, he was able to independently fry an edible egg during follow-up sessions. The error analysis showed that during the final follow-up session, he broke the egg yolk while cracking the egg and turned off the stove before egg was fully cooked but let it cook in the residual heat of the pan. While flossing his teeth during follow-up sessions, Kaleb was again able to independently complete the task, but did not get in between each of his teeth in some instances due to challenges with fine motor skills. Overall, the parent's creation and implementation of VP at home to successfully teach her child daily living skills suggest that VP can be an effective strategy for teaching daily living skills in authentic settings. This is especially important when children with ASD start to prepare for transition to post-school life and need to learn daily living skills for adulthood. This study also contributes to the literature on parentimplemented interventions, indicating that parents can effectively implement EBPs with high fidelity (Najdowski et al. 2010; Oliver and Brady 2014; Seiverling et al. 2012) . The novelty of this study is that the parent learned how to create VP clips and implement VP with error correction to teach daily living skills to her son in a home setting. It is important to note that the focus of our study was not to determine a presence or absence of a causal relation between parent training and parent learning outcomes of creating and implementing VP. Rather, our focus was to determine the presence or absence of a causal relation between parent-created and parent-implemented VP on the child's skill acquisition. Parent training targeted the systematic process for creating VP clips, implementing VP during intervention sessions, and providing error correction with least to most prompting. Since Kaleb was taught how to access and use the VP clips on his computer to complete tasks during the pre-intervention training phase, the parent's implementation of VP consisted of telling Kaleb to watch the VP clips to complete each task and providing error correction, when necessary. Nora created all three VP clips with high quality and implemented the intervention with high fidelity across all tasks (93% to 100%). The steps that she missed during intervention implementation were either not providing verbal praise at the end or providing a level of error correction out of the hierarchy of prompting (e.g., providing verbal prompting before telling her son to watch the VP clip again). Furthermore, the procedural reliability steps of the parent's implementation of baseline and follow-up phases (see Table 2 ) were also high.",

Furthermore, the ease of creating instructional VP clips using everyday technology (Kaleb's parent used her smartphone to create VP clips) and reusing those VP clips in the future when the child may need to refresh his or her memory, can be efficient and effective in helping adolescents with ASD acquire and complete many selfcare and daily living tasks.",

While SCRD can be implemented with one participant and a functional relation can be established by replicating the effects of the intervention across three behaviors, replication of effect across participants (parents and children in this case), settings, and skills enhances the generalizability of findings. Thus, the small number of participants could limit the generalizability of these findings. Further, one child with ASD without a co-occurring diagnosis of ID limits the generalizability of the findings, and replications are needed to enhance the generalizability to children with ASD with cognitive disability. Since we did not explicitly teach Nora how create the task analysis steps, but rather coached her in creating them, her continued use of VP effectively may also depend on creating task analysis steps that are appropriate for the task at hand. Additionally, the parent had a graduate level education (i.e., Master's degree) and was motivated to learn how to create and implement an EBP to support her son's skill acquisition. Therefore, future replication studies with parents of differing education levels and socio-demographic backgrounds are necessary to extend the generalizability of the findings. Future research might examine the implementation of VP at home across various groups of families. Further examining various factors (e.g., family dynamics, parent factors, etc.) that can impact parents' implementation of EBPs in home settings could further add to the literature in this area.",

However, it might be of interest for future research to plan for generalization of skills across new contexts and materials when it is developmentally appropriate for a participant who is making plans to live independently at the time of the study. Another limitation is that we did not have Kaleb call different doctor's offices during each session of the study for the confirming an appointment task. It was not practical and realistic to have Kaleb call different doctor's offices when he did not have appointments to confirm. However, it is important to note that while Kaleb followed VP to confirm an appointment according to the steps of the task analysis (see Table 1 ), the VP modeled the process for some steps that required flexibility from the participant, e.g., during every week of the study, Kaleb had to find the next date and time of the appointment in the future which varied each time, find the number for his doctor's office from the appointment calendar, and say the correct date and time of his next appointment. Additionally, Nora implemented the VP per each task once a week to teach daily living skills to Kaleb.
