As swab testing was negative for SARS-COV-2 and a chest X-ray scan did not show any sign of pneumonia, the patient was admitted to a COVID-free ward. On physical examination, we observed erythematous and slightly edematous patches on the trunk and upper and lower limbs, along with some isolated typical target lesions on both thighs (Fig. 1 ).",
