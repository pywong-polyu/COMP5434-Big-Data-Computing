To evaluate the effectiveness of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and detectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, those who are ineligible for broader antiviral criteria from the Chinese CHB prevention guide (2019). Methods: A total of 117 patients were recruited and their data were collected from paper or electronic medical records. HBV DNA and liver function were measured at baseline and throughout the 24-week follow-up. The effectiveness endpoint was complete virological response. The safety endpoint was the first occurrence of any clinical adverse event during the treatment. Results: Among the 117 patients, 45 had normal ALT as well as detectable HBV DNA and they were not recommended for antiviral therapy according to Chinese Guidelines (2019). After TAF antiviral therapy, the rates of patients who achieved HBV DNA <20 IU/mL at 4, 12 and 24 weeks were 77.1%, 96.7% and 96.8% respectively. Among them, the undetectable rates of HBV DNA in patients with low baseline viral load at 4, 12 and 24 weeks were 92.3%, 100% and 100%, while the rates of those with high baseline viral load were 68.2%, 94.1% and 94.4%. Compared with 71.4%, 94.4% and 94.7% in the high baseline group, the undetectable rates of HBV DNA at 4, 12 and 24 weeks in the low baseline liver stiffness group were 85.7%, 100% and 100%. There was no statistical significance among the above groups. Conclusions: CHB patients who had normal ALT and detectable HBV DNA and did not meet \"CHB prevention guide (2019)\", could achieve complete virological response in 24 weeks after antiviral treatment by TAF.",

Do we still leave out some patients that should be treated? Can CHB patients with normal ALT benefit from universal antiviral treatment?",

The guidelines of the Asia-Pacific Society of Hepatology (2015) 6 and the America Society of Hepatology (2018) 7 did not recommend antiviral treatment for these patients, without the evidence of liver biopsy. However, there existed some different viewpoints from the guidelines of European Society of Hepatology (2017) 8 as well as that of Chinese Society of Hepatology (2019). 5 Based on these two guidelines, experts argued that patients with a family history of HBV-related liver cirrhosis or cancer should receive antiviral therapy regardless of whether or not the evidence of he-patic fibrosis/cirrhosis exists. In addition, growing evidence supported that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence was high in HBV DNA-positive patients regardless of whether ALT was abnormal or not. 9 Universal treatment of CHB patients with normal ALT can reduce HBV-related HCC risk further. 10 But, we still lack evidence to confirm the impact of universal nucleoside treatment of patients with normal ALT (\u226440 U/L) and HBV DNA levels (<2,000 IU/mL). Therefore, the purpose of our study is to evaluate whether universal antiviral therapy is effective and safe for CHB patients with normal ALT who are ineligible to the antiviral indications of 2019 China Guidelines.",

The overall undetectable rates of HBV DNA were 77.1%, 96.7% and 96.8% at 4, 12 and 24 weeks respectively ( Fig. 2 ) after the treatment with TAF. None of those patients showed complete disappearance of serum HBsAg and change of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) during the 24-week follow-up. The treatment was well tolerated with no severe adverse events in most cases (Table 1 ). Next, we made a subgroup analysis to explore whether baseline HBV viral load or LSM would affect the virologic response rate.",

No major safety issues or serious adverse reactions were observed during follow-up. Although it seemed that the virological response rate in the high viral load group was lower than the low viral load group, and the difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, the virological response rates were getting closer and closer between the two groups as the therapy time prolongs. So, we have reason to believe that initiating TAF antiviral therapy is effective for these patients who are ineligible for the antiviral indications of 2019 China guideline, as long as the treatment period is sufficient enough. In addition, we observed an interesting phenomenon in the high viral load group. Only one HBeAg positive patient whose baseline viral load over 10 8 IU/mL did not obtain CRV, and his HBV DNA went down to 10 3 IU/mL after 48 weeks of treatment.

            "text": "Secondly, we also observed the effectiveness of TAF in CHB patients in the immune control phase (also known as having inactive HBsAg carrier status). According to the Chinese guidelines, 5 the characteristics of these patients are as follows: (1) serological marker HBsAg <1\u00d710 3 IU/mL, anti-HBs-negative, HBeAg-negative, anti-HBe-positive and anti-HBc positive; (2) HBV DNA <2\u00d710 3 IU/mL; (3) ALT normal; and (4) no or only mild (liver) inflammation, and there may be varying degrees of fibrosis. At present, there is controversy over whether or not to initiate antiviral therapy for such patients. Some scholars do not recommend starting antiviral therapy for these patients, mainly due to two concerns. One is that hepatic histological progression is sluggish in those patients, and therefore antiviral effect will not be good for these patients. 15, 16 Another concern regards the long-time effectiveness and safety of the current first-line oral antiviral agents. For example, although the current first-line oral antiviral agents, such as entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), are potent and have high resistance barriers; both of the drugs cited have deficiencies. Many publications have confirmed that patients treated with entecavir for a long time are prone to drug resistance 17 (especially in lamivudine exposed patients) and(or) low level viraemia, 18 while long-time TDF treatment is associated with renal and bone impairment risk. 19, 20 However, more and more evidence has shown that a significant proportion of untreated CHB patients with normal ALT exhibit significant histologic changes and even cirrhosis. 21 A recent study revealed that among 221 patients with normal ALT and low HBV DNA levels (<2,000 IU/mL), 27.1% of them had significant liver necroinflammation and 46.2% had significant liver fibrosis. 22 In addition, grow-ing evidence indicate that a high virological response can be reached in these patients as well. According to a metastudy of 830 CHB patients with normal ALT, favorable virological response can be achieved after initiating antiviral treatment to those patients. 14 In another study, liver biopsy was performed on 235 CHB patients with normal or slightly elevated ALT, in which antiviral treatment was initiated on HBeAg-negative patients. The virological response rate was 90.7% 23 in 72 weeks. After the second liver biopsy, it was found that antiviral treatment could effectively improve the stage of liver fibrosis in CHB patients and reduce cirrhosis occurrence. Thus, some scholars suggest that these patients should be treated actively. 24 TAF was approved for HBV-infected adults and adolescents over 12 years-old by the Food and Drug Administration in November 2016. Subsequently, several major association guidelines quickly recommended it as a first-line agent. Interestingly, our results showed that TAF was effective and safe in CHB patients in the immune control stage, even without liver histological evidence. There were 18 patients in the low viral load group (immune control phase) and the undetectable rates of HBV DNA after therapy were respectable.",

Generally, transient elastography is used as a kind of noninvasive ultrasonic technology to assess liver stiffness. According to the Expert Consensus on Diagnosing Fibrosis Based on Transient Elastography Technology (2018 Update), 25 different degrees of liver stiffness would affect the decision of antiviral treatment in clinic. For normal-ALT CHB patients with LSM \u22659.0 kPa, it is recommended to initiate antiviral therapy directly and monitor complications of liver cirrhosis or HCC. When LSM is between 6.0\u223c9.0 kPa, it is considered to perform liver biopsy to evaluate disease status and then initiate individualized antiviral treatment based on disease status. When LSM <6.0 kPa, liver stiffness should be monitored regularly and antiviral treatment should be individualized. Therefore, we set up low (LSM <6.0 kPa) and high (6.0 \u2264LSM <9.0 kPa) LSM groups. None of the patients in either group was eligible for antiviral indications by the 2019 Chinese guideline and by the 2018 expert consensus above. Our results showed that CHB patients in both groups had a significant response to TAF antiviral therapy. Moreover, the efficacy of the low LSM group seemed to be higher; the undetectable rate of HBV DNA in the high LSM group was lower than that in the low one at each time point, but there was no statistical significance. This may suggest that even for CHB patients whose LSM is below 9.0 kPa, antiviral therapy can be unhesitatingly initiated without liver biopsy evidence, as long as their HBV DNA is detectable. More broadly speaking, for normal-ALT CHB patients with detectable HBV DNA, antiviral treatment could be initiated regardless of liver stiffness, which will be good news for patients in certain conditions where liver biopsy or liver stiffness testing is not available.",

TAF was listed in China's medical insurance reimbursement catalog (patients paid about 647-3,234 RMB per year) in December 2019, so it is reasonable to believe that TAF, a cost-effective regimen of antiviral therapy, is currently available.

First of all, this study is retrospective, and the confounding bias that is often present in those studies may potentially affect the results of the trial. Secondly, our study did not set up a control group. It is easy to refuse antiviral treatment to normal-ALT CHB patients with detectable HBV DNA. But, it is hard to determine the difference between treatment group and non-treatment group based on serum biochemical indicators alone. We often rely on liver biopsy and longterm follow-up to monitor the occurrence of complications and to judge efficacy, which is quite difficult to complete in a short time. Thirdly, because of the impact of the COVID-19, many patients with follow-up value have to be excluded from this study due to lack of complete data. What is more, the follow-up time of this study was short, so it is not clear whether starting antiviral therapy for these patients will reduce the risk of long-term liver-related complications and improve the overall prognosis. We will continue to follow up patients to obtain longer-term research data. Finally, the current data come from a retrospective study of a singlecenter Asian population, and the number of samples is limited. Whether or not the research conclusions are universal requires multicenter research data with larger sample sizes of different races. Nevertheless, our research results provide new evidence for treating HBV-infected patients who are ineligible by the \"CHB prevention guide (2019 edition)\". We also look forward to contributing to the early realization of the goal of eliminating hepatitis B by 2030.",
