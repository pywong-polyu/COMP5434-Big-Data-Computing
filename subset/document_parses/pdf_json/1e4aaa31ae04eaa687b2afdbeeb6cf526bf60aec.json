Indeed, the Daily Telegraph claims that this is the most frequent referral cause for children to hospital, numbering equating to 177 cases per day nationally at an estimated cost of \u00a341 million. A further report of this problem appears in the recent BDJ (Potential surge in post-COVID child tooth extractions; BDJ 2020; 229: 278).",

Furthermore, it seems that frequent courses of antibiotics are prescribed to keep infection from carious teeth at bay pending hospital extraction. As we are all too aware, this repeat prescribing is undesirable, building up unnecessary resistances. I presume dental schools still educate undergraduates in the expert technique of extractions, therefore one must conclude that the problem is due to an unwillingness of clinicians in primary care to undertake these treatments. We must remember that for every child suffering from painful teeth, there are parents having to cope with stressful situations.",

The alternative solution for resource constrained environments is to explore frugal innovation approaches to make the most of existing assets and skills. 2, 3 For instance, for creating a temporary negative pressure in dental surgeries strong exhaust fans have been connected to the simple duct system to deliver the air from the surgery at the minimum three metres above the roof. 4 To prevent the transmission of infection through aerosol in the dental setting the 'protection box' is an innovative and economical solution for performing aerosol generating procedures. 5 The protection box has excellent visibility and can be reused after disinfection.
