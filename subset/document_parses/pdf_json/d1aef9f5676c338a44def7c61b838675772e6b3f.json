Increasing BMI category was associated with increasing waitlist time, and patients in the highest category experienced greater risk of waitlist mortality. The 2018 allocation system changes appeared to increase rates of transplantation among patients with obesity, who were most likely to be UNOS Status 2 at time of transplantation, with greater distances traveled to procure organs compared with those undergoing transplantation under the prior system. Transplantation in patients with an elevated BMI can be challenging, which can be driven by both comorbidities and by recommendations to match donor and recipient size. With increasing BMI, the concomitant increase in multiple comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) raises the risk of perioperative complications and mortality. 10, 11 In addition, obesity is independently associated with pulmonary hypertension, which when irreversible is a contraindication to transplantation. 12, 13 Size matching for patients with and without obesity also remains a concern. Recipients without obesity receiving a heart with a donor of <70% of the recipients weight has been associated with worse outcomes, 14 and current recommendations from the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation are to match donors to recipients with a <30% body weight discrepancy. 15 Additionally, donor predicted heart mass >15% below the recipient's has been associated with increased mortality; however, that study did not include patients with BMI >40 kg/m 2 . 16 Overall, patients with obesity face increased barriers to receiving a transplant compared with patients without obesity.",

In their analysis, a lower proportion (19.5%) of hearts from donors with severe obesity were used, compared with 31.6% of donors without severe obesity. We corroborate their findings in the contemporary population. Our study also found that with increasing BMI strata, there was an increase in estimated heart-mass discrepancy between recipient and donor, which was not associated with posttransplantation mortality after adjustments. Efforts to promote size matching to patients who have obesity or severe obesity should be carefully measured against the urgency for transplantation. 18, 19 We found that patients with obesity had significantly longer waitlist times than lean-weight transplant recipients; notably, patients with BMI 30 to 34.9 or 35 to 39.9 kg/m 2 had waitlist times more than twice as long as patients who were lean/normal weight, and patients with BMI 40 to 55 kg/m 2 had waitlist times about 3 months longer than that lean/normal weight group. With increasing waitlist time, there is not only a decreased likelihood of transplantation but also an increased likelihood of posttransplant death and graft failure. 8 Here, a BMI >40 kg/m 2 was independently associated with increased waitlist death, and increasing BMI strata was associated with a higher risk of posttransplantation death. To address this potential confounding by adverse events accumulated while on the waitlist, we controlled for time from listing to transplantation, and we found that severe obesity remained associated with posttransplantation survival difference. This suggests that it is unlikely that only delays to transplantation may be driving the differential posttransplantation outcomes for these patients. Compared with patients with a lean/normal BMI, those with a BMI >30 kg/m 2 were at greater risk of death.",

We found that in both BMI groups (30-34.9 and 35-55 kg/m 2 ), patients were less likely to have durable LVADs at listing and more likely to be supported with an intra-aortic balloon pump after the allocation system change, and the BMI group 30 to 34.9 kg/m 2 also saw an increase in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use at time of listing, findings that reflected those from analyses other populations after the allocation system change. 7, 20 Despite some evidence that obesity is not associated with long-term survival differences in LVAD recipients, 21 these changes may be beneficial given the posttransplantation survival advantage of primary transplantation compared with transplantation from an LVAD. 22 Additionally, both the patients with obesity and severe obesity were significantly more likely to receive a transplant in the new allocation system, with an \u224850% reduction in median wait times and dramatic increases in the percentage of patients transplanted within their first month of wait time. However, both groups had increased ischemic time and distance traveled for their hearts, which has also been described in other populations 7 and may be reflective of an overall change in the heart transplantation landscape rather than a finding specific to patients with obesity. 23, 24 Despite having an overall shorter period of follow-up, patients with obesity appear to have had greater access to donor hearts, and a greater percentage underwent heart transplantation under the new allocation system. This was, however, accompanied by an increase in posttransplant mortality among patients with BMI 30 to 34.9 kg/m 2 .",

Finally, the new allocation system has been in effect for <2 years, so practices may still be evolving and continue to evolve in response to this policy change. In addition to the limited time since the allocation system change, the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation of patients with obesity are not evaluated within this article but may have influenced transplantation rates and/or outcomes in a way that is difficult to capture.

Data presented as % or Median [IQR]. BMI indicates body mass index; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; IQR, interquartile range; and UTI, urinary tract infection. Overall, patients with a BMI 40 to 55 kg/m 2 had the highest mortality posttransplant (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 : 22.7%, BMI 25-29.9 kg/m 2 : 23.7%, BMI 30-34.9 kg/ m 2 : 25.0%, BMI 35-39.9 kg/m 2 : 26.7%, BMI 40-55 kg/m 2 : 36.4%; P<0.001). The most common causes of mortality by BMI category are demonstrated in Table S3. Patients with BMI 35 to 40 and 40 to 55 kg/ m 2 had significantly higher hazard of posttransplantation death (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.43; P<0.001; and HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.27-2.14; P<0.001, respectively). After adjusting for percent heart-mass discrepancy in addition to all covariates in the model, patients with BMI 35 to 40 and 40 to 55 kg/m 2 had increased risk of posttransplantation death (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.16-1.42; P<0.001; and HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.25-2.11; P<0.001, respectively) (Table S4).",
