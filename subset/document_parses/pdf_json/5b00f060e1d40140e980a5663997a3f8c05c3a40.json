The RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is a promising drug target due to its pivotal role in viral-host attachment. These specific structural domains can be targeted with small molecules or drug to disrupt the viral attachment to the host proteins. In this study, FDA approved Drugbank database were screened using a virtual screening approach and computational chemistry methods. Five drugs were short listed for further profiling based on docking score and binding energies. Further these selected drugs were tested for their in vitro biological activity. There was significant correlation between the prediction from computational studies and the actual RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition by the drugs. Then, we performed a series of studies that mimic some of the biological events seen in COVID-19 patients such as secretion of IL1\u03b2, presentation of a more thrombogenic endothelium by production of thrombomodulin and accumulation of inflammatory cells such as monocytes in the lungs. Of all the drugs, most promising drug was Ertugliflozin which is used for type-2 diabetes. This drug possesses several desired properties and may be a good candidate for immediate repurposing for treatment of COVID-19.",

            "text": "World Health Organization has now declared COVID-19 a global pandemic actively spreading around the world. COVID-19 caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, pneumonia, nausea, and fatigue, and death due to severity of symptoms and associated co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, etc. As of now, SARS-CoV-2 has reached almost all countries around the world, with more than 121 million confirmed cases and around 3 million deaths as of March, 2021 [1] . The mechanism of COVID-19 effect is believed to be that it binds its host's cellular receptors through, homo viral surface trimeric spike glycoprotein (S-protein) with human host cell surface angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) receptor and membrane fusion, necessary for viral entry into the host cell [2] . The entry of the virus into the host cell requires the spike or S-protein to be cleaved in two steps. The first step is the binding of the virus to the ACE2 protein and this is accomplished by the cellular proteases acting at the region between S1 and S2, namely, the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2. S1 and S2 subunits are responsible for viral-receptor binding and virushost cell membrane fusion, respectively. The S1 subunit bears the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on its C-terminal domain. The RBD itself contains the receptor-binding motif (RBM), which actually comes into contact with the carboxypeptidase domain of the ACE2 molecule. In the spike protein, there is unique furin cleavage site which was not found in SARS-CoV. This site makes the virus more adaptable for cleavage by other cellular proteases as well, thus making it able to infect more cell types. This cleavage step is required for the initiation of membrane fusion by the S2 subunit, and this involves a second site of cleavage on this site, which is now considered essential to activate the S2 protein [3] .",

At present, this strategy would be a logical choice for developing a new drug for COVID-19 considering the substantial time-scales associated with new drug discovery and the trial-based validation of its safety and efficacy.

Much research has gone into finding drugs that can effectively prevent or reduce viral-ACE2 interactions. Subsequently, testing their binding efficacy in in vitro assays with RBD will elucidate the computational rationale for robust proposal of drug repurposing. Screening the FDA approved drugs and antivirals from the Drugbank database through molecular docking methodology would identify and prioritize repurposed drugs as potential leads in order to avoid any bias towards a particular drug. The drugs identified by virtual screening were then tested in a cell-free biochemical RBD-ACE2 binding study to validate findings from virtual screening. In addition, the drugs were further profiled in cytokine secretion and three dimensional (3D)-printed human-cell-based vascular lung model for potential anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic activities which could be useful in treatment of COVID-19.",

The \u0394G provide an accurate estimate of protein-ligand binding energy, on the assumption that the pose is correct. For the selected drugs the \u0394G is range from -7.5 to -10.8 in site-1, while in site-2 the \u0394G is range from -7.6 to -10.8. The number of hydrogen bond and the number of amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 (site-1 & site-2) interacting with each drugs are given in Table-2 & Table-3 . As shown in Figure-3 , the graph represents the correlation between rank score and binding energies of all the selected drugs in RBD site-1 and site-2. All the drugs have more or less similar range of score and binding energies. From the detailed docking analysis, it is observed that the Ertugliflozin and Iodipamide drugs have good LF rank score and \u0394G in both the active sites. It is found that, these six drugs have formed strong H-bond contacts with more than two to three amino acid residues along with various hydrophobic interactions in spike protein resulting in increased binding affinity with target protein.

Out of all the selected drugs, Ertugliflozin a Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2) inhibitor showed best free energy and rank score toward the binding to the RBD domain of spike protein of SARS-COV-2. SGLT-2 inhibitors, a new novel class of antidiabetics are used to manage glucose levels in Type 2 Diabetes, promotes excretion of glucose thus reduce plasma glucose levels. Our computational studies on the potential of various other SGLT-2 inhibitors binding to the RBD domains resulted either similar or lower LF rank scores. The LF rank score and \u0394G for the other SGLT2 drugs in the RBD active site pockets S1-1 and S1-2 are described in Table-4 . Based on these observations we believe that the effects of Ertugliflozin are unique for COVID-19. Ertugliflozin has demonstrated most favourable binding affinity toward the RBD protein in both the sites. Its belong to the class of potent and selective inhibitors of the Sodium-dependent Glucose cotransporters (SGLT), more specifically the type-2 which is responsible for about 90% of the glucose reabsorption from glomerulus.

Another drug, Iodipamide, which is used as contrast agent for cholecystography and intravenous cholangiography is also showing good LF Rank score and \u0394G in both the active sites. In site-1, it makes three hydrogen bonding interactions with Arg457, Lys458, and Arg466. Further, it also is involved in strong cation-pi interaction with Arg457. Interaction analysis in active site-2 suggests that it has four hydrogen bonding interactions with Cys336, Phe342, Asn343, Trp436 amino acid residues. Further it has making a close contact with various hydrophobic interactions with Leu368, Asn440, Phe347, Arg509, Val367, Ser371 and Ser373 amino acid residues, as shown in Figure-5 .",

The data are shown as percent inhibition relative to binding observed in the absence of any drugs.

When the drugs were added together with LPS some of them blunted the induced secretion. Almost all drugs showed moderate inhibition of LPS induced cytokine secretion.

Almost all drugs had some degree of inhibition but continuing our interest in Ertugliflozin we were able to see that it blocks the secretion of thrombomodulin by almost 40%, a very desirable property to possess for a drug that can be repurposed for COVID-19 (Figure-8) .

The recruitment of inflammatory cells such as monocyte is a common feature seen in COVID-19 as an early step of disease onset. This monocyte accumulation may greatly contribute to cytokine storm that is seen in this disease. As shown in Figure-9 , some of the drugs were able to modulate monocyte adhesion stimulated by LPS. Again focusing on Ertugliflozin, it can be seen that it was able to reduce the impact of LPS (increase is 20 cell count per field) relative to the increase seen in control cells (increase about 70 cell counts per field). These data indicate Ertugliflozin has potential to modulate monocyte accumulation observed during COVID-19. There is an urgent need to identify a therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2 for blocking its spike protein binding to the host's ACE-2, and quick way of finding such is through drug repurposing. RBD of S-protein plays a pivotal role in viral-host attachment and one of the potential target for antiviral treatment against SARS-CoV-2. These specific structural domains can be targeted with small molecules or drug to disrupt the viral attachment to the host proteins. In this study, FDA approved drugs were tested for their inhibitory properties towards the COVID-19 S protein (6M0J) using a virtual screening approach and computational chemistry methods. Rigorous in silico analysis through molecular docking analysis showed all 5 drugs have strong predicted binding affinities toward RBD domain in the S1 protein. All these also showed good dock score and interaction with important amino acids along with various hydrophobic interaction and were well fitted in both the active sites of protein. More importantly the selection of drugs by computational modelling was corroborated in a series of in vitro studies. The most important confirmation came from the assay that examined the direct binding of RBD to ACE2. There was very significant correlation between the prediction from computational studies and the actual binding assay. We then conducted a series of studies that mimic some of the biological events seen in COVID-19 such as secretion of IL-1\u03b2, presentation of a more thrombogenic endothelium by production of thrombomodulin and accumulation of inflammatory cells such as monocytes in the lungs. In silico and in vitro studies demonstrate favourably drug's ability to modulate desirable properties, with Ertugliflozin standing out with promising potential for drug re-purposing.",

            "text": "Repurposing approved pharmaceutical drugs provide an alternative approach for rapid identification of potential drug leads. In the present study, we found Ertugliflozin, a drug used for type-2 diabetes, seems to possess all desirable properties demonstrated by in silico and in vitro pharmacological studies. This is an oral drug which works by blocking the activity of SGLT2 (Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2) and prevents glucose reabsorption in the kidney. This is used as a chronic treatment drug for diabetes, which means that its safety has been thoroughly tested prior to approval. It is also readily available and could be repurposed immediately. To avoid any glucose lowering in COVID-19 patients by this drug, a nasal formulation can be developed which targets the lungs. This will also improve the potency and efficacy against the infection while requiring lower doses. While the development of vaccines will prophylactically prevent the infection we do not have targeted drugs once the disease already sets in. Based on our work here we propose that Ertugliflozin is a strong candidate for immediate repurposing for treatment of COVID-19 treatment. Since the in silico screening did not identify other SGLT2 inhibitors in initial screening, we believe that the effects of Ertugliflozin are unique to it and unlikely to be a class effect, but this needs to be examined in separate studies. In conclusion, we propose that the disruption of the SARS CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 binding interface by Ertugliflozin and its associated anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties could pave the way for it to be useful as a new COVID-19 treatment.",
