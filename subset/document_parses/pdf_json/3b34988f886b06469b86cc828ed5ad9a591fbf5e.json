Here radiological chest X-rays are easily available with low cost only. In this survey paper, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) based solution that will benefit in detection of the Covid-19 positive patients using radiography chest X-Ray images. To test the efficiency of the solution, using data sets of publicly available X-Ray images of Corona virus positive cases and negative cases. Images of positive Corona Virus patients and pictures of healthy person images are divided into testing images and trainable images. The solution which are providing the good results with classification accuracy within the test set-up. Then GUI based application supports for medical examination areas. This GUI application can be used on any computer and performed by any medical examiner or technician to determine Corona Virus positive patients using radiography X-ray images. The result will be precisely obtaining the Covid-19 Patient analysis through the chest X-ray images and also results may be retrieve within a few seconds.",

In this study, Artificial Intelligence was used to detect whether a patient is positive for Corona-virus by analysing their lungs X-ray pictures. Artificial intelligence can also be used to predict the status of person like he is positive to corona or not by using existing evidence. Thus, predicting possibilities within the immediate future can help authorities to adopt the required measures [15] .",
