This question is worth asking since the future is not precisely fated, and ecological predictions may look like charlatanism. Strengths and weaknesses of ecology hold precisely in the unpredictable dimension of nature. The stochastic aspect brings considerable richness, allowing mechanisms such as interchangeability, founder effects, resilience, etc. System indeterminism is at the origin of ecologist discomfort when meeting requests for recipes. The duty of science holds probably more toward educating the glance than to manipulating nature. If society wishes more life, it should agree to lose some control over it to let every organism filling empty spaces and sharing a variety of ecological niches. In turn, every organism will be (or will construct) a habitat for adding a multitude of other species.",

In this frame, scientists may play an active role in society, explaining the differences between natural wilderness and natural gardening. Both systems may hold a similar level of species diversity, but the former is self-organized while the second needs social skills to stabilize the ecological niche of each component.

Can we take away something from the wood without giving something in exchange for it? We can change the species composition of forests when economically advantageous. Is this a right or wrong move?

A forest ecosystem is composed of lasting organisms that use the soil as a secondary source of nutrients, the primary source being photosynthesis. The soil corresponds to a mandatory recycling center necessary for forest survival, in harmony with a local and relatively fixed climate and a geological substrate, in a specific morphology. Soil organisms digest dead organisms or parts of them, allowing reinvesting the products of past biological activities in living structures through the photosynthetic process. As for egg and hen, was soil born before photosynthesis or vice versa? The process of photosynthesis took probably place in the soil, at the origin, in bacteria evolving in algae, but in contrast with the digestive processes, the chloroplast activities are poorly diversified. Regardless of plant species, the photosynthetic function is taken in charge entirely unchanged. The digestive system is, in contrast, highly diversified and unequally distributed among the soil organisms. Fortuitously, it lies beneath the surface and remains quite invisible, and could be the Achille's heel of every ecosystem.",

Nowadays, world ecosystems have to cope with mundialization that brings new flows and new channels. Increasing mobility brings upheaval in both ecology and society. Species and populations carried away from any places around the world bring disruption of local equilibria. Population dynamics, in an environment with limited resources, are known for a long time (Volterra 1926; Kingsland 2015) . A new incoming population increases slowly first, then rapidly and finally reaches an overall equilibrium, oscillating around a relatively stable value of environmental resources. Invasive species may be considered as monopolistic (a factor depleting biodiversity) or on the contrary, as a means to increase local biodiversity. The exportation of a universal model of sociological development upset the equilibrium of a millennium share of resources between humans and Nature. The belief and the system value that support the search for new stability cannot overlook economic constraints and the fact that richness unequally distributes.",

Putting the analogy to the end, we know that an ecological system also has a hidden face that is soil as a digestive system (SADS), and we may wonder what a SADS could be for society. SADS is the regulatory focus of every ecosystem. From an organizational point of view, the counterpart of SADS to the society could be the dissipative mechanism that corresponds to the process of economic goods consumption. Thus, the instruments of a social SADS regulation could consist of taxes and allow public services to control the consumer society. Unfortunately, this captivating representation may work only in a virtual and with unlimited resources world. As we live in a real and limited resources world, we need to reconcile with Nature. Humans should limit their needs. Living and dead Nature should remain in a long-term balance. Social and natural SADS need to meet themselves and co-evolve.",

Therefore, the cause of the lousy state of damaged forests is certainly not attributable to their abandonment. How is it possible that wellkept forests suffer such serious damage? An explanation could be that perpetual disturbance and disequilibrium could be a natural law (Motta 2018) . However, without equilibrium a system does not stand up, and this might contradict a thesis of perpetual disequilibrium. It could be the balance covering of a system in \"unstable equilibrium\", i.e., a continually evolving complex ecosystem. A forest displays century-old cycles, inserted in geological periods of several millennia. A forest includes trees with several-century growth cycles, plants, and animals with 10-yr, annual, or monthly cycles, up to the cycles of micro-organisms that are of days to hours or even minutes. Every sub-system is moving in a changing equilibrium. However, thinking that a world without balance exists, means disregarding ecology. If a catastrophe may stir the pot, there should be a trend, a force that allows recovering a momentarily lost original equilibrium (as in the aging of every natural system, like the growth of a child). Of course, the reference point of such evolution is in the future and remains theoretical. Nevertheless, this \"final theoretical forest\" will be mobile but measurable after the forest has started to regrow. We are talking about a concept attributable to the chaos theory (Lorenz 1963; Mandelbrot 1983; Gleick and Hilborn 1988; Nottale and Schumacher 1998; Nottale 2003; Ponge 2005; Zanella 2018 ). Chaos theory does not say that things are out of balance, and that sooner or later they can / must fall into disrepair. On the contrary, it announces an unpredictable but balanced and continuous becoming. And this means studying the forest as a system in the making, with its own and still unknown laws. To do this we need a lot of patience, a lot of research, respect for the future and a lot of prudence. These aspects were addressed with foresight during a historical conference in Italy (Ciancio 2010 (Ciancio , 2015 . That left the Italian forest managers' society divided, faced with a poorly understood proposal called \"systemic silviculture\". Unfortunately, however, the consequences of the past forestry are before our eyes, landed. From (Ciancio 2009) : \"Science has value if it is capable of explaining and predicting. The dominant scientific culture is aimed at planning the future on the basis of data acquired with experiments and observations. Well, in biology and forestry, current knowledge does not allow us to be certain that the change in some conditions does not affect the results. The uncertainty derives from the fact that it operates in a changing environment. As it is easy to guess, this factual datum involves methodological problems, on which, instead of pausing to reflect, one often flies over with great ease\".",

After this break, it is no longer possible to return to the preexisting state of equilibrium.

Millions of species of fungi and bacteria swap nutrients between soil and the roots of trees, forming a vast, interconnected web of organisms throughout the woods. Now, for the first time, scientists have mapped this \"wood wide web\" on a global scale, using a database of more than 28,000 tree species living in more than 70 countries. Earth has about 3 trillion trees. Each tree is closely associated with certain types of microbes. For example, oak and pine tree roots are surrounded by ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi that can build vast underground networks in their search for nutrients. Maple and cedar trees, by contrast, prefer arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), which burrow directly into trees' root cells but form smaller soil webs. The researchers wrote a computer algorithm to search for correlations between the EM-, AM-, and nitrogen-fixer-associated trees and local environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, soil chemistry, and topography. In cool temperate and boreal forests, where wood and organic matter decay slowly, network-building EM fungi rule. About four in five trees in North America, Europe, and Asia associate with these fungi. By contrast, in the warmer tropics where wood and organic matter decay quickly, AM fungi dominate. These fungi form smaller webs and do less inter-tree swapping, meaning the tropical wood wide web is likely more localized. About 90% of all tree species associate with AM fungi. The findings could, for example, help researchers build better computer models to predict how much carbon forests will squirrel away and how much they will spew into the atmosphere as the climate warms. As the planet warms, about 10% of EMassociated trees could be replaced by AMassociated trees. Microbes in forests dominated by AM fungi churn through carbon-containing organic matter faster, so they could liberate lots of heattrapping carbon dioxide quickly, potentially accelerating a climate change process that is already happening at a frightening pace\".",

We then listed these soils on a table (Appendix 1), associating each of them with the most likely humus system. A quick and punctual search of sample sites has proven these realities but has not allowed to recognize the most precise mesh of the humus forms. It would have required a more accurate sampling that could possibly be carried out during the research proposed in chapter 4.2., To better define the degradation times related to each humus system.",

The blowdown areas need to be assessed or classified according to their specific site condition and situation in the landscape (a concerted effort should be started to retrieve old records of local natural forest vegetation). In a second time, differentiated site and landscape adequate reactions (soil potentiality in the context of sites and differentiated priorities) should be planned (Susmel 1980; Giannini and Susmel 2006) . 6. Many years (from 57 to 106 years) are needed to achieve an advanced decay for fir and spruce logs, while leaves, needles and small branches will provide an important input of organic matter at the soil surface in the short time 7. Lack of a forest cover will enhance nutrient losses because of lack of biological recycling of element (Jastrow et al. 2007; Smolander et al. 2008; Falsone et al. 2012; Strukelj et al. 2013; Xu and Chen 2016; Magn\u00fasson et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2018) . 8.

Others papers link the litter biodegradation to groups of soil microorganisms (Cleveland et al. 2014 ). Few works link biodegradation time to humus systems (Zanella et al. 2018 ) and none to soil type. We know that: a) there is a negative correlation between lignin content and tree wood formation (Novaes et al. 2010) ; b) in different tree species the lignin content varies from 15 to 40% (Sarkanen and Ludwig 1971) ; c) in each species the content varies by only a few units (26% +/-2% in Picea abies (Raiskila 2008) .

After more than 100 years, the wood incorporated in the upper part of the soil was estimated at 15 or 30% of the initial volume. Even in the soil, these pockets of dead wood of more than 100 years show contents in N and P lower than the surrounding humus. Naesset (1999) states that the degree of contact with humus is one of the factors favoring the decomposition of wood. In particular, the author speaks of moisture rising from the ground (\"Crosssection diameter, ground contact, soil moisture, and aspect were all found to have significant impacts on the decomposition rate constant. For different combinations of these characteristics the decomposition rate constant ranged from a minimum of 0.0165 per year to a maximum of 0.0488 per year\"). This could mean that in a Mull (richer in organo-mineral aggregates and thus in water), the rise of moisture could be favored compared to a Moder.",

Culliney (2013) followed the decomposition of samples of wood included in different forms of humus and concluded the determining role of the macrofauna. This study shows that once integrated with humus, buried wood decomposes much faster in the mull than in the moder.

Diminished nitrogen uptake by plants and/or increased mineralization rates could be the driving process that explain nitrogen losses by leaching after forest disturbance (Vitousek et al. 1979; Ranger et al. 2007) . Changes in the soil climate of forest gaps due to decreased transpiration and increased sun exposure (Kreutzweiser et al. 2008 ) favor organic matter decomposition and nitrate formation after nitrification. Nitrate concentration in soil water has been found to reach a maximum a few years after the storm, up to 15 years depending on the study case. Indeed, the impact of windthrow on nitrate leaching is modulated by important factors such as the level of nitrogen deposition (Akselsson et al. 2004) , the extent of ground vegetation cover (Legout et al. 2009; Hellsten et al. 2015) and the magnitude of the area affected by windthrow.",

High inorganic nitrogen concentrations in soil solutions were found in sites with high N deposition loads , where a regular N flux out of the rooting zone can represent a risk of groundand freshwater pollution. Increased nutrient availability could also affect tree carbon partition patterns, with a shift of carbon allocation from roots to aboveground woody biomass (Janssens and Luyssaert 2009 ).

After VAIA, the prices of timber had literally dropped (Ebner 2018; Talignani 2019), with the consequent disadvantage of using most of the fallen timber. As a consequence, according to scientists, there were problems related to the spread of insects and fungi harmful even to the living woods that remained standing. However, in a second time the fall in the price of timber attracted unexpectedly forest companies and foreign European and Chinese buyers, arising the timber price which doubled. Market could be very efficient to use resources. Figure 8 shows the dynamic of the standing timber price and the logs price in the Trento province.",

It is, therefore, more prudent to store only the wood that can be used for local activities and to rely on a global market for the rest.

To avoid empty export containers back to China, trading companies arrived in Europe would choose to transport logs back to China. Such logs are most likely used to produce medium grade furnishings sold in the country. Therefore, Chinese buyers were likely to buy logs and not standing timber whose prices remain low (Figure 8 ). The fact that the cost of wood rose to avoid returning to China with empty containers (and not for reasons of competition with European companies) left everyone stunned. The unforeseeable is... not predictable (which corresponds to a first direct feedback of this review).
