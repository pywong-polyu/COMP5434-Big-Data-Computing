The expected number of cases in consecutive days is obtained as follows: initially, each case i incurs in a random number of contacts X i , i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n(t) with susceptible individuals. Out of these, a random number result in a successful transmission encounter. If on average these individuals contact m susceptible individuals, and if p(t) is the probability that one such contact results in a successful transmission, then the average number of cases for the following day is n(t)mp(t). Recovery is included in the term p(t) (see below). A similar framework is used in epidemiology (28) yet here we refrain from adopting a Poisson or negative binomial distribution for any of these quantities. This level of generality has two consequences. First, a moments-based decomposition of the process' variance of the growth rate (Supplementary Material) given demographic, environmental and individual variabilities and any combination thereof is obtained with the added benefit of not being tied to particular scalings. Parametric models contain implicit relationships, such as variance scalings, and adopting any particular model has unforeseen consequences for the estimation of risk quantities(29,30). Our analysis complements previous formulations in both epidemiology and population dynamics", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Letting m = m/(1 \u2212 \u03b3) b \u2261 e a , a > 0 Eq. (2) is seen to be a discrete time Gompertz model. We call this model the Epidemic Gompertz (EG) model. Because the solution of the discrete Gompertz map matches the solution of the ODE Gompertz equation in continuous time(29) dN (t)/dt = \u03b8N (t)(log \u03ba \u2212 log N (t))), there is a one-to-one relation between our EG model and the ODE model parameters. In particular, c = 1 \u2212 b = e \u2212\u03b8 and a = b log \u03ba, where \u03ba is the equilibrium total number of infected and \u03b8 is the speed of equilibration. Note that c is a simple transformation of the speed of equilibration of the continuous time Gompertz equation. When c is 1, the process grows without bounds. In the epidemiological context, that means that b = 0 thus implying homogeneous mixing. The closer the value of c is to 1, the closer the epidemic model is to homogenous mixing and the closer the growth is to pure exponential growth initially (seeFig 1E forestimates for e a and c for Latin America). Conversely, the smaller the value of c (i.e., the higher the value of b), the stronger the degree of inhomogeneity. To characterize the role of poverty, we tested a statistical hierarchical model where the in-homogeneity parameter c in the EG model (Eq. 2) depends on urban poverty as reported by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin -America and the Caribbean (UN-ECLAC, see Supplementary Material) against a null Gompertz model where such inhomogeneity was unconstrained and not related to poverty. Specifically, the model postulates that each countries' inhomogeneity parameter is drawn from a random effect whose mean depicts a non-linear relationship between c = 1 \u2212 b and urban poverty. Lognormal sampling error is added in both the null and the alternative model. A likelihood ratio test for hierarchical models rejected the null model (p-value=0.036). The joint, multi-countries hierarchical model with poverty as a covariate was about 8.92 times more likely to explain the ensemble of time series data than a model without the poverty covariate as given by the likelihood ratio test. Higher urban poverty index yields on average (thick black line in", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "and Supplementary Material). Second, we showed how the VPM concept(18) can be used to build an accurate, Risk Prediction Monitoring (RPM) tool aimed at serially updating each day, the probability of recording an increase in the number of cases by any given, arbitrarily defined amount. The trend in these serially computed probabilities can be used as a reliable indicator of whether a country is on course to control the epidemic over short forecasting horizons.Environmental stochasticity vs. SEIR models To compare the SEG model with the SEIR models, for each country we fitted both deterministic and stochastic models from the beginning of the epidemic until April 26 th .
