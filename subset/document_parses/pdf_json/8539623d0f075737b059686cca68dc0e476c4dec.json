Due to the rapid rise of multidrug-resistant uropathogens in global circulation, new therapeutic approaches, including vaccines and immunotherapy, are urgently needed. However, the development of these therapies is impeded by an incomplete understanding of how memory develops during UTI. Here, we found that reducing bacteria load early in infection, by reducing the quantity of bacteria used for infection or with antibiotics, completely abrogated the protective memory response. As we observed that a mixed T helper cell polarization bias, comprised of Th1, Th2, and Th17 T cells, develops, we hypothesized that reducing antigen load likely altered T helper cell polarization. Surprisingly, T helper cell polarization was unchanged in these scenarios, however, we identified a population of tissue resident memory (TRM) T cells that was significantly reduced in the absence of sufficient antigen, supporting that this population is necessary for protection. To demonstrate that they are sufficient for memory against recurrent UTI, we depleted circulating and lymph node-resident T cells, and observed that mice were still protected against a second infection. Our findings uncover an unappreciated mechanism of immunity to UTI and key role for TRM cells in the memory response to bacterial infection in the bladder, providing a target for non-antibiotic-based immunotherapy and/or new vaccine strategies to improve the response to UTI.",

Women experience UTI at a significantly higher incidence than men; and children, the elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals are at even greater risk than the general population of developing complications such as chronic infection, pyelonephritis, and subsequent kidney damage from infection (Chromek and Brauner, 2007; De Nisco et al., 2019; Dielubanza and Schaeffer, 2011; Hoepelman et al., 1992; Mazor-Dray et al., 2009) . Approximately every second woman will have one UTI in her lifetime, with the highest risk between the ages of 16 and 35, when women are 35 times more likely than men to be infected (Foxman, 2002) . Additionally, nearly half of all infected women will experience recurrent UTI, defined by similar or identical symptoms, within 6 months of their first infection (Ikaheimo et al., 1996) . Although the incidence of infection is much lower in adult men (around 1%), in this population, UTI is always considered a complicated infection, with considerable risk of becoming a recurrent or chronic infection (Lipsky, 1989) . In addition, the prevalence of UTI increases substantially in older men, bringing with it increased morbidity and mortality in this aging population (Ruben et al., 1995) .",

Indeed, antibiotics only diminish acute bacterial burden, and currently, there is no treatment or therapy that protects against initial or recurrent UTI . Although experimental vaccination in humans and mice induces antibody production that reduces bacterial colonization, these attempts have not lead to a successful clinically available vaccine (Alteri et al., 2009; Billips et al., 2009; Klein and Hultgren, 2020; Langermann et al., 1997; Uehling et al., 1997; Uehling et al., 2001; Uehling et al., 1994; Uehling et al., 1991) . Recurrent UTI likely arises due to several factors, including development of reservoirs in the bladder and gut, or inadequate development of memory responses to a primary infection (Mora-Bau et al., 2015; Mysorekar and Hultgren, 2006; Spaulding et al., 2017) . As the associated costs of UTI, including treatment and lost productivity, amount to more than $3 billion in the US, with similar expenditures in Europe ), a better understanding of how immunity arises and how it can be targeted to improve the response to UTI would have a profoundly positive societal and economic impact, as well as improve the quality of life of those suffering from recurrent infection.",

            "text": "Notably, however, how adaptive immunity develops in response to bladder infection is still incompletely understood (Ingersoll and Albert, 2013; ). An early key observation, that mice infected with an ovalbumin-expressing UPEC strain have ovalbumin-specific antibodies in the serum and reduced bacterial burden following a second or challenge infection, demonstrated that protective memory can develop during UTI (Thumbikat et al., 2006) . Using isogenic UPEC strains expressing different antibiotic resistance genes, we demonstrated that acute bacterial burden in the bladder is reduced following challenge infection compared to a first UTI (Mora-Bau et al., 2015) . Bacterial burden is similar between primary and challenge infection in RAG2 -/mice, dendritic cell-depleted mice, and CD4 and CD8 T cell-depleted mice, supporting that the reduced bacterial burden observed after a challenge infection in wildtype mice is mediated by an adaptive immune or memory response (Mora-Bau et al., 2015) . Together, these data support that adaptive immunity to UPEC infection does arise, however whether T cells or antibodies are the key players in bacterial clearance is unclear. A more recent study suggested that a Th2-biased T cell response develops during UTI to promote bladder epithelial repair, at the expense of bacterial clearance (Wu et al., 2020) . While this is seemingly a potential explanation for why the memory response to UTI is nonsterilizing, this work fails to consider that while a type 2 biased immune response develops in female mice, Th2 polarization is absent in male mice (Zychlinsky Scharff et al., 2019) . Importantly, despite the absence of a Th2-bias in the T cell response, female and male mice exhibit the same degree of nonsterilizing protection against a challenge infection (Zychlinsky Scharff et al., 2019) . Additionally, the cytokine response to UTI suggests that a Th2 T cell bias is not the determinant factor in whether memory develops or how protective the response is to UTI (Mora-Bau et al., 2015; Zychlinsky Scharff et al., 2019) .",

Antigen persistence was necessary for immunity, as memory was abrogated after early antibiotic treatment or in the context of a smaller inoculum. Finally, we identified that a tissue resident population of T cells, TRM T cells, were sufficient to mediate the memory response, as mice were protected during a second infection even in the absence of circulating T cells.

Half of the mice from each group were sacrificed 24 hours post-infection (PI) to assess the bacterial burden in the bladder. Resolution was monitored in the remaining mice by urine sampling twice per week for 4 weeks, with the sustained absence of bacteria indicating a resolved infection. At 4 weeks PI, all resolved mice were challenged with 10 7 CFU of the isogenic UPEC strain not used in the primary infection, to model a recurrent UTI. The presence of different antibiotic resistance markers between the first and second infection allows us to distinguish bacteria that established dormant tissue reservoirs following primary infection from those causing acute infection following challenge. We sacrificed animals 24 hours post-challenge infection to assess bacterial CFU. As expected, bacterial burden was significantly reduced 24 hours post challenge (2\u00b0) compared to levels measured following primary infection (1\u00b0) in wildtype mice. Surprisingly, a comparable, statistically significant reduction in bacterial CFU was also observed in \u00b5MT -/mice following challenge infection compared to the primary UTI, suggesting that B cells are dispensable for protective memory to UTI ( Figure 1A) .",

We focused on CD4 T cells because CD4 T cell infiltration is greater than 100 times higher than CD8 T cell infiltration following infection of na\u00efve mice (Supplementary Figure 1) . Six-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed at day 1, 3, and 7 post primary and challenge UPEC infection. Using intracellular staining and flow cytometry, we determined T cell polarization using transcription factor and cytokine expression (T-bet + , IFNg: Th1; Gata-3 + , IL-4: Th2; RORgT + , IL-17: Th17). Compared to na\u00efve animals (day 0), total CD4 T cells increased approximately 10-fold in the bladder over time after primary infection (Figure 2A) . A similar increase was seen between mice 7 days after the challenge UTI compared to resolved mice before they were given a challenge infection (R), although the baseline in the resolved animals was significantly higher than in na\u00efve mice (Figure 2A) . Instead of a distinct polarization program, a mixed bias was clearly apparent among infiltrating CD4 T cells following primary and challenge UTI (Figure 2A) . Of the global CD4 T cell population expressing one of these three transcription factors, T-bet + Th1 T cells made up ~10-20% of cells, Gata-3 + Th2polarized T cells represented ~5-15% of cells, and RORgt + Th17 T cells made up ~3-30% of cells over time in the primary and challenge infections ( Figure 2B) . Strikingly, no T helper cell subset dominated the response, and indeed, only one mouse in all experiments performed had more than 50% Th2-biased T cells in a single timepoint. Furthermore, while the numbers of IFNg + Th1 T cells and IL-17 + Th17 T cells were significantly increased after primary infection, we detected no IL-4-expressing Th2-biased T cells, in line with our previous results that IL-4 levels are 10-100 times lower than any other cytokine measured (Zychlinsky Scharff et al., 2019) . These data support that a dominant Th2 bias does not develop during UTI ( Figure 2C ). In addition to Th1, Th2, and Th17 T cells, a large number of FoxP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) infiltrated the bladder after primary UTI, remained elevated compared to na\u00efve levels after challenge infection, and made up 10-30% of total CD4 T cells over time ( Figure 2D ). Interestingly, all CD4 Th cell subsets increased substantially during the first UTI and remained significantly elevated over na\u00efve levels in resolved mice, supporting that the bladder is imprinted for at least one month after a first UTI.",

A balanced Treg/Th T cell ratio is important to maintain immune tolerance, but also to have an efficient immune response against pathogens (Falivene et al., 2015; Yordanova et al., 2019) . A skewed ratio, in which Tregs are outnumbered by Th cell subsets is often observed in autoimmune diseases and leads to uncontrolled inflammation and tissue damage, whereas a higher ratio of Tregs to Th cell subsets is detrimental in cancer as the suppressive environment impedes tumor killing by cytotoxic T cells (Baras et al., 2016; Ji et al., 2012; Preston et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2009 ). Thus, we calculated the ratio of Tregs to all CD4 Th cells in the bladder and draining lymph nodes. In the bladder, we found that, globally, the ratio of Tregs to Th cells was under or near 1 for all timepoints measured ( Figure  3A) . However, the ratio far exceeded 1 in the lymph nodes during primary UTI and was near 1 during the second infection ( Figure 3B ). When we considered the ratio of Tregs to Th1, Th2, or Th17 T cells individually, we observed that generally it was at or below 1 in na\u00efve mice (Day 0) and mice infected for 24 hours, however, the ratios increased over 1 at day 3 and 7 post-primary infection, and remained near 1 during the second infection ( Figure 3C ). The Treg to each Th subset ratio was striking increased over 1 in the lymph nodes (medians ranging from 3.5 to 32) over time, however this was more pronounced during the primary infection compared to the second UTI ( Figure 3D ). Thus, Treg T cells are highly prevalent during UTI, and given their abundance in the lymph node, and later in the bladder, may act to suppress the development of memory T cells, particularly after a first infection. Antigen persistence determines the development of adaptive immunity during UTI Tregs outnumbered Th cell subsets in the bladder and lymph nodes, potentially inducing a suppressive or tolerant environment in response to UTI. As tolerance can be induced following suboptimal (too much or too little) antigen stimulation (Xiao and Link, 1997; Yoshida et al., 1997) , we hypothesized that abundant Treg infiltration reflected the antigen quantity provided by the initial bacterial inoculum. We reported that increasing the inoculum from 10 7 CFU/mouse to 10 8 or 10 9 CFU/mouse does not promote a stronger memory response to a second UTI, suggesting that our infection protocol, using a 10 7 CFU/mouse inoculum, likely provides sufficient antigen (Mora-Bau et al., 2015) . Thus, we tested whether decreasing the inoculum, to reduce antigen load would induce a more robust memory response. We intravesically infected female C57BL/6 mice with 10 7 , 10 5 , or 10 3 CFU of UPEC. One cohort of mice from each group was sacrificed 24 hours post-primary infection to assess bladder bacterial burden and a second cohort was monitored for resolution over 4 weeks. All resolved animals were challenged 28 days later with 10 7 CFU of the isogenic UPEC strain and we assessed CFU in the bladder 24 hours post-challenge infection. Mice infected with 10 5 or 10 3 CFU resolved their primary infection faster than those infected with 10 7 CFU ( Figure 4A) . Notably, compared to the control scenario using an inoculum of 10 7 CFU, mice infected with 10 5 or 10 3 CFU for the primary infection were no longer protected against a challenge infection, and had higher bladder-associated bacterial burdens after their second UTI compared to the control group ( Figure 4B) . Notably, mice infected with 10 3 CFU for their primary infection had markedly reduced primary bacterial burdens near or at the limit of detection of the assay and bacterial burdens closely resembling those seen after infection of na\u00efve mice after a challenge infection, supporting that this low-level exposure to UPEC could not induce immune memory to the bacteria.",

To create a scenario in which antigen load is the same, but antigen persistence is reduced, we infected mice with the same inoculum and treated then with antibiotics at specific days PI. The advantage of this approach is that antibiotics are the standard therapy to treat UTI, and thus, we would be modeling a clinical scenario. UPEC-infected female C57BL/6 mice were given trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic combination commonly prescribed for UTI, in the drinking water for 5 days starting at days 1, 2, 3, or 5 PI. All animals with sterile urine after 28 days were challenged with an isogenic UTI89 strain and bacterial burdens at 24 hours post-challenge infection were compared to bladder-associated CFU at 24 hours post-primary infection. We observed that when antibiotics were given at day 1 post-primary infection, the adaptive immune response was abrogated, whereas when treatment was delayed until day 2, 3, or 5 post-primary infection, bacterial burdens were significantly reduced in challenge infection, similar to that observed in the control no antibiotic treatment group ( Figure 4C) . Together, our findings support that antigen persistence is necessary for the development of memory in UTI. Additionally, they raise the question as to whether a previous UTI is actually a risk factor for recurrent infection (Hooton et al., 1996) , or that instead, it is early antibiotic treatment that may contribute to an individual's risk for future infections due to poor immunity.

            "text": "When antigen load was reduced, by decreasing the inoculum or giving antibiotics on day 1 PI, protection against a second infection was lost. We hypothesized this was due to a change in Th cell polarization proportions, impacting the memory response, as previously we reported that depletion of tissue resident macrophages, prior to a challenge infection, results in increased infiltration of type 1 effector cells, including Th1 T cells, and improved bacterial clearance (Lacerda Mariano 2020). To test this hypothesis, we infected mice with 10 7 or 10 3 CFU of UTI89 or we infected a second cohort with 10 7 CFU of UTI89 and treated half of these mice with antibiotics at day 1 PI. 28 days later, we challenged all resolved mice with 10 7 CFU of UTI89 and sacrificed them 24 hours post-challenge to assess CD4 T cell polarization. In mice infected with 10 3 CFU for their first UTI, we observed a significant reduction of Th1, Th2, and Th17 T cell subsets, as well as decreases in IFNg + Th1 T cells, IL-17 + Th17 T cells, and Tregs compared to the control group ( Figure 5A) . Refuting our hypothesis, however, there were no differences in the proportions of each Th cell subset between mice infected with 10 7 CFU or 10 3 CFU ( Figure 5B) . Indeed, all Th cell subsets and Tregs decreased similarly, and as such, the frequency of each subset and therefore, the global polarization bias was the same between the groups. When we considered Th cell polarization in antibiotic-treated mice, again we observed that the proportions of each Th cell subset were unchanged compared to the control condition ( Figure 5C ). In contrast, though, to the decreasing inoculum experiment in Figure 5A , we did not observe a reduction in the numbers of Th1, Th2, or Th17 T cell subsets; IFNg + Th1 T cells or IL-17 + Th17 T cells; or Tregs between groups of mice that were antibiotic-treated or not ( Figure 5D) . Analysis of the draining lymph nodes mirrored these findings, as we observed no differences among any of the experimental groups compared to the control conditions for any of the parameters measured (Supplementary Figure 2) . Notably, although both experimental groups had abrogated immune memory (Figure 4) , in one scenario, T cell infiltration was globally reduced (Figure 5A) , whereas in the second scenario, T cell infiltration was similar to the control group ( Figure 5D) . That there was no change in Th cell bias or, in the case of antibiotic treatment, a reduction in the number of Th cell subsets present suggests that the polarization and quantity of infiltrating T cells in response to UTI are not major determinants of whether memory will develop to UTI.",

            "text": "We were surprised to observe that despite comparable Th cell polarization patterns, and in the case of antibiotic treatment, the same number of infiltrating T cells, reducing the inoculum or using antibiotics early in infection abrogated immune memory to UPEC. To understand this unexpected result, we considered that immunological memory can be mediated through B cells (Akkaya et al., 2020) , circulating central memory (TCM) and effector memory T cells (TEM), or a subset of long-lived stationary T cells called tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) (Mueller et al., 2013) . Our prior work, as well as our findings in Figure 1 , ruled out a role for B cells, and demonstrated T cells are necessary for an adaptive response (Mora-Bau et al., 2015) . The memory response to UTI, mediated by T cells, is rapid as a 2-log reduction in bacterial burden is observed in the bladder as early as 24 hours post challenge infection Mora-Bau et al., 2015; Zychlinsky Scharff et al., 2017) . Given the speed of the response, we hypothesized that TRM cells mediate immune protection. Indeed, TRM cells are found in different mucosa including the lung, intestine, and vagina, and are anatomically positioned for immediate detection and response to pathogens to provide localized immunological memory and more rapid protection against pathogen re-infection compared to TCM or TEM cells (Gebhardt et al., 2009; Iijima and Iwasaki, 2014; Jiang et al., 2012; Perdomo et al., 2016; Romagnoli et al., 2017; Schenkel et al., 2013; Shin and Iwasaki, 2012; Teijaro et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "To formally demonstrate that TRM cells mediate protection against a second or recurrent UTI, we hypothesized that their elimination should abrogate immune memory. However, currently, there are no specific tools that target TRM cells without also impacting circulating T cell populations. As an alternative approach, we chose to eliminate all T cells subsets except TRM cells. TRM cells can be protected from depleting antibodies when the antibodies are administered using certain doses or schedules (Davies et al., 2017; Galvez-Cancino et al., 2018; Gebhardt et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2018) . We took advantage of this to create a scenario in which the only memory T cells present during a challenge infection would be the TRM cells in the bladder. Mice were infected with UPEC and a cohort of animals was sacrificed 24 hours PI infection. After resolution of infection, at day 28, mice received CD4 and CD8 depleting antibodies or their respective isotype controls. Mice were challenged 24 hours later with 10 7 CFU of UPEC. In T cell depleted but uninfected mice, we measured T cell depletion in the blood, draining lymph nodes, and bladder. CD3 T cells were significantly reduced in the circulation of antibody-treated mice compared to control isotype-treated animals, with the reduction coming from a near complete elimination of CD4, CD8 and DP T cells (Supplementary Figure 4A) . As expected, DN T cells were unchanged, as this population would not be targeted by anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies. Importantly, however, we also did not observe an increase in the DN T cell population, supporting that CD4, CD8, and DP T cells were truly eliminated from the blood and not just masked by CD4 and CD8 antibodies covering these epitopes. In bladder-draining lymph nodes of antibody-depleted mice, total CD4, CD8, and DP TCM and TEM cells, as well as CD4, CD8, and DP TRM cells were significantly reduced to nearly zero, indicating depleting antibodies do access the lymph nodes and these cells were not available to infiltrate the bladder to mediate protection (Supplementary Figure 4B, 4C) . Similar to the blood, the DN T cell subset did not decrease or increase, supporting that CD4, CD8, and DP T cell subsets were truly eliminated from the lymph nodes, as well. Importantly, analysis of the TRM populations in the bladder revealed that TRM cells were protected from antibody depletion and there was no reduction of CD4 TRM, CD8 TRM, or DP TRM cell subsets in the bladders of mice that received CD4 and CD8 depleting antibodies compared to mice that were treated with isotype controls (Figure 6C) . Thus, only TRM cells were present when we challenged these mice with a second UPEC infection.",

Remarkably, CD4 and CD8 antibody-treated mice were also protected from challenge infection, as shown by significantly reduced bacterial CFU in the bladder despite a near global T cell depletion, demonstrating that immune memory was intact in these animals ( Figure 6D ). In addition, the bacterial burden after challenge infection between the control and experimental groups was not significantly different. Thus, these results support that TRM cells, specifically in the bladder, rather than circulating memory T cells mediate protection against a second UTI.

Supporting that humoral responses are important, UPECspecific antibody production is observed in children with pyelonephritis (Jodal et al., 1974) and, many years ago, antibodies were proposed as a biomarker of human pyelonephritis (Percival et al., 1964) . Thus, it was surprising to rule out a role for B cells in our model of recurrent UTI. Notably, however, in a similar mouse UTI model, antibodies to UPEC arise only when bacteria colonize both the bladder and kidneys (Chan et al., 2013) . We used C57BL/6 mice in our studies, and given that this background has a very low incidence of vesicoureteral reflux and kidney colonization (Murawski et al., 2010) , and that antibodies are present specifically in cases of human pyelonephritis, our findings support that B cells are likely dispensable for memory to cystitis. This has potential consequences for future vaccines or other immunomodulatory strategies for recurrent UTI. Indeed, it may be that targeting the bladder to promote antibody production will not provide efficacious protection against cystitis, and may explain why vaccination strategies tested so far has not been successful.",

            "text": "Immune memory to UTI develops, but it is not sterilizing (Mora-Bau et al., 2015) . Inadequate or inefficient memory responses likely play a role in the frequency of recurrent UTI. Recently, a study showed that a type 2 immune biased response develops following UTI in mice, and this bias was proposed as a reason for why memory is not sterilizing (Wu et al., 2020) . While a Th2 biased response would be expected to favor tissue repair over strong cellular immunity, our data show that this is not the underlying mechanism of insufficient memory to UTI. Previously, we reported that female and male mice develop comparable memory responses after an initial UTI, although male mice do not develop a type 2-biased immune response (Zychlinsky Scharff et al., 2019) . In trying to understand this paradox, we found through global immunophenotyping that the immune response is not specifically biased towards any single Th subset, but rather that a mixed Th1, Th2, and Th17 response develops, with a robust infiltration of regulatory T cells. While this mixed response was not previously appreciated, it is not entirely surprising, as in the first 24 hours of infection, UPEC induces extensive tissue damage, including robust inflammation and urothelial cell exfoliation, and will be both intracellular and extracellular (Anderson et al., 2003; Ingersoll et al., 2008; Justice et al., 2004; Mora-Bau et al., 2015; Mulvey et al., 1998; Zychlinsky Scharff et al., 2019) , necessitating a Th2 response to mediate repair, regulatory T cells to control effector cell activation, Th1-polarized T cells to eliminate intracellular pathogens and a Th17 response to target mucosal and extracellular pathogens concomitantly (Gieseck et al., 2018; Kaiko et al., 2008; Shevyrev and Tereshchenko, 2019; Vignali et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2010) . Indeed, this mixed response reflects the complexity of the host-pathogen interaction and immune response to UTI, as well as the fine equilibrium that must be established between resolution of infection and maintenance of bladder integrity.",

            "text": "Adding to our understanding of memory to UTI, the quantity and persistence of bacteria is a key parameter in the development of an adaptive immune response, and a minimum exposure of greater than 24 hours is needed for the development of adaptive immunity after a primary UTI. While additional studies are necessary to determine the mechanisms underlying this result, it may be that the rapid availability of antibiotics to individuals with a UTI actually places them at risk for recurrent infections by impeding memory responses. Determining whether delaying antibiotic treatment improves the memory response is feasible and may ultimately decrease the incidence of recurrence. Treatments that ameliorate symptoms but do not eliminate bacteria themselves, followed by delayed antibiotic therapy in those not at risk for pyelonephritis, may be a better therapeutic approach for lasting memory. Supporting this idea, while nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) administered in place of antibiotics are not superior to antibiotic treatment (Gagyor et al., 2015; Kronenberg et al., 2017; Vik et al., 2018) , a meta-analysis of 962 patients comparing antibiotic treatment to placebo for uncomplicated cystitis did not find a difference in the development of pyelonephritis (Falagas et al., 2009) . This suggests that delaying antibiotics may not put individuals at greater risk for progression to pyelonephritis. Further supporting our alternative treatment proposal, NSAID-treated individuals had a significant reduction in the number of recurrent UTI in their first month post-treatment compared to those treated with antibiotics (Bleidorn et al., 2016) . Thus, it would be of great value to test whether briefly delaying antibiotic treatment promotes a better memory response and a reduction in recurrent UTI in humans, which would, in turn, reduce reliance on antibiotics for this infection.",

This phenotype is T cell-dependent, and macrophage depletion specifically before the second UTI leads to an increase in Th1-biased immune cell infiltration Mora-Bau et al., 2015) . Thus, when we observed that memory was negatively impacted by decreasing the inoculum or administering antibiotics, we expected a change in the T cell polarization bias. We were surprised to observe changes only in TRM cell populations, which suggests to us that resident macrophages directly influence bladder resident T cell development or maintenance, potentially as a mechanism to maintain bladder integrity. As in other tissues, bladder resident macrophages likely modulate the microenvironment, which shapes the local TRM cell response. For instance, lung resident macrophages limit the development of influenza-specific CD8 TRM cells (Goplen et al., 2019) . In Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection, type I IFN and IL-12 in the intestinal microenvironment is key for the differentiation and persistence of TRM cells and depletion of CCR2 + IL-12-producing cells, including macrophages or monocytes, impedes TRM cell differentiation (Bergsbaken et al., 2017) . Deciphering the mechanisms by which macrophages control local T cell responses in the bladder will be important to design efficacious immunomodulatory approaches.",

            "text": "The discovery of TRM cells localized in non-lymphoid tissues, which are anatomically well positioned to detect and respond to a second infection faster than TCM or TEM cells, has driven development of vaccine strategies to promote their differentiation. UTI needs new therapeutic approaches to combat the inevitable global spread of multidrug resistant bacteria. Vaccination strategies promoting the differentiation of bladder TRM cells would likely be of great benefit for patients suffering from recurrent UTI and would have a positive economic impact by reducing the cost of medical care. The failure of previous vaccine strategies for UTI may be because the correct vaccination strategy to promote the differentiation of TRM cells has not been identified. For example, a BCG mucosal vaccination better protects mice against tuberculosis compared to a subcutaneous vaccination, and adoptive transfer of TRM cells from vaccinated mice protects na\u00efve animals from disease (Perdomo et al., 2016) and a mucosal vaccine approach provides superior protection against coronavirus infections compared to a subcutaneous route (Zhao et al., 2016) . In addition to the route of vaccination, the type of vaccine used is also a key parameter. Indeed, an attenuated influenza vaccine promotes TRM cell generation in the lung, inducing long term protection, whereas an inactivated vaccine does not, despite intranasal delivery (Zens et al., 2016) . Intranasal immunization with Chlamydia trachomatis promotes uterine mucosa protection and oral or gastrointestinal vaccination with Chlamydia muridarum protects the genital tract from infection (Stary et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018) . These observations will likely inform vaccine strategies for UTI and suggest that the bladder mucosa does not need to be directly targeted.",

Samples were washed once with FACS buffer and Fc receptors blocked with anti-mouse CD16/CD32. Samples were stained with antibodies listed in Supplemental Table 1 against surface markers and fixed and permeabilized with 1X fixation and permeabilization buffer and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 40 to 50 min protected from light. After incubation, samples were washed two times with 1X permeabilization and wash buffer from the transcription factor buffer kit (BD Biosciences) and stained with antibodies against IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, IL-4, and the transcription factors ROR\u03b3T, Gata-3, T-bet, and FoxP3 (Supplemental Table 1 ), diluted in 1X permeabilization and wash buffer at 4\u00b0C for 40 to 50 min protected from light. Finally, samples were washed two times with 1X permeabilization and wash buffer and resuspended in FACS buffer. Total cell counts were determined by addition of counting beads to a known volume of sample after staining, just before cytometer acquisition.",

The graph depicts the number of infected mice over time and an increase in the number of infected mice is due to a spontaneous recurrent UTI. The graphs show bladder bacterial burdens following (B) primary infection with the indicated inocula and challenge infection with 10 7 CFU UPEC and (C) challenge infection in mice treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at day 1, 2, 3, or 5 post-primary infection.

In B, significance was determined by Kruskal-Wallis test comparing bacterial burden 24 hours post 1\u00b0 to 2\u00b0 within each inoculum group and in C, each 2\u00b0 group was compared to the 1\u00b0 CFU, with Dunn's post hoc test to correct for multiple comparisons performed and adjusted p-values for each comparison presented for both. p-values <0.05 are in red.",
