This process has different operational implications. First, the mitigation of the peaks of the emergency needs to be connected to improvements in the ability to respond to future epidemics and must strengthen the policy, technical and organizational aspects of health care systems (Gates, 2020; Parmet and Sinha, 2020) . Secondly, healthcare response needs to be integrated with lessons learned on disaster resilience strategies, including risk governance, humanitarian coordination and response by communities (Djalante et al., 2020) .",

Targeting the general population at a European-wide level (EU countries and UK), the study was meant to improve the framing of similarities in and differences between risk and emergency perceptions across the countries that experienced the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. I contrast to other studies that have focused on the acute phase of the first wave, our data collection was planned for a later stage. This allowed us to gauge perceptions related to recovery aspects and explore options for improvement. The questionnaire (see Appendix 1 for supplementary data) investigated aspects of general and individual perception of the emergency, crisis communication and management, and possible future developments. We benchmarked the answers to a Likert-Scale based model to identify \"performance gaps\" or \"capacity gaps\" that were reflecting undesirable states of resilience (Pescaroli et al., 2020) . We emphasized the link between social, psychological and organizational vulnerabilities driving cascading and interconnected risks associated with the pandemic . In particular, we explored how the progression of the pandemic could be challenged by access to healthcare services and other critical infrastructure, along with reliable information about complex scenarios and associated learning in society.",

Conversely, for most respondents the use of transport significantly decreased, together with the use of health services, hospitals, banking and financial services. The respondents were mostly worried about the direct consequence of the primary emergency, such as the shortage of economic recovery measures and the possible occurrence of a second wave. However, much lower concern was expressed about the disruption of essential services, the concurrence of events such as flooding, and the risk of intentional damage actions such as terrorist acts or riots.",

The data show that Covid-19 was perceived as an 'emergency' when it started spreading in Italy, more than through its association with the global or local scales. This 'tipping point' seems to stress the importance of reinforcing the supranational governance of a pandemic. It echoes the observation that non-conventional transboundary threats, such as pandemics and cyber-attacks, call for \"extreme adaptation and unprecedented cooperation\" (Ansell et al., 2010) to overcome limitations of existing country-level protocols and plans (Boin et al., 2020) .

These were expected but they demand further consideration (Jallow et al., 2020; Galbusera and Table 1 Selected survey response statistics (N: number of valid answers; M: mean; \u03c3 2 : variance; s: skewness). Giannopoulos, 2018). The emergency triggered some behavioural changes that may affect the healthcare system in the long term, for example regarding reticence in accessing healthcare structures or the rise of internet-based services (Barr and Podolsky, 2020; Mehrotra et al., 2021) . Moreover, the wider networked system of which the healthcare infrastructure is part must also be considered, in terms of both functional dependencies and their implications for society (Galbusera et al., 2020; Little, 2002) . Increasing resilience for complex scenarios may require better use of stress testing (Galbusera et al., 2014; Galbusera and Giannopoulos, 2019; , more awareness of supply chain vulnerabilities (Galbusera et al., 2021; Kov\u00e1cs and Falagara Sigala, 2021) and enhancement of public-private partnerships (World Economic Forum, 2021). There is a need to identify means of raising public awareness of scenarios involving concurrent events. In our data, public concerns were mostly centred on the primary impacts of Covid-19, such as those on health and the economy or on the possible occurrence of further waves. Other elements that could escalate the pressure on healthcare and response services, such as the concurrency of natural hazards or societal unrest, were not perceived as primary concerns, and low priority was attributed to the issue of fake information. In general, our responses confirmed the presence of discrepancies in communication across the countries, in particular that destined for vulnerable groups (Tagliacozzo et al., 2021) . This recalls how \"various aspects of social and cultural contexts influence the extent and speed of behaviour change\" (Van Bavel, 2020) .
