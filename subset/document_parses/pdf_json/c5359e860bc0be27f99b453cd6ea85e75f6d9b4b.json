Therefore, it is crucial that we understand how we can successfully alter our behavior and promote physical distancing. We present a framework to systematically assess the effectiveness of behavioral interventions to stimulate physical distancing. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of this framework in a large-scale natural experiment (N = 639) conducted during an art fair. In an experimental design, we varied interventions to evaluate the effect of face masks, walking directions, and immediate feedback on visitors' contacts. We represent visitors as nodes, and their contacts as links in a contact network. Subsequently, we used network modelling to test for differences in these contact networks. We find no evidence that face masks influence physical distancing, while unidirectional walking directions and buzzer feedback do positively impact physical distancing. This study offers a feasible way to optimize physical distancing interventions through scientific research. As such, the presented framework provides society with the means to directly evaluate interventions, so that policy can be based on evidence rather than conjecture.",

Whereas the effectiveness of policy measures to reduce mobility has been investigated (e.g., 5 ), the effects of more subtle behavioral interventions largely remain a matter of speculation and debate. One of the most striking examples of this debate concerns the behavioral effects of wearing face masks. Although early on in the pandemic extensive experimental research was conducted on the protective function of face masks (e.g., see 6 for a review), studies investigating the behavioral effect of wearing face masks on physical distancing remained scarce.",

Pre-processing and quality control of sensor data. The SDS output contained the reporting and opposing ID for each contact, the number of times they were within 1.5 m, and the time this contact was registered by the access point. Note that a single contact between two visitors is in this database twice, each visitor once as the 'reporting ID' and once as the 'opposing ID' . First, we separated the output into the different experimental conditions and kept records that were between the start and end of each experimental condition (see Table 1 for start and finish times). Second, for each reporting ID in a condition, we checked whether the sensor was handed out during that condition as registered at the handout station. In case we could not link a sensor to a visitor, we removed this contact from the output. These records could occur when an SDS was activated but not handed out, e.g., when the SDS automatically activated when removed from the charger. Third, as the SDS output only contains records of contacts and the reporting and opposing IDs, we had to add visitors to the output who made zero contacts. More details on the processing of the data can be found in the Data Descriptor paper by Tanis et al. 28 .",

The phenomenon that people adjust their behavior in response to the perceived risk is more generally known as the Peltzman effect 9 , which could explain such compensation behavior. In contrast, others argued that face masks remind people to implement safety behaviors, thereby increasing compliance with COVID-19 regulations (e.g. 10 ) . Notably, even after evidence on the medical effects of face masks had accumulated, the debate around the implementation persisted due to the uncertainty of the behavioral effects of face mask policies (e.g. 11 ). Over the last year some studies have investigated the effect of face masks on physical distancing. Using an experimental set-up it was shown that generally people keep more distance from a confederate when the confederate was wearing a face mask compared to wearing no mask [12] [13] [14] , although some evidence was also found for the reverse pattern 15 . In observational studies it was moreover shown that mandatory wearing of face masks is positively associated to physical distancing 10 . However, through observational studies it is difficult to disentangle these findings from other confounding factors, such as incidence rates and public health messaging. The current paper adds to the literature on the relation between wearing face masks and physical distancing behavior, specifically by experimentally investigating the effect of wearing a face mask, as opposed to the effect of seeing someone else wear a face mask, on physical distancing.",

At the same time COVID-19 challenges our behavior in ways that have not been anticipated or assessed in previous research, thereby questioning the relevance of existing and behavioral science literature to this novel crisis 2, 16 . This has spurred several investigations of how psychological factors can facilitate a better adherence to safety behaviors, such as the role of emotions 17, 18 , reasoning 19 , and the effect of public health messaging [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, it is important to note that most of these studies focus on self-reports and intentions rather than on actual behavior. Additional experiments are especially important as the external validity and generalizability of any one particular experiment is limited, requiring to build up an evidence base consisting of different experiments. The novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic thus warrant only one way forward: to assess the effect of behavioral interventions on physical distancing behavior experimentally.",

The methodology combines systematic variation of interventions in an experimental design with contact network assessment through wearable sensors. Analyzing experimentally induced changes in www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the contact network allows researchers to systematically track the effect of behavioral interventions and, as such, brings epidemiologically relevant human behavior within reach of the scientific method. Because it uses assessment of intervention effects at the level of behaviors that are known to affect virus transmission, the introduced methodology can be implemented to bridge the gap between behavioral science and epidemiology. Therefore, this type of research can directly inform policy concerning the mitigation of virus spread. The implementation of the proposed methodology in the current experimental design may have several policy implications. First, consistent with recent findings from observational research 26 , we observed no significant effects of wearing face masks on physical distancing. This suggests that risk compensation, also known as the Peltzman effect 9 , is not operative in the case of face masks. Interestingly, however, previous studies showed that seeing someone else wear a face mask does influence physical distancing behavior [12] [13] [14] [15] . Together, these findings also underscore the need to execute dedicated empirical research in different contexts to evaluate behavioral hypotheses, as it illustrates how prima facie plausible claims about human behavior may miss the mark 16 . At the same time, it is important to note that while the Peltzman effect may not play a role in mandatory wearing of face masks, it could very well have a profound effect on the course of the pandemic, e.g., through its effects on risk taking after vaccination 27 .",

We hypothesize that this benefit is counteracted by the fact that the movement patterns of other visitors are relatively unpredictable in a free movement scheme, so that distancing requires more effort and attention, and accidental collisions occur more frequently. The latter hypothesis could be investigated by subjecting movement patterns isolated from camera data 28 to quantitative pedestrian modelling 29 . In comparing different walking directions, we did not observe differential effects of uni-versus bidirectional schemes. Given the dynamics of viral transmission, unidirectional walking directions should be preferred because they mitigate the probability of people facing each other directly; however, in situations where a unidirectional scheme is not available, a bidirectional scheme appears to be a good alternative. The implementation of walking directions is feasible in almost all public spaces and the current study directly supports this policy.",

Specifically, effective use of sensors seems to depend on adequate instruction and immediate feedback. In the absence of this guidance, on the first day of our study, visitors tended to try out the sensors and as such inadvertently came within 1.5 m of another visitor. This may have obscured the positive effects of feedback on subsequent distancing. After the first day, we countered this effect through a quite elaborate instruction where visitors were invited to try out the sensor on a trial sensor that was not included in the data analysis. However, in many cases such an instruction would be impractical, as it would take time and may lead to queue formation. One last consideration is that wearing a sensor, even without active feedback, could make people aware that they are being measured, thereby influencing their behavior, also known as the mere-measurement effect 30 .",

Other more rewarding ways to organize feedback may be more engaging (e.g., using gamification by letting people win various awards if they keep their distance) and informative for the user (e.g., many people asked for feedback on how many contacts they made). Clearly, there is a great potential for learning theory (e.g., reinforcement learning) to inform this process 31 ; next to encouraging distancing upon receiving feedback, a feedback system could promote learning to distance effectively and automatically/efficiently.",

First, as we conducted the experiment in a naturalistic setting, we were not in a position to randomize the visitors to time slots. Since participants were not aware of the interventions that were implemented in each time slot, and as the exhibition in the art-fair was the same for all days, a priori differences between visitors are not expected; yet, in future research it is important to extend the design to experimental setups that utilize random assignment to bolster causal conclusions. Second, as we were unable to counterbalance all conditions, the design may yield some confounds; for example, based on the time of day a condition was measured. Third, as visitors could stay as long as they liked, some visitors were part of multiple conditions creating some dependency in the data. Fourth, as the experiment was conducted at an art fair, the visitors are not a random sample from the population and the results may not generalize to the general population or other settings. Similarly, the effectiveness of certain measures implemented at an art fair, may not readily translate to other contexts, such as for example a supermarket. At the same time, a naturalistic design has the advantage of high ecological validity. Ultimately, as different contexts draw different crowds and behavior is affected by one's environment, we should replicate the interventions across various contexts (e.g., in a supermarket, or at a football stadium) to determine which interventions work best in which contexts.",

Within days, we varied supplementary interventions: face masks, a buzzer that indicated if one came within 1.5 m of another visitor, no supplementary intervention. It is important to note that when the art fair took place in August 2020, wearing face masks was not obligatory in The Netherlands, and only very few people wore face masks at the time. Of course, if visitors wanted to wear a face mask they were allowed to at all times. While we planned to cross all levels, we deviated from this plan, see \"Practical and technological problems\".",

In this paper, we only use visitors' demographics such as age and gender, see Tanis et al. 28 for an elaborate description of both questionnaires. with an accuracy of up to ten centimeters. Every sensor has a unique ID and registers how often a violation has occurred with every other sensor. An access point and a computer application are used to manage the system and set settings. Every time a sensor is within reach of the access point, it communicates all distance violations to the access point after which it is written to a central database. A distance violation between two sensors is logged on both sensors and is therefore written to the database twice. The sensor is able to provide direct feedback to the user using a flashing light, a buzzing sensation or a beeping sound. In this research only the light and buzzer are used. To accommodate visitors from the same household, multiple sensors can be paired after which violations of the 1.5 m distance between these specific sensors are not logged to the database and no feedback is given.",

In case people showed up at the art fair without having bought their ticket in advance, they could purchase a ticket directly without completing the questionnaire, and they were only asked to provide informed consent. If someone declined to participate in our study, they immediately received this code, and participation in our study was thus not required to visit the art fair. There was a separate code that allowed people to receive a free ticket, but the rest of the procedure was the same. Visitors were allowed to enter the art fair during their selected time slot. Upon entering, it was explained that research was being carried out in the hall and a health check was conducted. At the Social Distance Sensor (SDS) handout station, visitors were asked whether they had signed the informed consent and completed the corresponding questionnaire. Visitors for whom this was not the case were asked whether they wanted to participate in the study and, if so, to sign the informed consent form. When visitors belonged to the same household, this was registered and the sensors were activated at the same time so that they would not report any incidents with each other. In the face mask condition, after handing out the sensors, face masks were handed out with the request to wear them until they were told that the masks could be removed. Visitors could then enter the art fair and stay inside for as long as they wanted, possibly taking part in multiple experimental conditions. On the way out, visitors handed in their sensors. In addition, they were asked to fill out a post questionnaire about their experience at the art fair.",

In addition, we did not actively demonstrate the buzzing feature to the visitors, which resulted in people trying out the feature inside the art fair. On day two and three, visitors were able to test out the buzzer before entering the art fair.

Detailed analysis of the probability of visitors forming contacts in these two conditions-taking the network structure of the data into account (see \"Methods\")-did not provide evidence for an effect of wearing face masks on distancing (OR = 1.05, 95% Credible Interval [0.81, 1.33]). These results indicate that, if there are differences in the number of contacts when wearing face masks compared to when not wearing them, these differences are likely to be small. In other words, face masks do not appear to facilitate or inhibit physical distancing.Walking direction conditions. We performed two comparisons. First, we evaluated the effect of unidirectional walking directions versus no walking directions by comparing the buzzer conditions on day two and three(condition 5 vs. 6). On day 2 with unidirectional walking directions, visitors had a median of 4 unique contacts (IQR = 1-11; range = 0-31), whereas on day 3 without walking directions, visitors had a median of 8 unique contacts (IQR = 5-15; range = 0-38). The probability of visitors forming contacts was substantially higher in the condition with no walking directions compared to the condition with unidirectional walking directions (OR = 1.66, 95% CI [1.25, 2.17]). Second, we evaluated the effect of bidirectional versus unidirectional walking directions, by comparing the no supplementary intervention conditions on days 1 and 2 respectively (condition 2 vs. 4). During bidirectional walking directions, visitors had a median of 7 unique contacts (IQR = 3-15; range = 0-42), whereas during unidirectional walking directions, visitors had a median of 8 unique contacts (IQR = 4-14; range = 0-48). The probability of visitors forming contacts was about the same in these two conditions (OR = 0.99, 95% CI [0.75, 1.26])",
