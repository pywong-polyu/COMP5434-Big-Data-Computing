            "text": "Purpose of Review The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a matter of great concern worldwide. After the first wave, several countries, notably in the European Union, are suffering a very rapid increase in the number of cases in the pandemic second wave. Health systems are under stress; hospital beds and ICU beds are increasingly occupied by COVID-19 patients, and hospitals are struggling to keep their normal operations. We review some basic epidemiological data of this new disease, regarding its appearance, reproductive rate, ways of transmission, number of cases, death rate, usefulness of diagnostic tests, basic treatment options, and prevention and control strategies, including vaccines. Recent Findings The basic control strategy falls into two well established categories: active attack (control) or organized defense (mitigation). The control strategy relies on classic testing, tracing, and tracking possible cases of COVID-19. Those actions draw from classical epidemiology: to actively find and detect cases, isolate if positive for 10 days and treat when needed. At the same time, the search for close contacts, test them when needed and quarantine and monitor for 10 to 14 days in order to break chains of transmission. The mitigation strategy include basic measures to protect people at increased risk of severe illness, like social distancing, wearing a mask when social distancing is not possible, avoiding crowds, avoiding indoor crowded spaces, increase ventilation indoors and washing or sanitizing hands often. They include also targeted restrictions in people's mobility, and lockdowns, widely used during the first wave in order to spare the health system, become overwhelmed and increasingly used in Europe once more in the current strong second wave. Summary Waiting for effective and safe vaccines and treatments, stopping the ongoing COVID-19 transmission is our only defense wall. We do not know yet which strategy or strategies worked best. We all must work as a team to give an adequate response to this pandemic. We have just one world and one health. Nobody will be safe until everybody is safe.",

Only 10 months ago, we were studying the situation in the city of Wuhan (China), where at the end of 2019 an increase in patients with a respiratory infection was registered. Few weeks later, a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 was identified and sequenced genetically [1] . It is related to other coronavirus that circulate in bats (including the SARS coronavirus). Its natural reservoir is probably this flying mammal. The intermediate host, which is probably another mammal, has not yet been fully identified. The point of contact with human beings could have been a huge live animal market in Wuhan, which was shut down early in the epidemic [2, 3] . It is likely that the initial cases of the disease went unnoticed for several weeks before 2020 begins in Wuhan, an 11 million inhabitants city.",

It seems therefore that the COVID-19 could be more easily transmitted than SARS. However, there is a need to exercise caution. The R 0 values indicate the transmission potential of an infectious disease. A higher R 0 does not mean a more widespread disease. Seasonal flu, for example, whose R 0 values range around 1.3 each year, infects millions of people worldwide. R 0 is also an average value: there are people who, although infected, will not transmit the disease to anyone, while others may transmit it to many more people. For COVID-19 it is believed that 80% of infected people do not transmit the disease to others, while the remaining 20% are the main transmitters. These individuals, sometimes called super-spreaders, were responsible of two unexpected events during the SARS epidemic in Toronto (Canada) and the MERS epidemic in Seoul (South Korea) where, from a super-spreader patient, dozens of patients, visitors, and healthcare workers from two hospitals were infected. Several superspreaders events have been recorded also for COVID-19 [5] .",

A popular saying states \"All the models are wrong, but some are useful.\" This can also apply other controversial data found in nearly all epidemics: the number of real cases and the number of deaths. Current statistics of the first wave probably reflect a bias towards the most severe cases, which are the most likely to have reached out to the health system. Numbers for mild cases and asymptomatic cases are likely to be lower than the real ones by an estimated factor of 8-10. In the current second wave, the detection capacity (RT-PCR and rapid antigenic tests) for suspected cases has increased significantly in most countries, and could explain to a certain extent the increase in case counts, although many patients may still be undiagnosed.",

There are several of the candidates advancing now into phase 3 trials to demonstrate effectiveness as well as confirm safety data in the real world, i.e., countries with a high rate of COVID-19 infections. It is likely that COVID-19 vaccines are able to stimulate both antibody and T cell responses. The key is to confirm that they can protect us against COVID-19. The length of natural or vaccine-induced immunity is not known nowadays. It is likely that it will be in the range of months to years, raising the potential need of repeated vaccinations, like with the flu vaccine. Several vaccines are currently under review by the FDA as well as the EMA, and they will probably be authorized by the end of 2020 or early 2021. There is hope that vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will be deployed to the entire world as soon as possible to control the pandemic. This will probably require a targeted approach in order to protect first the most vulnerable groups as well as the healthcare workforce. Collaborative efforts are underway to ensure that manufacturing can occur at the unprecedented scale and speed needed to vaccinate billions of people. Careful and transparent evaluation and ongoing post-marketing surveillance systems for assessing COVID-19 vaccines safety is required to address properly any concerns to counteract a growing rate of vaccine hesitancy that could endanger the efforts to control the pandemic [19\u2022] . Herd immunity level for COVID-19 will be around 60-70%. Therefore, a massive effort will be needed in order to achieve it, or getting as much as closer possible to it, in the shortest possible time. The effectiveness and the acceptance rate of the new vaccines, together with the level of natural immunity, will determine the time where we can achieve the herd immunity level needed to control the epidemic.",

The control strategy falls into two well recognized categories: active attack (control) or passive defense (mitigation). The control strategy relies on the testing, tracing, and tracking all possible cases of COVID-19. Again, those actions originate from classical epidemiology: to actively find and detect cases, test them, isolate if positive for 10 days and treat when needed. Then, start at the same time the search for close contacts, find them, test them when needed and quarantine and monitor for 10 to 14 days. Basic measures to mitigate the spread of the virus and to protect people at increased risk of severe illness are social distancing, wearing a mask when social distancing is not possible, avoiding crowds, avoiding indoor crowded spaces, increase ventilation indoors, and washing or sanitizing hands frequently. They include also targeted restrictions in people's mobility and lock-downs, widely used during the first wave in order to spare the health system to be overwhelmed and increasingly used in Europe again in the current strong second wave. Even when mitigation strategy is used, it is important to continue with the control strategy to optimize the detection of most, if not all, possible cases and the use of resources to deal with this threat [20] (Fig. 2) .",

It is necessary to work evenly, methodically, and with sound judgment, constantly evaluating the short, medium and longterm evolution of the pandemic in this changing and uncertain situation [21] .

We know better the disease, but the rate of infection increased very fast. Several countries like France, Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, and Spain are starting to use lock-downs again, although with milder restrictions when compared to the situation in March or April 2020. Bed occupancy and ICU bed occupancy are on the rise.
