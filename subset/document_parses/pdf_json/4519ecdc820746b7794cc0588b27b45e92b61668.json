Indeed, a COVID-19 vaccine capable of reducing any of these elements might contribute to disease control where there are no efficacious prophylactic medications and few treatments. 8 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggested that laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection are appropriate pri mary endpoints for vaccine efficacy studies, with an endpoint estimate of at least 50% for placebo-controlled efficacy trials. 6 However, protection against severe disease and death is difficult to assess in phase 3 clinical trials due to the unfeasibly large numbers of participants required. Instead, data to address this end point might be available only from large phase 4 trials or epidemiological studies done after widespread deploy ment of a vaccine. In this Review, we explore the challenges in assessing the efficacy of candi date SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and discuss the caveats needed to interpret reported efficacy endpoints.",

Often, outcome data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are presented as a proportional reduction in disease between participants who were vaccinated and control participants to calculate the reduction that is attributable to the vaccine. 9 Outcomes might include reduction in infection (ie, assessing sterilising immunity), severity of resultant clinical disease (ie, assessing disease-modifying immu nity), 9 or duration of infectivity. 10 Such RCTs represent best-case scenarios of vaccine efficacy under ide alised conditions in particular populations and pro vide key data necessary for vaccine licensure. How ever, vaccine efficacy does not always predict vaccine effec tivenessie, the protection attributable to a vaccine administered non-randomly under field conditions. 11 For example, the effectiveness of rotavirus vaccines in children in lowincome and middle-income settings was lower than the efficacy observed in children in high-income countries. 12 RCTs might not predict protection gained indirectly from herd protection (sometimes called herd immunity) following widespread vaccine deploy ment. Equally, RCTs Review done in a particular age group or geog raphical setting might not predict effective ness if the vaccine is more widely deployed. It is possible that alternative vaccine platforms or the addition of adjuvants are required for adequate immuno genicity in older age groups, as for influenza vaccines. 13 For this reason, pros pective studies of vaccine effective ness in real-world scenarios post licensure are routinely needed.",

The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals is heterogeneous and dependent on multiple variables, inclu ding age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities. 14 On an indivi dual level, the consequence of infection can range from paucisymptomatic states to hospital admission, require ment for respiratory support, and death. 14 Transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet fully understood but the ability of infected individuals to transmit infection when asymptomatic or in a pre symptomatic period means that infection control strategies that focus solely on preventing transmission from symptomatic indivi duals will be insufficient alone to interrupt the trans mission of SARS-CoV-2. 15 The effect of an efficacious vaccine on the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is complex and there are many potential scenarios after deployment. The ability of a vaccine to protect against severe disease and mortality is the most important efficacy endpoint, as hospital and critical-care admissions place the greatest burden on health-care systems. However, the beneficial effects of such a vaccine on a population can be observed only if the vaccine is efficacious in older adults (eg, approximately >60 years) and widespread distribution of the vaccine exists, including to people who are most susceptible to COVID-19. High coverage among these groups who are at high risk of severe COVID-19 would have the greatest effect against disease endpoints. Alternatively, vaccines that do not affect the clinical course, but reduce the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, could still be valuable interventions on a population level.",

For example, older participants could be more likely to avoid social gatherings or use of public transport, reducing their likelihood of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. However, health-care workers might not only be more likely to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but also might receive higher infecting doses than would other participants in the study. Alter natively, by virtue of their recognised highrisk occu pations, health-care wor kers might have better access to protective strategies, such as personal protective equipment, than other partici pants, reducing the likelihood of infection fol lowing exposure. These complex behavioural variables are diffi cult to control; therefore, it is important that participants are randomly assigned between vaccine and comparator groups, by use of a concealed method, to ensure reliable assessment of efficacy outcomes.",

            "text": "Efficacy studies should be adequately powered to meet efficacy endpoints, and multiple variables inform these calculations, including local transmission rates and participant characteristics. For example, the severity of COVID-19 and mortality rates vary according to age, sex, and ethnicity, with higher rates of hospital admissions, critical-care admissions, and death in older individuals, men, and individuals of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups. 14 For example, if a phase 3 efficacy study enrolled partici pants aged only 20-29 years, the expected low mortality rate in this population would require an unfeasibly large sample size to adequately power the study to assess mortality as an endpoint, and the study would be reliant on a high rate of transmission to meet other efficacy endpoints (table 1). Selection of older participants with high rates of mortality, for example Review people older than 80 years, could reduce this number (table 1) . However, given that older participants, especially people with comorbidities, are more likely to socially shield, they might be less likely to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and so a mortality efficacy endpoint might still not be met. Indeed, recruitment of older participants in vaccine trials has been historically challenging; 20, 21 Cochrane reviews of influenza vaccine studies listed 52 RCTs in healthy adults with participants predominately aged 16-65 years, but only eight RCTs in adults older than 65 years, 22,23 despite the higher burden of disease in older adults. Given that mortality from SARS-CoV-2 dispro portionately affects older adults, it is important that enrolment of older participants in COVID-19 vaccine trials is actively pursued via targeted engagement, minimising inconvenience to participants, and proactive sharing of study results. 24, 25 Dedicated trials will be needed to assess COVID-19 vaccines in individuals younger than 18 years as trial data in adults might not be predictive of vaccine safety and efficacy in this age group. However, since children are less affected by COVID-19 disease than are adults, substantial safety data should be collected from adults, and greater understanding should be acquired of the biology of paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infec tion, before paediatric vaccine studies are initiated. 26 Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies hugely, with hotspots and surges occurring in an unpredictable way. 1 This unpredictability has a considerable effect on study sample sizes for efficacy endpoints (table 1) , especially as infection rates are highly likely to change over the study follow-up period. For these reasons, ass essment of vaccine efficacy against mortality is non-viable in current phase 3 clinical trials. However, as the pandemic spreads internationally, and other vari ables, such as poverty and decreased access to hos pital care, contribute to high rates of severe disease in some populations, clinical trials in such settings could provide a measure of efficacy against severe disease with fewer participants than are suggested in table 1. Alternatively, pooling data from multiple trials that were not originally configured as a network of sites could mean that efficacy endpoints are met earlier, and conclusions about the efficacy of candi date vaccines are reached sooner. 27 The usefulness of pooling of data assumes that trial protocols can be sufficiently aligned and might come at the expense of a loss of statistical power if heterogeneity exists between trials. 28 Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy against mor tality cannot be measured directly in clinical trials, it can be deduced from other endpoints. For example, an RCT efficacy study of a live rotavirus vaccine, including more than 69 000 participants, mostly in high-income countries, showed 95% efficacy against severe disease in vaccinees (notably, this sample size was chosen for safety rather than efficacy endpoints). 29 Although this study and others did not provide direct data for vaccine efficacy against mortality, 30 this efficacy could be conjectured, and following a WHO recommendation for the widespread introduction of rotavirus vaccination, 31 substantial declines were noted in mortality from diarrhoeal illness. 32 Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is a less important clinical endpoint than is efficacy against mortality. However, if prevention of asymptomatic infection was a surrogate endpoint for efficacy against clinical disease or trans mission, this endpoint could allow earlier estimation of the clinically relevant efficacy of a vaccine by use of a decreased sample size. Such an approach is already used for the assessment of pneumococcal vaccines, where the ability of a vaccine to prevent colonisation with vaccine serotypes is increasingly used as a surrogate measure of efficacy of vaccines against pneumococcal disease. 33 As the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 decreases, the time required to meet efficacy endpoints increases. This delay Data are n. Calculations assume no clustering and that participants are randomly assigned to either a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or a comparator or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, with 80% power to detect 70% vaccine efficacy within 6 months of follow-up and with 5% significance, for various primary efficacy endpoints. Calculations assume that incidence is unchanged over the follow-up period, there is no difference in rates of infection on exposure according to age, and 60% of infected individuals become symptomatic. 17 Hospital admission rates related to age and infection fatality ratio are taken from Verity and colleagues. 18 Each scenario presumes participants aged only either 20-29 years or >80 years are enrolled in the vaccine efficacy trial.

When the incidence is low, data for vaccine efficacy against infection and mild disease can still be collected in outbreak situa tions. For example, a so-called ring vaccination study design can be used, which relies on tracing and vacci nating contacts, and contacts of contacts, of a confirmed case. Vaccination can be administered immediately or weeks later and can provide a rapid efficacy measure, if appropriately powered. 34 This study design was used to show the efficacy of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectored Ebola vaccine (ie, rVSV-ZEBOV) during the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Guinea in 2015, when no cases were confirmed among contacts vaccinated immediately com pared with 16 cases in the delayedvaccination group. 35 However, for this study design to provide a measure of the efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, robust diag nostic and contact-tracing pathways and rapid induce ment of protective immunity post vaccination would be needed. Given the respiratory route of trans mission and the short incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, it is unlikely that this study design would be a feasible means of assessing the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Claims exist that the rate of mutation and phylogenetic diversification of SARS-CoV-2 is slow. 36 This suggestion, combined with the selection of conserved antigens for most COVID-19 vaccine candidates, 4 means that vaccine efficacy detected against a particular circulating variant of SARS-CoV-2 in one region is likely to predict efficacy in other parts of the world. 37 However, to support this expectation, and because an efficacious vaccine can itself provide a selective pressure for SARS-CoV-2 mutation, serum samples from vaccinees in efficacy studies should be tested for neutralisation against a range of viral lineages. 38 Ongoing surveillance for viral escape from immunity induced by vaccines or mediated by antibodies will also be important.",

However, the sensitivity of quantitative RT-PCR, the current goldstandard assay for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, is imperfect and influenced by variables such as viral load, sample type, and timing (panel 1). 43 In clinical settings, a substantial proportion of patients continue to be managed as presumed patients with COVID-19 despite repeated negative quantitative RT-PCR tests, potentially reflecting limitations in diagnostic assays and growing understanding of the clinical presentation and course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RT-PCR assay specificity is an even more important consideration, especially if the incidence of infection is low and efficacy analysis is powered by a few cases. 46 An efficacious COVID-19 vaccine could reduce the severity of disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. To assess this potential, careful data collection is required to evaluate markers of severe disease. Numerous methods of scoring the severity of COVID-19 exist and Review few are validated (appendix p 1). Classical measures of disease severity, such as admission to hospital, requirement for respiratory support, or admission to intensive care, represent the clinical phenotypes that place the most burden on health-care systems and are important endpoints. 39 However, these phenotypes might represent only a proportion of those with disease. 40 It is unclear whether previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 provides protection against subsequent infection. Some studies to date have excluded participants who are seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. However, the US FDA recommends that participants in vaccine efficacy studies are not screened or excluded if they have a previous history or laboratory evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, as prevaccination screening is unlikely to occur in practice with deployment of a licensed COVID-19 vaccine. 6 Stratification analysis will, therefore, be important to establish the effect of pre-existing immunity on efficacy outputs.",

However, aero sol and faeco-oral routes of transmission might also take place. 56 Individuals are also known to transmit SARS-CoV-2 in the asymptomatic and presymptomatic period. 48 During convalescence, patients can shed viral RNA for many weeks, 57, 58 and even longer if immunosuppressed. 59 How ever, there is an unclear asso ciation between detectable RNA by quantitative RT-PCR and the ability to culture SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. 60 It is possible that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could reduce severity of disease but lead to prolonged shedding of infectious virus, which could have important consequences for public health if shedding resulted in increased transmission. Therefore, it might be important for inves tigators to consider not only the duration of RNA positivity in regularly collected samples but also whether these samples include replication-competent live virus. Nested quantitative RT-PCR targeting subgenomic RNA that encodes conserved structural proteins has been suggested as a measure of active SARS-CoV-2 replication. 60 As the trans cription of these RNAs is reliant on translation of the ORF1 gene within the host cell and the subsequent assembly of an RNAdependent RNA polymerase, the detection of subgenomic RNAs can help to identify replication-competent and therefore trans missible virus. 61 However, emerging evidence suggests that subgenomic RNAs might be more stable than previously purported and so could be detectable for a period beyond the disap pearance of actively rep licating virus. 62",

Seroconversion of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is a marker of exposure, but whether the presence of neutralising antibodies is sufficient to provide protection against subsequent infection or disease is unclear. 49 Moreover, if these antibodies are sufficient, we do not know the titre that would be needed for protection or the diverse range of innate immune effector functions that can be relied on for antibody action, such as antibody-dependent complement deposition and antibody-depen dent neutrophil phagocytosis. 65 Cellular immune responses have also been described in response to infection and are likely to be an important component of a protective adaptive immune response. 66 Indeed, individuals have been described who were seronegative and had T-cell responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 55 However, the parti cular cellular signature that is required for protection is unknown, and whether protective T cells can be mea sured in peri pheral blood samples is unclear.

Evidence of effectiveness against disease would be needed in post-licensure studies, however, this approach could markedly accelerate development of multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. This approach relies on collaboration and standardisation of in-vitro assays to allow meaningful comparison of immunological outputs from different laboratories. 68 In the absence of data for humans, animal studies can help to identify potential correlates of protection.

            "text": "Assessment of the efficacy of a vaccine is complex for many diseases but particularly so in the case of SARS-CoV-2, where the fundamental understanding of the pathogen is evolving. Multiple vaccines are being tested worldwide in early-phase studies and some vaccine candidates are already in phase 3 studies assessing efficacy. 4 It is probable that there will not be a single vaccine winner; diverse platforms and technologies can offer different strengths and be relevant in distinct epidemio logical contexts. Additionally, there will probably be ins ufficient supply, at least initially, of a single vaccine. However, collaboration and standardised approaches for assessing different efficacy endpoints will be important to allow meaningful comparison and ensure that the most effective candidates are deployed. Following deployment, well supported pharmacovigilance studies should be estab lished to ensure the ongoing evaluation of vaccine safety. Capacity to measure vaccine efficacy in field studies is reliant on ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which is rightly at odds with public health interventions. In the absence of a surrogate of protection, CHIM trials might provide the only means of rapidly assessing vaccine efficacy; however, the relationship between efficacy data from CHIM studies in young individuals and populationlevel protection is unclear. CHIM studies might help to identify a surrogate of protection. It is probable that any evidence for efficacy against severe disease and mortality in populations that are at risk will only be garnered post licensure via large epidemiological studies.",
