The author suggests that the discourse of lifelong learning constructs a relation of what Lauren Berlant terms \"cruel optimism\" for the marginalised majority of South Africans, sustaining a fantasy of liberatory education despite empirical evidence to the contrary. First, the prevalence of this discourse in key policy texts (predominantly education policy white papers) is examined, along with how both instrumentalist and humanist framings of lifelong learning promote and sustain this relation in spite of the ordinariness of the \"attrition of the subject\" (in Berlant's terms) as a defining experience of everyday life. Next, the ubiquitous frame of crisis in education analysis in South Africa is considered, along with techno-solutionism (a term coined by Evgeny Morozov in 2013) as a popular response amongst the dominant middle-class minority. The article suggests that cruel optimism is sustained for this middle-class group through techno-solutionist education utopias, as what Berlant terms a \"redefinitional strategy\" for manufacturing ahistorical moments of agency in the face of persistent structural issues centuries in the making. The lens of cruel optimism is thus offered as a mechanism for denaturalising the political work of both discourses, a necessary (albeit insufficient) move towards better grasping the nature of South African education concerns, as well as theories of change that might offer genuinely emancipatory learning for all.",

L'auteure avance que le discours de l'apprentissage tout au long de la vie construit une relation de ce que Lauren Berlant appelle \u00ab optimisme cruel \u00bb pour la majorit\u00e9 marginalis\u00e9e des Sud-Africains, qui entretient un fantasme d'\u00e9ducation lib\u00e9ratrice malgr\u00e9 les preuves empiriques du contraire. Elle explore dans un premier temps la pr\u00e9valence de ce discours dans les principaux textes directifs (principalement les livres blancs sur les politiques \u00e9ducatives), ainsi que la mani\u00e8re dont les encadrements instrumentalistes et humanistes de l'apprentissage tout au long de la vie favorisent et entretiennent cette relation, malgr\u00e9 la banalit\u00e9 de \u00ab l'usure du sujet \u00bb (expression de Berlant), qui est une exp\u00e9rience d\u00e9terminante du quotidien. Elle aborde ensuite le cadre de crise omnipr\u00e9sent dans l'analyse de l'\u00e9ducation en Afrique du Sud, ainsi que le techno-solutionnisme (terme cr\u00e9\u00e9 par Evgeny Morozov en 2013) en tant que r\u00e9ponse populaire parmi la minorit\u00e9 dominante de la classe moyenne. L'auteure signale que l'optimisme cruel est favoris\u00e9 au sein de ce groupe par les utopies \u00e9ducatives techno-solutionnistes, et par ce que Berlant appelle \u00ab strat\u00e9gie de red\u00e9finition \u00bb visant \u00e0 fabriquer des \u00e9l\u00e9ments ahistoriques d'agentivit\u00e9 face aux probl\u00e8mes structurels persistants dans les si\u00e8cles \u00e0 venir. L'optique de l'optimisme cruel est donc propos\u00e9e comme m\u00e9canisme cens\u00e9 d\u00e9naturaliser l'action politique des deux discours, mouvement n\u00e9cessaire (bien qu'insuffisant) pour mieux saisir la nature des pr\u00e9occupations \u00e9ducatives sud-africaines, ainsi que les th\u00e9ories du changement susceptibles d'apporter un apprentissage v\u00e9ritablement \u00e9mancipateur pour tous.",

I then argue that the contradictions that appear between humanist (social democratic) ideals and instrumentalist (human capital) framings are not antagonistic, but rather coconstructive of a relation of attachment to formal state-sanctioned education as a means to obtaining \"a better life\", and deploy Lauren Berlant's concept of \"cruel optimism\" (Berlant 2011) to suggest how this attachment is sustained in the face of empirical evidence to the contrary.",

Adopting the mantles of emancipation and efficiency simultaneously, technological foci in South African education (both as objects of study and modes of delivery) abound. I suggest that a discursive type of techno-solutionism (Morozov 2013) is present, and that this discourse works to sustain attachment to formal education as a vehicle for economic development and social cohesion. However, techno-solutionist utopias are only a remedy in the imaginaries of activists and middle-class analysts, who construct a sense of crisis where the vast majority of South Africans experience an interminable \"ordinariness\" in education's broken promises (Berlant 2011) . That is: techno-solutionism sustains investment in educational improvement, but only for the hegemonic minority wedded to the fantasy of middle-class education for all without radical shifts in political-economic arrangements at the macro level.",

While discussed at length elsewhere (cf. Lee and Friedrich 2011) , the former can be summarised as \"lifelong learning to constantly upgrade existing and accumulate new skills so as to stay relevant in a competitive, capitalist labour market\", while the latter might be summarised as \"lifelong learning to continue pursuing deeper understandings of human experience, both individually and collectively, towards ends that include social justice, joy, democratic participation and flourishing\". Rarely do education policy texts include only one of these ideals; nor are the contradictions between them explicitly explored by policies themselves (e.g. via radical framings of education practices which question whether flourishing and genuine democracy is possible under capitalist labour market conditions; see Vally and Motala 2014) . Rather, policy texts tend to present a bricolage of differing discourses (Ball 1993 (Ball , 2015 , offering empty/floating signifiers shared by both discourses (e.g. terms such as \"quality\" -see Biesta 2004 ) and allowing readers to project or assume their preferred interpretation.",

Incorporating both discourses (labour-market skills and democratic humanism) was a necessary strategic move both to address the lack of legitimacy of public (state) education created by the Nationalists and their system of Bantu education 3 (which was most keenly demonstrated by the 1976 student uprisings), and to break away from the tactical position taken up by anti-apartheid struggle activists of \"Liberation Before Education\".",

Such curriculum reprioritisation began before democracy; the first inklings were in the report on the Provision of education in the Republic of South Africa compiled by the De Lange Commission in 1981 which was shelved by the Nationalist government at the time, but shaped the discourses of those who entered into the negotiated settlement with the ANC ten years later (Jacklin 2018; personal correspondence; HSRC 1981) .
