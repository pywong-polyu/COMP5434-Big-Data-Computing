The pandemic has affected nearly 105 million people as of February 8, 2021, and the cases are still increasing at an alarming rate globally (World Health Organization., 2021 -Coronavirus disease pandemic 2021). The main reason for the outbreak is the ability of the virus to transmit from one individual to other through air. There is maximum possibility of transmission from one person to another or from one person to 1000 individuals or more, i.e., super-spreading by a super-spreader which makes this COVID-19 extremely deadly (Cave, 2020) . Adversity created by the COVID-19 pandemic is humongous and affects each and every aspect of life. The complexity of the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing and the main reason behind this is the current state of people worldwide, i.e., lack of specific immunity to fight against SARS-CoV-2 (Tian et al., 2020) .",

The reason for being prone to cancer can be both genetic and due to lifestyle. Almost every organ of the body is prone to cancer growth; however, there is difference between occurrences of organ specific cancers. As per Globocan 2018, around 18.1 million people were suffering from cancer and 9.5 million people died due to cancer (All Cancers, 2020; NIH National Cancer Institute, 2020) . Likewise, whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause cancer is not known yet, but cancer patients and cancer survivors are reported to have two to three times more chances of severe events, suffering, and death along with increased risk to get infected with COVID-19 (Tian et al., 2020) . So it is the need of the hour to study the various aspects of \"doubly unfortunate\" patient suffering from both COVID-19 and cancer. The present review discuses briefly the risk and molecular aspects of the link between cancer and COVID-19, impact on the diagnosis, treatment, and research along with special attention to the repurposing of anticancer drugs in the management of the deadly duo of COVID-19 and cancer.",

One study showed that nearly 2% of the total COVID-19 patients prior to May 2020 had cancer, and these statistics are very frightening (Desai et al., 2020) . Along with cancer patients being at high risk for COVID-19, there is an increase in the risk of severe conditions, i.e., use of intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive ventilation when compared to non-cancer COVID-19.

The possible cause of this high risk to cancer patients with COVID-19 is surely the immunocompromised state of the patient. 0.79% or 12 patients tested positive for COVID-19 out of 1524 cancer patients admitted in the Department of Radiotherapy and Medical Oncology, Zhonghan Hospital of Wuhan University. At the time of diagnosis, from a total of 1524 cancer patients, 41.7% of patients were undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy and immunosuppression was cited as a cause for increased risk of COVID-19 by the authors . A study conducted in France at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Centre from March 14 to April 15, 2020 reported that the COVID-19 infection rate in cancer patients was 2.1% when compared to the national rate of 0.25% (Barlesi et al., 2020) . As a part of their anti-cancer therapy, cancer patients are advised about the use of immunosuppressive agents as well as immune stimulatory agents respective to the cancer patient. The use of these immunosuppressive and immune stimulatory agents leads to an immunosuppressive state of the body in cancer patients (Kalathil and Thanavala, 2016; Tian et al., 2020) .",

Pediatric cancer patients had less susceptibility toward infection with SARS-CoV-2, contrasting to 14.7% infection rate in asymptomatic caregivers who suffered from COVID-19, only 2.5% of pediatric cancer patients suffered from COVID-19 (Albiges et al., 2020; Boulad et al., 2020) .",

The virus enters through air droplets and binds with the specific cells called Type 2 pneumocytes having angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) . Spike proteins present on the virus help in binding with the ACE2. After binding multiplication of the viral DNA takes place, thus there is an increase in the viral load in the body. The virus exits the cells through exocytosis, enters the blood stream, and spreads within the body. Simultaneously the host or body reacts to the entry of the virus by increasing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, along with the rise in macrophage and alveolar secretion and initiation of pyroptosis (M. Yang, 2020) . At this stage, symptoms such as fever and headache are experienced by the host. Thus, huge macrophage infiltration and cytokine infiltration affects the lung's capacity to perform its function, and the alveolar capacity is reduced due to the accumulation of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The symptoms experienced at this stage are difficulty in breathing, hypoxemia, and pneumonia. Further, due to the systemic spread of the virus, the risk of secondary infection is increased, which can be to the central nervous system, renal system, digestive system, and cardiac system. Terminally acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is experienced by the host which may be accompanied by multiple organ failure (Tay et al., 2020) .",

Of the previously identified \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 genera of coronaviruses, the novel SARS-CoV-2 belongs to \u03b2-CoV strain . There are 10 open reading frames (ORFs) in SARS-CoV-2, and viral RNA is translated into large polyproteins; these large polyproteins comprise two-thirds of the ORFs. In viral RNA, these large proteins are present in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and these are the places where both the transcription and replication of the virus occur. The remaining one-third of ORFs converts into four main structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and the membrane proteins (M) of the virus . The spike proteins (S) are responsible for the binding and entry of the virus in the host. As discussed above, after the entry of the virus into the host or human, three mechanisms occur to bind with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) receptors and further trigger in the replication of the virus in the host, followed by the initiation of a cytokine storm and hyperactivation of coagulopathy. The virus binds independently with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the ACE2 binding facilitates the uptake of virus by host cells and the TMPRSS2-binding-activated glycoproteins facilitate the entry of virus into host cells van Dam et al., 2020) .",

Cancer is a disease caused by exposure to carcinogens, factors such as smoking, exposure to radiation, UV rays, working environment, and heredity can increase the risk of cancer. Any part of the body can be mutated resulting in cancer. After mutation there is uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells leading to the formation of a tumor, the tumor is non-communicable. Systemic inflammation, loss of function of the respective organ or part of body, coagulation, and metabolic abnormalities are the primary effects of cancer. As cancer progresses to advanced stages, metastasis along with increased susceptibility to secondary infections is observed leading to multiple organ failure and ultimately death. On the right, COVID-19 progression is illustrated. The source of COVID-19, a viral infection, is SARS-CoV-2, risk factors include immune status, age, and direct contact with the virus or infected person. The virus enters through the respiratory system into the human body and gets entry into the lung cells, where the replication of the virus occurs. COVID-19 is highly communicable and leads to fever, headache, loss of smell and taste, along with systemic inflammation and difficulty in breathing. Secondary infection to other organs is observed if the infection is chronic leading to lung failure, coagulation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Multiple organ failure leading ultimately to death is observed in COVID-19.",

Cumulatively, all of these conditions lead to suppressed immunity in cancer patients.

TMPRSS2 is a binding site for SARS-CoV-2, and the bonding takes place with the formation of S protein cleavage at S1/S2 and the S2' site. Thus, the immune state of the patient is directly proportional to the severity of infection in patients suffering from COVID-19 (Tay et al., 2020; van Dam et al., 2020) . The transcription of TMPRSS2 in the lungs is altered by the modulation of androgen and androgen derivatives causing a reduction in androgen levels in prostate cancer patients, which directly affects the chances of COVID-19 infection and severity in patients (Montopoli et al., 2020) . Patients, particularly with prostate cancer, have higher expression of TMPRSS2 as compared to patients with renal, lung, colorectal, or pancreatic cancers, while other cancers have no significant expression of TMPRSS2. So, the risk of lung cancer patients having TMPRSS2 expression is moderate but it is higher in prostate cancer patients .",

These interleukin inhibitors are available in injection and pill form and can be administered as an infusion or by the oral route. These agents may have potential in COVID-19 and cancer management, as cytokine storms are common events observed in both the diseases. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor, is used to counter cytokine release syndrome aroused due to CAR-T anticancer therapy. In CRT therapy, immune cells are used as anticancer agents, and this causes cytokine storm release by the body (di Giacomo et al., 2020; di Lorenzo et al., 2020) . Sarilumab and Siltuximab are interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors implied for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Castleman disease, respectively, and can be used in the management of cancer patients with COVID-19.

These are especially used in lung cancer. Antiviral drug Tocilizumab is known to elevate cytochrome P450 (CYP) and isoenzyme CYP3A4 involved in the metabolism of the above mentioned drugs. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) (durvalumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab) activity is decreased as tocilizumab has the potential to suppress the immune response (Ying et al., 2015) . ICIs are used in the management of various cancers, such as lung, kidney, gastric cancer, and thyroid cancer. Drug interaction between immune checkpoint inhibitors and anakinra and ruxolitinib is not established but risk factors must be considered before administering respective drugs (di Lorenzo et al., 2020) . Cisplatin and vinca alkaloids are potent anticancer agents, and their interaction with colchicine and tocilizumab is not established yet (La Regina et al., 2019) .",

Many countries like United States, Brazil, France, Spain, United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, Mexico, India, and Indonesia, among others, are facing a second wave of COVID-19 as spikes in the number of cases are observed from September 2020 to January 2021 (Johns Hopkins Corona Resource Center, 2021 -New Cases of COVID-19 in World Countries). The current scenario is quite frightening for cancer patients, if patients come in contact with COVID-19 then managing the patient is a challenge for health care systems globally. As the severity of the disease increases, there is an increase in risk for providing symptomatic care to COVID-19 patients suffering from cancer. The impact on cancer diagnosis as well as treatment is worsening for the patient and even become unmanageable, leading to deaths of patients. The molecular mechanism is quite clear between cancers and COVID-19 where ACE2, cytokines, TMPRSS2, and coagulation are prominent. Joint efforts by the healthcare system and oncological societies are very crucial and will be very fruitful for the patient. Some anticancer drugs like cytokine inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and hormonal therapy can be repurposed for combating the deadly duo of COVID-19 and cancer. Considering few reports of drug interactions between anticancer and anti-viral treatment, anti-cancer drugs can be potential targets for treating the deadly duo of COVID-19 and cancer. Data available are quite scarce, so to confirm the repurposing of anticancer agents in COVID-19 will require more time.",
