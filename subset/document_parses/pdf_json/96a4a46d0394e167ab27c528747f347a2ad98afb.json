Some of the largest increases in food insecurity were among Asian respondents, the self-employed, respondents aged 35-44, and those living in Scotland, London, and the North West of England. At the individual level, losing employment was associated with a higher odds of food insecurity compared to those furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the persistently employed.

            "text": "Concerns about food supply have featured prominently in the United Kingdom's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 1 In March 2020, the media reported fights breaking out as people attempted to stock up on rapidly diminishing supplies. 2 Supermarket shelves emptied and food producers asked how they could continue to supply them without placing their workers at risk. The immediate panic resolved but soon gave way to concerns about the many families who, until then, had been just about coping. Austerity measures adopted since 2010 had left many living a precarious existence characterised by insecure employment, income, and in some cases food and shelter. 3 Many were dependent on the growing number of foodbanks 4 and, for those who qualified, free school meals for their children. As schools closed, many families found that they had to find additional food for their children, even though many were facing loss of income or employment. In 2019/20 over 1.4 million school children in England, around 15% of the total, received free school meals. 5 While the rules of entitlement vary among the four nations of the United Kingdom, those whose families are receiving certain benefits are likely to be eligible. One recent study estimated that half of free school meal eligible children could not access the scheme in April 2020. 6 Food insecurity has become highly politically contentious in the UK. When schools closed in March 2020, a prominent football player, Marcus Rashford, whose family had depended on foodbanks when he was a child, established a charity to deliver food packages to children who were no longer getting school meals. The four governments in the United Kingdom subsequently established schemes to support these children, with varying degrees of success, but the United Kingdom government, which is responsible for education policy in England, rejected continuing its scheme over the summer. In June, Rashford wrote an open letter to the government 7 and, a day later, the government reversed its decision. However, as of October, England declined to continue its scheme during school holidays, unlike in the other three countries. An opposition Bill calling for it to be reinstated was defeated, although this provoked a split in the Conservative parliamentary party, with some Members of Parliament voting with the opposition 8 while others made a series of widely criticized comments blaming parents and suggesting that some food parcels were being diverted to pay for illegal drugs. 9 Over 2,000 British paediatricians wrote an open letter calling on the UK government to match the policies in the other three nations 10 and a petition to \"End child food poverty\", set up by Rashford, has attracted almost 1 million signatures. 11 Yet while the debate about food insecurity has become extremely acrimonious, it has not always been underpinned by data and most of the times the data used belong to very selective groups such as food bank organizations.",

In April, food insecurity was, as expected, higher among those in the lowest quintile of household income (Figure 1 ), although the gradient diminished in the fully adjusted model and no statistically significant differences can be found among the highest four quintiles. By July, the probability of experiencing food insecurity had increased by more than twofold for all quintiles, with gradients in the adjusted and unadjusted model similar to those in April. Looked at by employment status, again, as expected, insecurity was greatest among the unemployed, and very low for those in any form of employment ( Figure 2) . Again, by July, this had increased markedly for all groups, but especially for the unemployed.",

Finally, Our study is consistent with recent findings from the USA, finding that food insufficiency among all adults increased three-fold during the COVID pandemic compared to 2019, with African-Americans hardest hit. 18 As with all analyses of survey data, our study has several limitations. First, our analysis does not provide a causal explanation of the impact of COVID on food insecurity, just an association. Second, the Understanding Society COVID wave was only able to link data to 40% of respondents from wave 8 or 9 of the Understanding Society study. This does not affect internal validity, but complicates assessing representativeness of the UK population. To address this, sampling weights were employed. Further we tested whether those respondents with missing values for food insecurity in both April and July differed from those who did not by all study variables. Table A1 in the appendix presents a logistic regression model predicting missingness on food insecurity in both April and July. Here, we find that the self-employed in July are less likely to be missing relative to the employed, those aged 55-64 are less likely to be missing relative to the 16-24 age group, while those with multiple children are more likely to be missing compared to those with no children. We also detect some regional variations, with those in Scotland, Wales, and the North East of England more likely to be missing compared to those residing in London.",

Food price annual inflation, which had been negative prior to the Brexit referendum but increased rapidly thereafter, has remained at between 1% and 2% between March and July 2020. 20 The Bank of England's biannual NMG survey, conducted between 6 th April and 1 st May, found that while many people experienced reductions in income, even more reduced spending. 21 Among those employed, 18% experienced a reduction in income but 53% reduced spending. The corresponding figures for those who were self-employed, who were especially severely hit, were 66% and 72%, similar to the figures for those furloughed, at 67% and 66% respectively.

Factors contributing to increased risk and vulnerability included an inability to build or draw on financial safety nets, the lack of reliable full-time salaries, working in sectors that did not permit remote working, caring responsibilities that limited alternative sources of income, health, and particularly mental health challenges, and domestic abuse. Restrictions associated with the pandemic contributed to food insecurity in several ways. These included the loss of the inability to join family members for particular meals, such as Sunday lunches, that had previously helped them to stretch their budgets, an inability to afford supermarket delivery fees, reduced access to low-cost shops, competition for low-cost \"value\" brands that were especially likely to be stockpiled, price increases in shops serving deprived areas, and relying on others to help with their shopping, where a feeling of shame prevented them from asking for the cheapest brands to be purchased. The result was that those interviewed reported relying on food of poor nutritional quality, especially from tins or simple carbohydrates, skipping meals, and compromising on food safety by using out of date products. They also reported emotional problems, linked to the loss of family mealtimes. There was considerable awareness of food banks and food box schemes, but low uptake due to the associated stigma. Statutory welfare provisions, including both pre-existing ones, such as Universal Credit, and those introduced as part of the COVID response were reported as often being difficult to access.",

This is not a problem limited to those on the margins of society. Third, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in practical terms, access to affordable food has declined reduced. All age groups, including those of pensionable age whose incomes have largely been unaffected, have experienced increased food insecurity. Steps are needed to provide subsidies or food support, especially since during the pandemic emergency food assistance may not be readily accessible.
