The association of common colds with asthma episodes is certainly an old one. 4 However, until recently, we lacked sensitive methodologies for the detection of the most prevalent respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses (RVs) or coronaviruses, 5 making it difficult to evaluate their importance. With the advent of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), it was shown that the majority of asthma exacerbations follow virologically confirmed upper respiratory tract infections, 60% of which are due to RVs. 6, 7 This implies that the understanding of RV-induced asthma mechanisms could offer important evidence on the pathogenesis of the disease, as well as novel therapeutic targets. The initial epidemiological studies have now been confirmed in several instances; the percentage of virus-related wheeze in children is usually over 80%, 8 while in adults, this proportion is more varied (between 45% and 80% of cases). 9, 10 The conclusion of the epidemiological studies was that RVs are not only responsible for the majority of common colds, but also for at least half of the acute asthma exacerbations in the community.",

            "text": "Crucial to our understanding of RV-associated asthma exacerbations has been the debate over whether such exacerbations are a result of direct infection of the lower airway epithelium by RVs, or of indirect mechanisms due to PAEDIATRIC RESPIRATORY REVIEWS (2004) Summary Several epidemiological studies using sensitive detection methodologies have confirmed that the majority of acute asthma exacerbations follow upper respiratory tract infections -common colds. Most of these colds are due to human rhinoviruses (RVs). RVs are able to reach and replicate in epithelial cells of the lower airways and can activate these cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators. Under some circumstances, RVs can also become cytotoxic to the epithelium. Atopic asthmatic individuals produce less interferon-g and more interleukin-10 than normal subjects in response to RV infection. Symptom severity as well as viral shedding after experimental RV infection, is inversely correlated with 'atopic' status, expressed as the interferon-g to interleukin-5 ratio. Expression of co-stimulatory molecules on immune cells is also affected in atopic asthmatics, suggesting an aberrant immune response to RV that may lead to suboptimal viral clearance and viral persistence. Some of the above effects can be reversed in vitro by corticosteroids, second-generation antihistamines or anti-oxidants; however, the optimal strategy for treating acute asthma exacerbations requires further research at both mechanistic and clinical levels. \u00df 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most frequently quoted arguments against such a possibility has been the temperature restriction for replication of these viruses at an optimum of 33 8C, the temperature of the nasal cavities. 14 Nevertheless, this dogma was based on a small number of studies that only used one RV serotype. 15 Therefore, we cultured different RV serotypes at both 33 8C and 37 8C and compared their replicative capacity using titration assays. 16 Although 33 8C was preferable for several but not all serotypes, differences were small and virus titres achieved at 37 8C were high. Furthermore, when wild-type RV isolates were compared; less than half replicated better at 33 8C than 37 8C, while one isolate preferred 37 8C. 16 Consequently, it was concluded that there are no temperature restrictions for RV replication in the lower airways.",

The peak of viral replication was between 24 h and 48 h, followed by a slow, gradual decline. Live virus remained in the bronchial epithelial cells for as long as 8 days after exposure. Using immunoprecipitation of radiolabelled newly synthesised proteins with specific antibodies, it was shown that newly synthesised RV proteins VP1 and VP3 were present at 48 h after exposure. Infection kinetics were very similar to those reported for nasal and tracheal epithelium, 19, 20 suggesting that the whole respiratory tree is equally susceptible to RV. These results are almost identical to findings from another group 21 and have also been reproduced in murine epithelial cells using either a minor subtype RV whose receptor is present on these cells, or a major subtype in cells transfected with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), the receptor for the major subgroup RVs. 22 ",

These observations are in contrast to previous data showing a lack of RV cytopathic effect in several epithelial cell models, 19 suggesting that specific conditions should apply for RV to become cytotoxic. Previous studies have shown that in-vivo RV infection produces little or no histological alterations, with a patchy distribution in the respiratory epithelium. 23 This was also the case in a recent study by Mosser et al. 24 that investigated RV infection of adenoidal tissue; this study found that a small proportion of cells were infected with negligible epithelial cytotoxicity. However, it can be speculated that an already disrupted epithelium, as in the case of asthma, 25 may be more susceptible to RVinduced cytotoxicity. For this reason, we assessed RVassociated cytotoxicity in BEAS-2B cells seeded at varying densities and using a panel of different RVs. Cytotoxicity varied with serotype but was also dependent upon cell density in an almost linear way up to confluence. 26 Studies to characterise this phenomenon further are underway.",

It was shown that 50% of bronchial biopsies from infected volunteers contained RV RNA after an experimentally induced cold, mostly in the epithelial layer. These samples were positive with both genomic and replicative strand probes and hybridisation signals co-localised, indicating that RVs not only reach and enter the bronchial epithelium after upper airway infection but also replicate in it. The percentage of positivity was identical to that reported in studies using the same technique in nasal epithelium where RV presence is not disputed, 28, 29 indicating that RV bronchial infection may be the norm rather than the exception after common colds. Similarity between RV infection rates in upper and lower epithelium was recently confirmed ex vivo. 24 It remains to be confirmed whether bronchial RV infection also takes place after natural colds; the actual proportion of upper airway infections that are followed by bronchial spread of the virus also needs to be assessed.",

To determine whether RV bronchial infection can result in local inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines resulting from natural infection, experimental infection or in vitro have been measured in different settings. 30, 31 Primary cells infected with RV express mRNA for and produce IL-6, IL-8, RANTES and IL-16. 18, 32 In BEAS-2B cells, the eosinophil-specific chemo-attractants eotaxin and eotaxin-2 are also inducible. 33 In the upper airways, eotaxin has been found to be elevated during experimental colds in subjects with allergic rhinitis. 34 This is in agreement with results from subjects with naturally acquired colds that show a prolonged eosinophilic influx in the nasal mucosa, persisting into convalescence in allergic subjects. 35 IL-6 and IL-8, which are central mediators of inflammation and neutrophil recruitment, respectively, have also been found after RV infection of the upper respiratory epithelium and/or nasal secretions. Interestingly, high IL-8 levels in nasal fluids and increased allergeninduced plasma exudation responses observed in allergic subjects before RV16 inoculation protected against the development of cold symptoms. 34 The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1b is produced in increased levels in the nasal secretions of experimentally infected volunteers, 36 whereas elevated nasal granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and IL-8 levels correlate with neutrophilia in blood and nasal secretions following RV16 challenge of subjects with allergic rhinitis or asthma 37 or children with viralprecipitated asthma. 30 RANTES, a potent eosinophil and neutrophil chemo-attractant, seems to be a key component of RV-mediated inflammation in in-vitro and in-vivo studies. 21 RVs can also stimulate production of angiogenic growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 from bronchial epithelial cells, 38 which may act on underlying stromal cells to induce tissue remodelling.",

            "text": "A hallmark in the pathophysiology of asthma is the imbalance between two types of polarised immune responses, initially demonstrated for T-helper cells and subsequently shown to involve cytotoxic T cells and probably dendritic cells as well. 12 IFN-g is the central cytokine in type 1 responses, while type 2 responses are characterised by IL-4 and IL-5; an increasing array of cytokines and chemokines are known to take part in or influence this balance. While asthma is paradigmally a type 2 cytokine-related disease, most evidence suggests that antiviral immune responses are usually dominated by type 1 cytokines. In order to model the possible effects of RV infection in atopic asthma, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from normal and atopic asthmatic subjects, exposed them to RV and assessed type 1 and type 2 cytokine production. When PBMCs were exposed to RV, time-and dose-dependent increases of IFN-g, IL-12 and IL-10 were observed. 46 IFN-g and IL-12 concentrations were significantly higher in cells from normal individuals, while IL-10 predominated in cultures from atopic asthmatic subjects. Furthermore, IL-4 was induced in cultures from asthmatic subjects only, while induction of IL-13 was found in both normal and atopic asthmatic subjects. These data suggest that following bronchial epithelial infection by RV and the concomitant inflammatory response described above, the systemic immune response that is known to occur in vivo during and after a common cold 47 is probably defective in atopic asthmatic individuals. Decreased levels of type 1 cytokines and increased levels of type 2 cytokines, expressed as more than a three-fold difference in the ratio of IFN-g/IL-4 between normal and atopic individuals in our experiments, support the notion of a suboptimal antiviral response that may be further enhanced in an already type 2 environment, as occurs in asthma. These data are in agreement with recent evidence from Parry et al. 48 showing an inverse correlation of IFN-g production by PBMCs before an experimentally induced infection with RV shedding after the infection. Another study demonstrated an inverse correlation of RV persistence and symptom score after experimental infection with the ratio of IFN-g/IL-5 levels in nasal secretions. 37 Even more interesting is further evidence from the same group showing an inverse correlation between PBMC IFN-g responses and virus-induced airway hyper-reactivity in patients with asthma. 49 ",

When PBMCs were exposed to RV in vitro and phenotyped by flow cytometry, several alterations were observed. 50 Not surprisingly, cells were activated, as indicated by increased CD25 expression, in agreement with previous reports. 51 While there were no changes in the numbers of T cells (CD3, CD4 or CD8 positive) or B cells in these cultures, the number of CD14\u00fe monocytes was reduced after RV infection. This was more pronounced in cells from normal subjects compared with asthmatic subjects. Furthermore, B7-1 (CD80) was induced on monocytes and B7-2 (CD86) on B cells; this upregulation was less marked in the asthmatic population. Finally, CTLA-4, considered a negative regulator of the CD28/B7 co-stimulatory system, was upregulated on T cells of the asthmatic patients alone. These data confirm the ability of RV to activate the antigen presentation system, as has also been shown in respiratory epithelial cells. 43 They also indicate that this process is defective in atopic asthmatic subjects. Such a defect in antigen presentation may partly explain the delayed viral clearance and increased symptomatology observed in the experimental infection studies. 37, 48 ",

RVs are the most common respiratory pathogens and are responsible for the majority of asthma exacerbations in childhood. Therapeutic strategies aimed at these viruses and/or their inflammatory consequences have the potential for greatly alleviating the morbidity and cost of asthma. Several questions are still to be answered in order to design any effective therapies. Nevertheless, the pieces of the puzzle seem to be getting closer together. We now know that bronchial infection frequently develops subsequent to a common cold. Such an infection is able to induce an epithelial inflammatory response that can, among others, lead to bronchial cellular infiltration, demonstrated after experimental RV infections. This is probably related to the development of asthma exacerbation symptomatology. In this respect, it will be necessary to determine whether a window of opportunity exists for the introduction of specific anti-rhinoviral drugs as potential therapies in the prevention of acute asthma exacerbations.",

It is therefore possible that RV infection in these individuals initiates or amplifies the immune-mediated type 2 inflammation that characterises the pathophysiology of asthma. As no animal model of RV infection currently exists, additional human studies are now required to explore this observation further.",

This seems to regulate viral shedding and symptoms",
