Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome. We confirm high sequence similarity (>99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein.

Human 2019-nCoV are shown as blue circles, other genomes as grey diamonds sequence and SARS reference. Query (2019-nCoV) coverage was always above 99.0%. Generally, we could observe high conservation for structural proteins E, M, and A across the beta-coronavirus family, while accessory proteins (especially ORF8) seem to have much stricter evolutionary constraints (Table 1). On average, nCoV shares 91.1% of protein sequences with Bat virus MG772934.1, 79.7% with Bat virus DQ022305.2%, and 77.1% with the SARS proteome.For further visual confirmation, via MSA, of the conservation between SARS and 2019-nCoV, especially in structural proteins, please refer also to Figure 4C and Figures S2 and S3. As previously observed, the N protein in 2019-nCoV differs from the SARS ortholog in the structurally relevant amino acids 380 and 410. 4 4 | DISCUSSION Our results highlight a high level of conservation within 2019-nCoV genomes sequenced so far, and a clear origin from other beta-CoVs, specifically BCoVs, SARS and MERS. Our analysis F I G U R E 3 Variability within 54 2019-nCoV full genomic sequences. A, location of major structural protein-encoding genes (red boxes; S = Spike protein, E = Envelope protein, M = Membrane protein, N = Nucleocapsid protein) and accessory protein ORFs (blue boxes) on the meta-genomic sequence derived from the MSA of all genomes. B, Shannon entropy values across genomic locations. The two coordinates with the highest entropy (excluding the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 highly variable UnTranslated regions) are indicated. C, Zoom-in of the MSA describing the two most variable locations in the core genome, in the ORF1ab (left) and in ORF8 (right). MSA, multiple sequence alignment confirms previous results highlighting the BCoV as a likely evolutionary link between the SARS viruses and the current epidemic 2019-nCoV. 4 We could confirm this result both with standard phylogenetic analysis and a newly developed visualization method for genomic distances, based on CATPCA. The similarity between 2019-nCoV and the closest Bat relative is very high: all proteins in the coronavirus proteome (with the exception of ORF10) have identities of above 85%, with full conservation of the genome length (~30 kb). We could report also the specific amino acids that changed between SARS and nCoV, with potential implications in epitope definition and possible repurposing of anti-SARS drugs and vaccines. Our analysis found low variability (>99% sequence identity) within the 56 2019-nCoV genomes available at the time of writing, with only two core positions of high variability, one a silent variant in the ORF1ab locus, and the other as an amino acid polymorphism in ORF8. The mutation in ORF8 resulting in one of its two variants, ORF8-L and ORF8-S, is predicted to be affecting the structural disorder of the protein. Specifically, the amino acidic region aa83-aa89is more likely to be disordered in the ORF8-S isoform.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "I G U R E 4 A, MSA of the coronavirus proteins encoded by ORF8 in representative sequences for the 2019-nCoV (Wuhan), BCoVs (Bat SARS-like and Bat SARS) and SARS viruses.

MSA, conclusion, our analysis confirms low variability within the new epidemic virus 2019-nCoV sequenced specimens, while highlighting at least two nucleotide positions of higher variability within protein-coding regions, and specific amino acid divergences compared to BCoVs and SARS. 4 These findings shed a cautiously optimistic light on the possibility of finding effective treatment for this novel coronavirus, starting from already existing anti-betacoronaviridae compounds, 20 which will be dealing with a relatively homogenous viral population.
