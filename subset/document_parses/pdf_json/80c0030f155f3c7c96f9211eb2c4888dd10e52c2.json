While there are many studies on climate change, natural hazards and environmental pollution, relatively less attention has been paid to public and human health. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic, which is a major global public health crisis, is posing severe challenges to the resilience of cities and communities in the context of high-mobility, high-density and high-intensity, as well as expands the connotation of community resilience to public health. To compensate for the lack of current research, this study examined the characteristics of community medical facilities in response to pandemics at urban, community and individual multi-spatial scales based on a thorough review of current research and relevant practice. It also emphasized the significant role played by community medical facilities in improving resilient community constructions in the face of large-scale public health emergencies. These characteristics were fully utilized to explore ways to build and govern the 'resilience' of communities in the future, help people to survive better as well as develop in complex and changeable external environments.",

Community, as the basic unit of a city, is the cellular organization of social organisms and has been at the forefront of disaster prevention and mitigation. As a result, 'community resilience' has become the core issue of relevant theoretical research and construction practices.",

A series of international slogans or proposals show that disaster prevention and mitigation has become an international consensus as to the primary goal of community resilience enhancement. The management forum of the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in 1999 proposed that 'communities should be regarded as the basic unit of disaster reduction'. 15 In 2001, on the International Day for Disaster Reduction, the United Nations put forward the slogan of 'developing community-based disaster reduction strategy'. 12 The 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction listed community disaster reduction as important content and proposed to establish emergency response mechanisms for improving emergency response capacities in all social strata, especially communities. 16 Specifically, Australian scholars are concerned about the rising energy costs caused by climate change and the impact of freezing, heat waves and storms on communities and families, and have considered transforming residences using block designs to adapt to bad weather. 17 In the Middle East, urban planning has paid attention to the impact of extremely high temperatures, water shortages, floods and power interruptions on vulnerable communities in summer, when designing key infrastructure. 18 American scholars found that the inherent conditions of communities (including the environment, social economy and industry) play a key role in post-disaster recovery. 19 Secondly, community resilience is often associated with 'sustainability' and emphasizes the ecological environment and inclusive growth, 20 which is a new way to guide the sustainable development of modern cities based on the traditional planning theory. The 2015 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development proposed, 'make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable' in the next 15 years. 21 The New Urban Agenda of the 2016 United Nations Conference on Housing and Urban Sustainable Development 22 put forward the vision of urban development: ensure that all inhabitants, of present and future generations, without discrimination of any kind, are able to inhabit and produce just, safe, healthy, accessible, affordable, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements, to foster prosperity and quality of life for all.",

Tian et al. 26 proposed a framework for measuring community resilience based on five aspects: original conditions, coping capacity, adaptability, disaster loss and disaster exposure. Although scholars construct a community resilience evaluation system from multi-dimensional and multi-scale synthesis, they pay less attention to public and human health aspects. Correspondingly, research on community resilience in major public health emergencies is also relatively less. 27 Since 2020, the community's response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia pandemic has enriched the connotation of community resilience and led to a rethinking about the community spatial resilience strategy based on public health crisis management. In the global scope, the response speed and governance effect of different communities in different countries, regions and cities are not the same, 20 which reflects the resilience strength of comprehensive management of public health crisis at two levels: city and community.",

These groups and organizations can coordinate various projects such as health care, construction, safety and hotel management. Such strong cross-organizational cooperation and clear communication channels can effectively utilize social resources and better guarantee the establishment and operation of emergency plans. 35 Construction land reserved for temporary emergency facilities. During the implementation of special plans for medical and health facilities and the formulation of emergency response plans for largescale public health events, reserving construction land for temporary emergency facilities based on community medical facilities is an important measure for improving the community emergency response capabilities. It is also necessary to fully consider emergency beds under public health events along with the ventilation and filtering systems, 36 material storage systems, surgical lighting and other ancillary facilities to meet the needs of hospitals and combine peacetime and wartime with disaster relief, to ensure rapid function conversion in special periods and realize the efficient utilization of space resources. For example, the 'mobile cabin hospitals' in Wuhan, China, provided a safe treatment place and an effective isolation area for patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 when the pandemic broke out; thus, effectively preventing its spread. 37 The principle of 'small and even' can be referred to in relation to the preparation of dispersed public spaces for function conversion, 38 and for providing sufficient, simple medical and disaster prevention facilities. There is also a need to consider the needs of medical facilities for space and site, such as well-ventilated and compatible garbage disposal sites, 39, 40 along with the allocation of certain public spaces for the community's education and learning during special periods.

On the one hand, as the core of the communities' defence system, it becomes an important node of the urban public health network constructed by the government to effectively prevent and respond to emergencies by establishing community basic unit self-governance; while on the other hand, it connects individuals, families and communities, as well as connects and associates each basic node of pandemic prevention and control, and builds a community-level pandemic prevention and control support network by guiding residents' health behaviours. In short, community medical facilities promote a 'public health defence network' to reasonably organize the integration and blocking of social and urban spaces and effectively reduce the transmission capacity of viruses in highdensity, high-mobility urban spaces. 43 Establishing a basic community governance unit. The novel coronavirus pneumonia pandemic highlights the importance of a community-based medical system during pandemics. Some scholars have begun to reflect on the concept of patient-centred care in the past, 44, 45 since pandemics affect not only individuals but also families and communities related to the disease. If barriers are not built to prevent infection at the community level, and only the hospital system is relied upon to fight the pandemic, the healthcare system will collapse. Community autonomy means that when public health emergencies occur, the pressure of hospitals and large-scale public health places will be distributed to grassroots community hospitals and small clinics, 'distributed reception and centralized treatment'. In this way, as a key node of the urban public health system, community medical facilities help to improve the utilization efficiency of social medical resources and cope with the lack of hospitals and critical medical facilities.",

The rise of community power can clearly be seen in the pandemic environment, and community governance issues will be comprehensively upgraded. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it necessary for governments to urgently overcome the obstacles of institutional weaknesses: weak administrative capacity, rigid bureaucracy and conflicts among political leaders, which are structural constraints, 46 as well as to encourage responsive grassroots governance. Therefore, there is a need to establish a social governance pattern of co-construction, co-governance and sharing by decentralizing the responsibility and power of community governance at the grassroots level, as well as guiding and encouraging community autonomous governance, which will make the city, the basic cell, really live. 47 Guiding residents' health behaviour. Community medical facilities and related medical staff, regarded as key nodes in the urban public health network, provide urban residents with risk assessment and health knowledge education, 48 and guide their health behaviours. Research shows that medical facilities and medical staff in the community can promote the improvement of community-based health levels and disease prevention; effectively improve per capita health levels and the utilization rate of medical care 49 ; build a social knowledge network on environment and health; enhance residents' sense of participation. 50 Community public health intervention measures should not only focus on the construction of a healthy living environment but also pay attention to guiding residents' health behaviour, which is the key to promoting the quality of the living environment and the construction of resilient communities. 51 In addition, the gradual increase of population density in urban residential areas will affect residents' physical and mental health as well as the community's social management to a certain extent. As a professional department, community medical facilities can carry out a comprehensive and systematic health risk assessment; health knowledge education and popularization; effectively integrate material and social spaces to guide individuals/families' health behaviours through regular health examinations and health education, which will greatly improve the community's anti-risk levels. 52 Community medical facilities should also play a key role in protecting vulnerable groups' health rights and interests. For example, from the perspective of age groups, the elderly are the most vulnerable group, since they often lose the opportunity of forming social networks with the outside world because they live alone and are at a disadvantage in receiving health care services. Community medical facilities can provide support in these two aspects, for example, by volunteering to provide regular health examinations and trying to help the single elderly contacting with others. European scholars have found that community medical facilities can help improve the relief rate of the infected population in poor communities and immigrant groups. 33 Studies have shown that communities with strong social ties are more resilient. 53 By strengthening the connection, trust and reciprocity between individuals, community medical facilities can also help to enhance social capital, strengthen the network support system at the community level, and enhance the effect of collective action and local governance.",

The present COVID-19 pandemic clearly showed home isolation to be a very effective measure. To guarantee the basic quality of life of those living at home requires stable infrastructure, material supplies and community services, such as communication facilities, networks, transportation, logistics, energy, water supply, distance education and entertainment.",

Thus, intelligent management networks based on the new generation of communication technology cover everyone and contributions to the control and protection of pandemic situations. 58 Infrastructure construction should not only meet the needs of daily life, but also of situations during special periods.

This goal can be achieved through three measures.

Second, decision-makers in city planning and related scholars should cooperate to promote the health planning program, clarify the health needs of different groups of people and fully consider the health effect of space in the daily design and use of public space.
