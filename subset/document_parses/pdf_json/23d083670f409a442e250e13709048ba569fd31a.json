Their analysis was based on complete genomes (presumably, nucleotide sequences), whereas in our pilot analysis only protein-coding nucleotide sequences were compared. This initiated an analysis to identify how much of the phylogenetic signal and conservation was actually present in noncoding regions of the viral genomes.

Therefore, a more extensive comparison was performed, this time with either the 5'-or the 3'-end noncoding flanks, obtained from 31 whole genome sequences covering all subspecies of Betacoronavirus (Table 1) . This selection included the most variable genomes identified by Lu and colleagues, complemented with other members of the subgenera, while genomes with high similarity to another genome were discarded to remove redundancy. The phylogenetic trees obtained with these two noncoding regions are shown in Fig. 1 . Both fragments could separate the four subspecies, and an unclassified bat isolate from Cameroon could be identified as a member of the Nobecovirus.

Such a case has been proposed for Malayan pangolins (Liu et al. 2019 ), a meat delicacy that was most likely sold in the exotic meat market. Such cross-infection could also have occurred during handling, storage or selling prior to animals reaching the food market.
