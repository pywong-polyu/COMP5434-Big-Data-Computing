Here, we developed, characterized, and demonstrated the efficacy of a novel microparticle vaccine scaffold comprised of bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN), isolated as an entire sacculi. The PGN microparticles contain bio-orthogonal chemical handles allowing for site-specific attachment of immunogens. We first evaluated the purification, integrity, and immunogenicity of PGN microparticles derived from a variety of bacterial species. We then optimized PGN microparticle modification conditions; Staphylococcus aureus PGN microparticles containing azido-D-alanine yielded robust conjugation to immunogens. We then demonstrated that this vaccine scaffold elicits comparable immunostimulation to the conventional carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). We further modified the S. aureus PGN microparticle to contain the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)\ue0d5this conjugate vaccine elicited neutralizing antibody titers comparable to those elicited by the KLH-conjugated RBD. Collectively, these findings suggest that chemically modified bacterial PGN microparticles are a conjugatable and biodegradable microparticle scaffold capable of eliciting a robust immune response toward an antigen of interest.",

Adjuvants take advantage of innate immune receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotidebinding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), and other receptors to directly stimulate immune cells. 21\u221225 Recent work has shown that direct tethering of adjuvants to immunogens is optimal for eliciting a robust immune response. 26\u221230 As such, many effective carrier proteins are known to activate innate immune receptors. For example, KLH has been shown to be innately immunogenic. 25 Given that the most effective carrier proteins and nanoparticles act by not only multimerizing subunit vaccines but also directly tethering adjuvants to immunogens, we envisioned that a scalable, biodegradable, immunogenic nanoparticle technology could be a very useful tool in the growing arsenal of vaccine carriers.",

For the five species of Gram-positive bacteria tested, the microparticles did not substantially differ in size when grown without D-aa derivatives or with 1 mM D-ala or 1 mM alkDala (Figure 1d and Figure S1a ). However, purified PGN microparticles of Gram-negative Escherichia coli exhibited large variations in size based on growth conditions ( Figure S1b ). These variations could be due to decreased stability of the thinner PGN shell in Gram-negative 52 Escherichia coli compared to the Gram- positive strains. We also examined genetically modified sacculi in PGN O-acetyltransferase A (OatA) and N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (PgdA) mutants in Listeria monocytogenes. These knockout strains of L. monocytogenes alter the PGN composition, by removing the enzyme (OatA) 53 responsible for acetylating the C-6 hydroxyl group of the N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) residue in the growing PGN or by removing the enzyme responsible for deacetylating (PgdA) 54 the Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in the growing PGN.

RAW-Blue cells 57 are immortalized murine macrophages that express relevant PGN immune receptors (TLR-2, NOD1, NOD2, etc.) and produce secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase upon NF-\u03baB activation. We plated macrophages in the presence of PGN microparticles at a 10:33 ratio of cells to PGN and measured NF-\u03baB activation with a colorimetric assay (Methods). We aimed to ensure that PGN microparticles were immunostimulatory, as expected, and that unnatural D-aa incorporation into the PGN microparticles did not influence immunostimulation. Unmodified sacculi and those grown in the presence of additional D-ala or the unnatural amino acid alkDala displayed no significant difference in macrophage activation for most of the Gram-positive samples (Figure 2a) . However, E. coli, the only Gram-negative species tested here, displayed differing responses ( Figure S2 ), perhaps due to heterogeneity in particle sizes or purity. Given the DLS data ( Figure S1b ) and this result, E. coli was not pursued in future experiments. Bacillus subtilis also exhibited markedly different macrophage activation between growth conditions ( Figure S2 ) and was not carried forward for further analysis. Consistent with previous reports, we confirmed that the sacculi isolated from OatA-knockout cells were less immunogenic than sacculi isolated from WT-or PgdA-knockout L. monocytogenes strains (Figure 2a ). 55 Taken together, these results demonstrate that Gram-positive bacterial PGN can yield homogeneous microparticles that are immunostimulatory.",

The resulting maleimide-PEG 4 -DBCO conjugation of SA Aza-Pep to sfGFP produced an immunogen henceforth referred to as sfGFP-SA-Aza-Pep. No modification was detected for any condition for the three derivatives of L. monocytogenes (Figure 2b) , which was surprising because these bacteria readily incorporate unnatural D-aa into their PGN which can be modified by small molecules suggesting that biological processes do not alter unnatural D-aa incorporation. 47 Rather, it is likely that there are fundamental differences in the PGN between L. monocytogenes and S. aureus which could explain the relative impermeability of the L. monocytogenes PGN for the sfGFP protein. 62 PGN Microparticles as Vaccine Carriers. Given our successful conjugation of a subunit vaccine candidate (sfGFP) to the surface of a S. aureus PGN microparticle, we were interested in this microparticle's in vivo efficacy as an immunogen. We sought to compare the immunogenicity of PGN microparticles to that of KLH conjugated to sfGFP. We produced a KLH\u2212sfGFP conjugate using a maleimideactivated KLH in order to also conjugate sfGFP through a cysteine at position 3 and normalized the amount of sfGFP in each immunization sample using a standard sfGFP curve ( Figure S3b ). Therefore, each immunization sample had an identical amount of fluorescence. Because we were able to determine the molarity of sfGFP in each sample and by knowing the concentration of KLH used in the conjugation or by counting the number of microparticles in a known sample volume by microscopy, we then approximated the number of sfGFP units per KLH (\u223c21 sfGFP/KLH) and per PGN microparticles (\u223c250,000 sfGFP/sacculi) ( Figure S3c ).",

We compared the immunization of KLH conjugations with and without Freund's adjuvant system to the adjuvant-free immunization of sfGFP-SA-Aza-Pep. Freund's adjuvant system (Freund's complete adjuvant for the prime, followed by Freund's incomplete adjuvant for the boosts) 63,64 is an extremely robust adjuvant that is not approved for any human or veterinary vaccines but is only used in laboratory settings. 63 Freund's adjuvant contains, among other components, bacterial cell wall fragments from mycobacterium and, therefore, may be stimulating the immune response in a similar way to that of our PGN conjugates. 63, 64 We profiled the immune response after the prime (Figure 3c ), first boost (Figure 3d ), and second boost (Figure 3e ). Following a boost, the unadjuvanted sfGFP-SA-Aza-Pep elicited a better immune response than unadjuvanted KLH; however, this response was less robust than with Freund's adjuvant system (Figure 3c,d) . Strikingly, following a boost at day 112, sfGFP-SA-Aza-Pep retained a robust response (Figure 3e ), demonstrating PGN's ability to elicit an anamnestic immune response. Furthermore, biolayer interferometry, in which the magnitude of the nm shift can be used as a surrogate for binding, indicated the same rank order of binding, with PGN microparticles outperforming KLH (Figure 3f ).",

Given that the PGN structure is known to be altered based on the bacterial strain, 65 we were next interested in whether the S. aureus strains used to produce the PGN microparticles played a role in the host's immune response. We conducted an experiment testing five sfGFP-conjugated S. aureus strains for their immunogenicity in mice. We selected two common (Rosenbach) 66 lab strains of S. aureus (ATCC: 25923 and 29213), two other common laboratory strains (SH1000 67 and RN4220 68 ), and a wall teichoic acid knockout of RN4220 (\u0394TarO) 69 for this experiment. Note that our previous experiments had utilized the 25923 strain. Sacculi were isolated from all five strains ( Figure S5a ) and conjugated using maleimide-PEG 4 -DBCO-modified sfGFP. Flow cytometry revealed that the relative conjugation efficiency was similar across all strains tested (Figure 4a ). We also confirmed that all versions of PGN from these strains yielded similar macrophage stimulation with RAW-Blue assay, when normalizing for the amount of sfGFP (Figure 4b ). Differences in silver staining ( Figure S5b ) suggested that bacterial components, such as wall teichoic acids, may impact PGN purification efficiency during purification.",

They could easily be combined with a variety of other adjuvants 83 or stabilizing agents, 81 further increasing their immunogenicity. Moreover, it is possible to incorporate multiple distinct clickable handles into individual microparticles (by simply growing the cells in broth containing an additional D-aa). This allows for the production of PGN microparticles that can simultaneously contain the antigen, clicked to one handle, and a multiplicity of additional TLR agonists, 26 T-cell epitopes, 84 or cancer neoantigens 85 conjugated to the orthogonal handle. 26, 86 Finally, in contrast to the inorganic nanoparticles, like gold or silver nanoparticles, 13 that are used in vaccination, PGN is a native substrate for many endogenous enzymes and is therefore readily biodegradable. 16, 87 Meanwhile, the composition of PGN and its overall stability during the harsh purification process (Figure 1c) suggest that PGN would benefit from the same advantages as inorganic scaffolds, like their solvency and pH stability, while mitigating their risks. Bacteria are commonly lyophilized and shipped at room temperature, and therefore, it is quite likely that PGN microparticles could afford the same stability and ease of storage. Given the current global limitations on cold-chain storage, stable PGN microparticles could offer an alternative scaffold that is amenable to large-scale distribution. The advantages of their production, ease of purification, stability, and innate immune properties render PGN microparticles an ideal addition to the growing arsenal of vaccine nanoparticles.",

To quantify the amount of the RBD in solution, we developed a standard curve dot blot using His-tagged sfGFP and the RBD. sfGFP-conjugated KLH or PGN microparticles (of a known sfGFP concentration, as determined with a standard curve) were dotted in duplicate on a nitrocellulose membrane (1.8 \u03bcL dots, Thermo Fisher) in twofold dilutions. Unknown concentrations of RBD-conjugated KLH or PGN microparticles were also dotted in duplicate. In a final lane, unmodified PGN microparticles were dotted as a control. An anti-his dot blot was conducted as follows. The blot was dried for 15 min in a fume hood. Following drying, 10 mL of a 1\u00d7 PBST + 5% blotting grade blocker (Bio-Rad) was added for 10 min. Two microliters of the mouse antihexa His antibody (BioLegend) was added to the 10 mL sample and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed 16 times with 9 mL of PBST. Ten milliliters of the 1\u00d7 PBST + 5% blotting grade blocker with 2 \u03bcL of anti-mouse IgG1 (Abcam) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.

Target cells used for infection in viral neutralization assays were from a HeLa cell line stably overexpressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and the protease known to process SARS-CoV-2, TMPRSS2. Production of this cell line is described in detail by Rogers et al., 2020, 78,88 with the addition of stable TMPRSS2 incorporation. ACE2/TMPRSS2/HeLa cells were plated at 5000 cells per well on white-walled, clear-bottom 96well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 1 day prior to infection. On the day of the assay, dilutions of serum were made into sterile D10 medium [500 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS, 5 mL of L-glutamate, penicillin, and streptomycin (5 mL of 100\u00d7), and 10 mM HEPES] to a final volume of 60 \u03bcL. For viral neutralization assays, mouse serum was centrifuged at 2000g for 15 min and heat inactivated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C. Samples were run in technical duplicate in each experiment. All other wells contained only D10 medium. A virus mixture was made containing the virus of interest (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 with a 21-amino acid deletion at the C terminus), D10 medium, and polybrene (final concentration 5 \u03bcg/mL). Virus dilutions into medium were selected such that a suitable signal would be obtained in the virus-only wells (luminescence > 10,000 RLU). Sixty microliters of this virus mixture was added to each of the inhibitor dilution to a final volume of 120 \u03bcL in each well. Virus-only wells contained 60 \u03bcL of D10 medium and 60 \u03bcL of the virus mixture. Cell-only wells contained 120 \u03bcL of D10 medium. The serum dilution/virus mixture was left to incubate for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Following incubation, the medium was removed from the cells on the plates made 1 day prior, replaced with 100 \u03bcL of inhibitor/virus dilutions, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for approximately 48 h. Infectivity was read out by measuring luciferase levels 48 h postinfection: 50 \u03bcL of medium was removed from all cells, and then, cells were lysed by adding 50 \u03bcL of BriteLite assay readout solution (PerkinElmer) into each well. Luminescence values were measured with a BioTek Synergy HT Microplate Reader (BioTek). Each plate was normalized by averaging cell-only (0% infectivity) and virus-only (100% infectivity) wells. Normalized values were fit with a threeparameter non-linear regression inhibitor curve in GraphPad Prism 9.1.0 to obtain IC 50 values.",

In contrast, both the KLH-and SH1000-conjugated RBDs displayed both binding and neutralization (Figure 5c\u2212f). As with the sfGFP-immunized mice, there was little difference between the KLH-and SH1000-conjugated groups (Figure 5c\u2212f). The improved immunogenicity of the PGN microparticles compared to the unconjugated RBD (Figure 5c\u2212f) demonstrates a clear first step in the development of PGN microparticles as a biodegradable, immunostimulatory, and adaptable vaccine platform.
