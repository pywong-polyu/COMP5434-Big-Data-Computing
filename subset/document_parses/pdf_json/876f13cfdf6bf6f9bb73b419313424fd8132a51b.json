            "text": "Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has imposed a complete shut-down of face-to-face teaching to universities and schools, forcing a crash course for online learning plans and technology for students and faculty. In the midst of this unprecedented crisis, video conferencing platforms (e.g., Zoom, WebEx, MS Teams) and learning management systems (LMSs), like Moodle, Blackboard and Google Classroom, are being adopted and heavily used as online learning environments (OLEs). However, as such media solely provide the platform for e-interaction, effective methods that can be used to predict the learner's behavior in the OLEs, which should be available as supportive tools to educators and metacognitive triggers to learners. Here we show, for the first time, that Deep Learning techniques can be used to handle LMS users' interaction data and form a novel predictive model, namely DeepLMS, that can forecast the quality of interaction (QoI) with LMS. Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, DeepLMS results in average testing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) < 0.009 , and average correlation coefficient between ground truth and predicted QoI values r \u2265 0.97 (p < 0.05) , when tested on QoI data from one database pre-and two ones during-Covid-19 pandemic. DeepLMS personalized QoI forecasting scaffolds user's online learning engagement and provides educators with an evaluation path, additionally to the content-related assessment, enriching the overall view on the learners' motivation and participation in the learning process. OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ tools 12,13 . As Herrington et al. 14 state, the degree of interactions that take place within an educational context of reference is an essential predictor of its success. The QoI of the learner, within the LMS, is a strong efficacy indicator of the design and its ability to sustain online learning communities 15-18 . In particular, designed procedures within the learning environment can activate and sustain interactions towards learning. Then, upon these interactions 19 , knowledge can be extracted concerning the student's preferred learning patterns while interacting with leaning resources, and/or while collaborating in groups. In this respect, empirical findings suggest that the commitment to the course workflow 20 , the connection time 21 and the total number of accesses to the system 22 are very important. Moreover, LMS-based online records can also be used to map individualand population-level social jet lag, showing the potentiality of the LMS to provide behavioral information in terms of learning and attention deficits 23 , or emergence of novel relationships between social structure and performance 24 . From an educational data mining and learning analytics perspective, LMS was used to provide user track data within the online learning context, which were used as additional sources of information in: i) early detection of at-risk students on distance learning modules 25,26 , ii) findings as to learning dispositions 27,28 , iii) learning success and performance prediction 29-39 , and iv) learner behavior and goal attainment in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) prediction 40 . Nonetheless, no evaluation of the QoI was performed, beyond merely descriptive statistics of the users' interactions and their relation with the users' performance, which were the main focus of the analysis.",

            "text": "The aforementioned place the need on the analysis of user's LMS-based interactions related with their quality, so the latter could be used to explain the true nature of the users' behavior when interacting within a LMS. So far, relevant research focused on QoI tends to examine LMS data statistics, including learner-teacher discussions and exchanges in online forums, to investigate the dimension, depth and category of interactions occurred 41 . A more extended and quantitative approach in QoI analysis was introduced by Dias and Diniz 42 . Their model, namely FuzzyQoI, considers the users' (professors' and students') interactions, based on LMS use, and, by translating the knowledge of the experts in the field to fuzzy constructs, quantitatively estimates, a normalized index of the users' QoI. As a result, the latter, can be used to identify users' LMS interaction trends and provide personalised feedback to users. Another approach to evaluate the human interaction processes on a LMS-based online learning course was proposed by Dzandu and Tang 43 . They used a semiotic framework as guide to identify syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and social context gaps or problems, focusing on only the human information interaction issues. Nevertheless, their approach was based on simple questionnaires, missing out the dynamic characteristics of LMS interactions. In an further effort, Dias et al. 44 suggested the use of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) as a means to efficiently model the way LMS users interact with it, by estimating their QoI within a b-learning context. Their FCM-QoI model was used to analyse the QoI influential concepts' contribution to self-sustained cycles (static analysis) and corresponding alterations, when the use of the LMS time period is considered (dynamic analysis), demonstrating potential to increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback approaches. In the work of Cerezo et al. 45 , identical students' LMS Moodle logs behaviours were grouped concerning effort, time spent working, and procrastination, in order to investigate the students' asynchronous learning processes, matching their behaviours with different achievement levels. Although this approach tries to shed light upon the role of the LMS interaction in the students' achievements, it lacks generalisation power and evaluates the LMS-based QoI mainly from the grading of the students' achievements and not from the actual interaction quality per se.",

The proposed enhancement of LMS, namely DeepLMS, fills the gap in predictive use of LMS-based QoI to early inform effective feedback providers, i.e., educators, policy makers, relevant stakeholders, so to apply any corrective measure to increase the efficiency of the educational processes. In addition, DeepLMS acts as a metacognitive triggering tool to the learners, as it provides them with a prediction of their LMS-based QoI, so to reflect on their current QoI and proceed with any necessary personal corrective actions. By adopting a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) artificial Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture 46 , a LSTM-based predictor was employed to form the QoI prediction model of DeepLMS, trained and tested on experimental LMS-based QoI data drawn from three databases, i.e., DB1 42 , DB2, and DB3, that come from both the pre-(DB1) and during-(DB2, DB3) Covid-19 pandemic periods, and refer to different countries, sociocultural and educational settings. The derived experimental results across DB1-DB3 show efficient predictive performance of the DeepLMS to accurately predict the daily QoI values, despite any temporal and/or educational setting differences. An illustration of the DeepLMS-based QoI prediction process is depicted in Fig. 1 .",

Apparently, effective integration of technology is needed 9 to support QoI within OLEs.

One step further, in the right column of Fig. 2 for the case of P#55, out of all of the changes in slope across the depicted subfigures, this is the only one that contains a proactive prediction value, i.e., not just reacting to the QoI change (blue solid line) with a slight lag due to the use of the recurrent LSTM model. Similarly to Fig. 2, Fig. 3 depicts the predictive performance of the DeepLMS upon some excerpts of the QoI time series derived from the DB1 1037 Students (S#55, S#60, S#155, S#310, S#612, and S#775). The same configuration as in Fig. 2 is also followed in Fig. 3 , where again various cases of the QoI time series distribution across the two academic semesters are shown. The solid line at day 323 separates the data used for the training from the ones used for testing. Moreover, the estimated correlation coefficient r per case is also depicted. From the results presented in Fig. 3 , the same level of high predictive performance of DeepLMS seen in Fig. 2 is sustained for the case of Students. Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of the DeepLMS performance indices (see \"Methods\" section) across the whole set of QoI data per user type (DB1 Professors (75) . In particular, the distribution of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the testing and the estimated QoI data is depicted in Fig. 4a ,d for the case of DB1 Professors and Students, respectively. Moreover, the distribution of the correlation coefficient r between the testing and the estimated QoI data is depicted in Fig. 4b ,e for the case of DB1 Professors and Students, respectively. Furthermore, the distribution of the correlation coefficient r d between the derivative of the testing and the derivative of the estimated QoI data is depicted in Fig. 4c ,f for the case of DB1 Professors and Students, respectively. The median and the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the estimated RMSE, r and r d are tabulated in Table 1 . From both Fig. 4a ,d and Table 1 , it is clear that the testing RMSE lies in quite satisfactory levels across the two users' groups of DB1, showing an efficient predictive performance by the DeepLMS. This is further justified by the very strong correlation identified both between the amplitude of the testing and predicted QoI values (Fig. 4b ,e, Table 1 ) and the trend of the testing and predicted QoI values (Fig. 4c ,f, Table 1 ). The number of outliers (red crosses in Fig. 4 lying outside > 1.5 times the interquartile range, i.e., the box-plot whiskers) does not really affect the overall predictive performance of the DeepLMS, as expressed by the corresponding high median values and low 95% CIs (Table 1) . Moreover, the difference in the number of outliers between Fig. 5 shows the QoI data used for training (before the vertical solid line) and for testing (after the vertical solid line), whereas the right column zooms into the testing QoI data (blue solid line) and the DeepLMS predicted QoI (red dashed line). Analogously to Figs. 2 and 3, the estimated correlation coefficient r between the testing and the estimated QoI Supplementary Table S1 ) categorized into 14 input parameters ( C 1 , . . . , C 14 ; see Supplementary Table S1 ) fed to the FuzzyQoI model 42 , outputting the estimated QoI(k) at instance k. The latter is then inputted to the trained LMST network (see \"Methods\" section) to predict the Q oI(k + 1) at instance (k + 1) . Both QoI(k) and Q oI(k + 1) are compared and their difference (dQoI(k)) is used to inform the user's feedback path. Fig. 6d-f ). The corresponding values of the median and 95% CI of the estimated RMSE, r, and r d for the Dee-pLMS performance when using DB2 QoI data are tabulated in Table 1 . From both Fig. 6 and Table 1 , it is clear that DeepLMS sustains its efficient predictive performance reported in the case of DB1 also in the case of DB2, exhibiting quite satisfactory performance metrics across the two users' groups of DB2. Apparently, the differences between DB1 and DB2 performance metrics are due to the different number of users per database (see Table 2 ); however, they are both quite acceptable. shows the QoI data from DB1 P#2, P#33, P#35, P#60, P#65, and P#70, used for training (from day 1 until day 323 where the vertical solid line lies) and for testing (day 324 until day 358), whereas the right column zooms into the testing QoI data (blue solid line) and the DeepLMS predicted QoI (red dashed line). Moreover, the estimated correlation coefficient r between the testing and the estimated QoI data (see \"Methods\" section) for each case is also superimposed in the right column plots. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the way the focused discipline related to DB3 was evaluated during the exams period, as it involves more online research-based activities, rather than the hands-on ones seen in DB2. From the results depicted in Fig. 7 , it is clear that the DeepLMS takes into account the QoI characteristics from the training period and successfully predicts the various QoI patterns seen in the testing period. The distribution of the DeepLMS performance indices, i.e., RMSE, r, and r d , across the whole set of QoI data for the case of DB3 Students (52) is illustrated in Figs. 8a-c, respectively. The distribution for the case of DB3 Professors was omitted, as there is only one Professor involved within the DB3. The corresponding values of the median and 95% CI of the estimated RMSE, r, and r d for the DeepLMS performance when using DB3 QoI data are tabulated in Table 1 . The results presented both in Fig. 8 and Table 1 , confirm efficient predictive performance of the DeepLMS when using QoI data from DB3, similarly to the cases of DB1 and DB2. Apparently, the different number of users per database (see Table 2 ) contributes to the differences seen in the DeepLMS performance metrics across DB1, DB2 and DB3; yet, in all cases, the DeepLMS predictive performance can be considered quite satisfactorily.",

Possibly, this is due, in part, to the lack of investment in online education modality by many educational institutions and/or to underestimation of online learning as a core aspect of their learner experience 48 . However, led by top universities, a noticeable change began a few years ago, as fully digital academic experiences started flourishing 49 . The current crisis due to Covid-19 is accelerating this trend, revealing the need for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to promote faculty's digital skills. The latter can be facilitated by the construction of a technological backbone, to mitigate the effects of this crisis and to welcome the online teaching/learning within a digital era. These digital competences can amalgamate the short-term response to crisis into an enduring digital transformation of education contexts. , the minimum and maximum values (ends of \"whiskers\" below and above the box, respectively) still within the interquartile range, and outlier values (individual red crosses below and above \"whiskers\"). Additional DeepLMS predictive performance indices are tabulated in Table 1 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In this disrupted educational landscape, the issues of how instructors and colleges treat student evaluation and how institutions treat student evaluations of professors have surfaced. Educators face a challenge/opportunity in trying to evaluate quality, even as the educational activity they are evaluating is mutating, in real time. DeepLMS comes into foreground as a means to offer quantitative metrics of the user's LMS-based QoI, as an alternative to conventional evaluation metrics. The efficient predictive performance of the DeepLMS, as justified by the experimental results derived from three databases, involving pre-and during-Covid-19 pandemic data, establishes a reliable basis to construct a motivational, personalized feedback to the LMS users, so to readjust their interaction with the LMS, as an effort to increase the related QoI. The latter refers to the efficient engagement of the user with the online part of the learning process (nowadays almost the sole one), and provides educators with an evaluation path, in parallel to the content-related assessment, that could enrich their overall view about whereas the left column-bottom panel shows the QoI data from excerpts of DB2 Students, i.e., S#25, S#39, S#58, S#158, S#171, and S#172, for the same training and testing periods.

Moreover, based on the estimated dQoI(k) and its segmentation setting (see \"Methods\" section), personalized feedback can be provided to users that helps them get the most out of their interaction with the LMS and the related online material, and can have a significant impact on overall learning performance outcomes 50 . Many forms of representation of the segmented dQoI(k) value can be employed (e.g., text, graphs, audiovisual); in all of them, however, a personalization in the way the feedback is communicated to users should be incorporated. For example, when dQoI(k) \u2208 [\u22121, \u22120.8] , a text message of 'Serious alert! Your QoI is expected to significantly fall!', can be used as an intense warning; alternatively, it can be more constructive in the form of 'From now on, please try to be more focused and more active in the online part of your course'. The former textual feedback is a descriptive interpretation of the dQoI(k) value per se, whereas the latter is a proactive interpretation that motivates learners to act constructively. This need for personalised Table 1 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ interpretation stems from the fact that learners, usually, chose different paths to respond to learning challenges. For example, the ones with a positive orientation view feedback (either positive or negative) as information to be assimilated and accommodated. However, the ones with a negative orientation, perceive negative feedback as a 'crushing blow' and reflection of their poor ability 51 ; most of such learners easily give up 50 . Hence, the adaptation of the feedback path could better support the ultimate aim in feedback provision, which allows learners to take over the function of assessing themselves and others 52 .",

            "text": "From the results presented in Figs . These patterns are governed by various academic calendar activities, e.g., lectures, mid-term exams, final exams, winter/spring/summer breaks, and/or external ones, especially for DB2 and DB3, as the lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic (DB2: 26/3-24/4/2020; DB3: 11/3-4/5/2020) lies within their time duration (see Table 2 ). In spite of these, the DeepLMS acknowledges such data evolution, resulting in adequate predictive performance due to the ability of its embedded LSTM forecasting model to outperform classical time series methods in cases with long, interdependent and sparse time series 53 . Clearly, the aforementioned results show increased generalization power in the performance of DeepLMS. Extending the demographics analysis in the bias domain, as Table 2 shows, the distribution of Male/Female was quite balanced, both in Professors and Students, along with their age, without any heterogeneity that would potentially produce data bias in LSTM learning. Hence, no historical bias (as no socio-technical issues were involved), no representation bias (sufficient number of users were involved and the significant spread of QoI data comes from users across three countries, with five courses with 30-40 different disciplines each course (macro level: DB1), one course (meso level: DB2) and one discipline (micro level: DB3)), no measurement bias (data were captured from users that all had equal access to the LMS Moodle pages after logged in), no evaluation bias (the evaluation was performed on an equal basis and with the same objective measures of (RMSE, r) as in the baseline algorithm (FCM-QoI 44 )), no population bias (user population represented in the datasets is coming from a real-life setting (University) end expresses the original target population), no Simpson's Paradox (the data were homogeneous and there were no subgroups in Professors' and Students' groups), no sampling bias (uniform sampling across Table 1 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ all groups), no user-interaction bias (the LMS Moodle metrics involved in the production of the QoI are 112 (see Table S1 ) and provide a high variety to the user to interact with the LMS Moodle), and no self-selection bias (the data were analyzed after the users interacted with the LMS and they were totally unaware of the research; hence, they could not influence the results by selective self-participation). Consequently, there is no unfairness arising from biases in the data. Taking the bias issue further, another source of unfairness could potentially arise from the learning algorithm involved itself. To avoid such event, some techniques 54 could be explored to try to transform the data (pre-processing), so that the underlying discrimination is removed, or incorporating changes into the objective function or imposing a constraint (in-processing), or accessing a holdout set, which was not involved during the training of the model, and reassign the initially assigned labels by the model based on a function (post-processing). In the DeepLMS case, although no data bias was identified, in a broader perspective, flexibly fair representation in DeepLMS learning could be introduced in its future edition by creating a layer that disentangles the information that relate with sensitive attributes (e.g., demographics) and create a targeted learning for such sensitive latent variables, which potentially can bias the model, and incorporate such knowledge in a debias process (e.g., as in 55, 56 ) at the higher QoI prediction layer. When performing a relevant comparative analysis between the DeepLMS performance and the most related FCM-QoI model 44 , that it is also based on the same QoI data drawn from the FuzzyQoI model 42 , it seems that the proposed DeepLMS achieves higher overall performance, when compared to the testing output of FCM-QoI. In particular, based on the predictive performance of both the DeepLMS and the FCM-QoI 44 tabulated in Table 1 , it is apparent that the DeepLMS exhibits lower testing RMSE and higher r values in its predictive output, when compared with the ones from the FCM-QoI model 44 . From a structural comparison, DeepLMS overcomes the training limitation of the FCM-QoI, i.e., its training is based on the mean values of QoI across users provided by the FuzzyQoI model; this, however, merges the specific characteristics of each user to an average behavior 44 . On the contrary, the DeepLMS provides personalised predictions for the QoI of each user across the academic semesters.",

The incorporation of Deep Learning-based predictions of QoC and QoAE, in parallel to the QoI ones, extends the work of the authors 70-72 from the concept of affective/blended/collaborative-teaching/learning (a/b/c-TEACH, http://abcte ach.fmh.ulisb oa.pt/) to the a/b/c/d(eep)-TEACH one.

Finally, as distinct time periods of pre-, during-and post-Covid-19 lockdown have been formed, the analysis of LMS www.nature.com/scientificreports/ data that emerged during these three periods seems promising, in particular for the identification of any effect on the QoI per se and its related prediction via the proposed DeepLMS model.

In particular, the final network consisted of four layers, i.e., the sequence input layer, the LSTM layer with 1200 hidden units, the fully connected layer and the regression output layer, and was trained for 300 epochs. With this selection, the estimated training RMSE was converging to values less than 0.001 across the 300 iterations (Fig. 10) .

The size of the mini-batch used for each training iteration to evaluate the gradient of the loss function and update the weights was set equal to 128. A common issue that should be considered during training any kind of neural network is overfitting, due to the highly flexible nature of the network. In order to reduce the negative effects of overfitting, apart from the dropout process described above, regularisation techniques can also be applied to reduce the generalization error. In this vein, the L 2 norm regularization was also adopted here 76 . This technique, also known as Tikhonov regularization and ridge regression in statistics, is a specific way of regularizing a cost function with the addition of a complexity-representing term. In the case of L 2 regularization in neural networks, the term is simply the squared Euclidean norm of the weight matrix of the hidden layer of the network. L 2 regularization usually results in much smaller weights across the entire model. An additional parameter, , is added to allow control of the strength of the regularization; here the value of = 0.0005 was used.",

In addition, cross-country/scale/time-period statistical analysis has resulted in non-significantly statistical differences of the performance of DeepLMS for different sociocultural and temporal settings (Wilcoxon rank sum test for RMSE(DB1, DB2) : p = 0.207; RMSE(DB1, DB3) : p = 0.219; RMSE(DB2, DB3) : p = 0.387). The same holds for the factors of sex and age, as linear regression tests did not show any influence of both on the prediction of QoI for Professors ( {sex, age} P\u2212DB1 : {p = 0.363, p = 0.113} )",

All users started to use LMS Moodle in that academic year. These contributions were provided by the users (75 Professors and 1,037 Students) within five b-learning-based undergraduate courses, i.e., Sport Sciences, Ergonomics, Dance, Sport Management and Psychomotor Rehabilitation, offered by a public HEI (Faculdade de Motricidade Humana, Portugal).

These contributions were provided by the users (3 Professors and 180 Students) during the course of Engineering Design. The latter is a freshman course on the basic principles of engineering design, applied on solving real-life problems via projects. DB3 includes overall 27,056 users' LMS online learning interactions drawn from a discipline in the area of Advanced Signal Processing at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), Greece, taught at the 4th year of ECE studies, during the Spring semester and Summer/ Fall exam periods of 2020 (181 days).
