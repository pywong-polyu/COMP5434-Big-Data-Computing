Students were encouraged to make TikToks with these principles in mind, aiming to be accurate, accessible, and engaging by using current trending sounds, challenges, and dances to reach a wider audience. In addition to evaluating science communication skills, this activity also showed how well students understood the broad scientific concepts taught in the course, including course content and research methods.

Science communication skills are important for all STEM professionals, not just researchers. Thus, incorporation of these methods into any STEM class could be a helpful addition for building these skills for communicating important topics or current events related to the class curriculum. The flexibility and popularity of TikTok means that it can easily accommodate the science communication principles of setting, timing, effectiveness, and memorability to create unique educational videos that could potentially reach millions of people (12) . Furthermore, the ability to easily capture, edit, and share video content from a single application makes creating TikToks easy for new content creators and a great way to engage students while simultaneously contributing to science outreach initiatives. It is the ethical responsibility of researchers to disseminate findings with the public in a timely way. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, effective science communication is vital to fulfilling that obligation. Inspiring the next generation of science communicators will continue to improve science communication, making exciting discoveries accessible to everyone. ",
