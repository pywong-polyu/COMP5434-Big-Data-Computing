In the phase I/II doubleblind study, 548 individuals without prior HCV infection but with a history of injection drug use were randomized to vaccine or placebo and followed for incident HCV infection. In total, 455 participants (228 vaccine and 227 placebo) received both doses. In both groups, 14 participants developed chronic HCV infection, indicating no protection against initial or chronic infection with the vaccine. Although the final outcome was not optimal, there were key lessons from this trial. The vaccine was immunogenic, leading to HCV-specific T cell responses in 78% of those who received the vaccine compared with 3% in the placebo arm. Interestingly, the geo metric mean peak HCV RNA level post-infection was lower in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (152.51 \u00d7 10 3 IU per millilitre and 1,804.93 \u00d7 10 3 IU per millilitre, respectively), and reassuringly the vaccine was well tolerated with no safety concerns 7 .",

Repeating this type of effort for each vaccine candidate is not feasible, raising the prospect of new approaches, including using a controlled human infection model (CHIM) of HCV to rapidly test vaccine candidates 9 .

Chronic HCV infection promotes pronounced T cell exhaustion. Detailed single-cell transcriptomic data show that HCV clearance with DAAs leads to polarization of HCV-specific CD8 + T cells towards a memory-like phenotype with loss of terminally exhausted CD8 + cells. However, the profile of the memory-like cells did not change after treatment-induced clearance and was clearly distinct from the profile of patients who spontaneously cleared their infection, indicating the presence of an 'immunolo gical scar' despite viral clearance 10 . These data suggest that antigen elimination alone is not enough to reverse exhaustion once chronicity is established and might support early treatment during acute infection. Not only does this explain the lack of protection against HCV reinfection after DAA cure of chronic HCV, but it raises concerns that vaccination of previously infected individuals might be particularly challenging owing to persistence of HCV-specific CD8 + T cells that expand to produce only terminally exhausted T cells 10 .",

Innovations in 2021 promise to curb HBV transmission by reducing mother-to-child transmission and enhancing vaccine immunogenicity in at-risk adult groups. Additionally, an HCV vaccination trial was conducted, and there were also advances in our understanding of the immunology underpinning the lack of protection against HCV reinfection.",
