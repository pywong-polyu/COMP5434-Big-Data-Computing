In December 2019 and January 2020, COVID-19 has spread in large scale among the population, which brought terrible disaster to the life and property of the Chinese people. In this paper, we will first analyze the feature and pattern of the virus transmission, and discuss the key impact factors and uncontrollable factors of epidemic transmission based on public data. Then the virus transmission can be modelled and used for the inflexion and extinction period of epidemic development so as to provide theoretical support for the Chinese government in the decision-making of epidemic prevention and recovery of economic production. Further, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the prevention methods taken by the Chinese government such as multi-level administrative region isolation. It is of great importance and practical significance for the world to deal with public health emergencies.",

It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the number of the confirmed cases in Wuhan is much larger than those in these two cities, which can also prove the effectiveness of closure of Wuhan from stopping the virus spread from 23 rd Jan, 2020. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the cured rate has increased rapidly since the 3 rd Feb 2020, while the death rate is rather stable. The tendency of the death rate and cured rate in Hubei and other areas are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 , repectively. As the origin of COVID-19, the death of Hubei Province is much higher than those of other Provinces, and the newly confirmed cases and newly dead cases are both much higher than the sum of other provinces, shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 . It demonstrates that the density of the infected people in Hubei Province is still quite large, and the current medical facilities cannot meet the demand. In contrast, the situation of the areas outside Hubei Province is rather easier to control due to effective community isolation and individual monitoring. Currently, different App programmes in each district or even community on the smart phone are developed to report personal tracks when on the move, i.e., 'Shen i', 'Health code'. As demonstrated in Fig. 8 , there is a sudden rise for the new confirmed cases in Hubei area at the 12 th Feb 2020, which is caused by the confirmation of the previous suspected population since the virus symptom can not be diagnosed at the first place [9] [10] . However, the inflected population with confirmation are roughly stable after this point, due to appropriate traffic and medical support from other Provinces of China. The new cases from non-Hubei area are decreasing gradually, shown in Fig. 10 . Therefore, it can be concluded that the current measures taken by the Chinese Government can effectively prevent the spread of virus.",

In other words, the probability of the potential risk of this factory returning to work is about 44.23%.

It is of great significance that the implementation of these measures makes the virus infection rate in Wuhan well controlled. 2) Considering the impact of indirect infection and suspected cases backlog on the epidemic situation, the prediction results can be more consistent with the progression of the epidemic. 3) The human factors are not considered in the paper.",
