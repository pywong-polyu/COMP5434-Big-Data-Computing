Economic, social, and political issues are mostly related to the nation's failure to undergo its roles well. As a legal institution, a state must not ignore the people into a position of incapability to fulfill their basic needs in providing basic social services (Setiawan, 2011) . Ohmae (1995:11-17) explicitly announces the end of the 'nation-state'. The declining power of a nation is definite in the rise of the global economy. As an institution, the state is no longer perceived as an important agent as the reality of a borderless world describes a vital consequence; the diluting ethics of border identities (nationalism, religion, community) . These identities used to be the main guidance, but they fade and collapse due to the surge of globalization (Ohmae 1995:11-17) .",

Moreover, Fukuyama (2005:xix) describes the diminishing roles and strategic functions of nations that worsen poverty and social gapand possibly igniting social conflicts and civil war. That simple picture explains the immense paradox of the welfare paradigm. The transformation of the capitalistic paradigm creates a big leap into neoliberalism. Subsidies as the assurance of basic need services are assumed as inefficient. Neoliberalism incorporates capitalist economy and free trade systems as tools to create a market syndicate. According to John Perkin's term of corporatocracy syndicate, it aims to gain profits by promoting corruption, collusion, and nepotism from the third nations, and it operates like a mafia syndicate (Perkins, 2008:12-13) .",

They agreed to form Indonesia as a multi-religious and multicultural country. As citizens, the founding fathers acknowledge this condition. This ideal vision is then translated into the constitutional regulations or policies in achieving welfare.

According to Gulen (2006:103) , the transcendental approach will result in the ultimate intelligence, which is carried out by breaking through the formalism boundaries (exciting rule) and transcendence, to obtain a new way of thinking that is close to the ultimate truth. According to Shiddiqi (1993) , the transcendental approach departs from the paradigm as well as hudan (guidance of wisdom) and rakhmah (peace). According to Absori et al. (2018:12) in this perspective, knowledge is not only for the sake of knowledge, but it must be beneficial for the good of the public. This means that to reach an understanding of Indonesia as a legal state of welfare in the transcendental-prophetic perspective, we must find and identify Indonesia's welfare laws in the transcendental-prophetic philosophical approach framework (Dimyati, 2014) . This is juridical-normative research with a transcendental approach. It means that the data on Indonesia as a welfare state is inventoried. These data include thoughts, books, and statements of Indonesia's founding fathers on the philosophy of Indonesia as a welfare state. The inventoried data are then processed and analyzed using the descriptive, dialectic, and interpretative methods (Sidharta, 2011:145) .",

Second, Pancasila follows the view of a religious nation-state; it is neither a religious state nor a secular state. The nation must protect and maintain all religious adherence.
