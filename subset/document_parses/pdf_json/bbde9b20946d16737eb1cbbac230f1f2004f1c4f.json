Therefore, the attention of these types of attacks are being increased owing to the notorious impact on the business and factories. In the case of smart environments such as farming, cities, healthcare, and home automation, the jamming attacks also present a serious issue. In the smart farming context, the presence of attackers creates an unsafe and unproductive environment [9] . Therefore, the economy and wellness of the persons in a nation could be undermined by the destruction of fields, flood farmlands, and over spray pesticides.

We also implement a sniffer in a Software Defined Radio (SDR) to analyze the behavior of the network, under jamming attacks, without intervention. Additionally, using the XBee devices and a Voltage Controlled Oscillator, we implement reactive and constant jamming strategies to analyze their impacts on performance metrics. Our main contribution is to present a critical study based on a successful experimental testbed that includes the impact of jamming attacks on the transceiver devices used in real smart scenarios. Consequently, we extend the experimental analysis to the probabilistic model to include reactive and constant jamming attacks under the assumptions used in our work.

The macMinBE corresponds to the minimum value of the Backoff Exponent (BE) configured in the device. Next, the device performs the CCA process to sense for activity in the channel and decide if it is assed busy or free. If the channel is detected busy, the BE is incremented by one, and a new backoff stage and sensing process starts.

Therefore, the probability that the CE phenomenon occurs will depend on the ratio between the power of the carrier signal (RSS c ) and the interfering signals (RSS i ), assuming the overlap of the signals in the transmission time. Therefore, the CE can be evaluated using the signal-to-interferenceplus-noise ratio (SINR). In [24] , the CE for the unslotted mode is analyzed under the assumption of signals overlap in time. The results of PRR and goodput for different ranges of SINR show that the CE occurs in certain regions for reactive jamming strategy.

The distances between the nodes used in the experiments and the number of nodes suffered from limitations due to the physical space owing to the outbreak of the coronavirus, COVID-19. However, the distances and number of nodes used in this work are in the range of values used in previous works for smart indoor environments [14, 17, 18, 23] ). Note that, when the transmitter is used as an interferer, the circular distribution is maintained. To determine the performance metrics for the scenarios under jamming attacks, we activate the ACK mechanism. Therefore, we have the information of the transmitters, the received packets in the sink, and the registered packets by the sniffer to analyze the behavior. For the first round of experiments, we vary the number of interferers present in the scenario to analyze the performance against one transmitter. Consequently, we start the experiments with one transmitter and one interferer. We remark that the sniffer and the sink node are always implemented in all the experiments.",

Following the circular distribution, we deploy the nodes at different distances from the sink node. From here, we only analyze the performance metrics for a total collision scenario, and all the nodes are configured with BE = 0. The results show that the interferers generate a constructive interference that completely blocks the reception of packets, as shown in Table 2 . Therefore, we focus on finding a threshold value that permits the reception of packets with two interferers. To encounter the threshold that permits the reception of packets in the sink node for the transmitter node, we use the following methodology. First, we fixed the distance of the transmitter to the sink node. Then, we vary the relative distance of the interferers from the sink and also between them. According to the results acquired, when the second interferer have a threshold of almost 3.1 dBm from the first interferer, the reception of the packets occurs, Table 3 shows some experiments performed that reveals this behavior.

Using the SDR as a spectrum analyzer and correlating the gain of SDR with the XBee devices, we fixed the signal strength in \u221258 dBm for the jammer.

Summarizing, this behavior shows that the CE can cope with the presence of impulsive noise (or interference) for some packets. For the packets that are not captured, the ACK mechanism can detect the collision and report the transmission failure as show in Figure 15 . We emphasize that the transmitter E1 is affected by interference during the entire experiments, but does not lead to errors in the transmission. According to the study of the interferences done in Section 2, the collision occurred outside of the preamble or header bytes of the packet. The variance that the noise of the burst type and the constant strategy provokes in the RSS values are critical for localization applications [39] .

Hence, in Table 5 , we present the different timing and energy consumption for the transmitter in each scenario.

For the reactive strategy, the jammer device corresponds to the XBee device used for the legitimate transmitter. Therefore, the electrical characteristics are the same for the calculations.

Therefore, we emulate the reactive strategy transmitting at the same time instant of the legitimate transmitters with a constant scanning of activity in the communication channel.

For the transmitter, we sum the energy consumption of XBee and ATMega2560 devices in the jammer scenario. Then, we calculate the energy consumption of each jammer device with the previously stated times and with the electrical characteristics presented in Table 1 . The results of total energy consumption for the different devices are presented in Table 6 . The results are consistent with the methodology and the works that analyze these types of strategies. The constant jammer has higher energy consumption than the other devices and the reactive strategy. In particular, the energy consumption of constant strategy is 40% higher than the transmitter and 118% from the reactive jammer.",

            "text": "However, is interesting to remark that the energy consumption of the transceiver does not present great variations. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, the XBee has a lower energy consumption than the ideal scenario with 207.82 J from 210.80 J. This behavior is because the current consumption in the transmitting mode is lower than the idle mode. As a consequence, when a lot of retransmission occurs, the transmitting mode generates more active time, and this compensates for the energy consumption of the ideal scenario as shown in Figure 16 . A similar behavior accounts for the reactive jamming implemented in the XBee devices. Additionally, the energy consumption of the transmitters in the worst scenario from the reactive strategy is 35% lower with a incidence rate of r j = 0.19 that corresponds to the ratio between the used time to generate the interference 173 s from the total time of the experiment t xp . As a consequence, the attacker could severely impact the lifetime of the networks using transceivers with similar characteristics. We recommend the use of devices with higher energy efficiency between the transmitting and idle state to improve the lifetime of the network and the implementation of sleep times is mandatory to extend the lifetime. Additionally, the detection of the attacker is mandatory to preserve the integrity of the users in smart environments.",

For a 35% lower energy consumption, a reactive strategy can fully discharge the battery of smart devices. Therefore, we recommend that detection algorithms should use RSS values, PDR metric, and the ACK frames status report to improve the integrity of the devices and the network. A reasonable approach to tackle this issue could be to use AI or machine learning techniques to improve the detection of these types of attacks.",

The performance measures obtained by the experimental testbed were correlated with analytical models. Results showed a good correlation of the performance metrics for the ideal and the attacker scenarios. In particular, we acquired experimental data that shows that for one interferer in the communication, the SINR allows us to predict the behavior of the PRR using the regression model. For our experimental scenario, considering one interferer and a maximum of 4 contending nodes, an SINR of 3.1 dB ensures the reception of half of the total packets. Additionally, for values of SINR greater than 4.5 dB, the goodput and PRR converge and have the same behavior as the ideal scenario without the presence of attackers. Conversely, when two interferers are present in the network, the range of SINR and the PRR-to-SINR regression model varies drastically. However, we found that with a threshold of 3.1 dBm between the interferers nodes, the reception of packets is possible. Additionally, a similar threshold value between the transmitter and the interferer with higher a RSS from the sink is needed to guarantee the reception.",
