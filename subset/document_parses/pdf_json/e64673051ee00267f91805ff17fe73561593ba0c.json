SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has infected over 200 million individuals and claimed the lives of over 4 million of them (https://covid19. who.int/). COVID-19 continues to periodically surge in many parts of the world. Even though highly effective vaccines were identified and granted emergency use authorization in 2020, most middle-and lower-income countries have yet to obtain and distribute sufficient doses to afford large-scale protection against new infections. Furthermore, viral variants that arise during replication threaten to diminish the protective efficacy of first-generation COVID-19 vaccines [1] .",

Enormous financial incentives and novel funding mechanisms ensued [2] . Private companies readily took up the challenge and advanced candidate vaccines into human studies in record time. In many cases they employed platform technologies, such as recombinant adenovirus 26 and mRNA, that had been explored in the development of vaccines to prevent HIV, Ebola, influenza and other infectious diseases [3] . The scientific community, especially HIV vaccine trialists with established clinical sites, community relationships and laboratory procedures, quickly pivoted and formed new alliances to demonstrate the success of those vaccines [4] . Now, 40 years after the first report of the disease now known as AIDS, proof that an HIV vaccine is possible, has relied heavily on active and passive vaccine studies in non-human primates (NHP), the RV144 phase 2b trial in Thailand, and studies of passively administered monoclonal antibodies in NHP and, more recently, humans [5] [6] [7] [8] The scientific challenges faced in the quest to identify a safe and effective HIV vaccine remain unchanged: enormous variability in the outer membrane envelope, which enables evasion from immune responses; a \"glycan shield\" that hides sites that might otherwise be vulnerable to antibody (Ab) neutralization, and the absence of financial incentives that would sway the private sector to put their full weight into the effort [9] .",

The G8 called for creation of an alliance of researchers from around the globe to synergize efforts, avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts, standardize laboratory measurements to permit valid comparisons among studies and promote greater capacity for the manufacture and distribution of any vaccine. This call to action inspired the formation of two new collaborative inter-disciplinary programs that focus on advancing novel vaccine designs, that is, The Center for AIDS Vaccine Immunology, now the Center for AIDS Vaccine Development and the Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery (CAVD). Notably, CAVD researchers are required to share data with others in the CAVD program prior to publication, and CAVD awards include global access requirements. About the same time, the HIV Vaccine Trials Network was expanded to include more international sites, especially in Africa and South America, which has proven key to the successful conduct of efficacy studies for both HIV and SARS-CoV-2. The evolution of these and other important collaborative efforts, including EAVI2020 and Accelerate the Development of Vaccines and New Technologies to Combat the AIDS Epidemic (ADVANCE), are summarized in Feinberg et al.

To date, one study conducted in Thailand showed modest vaccine efficacy, which appeared to wane over time [6, 19] . A modified version of that vaccine, when tested in a higher incidence population in South Africa, failed to show any efficacy [20] . Other advanced candidates have either failed to show efficacy or remain under study, as summarized in Kim et al. [7] . One novel vaccine design still in efficacy testing at the time of this writing is based on mosaic antigens, which were designed to afford broad coverage across HIV clades. The Imbokodo and Mosaico trials are evaluating a prime-boost regimen that combines an rAd26 vector and protein. Unfortunately, following a recommendation from its data and safety monitoring board, the Imbokodo study will not be moving forward to its second phase of follow-up due to inadequate efficacy although no safety concerns have been raised. Another study referred to as PrEPVacc is evaluating PrEP and two vaccine candidates: rDNA with gp120 boost and rDNA/gp140 followed by MVA/gp140 boost. This novel multi-arm, multistage adaptive trial will employ an averted infection ratio method to determine efficacy. These trials, other on-going and past vaccine studies, as well as innovative studies of bNAbs, native envelope trimers, germline targeting immunogens, mRNA and new adjuvants are reviewed in Kim et al.

Structural studies have provided insights as to how to modify the HIV envelope to expose sites that are vulnerable to neutralization, as well as how to develop stable, \"authentic\" looking HIV envelope trimers. Understanding how the enormous glycan shield on the HIV envelope protein masks certain sites of vulnerability has led researchers to produce immunogens designed to induce antibodies that are \"on target\" and avoid inducing antibodies that are \"off target.\" Recent technical advances now enable the identification of the sites of antibody binding at an atomic level.",

Detailed studies of how both the HIV envelope and the body's Ab response evolve over time in those individuals have led to a strategy that attempts to replicate that evolutionary process through sequential immunization with multiple immunogens [22] . The first step along this pathway is to devise an immunogen that activates unmutated common ancestors of the desired bNAb, followed by boosting with different immunogens designed to \"mature\" the response to one that includes plasma cells producing the desired bNAb.

Subsequent studies initially described at the R4P conference in early 2021 demonstrated that this immunogen could expand such cells in human volunteers [25] . This is perhaps the most promising study to date supporting the hypothesis that vaccines might be able to do better than the immune responses and induce bNAbs that neutralize HIV upon its entry into the body, or that immune memory of such responses will be sufficiently fast and durable to prevent the establishment of infection. Now comes the challenge of determining what additional immunogen(s) are required to trigger further B-cell development along the desired pathway, which could benefit from the application of mRNA vaccine technology used in COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, responses will need to be more durable and broader than the CD4 binding site targeted by VRC01.",

Two studies of a passively administered bNAb, VRC01, to volunteers at risk for HIV infection were completed recently. As summarized in Miner et al. [8] , infusions of VRC01 administered every 8 weeks did not prevent infection overall, but VRC01 was highly effective at preventing infection with strains of HIV that were susceptible to VRC01 in vitro at the level of Ab achieved in the trial. This has led to the hypothesis that protection could be achieved following administration of mixtures of bNABs (or bivalent or trivalent bNAbs) that are sufficiently potent to neutralize a high percentage of viruses in vivo. Such studies are underway or planned. Importantly, the results of that initial VRC01 trial demonstrated that neutralization in the TZMbl/pseudovirus in vitro assay can reliably predict protection from HIV infection in humans, thus, setting the stage for a rationale selection of antibodies that could prove highly effective [24] .",

If Mosaico shows a modest or better level of efficacy, then hope remains that induction of antibodies that bind to but do not necessarily neutralize HIV, along with HIV-specific T cells could prove beneficial. If the results are \"modest\" (i.e., lower bound of efficacy estimate above zero but not sufficiently high to warrant licensure, e.g., <70%), then efforts to improve upon those results will likely fall to the corporate sponsor, governments and non-profit partners. Whether such a collaborative effort will be undertaken will likely depend on the progress made with other passive and active immunization strategies as well as the uptake of existing prevention measures. If, however, efficacy is sufficiently high to warrant licensure, then attention will need to turn to tackling implementation issues including bridging to other populations and other virus clades.",

These questions have important ramification for health care systems in both highly and under-resourced settings. How best to obtain prequalification from the World Health Organization (WHO) and a positive recommendation of WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, the role of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and gathering of real-world effectiveness data will need to be tackled.
