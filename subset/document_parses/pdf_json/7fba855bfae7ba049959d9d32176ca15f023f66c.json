Therefore, we investigate the evolution of the complexity of the cryptocurrency market and analyze the characteristics from the past bull market in 2017 to the present the COVID-19 pandemic. To confirm the evolutionary complexity of the cryptocurrency market, three general complexity analyses based on nonlinear measures were used: approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ). We analyzed the market complexity/unpredictability for 43 cryptocurrency prices that have been trading until recently. In addition, three non-parametric tests suitable for non-normal distribution comparison were used to cross-check quantitatively. Finally, using the sliding time window analysis, we observed the change in the complexity of the cryptocurrency market according to events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination. This study is the first to confirm the complexity/unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market from the bull market to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We find that ApEn, SampEn, and LZ complexity metrics of all markets could not generalize the COVID-19 effect of the complexity due to different patterns. However, market unpredictability is increasing by the ongoing health crisis.",

The financial markets seems to have stabilized, but the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic in 2020. The global economy is once again in panic; this follows the global financial crisis in 2008. Consumer consumption has changed, and the types and quantities of products have also changed. Many companies are trying to escape from the panic by the changes in business and marketing, but they are still unable to recover their business or reduce their financial burden easily. In addition, the unemployment rate and the COVID-19 incidence rate are still not improving. As the liquidity of capital decreases in many ways due to these changes, there is also a phenomenon of seeking new investment destinations. Recent studies show that the effect of the recently developed COVID-19 vaccine will improve real assets and financial assets [4] [5] [6] . The cryptocurrency market also shows a sharp decline due to COVID-19 after booming in 2017. The cryptocurrency market is now a new financial market that needs a lot of research, including research on the impact of COVID-19. However, there has not been much research on predicting the future of the cryptocurrency market or measuring its impact on COVID-19. Therefore, from an investment perspective, we aim to examine the evolution of the complexity of the cryptocurrency market and analyze the characteristics of the market from the past bull market to the present COVID-19 pandemic outbreak to help policymakers and decision-makers ensure future stability.",

Using information theory, a study of comparing the price movement of major cryptocurrencies and measuring informational efficiency was conducted [19, 20] . Goodell and Goutte [21] studies the co-movement of bitcoin and COVID-19. Additionally, a multi-scale bi-dimensional approach is studied for analyzing complex time-series [22] . Others investigate the market entropy [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] but concentrate on the short-term patterns. This study is the first to understand the mid-term to long-term social phenomena from the bull of cryptocurrency in 2017 to the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, it has been over 10 years since the cryptocurrency market started, and many cryptocurrencies have been newly developed and disappeared due to various issues. Therefore, analyzing all the cryptocurrency markets that are being traded stably so far can provide quantitative detailed market information without hastily generalizing all markets, including comparison tests in accordance with the market caps.",

            "text": "To investigate the evolutionary complexity, we conduct three general complexity analyses on the basis of nonlinear measures. First, Pincus [28] introduced Approximate Entropy (ApEn) which is suitable for measuring sequential and temporal regularity/irregularity of time series based on the existence of patterns in 1991. ApEn can represent the probability of a pattern that has not appeared so far [29] . Therefore, ApEn is one of the most popular metrics to estimate complexity and regularity. However, ApEn has bias, consistency, and dependence on the sample length because ApEn counts each sequence as matching itself [30] . To overcome the disadvantages of ApEn, Richman and Moorman [30] proposed the Sample Entropy (SampEn) in 2000 which does not count self-matches, so that SampEn is a more consistent and robust estimator than ApEn. SampEn is independent of the sample length. Therefore, we choose SampEn as the second complexity measurement methodology for comparing and analyzing the result values of ApEn for cross-checks and look at the complexity of time series data in various views. Finally, Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ) [31] measures whether a new non-repetitive pattern exists in a time sequence. These metrics can easily determine the nonlinear and non-stationary sequence without any special prior distributional assumptions. The approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ) are alternative tools for time series analysis for capturing nonlinear dynamics. In addition, scholars applied these entropies to several fields in econophysics [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] and financial phenomena [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Therefore, in this paper, we apply these three metrics to the price sequence of the cryptocurrency market for investigating the evolutionary unpredictability or complexity. Rather than trusting only one algorithm, it seems important to cross-check with several algorithms. In addition, using the sliding time window analysis, we observed how the complexity of the cryptocurrency market changes with time and how it changes with events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination. Although COVID-19 is still undergoing, the findings of this study can help related agents and global policymakers develop the right decisions for the short, mid, and long-term, ultimately contributing to reducing market uncertainty.",

To analyze the growth of cryptocurrency to the COVID-19 pandemic, we used a period of approximately four years from January 2017 to July 2021. We excluded the recently developed markets and those with discontinued trading now. We obtained price data in 43 out of 367 cryptocurrencies with 1692 data points for each. Table 1 presents the list of 43 cryptocurrency markets in descending order from the largest market cap. Figure 1 presents the evolution of prices from 2017 when the cryptocurrency was growing to the recent pandemic. To compare the similarity patterns of the data, we scaled the prices of all markets equally between 0 and 1. As you can see, the dynamics of the market appear differently according to each period. In terms of trend, overall prices rose sharply in 2017 and 2018, and although there was often a move to increase in 2019 and 2020, it was limited by COVID-19. The trend of the cryptocurrency market shows that prices rose sharply in 2017 and 2018, followed by a stagnant move until the recent COVID-19. Again from 2020, prices are rising sharply with COVID-19. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the complexity of the cryptocurrency market through the entropy evolution in order to understand the rapid fluctuations from the past with small economic risks to the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 2 presents the results of the three complexity algorithms. ApEn and SampEn gradually increased until the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The LZ complexity distribution increased as it widened in 2019\u223c2020 more than in 2017\u223c2018. The median in 2019 was the highest in the entire period. In descriptive statistics, the interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion and a widely accepted robust measure of scale. The IQR is equal to the difference between 75th and 25th (Q1) percentiles, and most of the values for each year were within the 1.5 \u00d7 IQR.

However, in market cap the top \"1-50%\", the complexity has been continuously increasing from 2017 to 2020, and we observed no particular decrease. It also was confirmed that the complexity/unpredictability of the cryptocurrencies with a market cap of \"51-100%\" was very low in 2018 compared to other years. The distribution of ApEn has significantly increased in 2019 and 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2017 and 2018). Furthermore, in particular, it shows that complexity/unpredictability increased more in 2020 than in 2019 in each market cap result. In 2020, the complexity of the \"51-75%\" market cap has the widest range of IQR, so it shows that cryptocurrency with a very diverse complexity is distributed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in market cap being the top \"51-75%\". (bottom left of Figure 3 ). Second, the SampEn results did not differ from the ApEn results in all cryptocurrency markets. (middle of Figure 2 ). Furthermore, the SampEn results and ApEn results were similar even after looking at the detailed results of the complexity of the cryptocurrency market according to the market cap. The difference between the result of SampEn and the result of ApEn can be confirmed in that the IQR of SampEn has a narrower result than that of ApEn. That is, it showed that the density of complexity of the cryptocurrencies appeared more in SampEn than ApEn. (Figure 4) .",

However, it includes only data up to 2020, when the coronavirus occurred, and excludes 2021, when a vaccine is being developed and the global vaccination rate is increasing. The reason is that there are about 365 samples per year from 2017 to 2020, but there are 232 samples in 2021. Because 2021 is not over, the sample numbers for 2021 are different from other years. If there is a difference in the number of samples, a problem may arise when comparing by year. There will be a problem with the reliability of time evolution and the robustness of statistics. To solve this problem, the sliding time window analysis [20] is necessary to analyze the changes of the dynamic behavior of complexity in the cryptocurrency market from 2017 to 2021 to quantitatively compare the complexity of 2021 when the vaccination rate is increasing and mutations occur. For robustness of entropy, the time window is set to 1 quarter (90 days). Moreover, the results of the COVID-19 test have a weekly trend because vaccine tests are mainly conducted on weekdays. Therefore, a time interval is set to 2 weeks (14 days) for stable calculation that is not affected by the weekly trend. Figure 6 shows the time evolution of three complexity measures over time. It shows the trend of complexity in the cryptocurrency market. In the case of ApEn, it shows the lowest point in 2017, but the ApEn value is gradually increasing, and it is maintained at a high level in 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak. The overall volatility has increased even though a vaccine was developed in 2021. SampEn is similar to ApEn, but after 2020, it has been slightly different. With the advent of COVID-19, it has always had a high value, but with the news of vaccine development, the unpredictability seemed to decrease. However, in 2021, the value of SampEn starts to increase again, showing the highest unpredictability in history in July. The volatility is larger than that of ApEn. Lastly, the LZ complexity showed the highest value in the middle of 2019 but has decreased since the advent of COVID-19 and has been a steady upward trend until now. In summary, the cryptocurrency market has recently increased in complexity and thus unpredictability is increasing. Although the complexity of the cryptocurrency market has temporarily decreased due to the development of a vaccine, the complexity of the cryptocurrency market has still been increasing since then. Vaccination rates are rising worldwide, but it is estimated that many other factors, such as the emergence of the delta virus or foreshadowing of tapering, are adding to the complexity of the cryptocurrency market.

We also describe the market characteristics in detail and conduct comparison tests in accordance with the market caps. The market prices could have recorded the highest number in 2017 and 2018. However, the actual complexity has increased in the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in more unpredictable patterns. All complexity metrics of all markets showed different patterns, so we could not determine that the unpredictability was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak alone. Given the outliers exceeding the 1.5 \u00d7 IQR of distribution, the complexity or unpredictability in all markets might be different from that of each market cap size. The results of the three non-parametric tests are suitable for non-normal distribution comparisons, and the average of metrics has increased until the COVID-19 pandemic. ApEn and SampEn reject the null hypothesis in the same way regardless of the market cap. LZ complexity is useful in interpreting the evolution of complexity because it quantitatively and differently rejected the null hypothesis for each market cap. Furthermore, in the case of ApEn and SampEn, the complexity showed a steady increase from 2017 to 2020. In particular, 2019 and 2020, which were affected by COVID-19, were high, and 2020 was the highest.
