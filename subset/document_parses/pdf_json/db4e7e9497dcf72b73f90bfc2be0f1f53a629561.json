To reduce the suffering of victims, this paper focuses on how to establish an effective emergency logistics system. We first propose a multiobjective optimization model in which the location and allocation decisions are made for a three-level logistics network. ree objectives, deprivation costs, unsatisfied demand costs, and logistics cost, are adopted in the proposed optimization model. Several cardinality and flow balance constraints are considered simultaneously. en, we design a novel effective IFA-GA algorithm by combining the firefly algorithm and genetic algorithm to solve this complex model effectively. Furthermore, three schemes are proposed to improve the effectiveness of the IFA-GA algorithm. Finally, the numerical results provide several insights on the theory and practice of relief distribution, which also illustrate the validity of the proposed solution algorithm.",

We study a location-allocation problem of emergency logistics. ree objectives, deprivation costs, unsatisfied demand losses, and logistics costs, are adopted in the proposed optimization model. e fairness objective of this paper equalizes the supplies between affected areas, which has the same purpose as unmet demand minimization in [14] . In addition, our literature also lies in the stream of multiobjective programming, which is widely used to solve emergency optimization problems. Sun et al. [15] proposed a robust optimization model to decide the facility location, resource allocation, and casualty transportation in a threelevel rescue chain composed of casualty clusters, temporary facilities, and general hospitals. eir objectives are to minimize the total Injury Severity Score (ISS) and logistics cost. Zhou et al. [2] studied the multiperiod dynamic emergency resource scheduling problem by a proposed multiobjective optimization model. Cao et al. [16] proposed a multiobjective nonlinear programming model for resource distribution regarding the beneficiary perspective on sustainability. e model is solved by maximizing the lowest victims' perceived satisfaction and minimizing the largest deviation of victims' perceived satisfaction. \u00c7elik et al.

[18] developed a method to value the objective functions of emergency logistics based on expert preferences over five key attributes. ey found that the amount of cargo delivered is the most valued objective and cost the least important. In a similar vein, we conduct the optimization problem based on a three-level emergency logistics network. Considering the complexity of reality, we formulate the problem by a multiobjective mixed-integer nonlinear programming with cardinality and flow balance constraints.",

Fortunately, both FA and GA have specific and understandable procedures which are easy to implement. Furthermore, both of them are suitable to be hybridized with other optimizers due to their multimodalities. Inspired by these privileges, we introduce an IFA-GA algorithm by combining the desirable characteristics of FA and GA. e emergency logistics model of this paper includes location decisions and allocation decisions.

GA outdoes FA in each case, with almost the same objective values as PSD but a much lower run time. Additionally, the increase in LDPs brings more objective costs, but the increase in RTCs takes lower objective costs. e result can be obtained by comparing the case I \ufffd 20, J \ufffd 100 with the case I \ufffd 50, J \ufffd 100. e reason is that the increase in RTCs can reduce the deprivation costs effectively, which enlightens us that more RTCs are recommended to be established when faced with large-scale disasters.

First, RTCs should be located closer to rescue demand to decrease the human suffering caused by deprivation. Second, in a large-scale disaster scenario, more RTCs should be established to provide fast relief. In the theoretical aspect, we validated the efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm, which has an excellent performance in convergence and computation time.",

An effective emergency logistics occupies a pivotal position to relieve human suffering and mitigate losses after disasters.is paper proposes a multiobjective optimization model for relief distribution. e relief supplies are transferred in a three-level logistics network which includes an SNS, some RTCs, and LDPs. e location decision of RTCs and resource allocation decision from SNS to RTCs and from RTCs to LDPs should be made in postdisasters. We present three objectives, deprivation costs, unsatisfied demand costs, and logistics cost, in this location-allocation optimization model, in which several cardinality and flow balance constraints are considered simultaneously. Realizing the complexity of the problem, we design a novel IFA-GA algorithm by combining classical FA and GA. ree schemes are proposed to improve the effectiveness of the IFA-GA algorithm. e results from numerical studies provide several insights on the theory and practice of relief distribution, which also illustrate the validity of the proposed solution algorithm.is study is not exhaustive. We only present a simplified model and ignore some factors which will make the model more complex. For example, the uncertainty factors, such as delivery time and quantity, are not considered in the proposed model. Multiple transport and multiple periods are also not investigated in our model. erefore, we may extend the proposed model to an uncertain situation by using robust optimization theory or distributionally robust theory for future work. Furthermore, more hybrid algorithms that combine exact and metaheuristic approaches should be exploited to solve the proposed optimization model effectively in the future.Data Availability e data were included in the manuscript.",
