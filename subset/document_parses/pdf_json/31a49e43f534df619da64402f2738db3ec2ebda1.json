Although progress has been made in the global access of antiretroviral treatment (ART), the UNAIDS 2020 global targets were not achieved because of structural and individual barriers. Therefore, the global targets are being revised for the 2025-2030 timeframe [1] . In this article, we will discuss the current state of HIV treatment and prevention and describe the research agenda that will help advance the next generation of strategies. In the context of this rapidly evolving prevention and treatment landscape, the levels of efficacy expected from an HIV vaccine increase. While using some of the lessons learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, we will also point out that a safe, efficacious and durable HIV vaccine is achievable and remains a worthy goal.",

Current estimates of adherence suggest that 59% of PLWH are virus-free worldwide and thus can expect relatively normal life spans [2] . Furthermore, global endorsement of \"undetectable equals untransmissible\", also known as U = U, makes ART the most potent and widely used preventive approach today [3] . The first longacting injectable ART regimen delivered via monthly injection has been approved by regulatory authorities. Additional long-acting formulations are in development, including several containing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that could potentially extend the injection time from once every 6 months to once a year. Simplified delivery of long-acting combinations will result in both greater population coverage and durable virologic suppression. Furthermore, greater population coverage with these potent, durable regimens will boost the role of treatment as prevention in helping to control the global HIV pandemic. With these significant periods of time between doses, long-acting ART may well soon become a preferred option for treatment of PLWH.",

            "text": "Except for barrier methods and adult medical male circumcision, all successful HIV prevention methods rely on antiretroviral drugs [4, 5] . The hypothesis has been that if there is a sufficient concentration of drug blocking HIV replication in the exposed tissues, then virus cannot establish infection, allowing the individual to remain HIV-free. Studies of different drug regimens of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have shown that with adherence, protection from acquisition of HIV is remarkably high, greater than 95% and consistent across populations [6] . However, with only approximately a million PrEP users in 70 countries, the full impact of this powerful preventive tool is far from being fully achieved [6] . A major challenge facing PrEP-based HIV prevention has been the lack of sustained use by individuals who would gain the most benefit from the intervention. In studies comparing methods to improve PrEP rollout, high PrEP uptake and initiation was achieved at onset, but was then followed by significant levels of PrEP discontinuation [7] . One strategy to address adherence challenges has been the development of long-acting PrEP. In 2020, PrEP trials of an injectable drug, administered every 8 weeks, demonstrated superior efficacy compared to the standard daily oral PrEP among atrisk women and men. This significant achievement will soon lead to drug approval and implementation [8, 9] . As with therapy, new agents for PrEP are moving forward in the evaluation process that could increase the amount of time between doses to once or twice a year. This could lead to increased adherence, with significant improvements in effectiveness and less burden on the health system, compared to daily pills.",

Acknowledging that the natural immunity that is induced by current HIV vaccines or HIV infection does not provide protection, the new tools that SARS CoV-2 can provide help to iterate vaccine strategies faster [15, 16] . Addressing the fundamental challenges of HIV vaccine development, combined with operationalizing new concepts, and fostering significant industry engagement will be the research focus for the next decade.
