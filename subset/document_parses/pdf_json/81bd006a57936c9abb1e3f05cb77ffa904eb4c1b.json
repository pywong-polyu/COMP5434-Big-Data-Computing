            "text": "Purpose. Sepsis originates from the host inflammatory response, especially to bacterial infections, and is considered one of the main causes of death in intensive care units. Various agents have been developed to inhibit mediators of the inflammatory response; one prospective agent is \u03b2-sitosterol (\u03b2S), a phytosterol with a structure similar to cholesterol. This study is aimed at evaluating the effects of \u03b2S on the biomarkers of inflammation and liver function in cecal ligation and puncture-(CLP-) induced septic rats. Methods. Thirty male Wistar rats were divided equally into six groups as follows: sham, CLP, CLP+dexamethasone (DX, 0.2 mg/kg), CLP+\u03b2S (1 mg/kg), CLP+imipenem (IMI, 20 mg/kg), and CLP+IMI (20 mg/kg)+\u03b2S (1 mg/kg). Serum levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, AST, ALT, and liver glutathione (GSH) were assessed by ELISA. Liver expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baBi mRNAs were evaluated by RT-qPCR. Results. Serum concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, ALT, and AST and mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baBi were all significantly higher in septic rats than in normal rats (p < 0:05). Liver GSH content was markedly lower in the CLP group than that in the sham group. \u03b2S-treated rats had remarkably lower levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baBi, AST, and ALT (51. 79%, 62.63%, 41.46%, 54.35%, 94.37%, 95.30%, 34.87%, and 46.53% lower, respectively) and greater liver GSH content (35.71% greater) compared to the CLP group (p < 0:05). Conclusion. \u03b2S may play a protective role in the septic process by mitigating inflammation. This effect is at least partly mediated by inhibition of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Thus, \u03b2S can be considered as a supplementary treatment in septic patients.",

It remains one of the major causes of death specifically in intensive care units. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), sepsis affects more than 30 million people each year, causing approximately six million deaths worldwide [1] . Excessive and uncontrolled response to infection, septic shock, and acute failure of one or multiple organs such as the liver, kidney, and lungs can occur and may result in death in sepsis patients [2, 3] . It has been reported that liver dysfunction is a subsequent result of sepsis, confirmed by higher serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lower glutathione (GSH) content [3] .",

            "text": "Cytokines, defined as a group of endogenous inflammatory and immune-modulating proteins, play a dominant role in sepsis syndrome. Exacerbated production of both proand anti-inflammatory cytokines results in a situation called \"cytokine cascade.\" A cytokine cascade is initiated when a host is targeted by stimuli such as bacterial endotoxins, which induce the production of early cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1\u03b2). Overproduction of early cytokines has been associated with multiple end-organ dysfunction and mortality [4] . Along with endotoxins, these cytokines are able to stimulate the production of later cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). Interestingly, IL-6 is responsible for the downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which might be vital in limiting the cytokine cascade [2] . Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) also plays a regulatory role in the cytokine cascade and is activated in numerous cell types by endotoxins, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2. Activation of NF-\u03baB is a pivotal step for the transcription of many cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8. However, as activation of NF-\u03baB increases, the transcription of NF-\u03baB inhibitor (NF-\u03baBi) also rises. The protein product of NF-\u03baBi, I\u03baB\u03b1, is an indicator of NF-\u03baB activation. Newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 translocates into the nucleus and terminates NF-\u03baB activation by binding to the activated dimer. NF-\u03baBi level increases in response to inflammation and decreases when appropriate treatment is given [5] . Furthermore, the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway has been reported to play a role in hepatic injury [6] . In addition to the cytokine cascade, several studies have demonstrated that the balance between pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines is a major factor determining the severity of sepsis [7, 8] . In vitro studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a regulatory factor that blocks TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 [4] and many studies have found higher concentrations of IL-10 in patients with sepsis [9, 10] (Figure 1 ).",

Several in vitro studies have revealed \u03b2S to possess anti-inflammatory properties. \u03b2S has been shown to have antiatherogenic potential through its anti-inflammatory action on human aortic endothelial cells [13] . Similarly, it has been reported that \u03b2S causes a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in endotoxin-activated human monocytes [13, 14] . It has been found that \u03b2S has beneficial effects on the immune system by increasing the number of viable peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and activating the swine dendritic cells (DCs) [15] . Moreover, \u03b2S has been evaluated as an anti-inflammatory agent in a number of animal models in in vivo experiments. Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of \u03b2S have been demonstrated in several animal models, including fattener pigs after receiving a mod-ified live porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vaccine [15] , rats with oxazolone-induced contact-delayed type hypersensitivity [16] , and mice with ovalbumin-induced lung inflammation [17] . Clinical studies represented the potential immunomodulatory effects of \u03b2S in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), stressinduced immune suppression, rheumatoid arthritis, and allergic rhinitis and sinusitis [14] .",

Serum levels of AST and ALT were determined using commercially available ELISA kits (Pars Azmoon Inc., Tehran, Iran) and according to the manufacturer's instructions. The serum ALT levels were measured based on two parallel reactions. Firstly, ALT transfers the amino group of alanine to \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid. The products of this reaction are pyruvate and glutamate. Then, lactate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate to lactate while oxidizing NADH to NAD + . This oxidation results in a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, and this reduction is proportional to the ALT level in the sample [18] . Relatively similar reactions were used to measure the serum AST levels. AST transfers the amino group of aspartate to \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid to form oxaloacetate and glutamate. Then, malate dehydrogenase changes oxaloacetate to malate while oxidizing NADH to NAD + [19] . The absorbance was measured using an ELISA plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). 3 BioMed Research International 2.6. GSH Content.

We observed lower levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10 serum levels in the \u03b2S-treated group compared with the CLP group. Although adding \u03b2S to IMI treatment did not significantly alter IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels, it resulted in a remarkable decrease in IL-10 serum level compared with IMI alone, suggesting that \u03b2S might help to control the inflammation caused by cytokine cascade via modulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, \u03b2S treatment caused a significantly greater reduction in IL-6 level compared with DX. Glucocorticoids such as DX are proven anti-inflammatory agents in sepsis management. Glucocorticoid therapy interferes with the production of [27] reported that DX administration decreased IL-6 production in a CLP-induced sepsis study. Given this context, the statistically distinct reduction of IL-6 by \u03b2S supports the potential usefulness of \u03b2S in sepsis-induced inflammation. Our observations on the effects of \u03b2S on inflammatory cytokines are in agreement with several other studies. One recent study suggested a negative correlation between \u03b2S and IL-6 levels in an animal model of obesity-related chronic inflammation [28] . Another study revealed a decrease in IL-1\u03b2 levels in murine-activated neutrophils following \u03b2S therapy [29] . However, our data on the effects of \u03b2S on serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 is not in agreement with a study conducted by Alappat et al. [30] on the immune function of macrophages. Their findings demonstrated higher serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 in the \u03b2S group compared with the sham group. These contradictory results might be due to different dosages, times of sampling, and the type of experimental study (i.e., in vitro vs. in vivo).

The stabilization of NF-\u03baBi mRNA by \u03b2S is believed to be the mechanism underlying TNF-\u03b1 downregulation, reducing its phosphorylation, and consecutively depleting the nuclear NF-\u03baB complex [35] . The most striking result that emerges from our data is that the administration of \u03b2S and DX both resulted in significantly lower levels of TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baBi mRNA expression compared to the CLP group (p < 0:0001), and the level of expression was the same between the \u03b2S and DX groups as confirmed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test (p > 0:05). This further supports that \u03b2S could be considered as an effective intervention for controlling sepsis-induced inflammation. Liver injury is common among sepsis patients. The incidence of liver dysfunction varies in different studies from 34% to 46% [36] . Along with the sepsis-associated liver injury, other liver injuries such as diseases caused by hepatitis B and C viruses, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and drug-induced injuries are also common among sepsis patients [37] . Elevation of serum AST and ALT and reduction of liver GSH are signs of liver malfunction [3] . In our experiment, compared with the sham group, CLP rats had significantly higher levels of AST and ALT. These levels were markedly lower in the \u03b2S-treated rats. Similarly, compared with the sham group, liver GSH content was significantly lower in the CLP group, and \u03b2S treatment restored the GSH content. Furthermore, the level of GSH in the \u03b2S group was significantly greater than that in the DX group. The addition of \u03b2S to IMI (IMI+\u03b2S group) also resulted in significantly lower levels of ALT and significantly Figure 4 : mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baBi in liver tissue.

Our data confirm the results provided by Wong et al. [38] , which demonstrated the favorable effects of \u03b2S against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity with significant improvements in AST, ALT, and GSH levels. Liver dysfunction during sepsis is associated with an increased risk of multiple organ failure and death. Mortality occurs in up to 68% of sepsis patients with liver dysfunction [36] . Data from our study, showing reduced serum levels of AST and ALT, suggest that \u03b2S may improve liver function in sepsis. Redox imbalance and severe oxidative stress occur in critically ill sepsis patients and can cause multiple organ failure [39, 40] . Glutathione is the primary antioxidant in cells, meaning that the lower the glutathione content, the greater the risk of organ failure becomes [41] . Thus, increased liver GSH content with \u03b2S treatment indicates that it may improve prognosis and limit liver dysfunction in sepsis.",

In another study by Sen et al. [43] , the antibacterial activity of \u03b2S was examined using the agar disk diffusion method. \u03b2S was found to be effective against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They reported that the antibacterial activity of \u03b2S (20 \u03bcg/mL) was almost equivalent to that of gentamicin (20 \u03bcg/mL). Similarly, Bur\u010dov\u00e1 et al.

A wide range of bacteria were affected by \u03b2S in these studies, and this can potentially provide additional benefits for sepsis patients. More pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are required to fully evaluate the antibacterial properties of \u03b2S in sepsis.",

By dampening the hyperinflammatory damage, \u03b2S may provide some benefits in diseases with molecular patterns similar to sepsis, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 . It has been demonstrated that the extensive release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 is associated with increased mortality risk in COVID-19 patients [45] . Moreover, this cytokine storm may lead to liver dysfunction in these patients as ele-vated AST/ALT levels are widely reported in the literature [46] . The potential benefits of \u03b2S supplementation in COVID-19 could be investigated in future research. The disturbance of immune cells, including a drastic depletion of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, occurs in sepsis patients [47] . The evaluation of the effects of \u03b2S on the status of immune cells is warranted in future studies.",

In our study, we observed that treatment with \u03b2S at a dose of 1 mg/kg for two days results in a significant reduction of proinflammatory cytokines in the sera of CLP-induced septic rats. Liver expression of TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baBi was also reduced in rats treated with \u03b2S. Similarly, the addition of \u03b2S to IMI led to an improvement in the serum and liver inflammatory markers compared to IMI alone at three days after sepsis induction. We concluded that \u03b2S has noticeable potential for consideration as an anti-inflammatory supplement in hyperinflammatory conditions such as sepsis. Our findings would seem to suggest that \u03b2S targets NF-\u03baB as a major regulator of cytokine cascade and inhibits inflammatory response to a great extent. Liver dysfunction is common among sepsis patients and is associated with a poor prognosis. Here, we found that \u03b2S treatment effectively lowered the levels of serum biomarkers of liver dysfunction (AST and ALT) and increased the liver GSH content in septic rats. Thus, \u03b2S could alleviate liver oxidative stress and could inhibit possible organ dysfunction. The results so far are encouraging and promising, and this could eventually lead to a better understanding of the beneficial effects of \u03b2S against hyperinflammation. Future research should provide further insight into the potential use of \u03b2S in sepsis and similar clinical conditions with systemic inflammation.",

An increase in the early proinflammatory elements (such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) results in the production of other inflammatory factors such as NF-\u03baB, IL-6, and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. An uncontrolled cytokine cascade will lead to sepsis and, in severe cases, to septic shock. Tissue/organ dysfunction or end-organ damage might occur following progressive cytokine imbalance.
