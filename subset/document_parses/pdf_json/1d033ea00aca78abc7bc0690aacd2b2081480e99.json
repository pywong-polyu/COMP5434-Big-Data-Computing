Diabetes represents one of the most important comorbidities related to the severity of viral infection caused by the new Sars-Cov-2. Diabetes patients have a higher risk of serious complications caused by Sars-Cov-2 infection, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, a hyperinflammatory state associated with multi-organ dysfunction. Given the importance of the link between COVID-19 and diabetes, it is essential to better manage glycemic normalization and infection in this category of patients to avoid serious complications. However, for some antidiabetes agents, there is evidence of efficacy against Sars-Cov-2 extra glycemic normalization. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the potential therapeutic benefits to fight Sars-Cov-2 infection with antidiabetic agents.",

As of now, 5.8 million positive cases and 360,000 deaths were recorded with over 250 countries affected [1] . COVID-19 infection is divided into three phases, the first slightly symptomatic or asymptomatic, the second and third more severe, with increased inflammatory status and cytokinic cascade causing multi-organ dysfunction resulting in fatal lung injury. Studies have shown that people with pre-existing chronic diseases such as diabetes are at increased risk of infection and serious complications. To date, there are no direct antivirals and effective vaccines against Sars-Cov-2 [2, 3] .",

            "text": "Diabetes is an important risk factor for viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. During the current global COVID-19 pandemic, diabetes has been identified as a primary risk factor for the development of severe Sars-Cov-2 viral infection pneumonia. Epidemiological data show that the risk of a fatal outcome of COVID-19 is up to 50% higher in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes. There are many factors that may increase the risk for diabetes patients with COVID-19; among them, the presence of a deficient immune system, a dysfunctional coagulation cascade, a hyperactive inflammatory state, in the elderly patient with diabetes, there is also almost always a cardiovascular disease that could explain the more severe outcome of COVID-19 infection. In addition, the Sars-Cov-2 virus uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein to enter the lung epithelial cells [4] [5] [6] . ACE2 has protective effects especially with regard to inflammation of the respiratory tract. COVID-19 infection in the most severe phases (two and three) reduces the expression of ACE2; this is one of the causes of hyperinflammation and respiratory failure. In the diabetic patient, ACE2 expression is altered, and this may cause an even more complicated clinical situation in the COVID-19 patient; moreover, the viral infection itself may cause a worsening of the diabetic disease with a glycemia that is difficult to control. [7] [8] [9] Another fundamental aspect to consider is that the DPP-4 protein (therapeutic target of gliptins) has been identified as a functional [10] , and to date, it is not certain whether it is also a functional receptor for Sars-Cov-2. In patients with diabetes, the expression of DPP-4 is altered and is responsible for overactive inflammation, which could further complicate the clinical situation [11] . Based on the considerations expressed, it emerges that the management of the patient with diabetes and COVID-19 positive is extremely delicate. The recommendations indicate that drug treatment for diabetes should not be discontinued during viral infection, if there are no particular contraindications; however, for some of them, there is evidence in the literature that shows their potential additional therapeutic role against COVID-19 infection.",

            "text": "It is now known that in the most severe stages of COVID-19 infection, an overactive and uncontrolled inflammatory system triggered by an uncontrolled cytokinic cascade is responsible for multi-organ dysfunction and fatal lung injury. The use of metformin has shown a decrease in inflammatory markers through different modes of action. Evidence has shown that metformin causes a decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAD(P)H) oxidase and the respiratory mitochondrial chain; other studies have suggested that metformin suppresses inflammatory response by inhibition of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB) through pathways dependent on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and through the blockade of 3-kinase phosphoinosis (PI3K)-Akt [13] . Other studies have shown that metformin reduces the production of NO, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1) by inhibition of Nf\u03baB activation in macrophages. Finally, there is evidence that metformin also suppresses inflammatory mediators specifically in lung tissue [14] damaged by viral infections such as SARS and MERS; however, its use in severe patients with COVID-19 should be carefully assessed in light of the risks of lactic acidosis in patients with renal dysfunction, which may be present in more severe COVID-19 cases [15] . Metformin use has shown a decrease in inflammatory markers in patients with SARS and MERS, but seems to have an additional advantage on viral infections, particularly on hepatitis C virus (HCV) [16, 17] and RNA viruses such as Sars-Cov-2. In addition, according to studies, metformin therapy reduces liver fibrosis in HCV patients [18] ; therefore, a protective role on the liver could be hypothesized even in the most severe stages caused by Sars-Cov 2 infection.",

It should also be emphasized that the enzymatic activity of DPP4 causes cleavage and may affect the function of several cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Some studies have suggested that a higher mortality rate and complications in people with diabetes and infected with MERS-CoV may be associated with a dysregulated DPP4-mediated immune response. DPP4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, etc.) are drugs of undoubted therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of diabetes. Recently, this class of drugs has been associated with pleiotropic therapeutic benefits that go beyond their lowering of glucose.
