Here, we investigated the interaction between complement and the platelet/neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)/thrombin axis, using COVID-19 clinical samples, cell-based inhibition studies and NETs/human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) co-cultures. Increased plasma levels of NETs, TF activity and sC5b-9 were detected in patients. Neutrophils yielded high tissue factor (TF) expression and released NETs carrying functionally active TF. Confirming our ex vivo findings, treatment of control neutrophils with COVID-19 platelet-rich plasma generated TFbearing NETs that induced thrombotic activity of HAEC. Thrombin or NETosis inhibition or C5aR1 blockade attenuated platelet-mediated NET-driven thrombogenicity. Serum isolated from COVID-19 patients induces complement activation in vitro, which is consistent with high complement activity in clinical samples. Complement inhibition at the level of C3 with compstatin Cp40 disrupted TF expression in neutrophils. In conclusion, we provide a mechanistic basis that reveals the pivotal role of complement and NETs in COVID-19 immmunothrombosis.",

The levels of these complexes were positively correlated with thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) activity, suggesting that activation of the TF/thrombin axis had occurred ( Figure 1B ,C). These findings were further confirmed ex vivo by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in neutrophils collected from four patients with severe COVID-19 (Supplemental Table S1 ). We found spontaneous formation of NETs expressing TF ( Figure 1D ,E) that were functional, as indicated by TAT assay ( Figure 1F ).

We found that these PRP-stimulated control neutrophils had increased levels of TF mRNA ( Figure 2A ) and efficiently generated TF-bearing NETs ( Figure 2B ,D,E); the corresponding NET structures showed high TAT activity ( Figure 2C ), supporting the important role of platelets in NET-mediated COVID-19 immunothrombosis. On the other hand, although COVID-19 serum or plasma led to intracellular TF expression in neutrophils, they were not able to trigger efficient NET formation ( Figure S1A -C), further supporting previous studies indicating that the release of TF-expressing NETs is a \"double-hit phenomenon\" (10, 19) .

Prompted by our findings described above regarding the high levels of complement activation in COVID-19 patients (increased sC5b-9), we next examined whether COVID-19 patient serum, which represents the disease\"s inflammatory environment, is able to induce complement activation upstream of C5, leading to TF expression in neutrophils. In this context, to address the role of C3 activation we developed a serum co-incubation system (for details see Supplemental Methods, section 1.4.1). Serum from healthy individuals (control serum), serving as a source of non-activated complement, was pre-treated or not treated with the compstatin analog Cp40 (which blocks all three pathways of complement activation by targeting the central protein C3) (12, 16) , and then co-incubated with COVID-19 serum. Cp40-mediated inhibition of C3 significantly decreased the capacity of our serum co-incubation system to induce TF expression in neutrophils, at both the mRNA ( Figure 3B ) and protein levels ( Figure 3C ). These results indicate that C3 inhibition disrupts the source that triggers TF release from neutrophils, broadly preventing complement activation and impairing the thrombogenicity of the TF/thrombin axis in COVID-19.",

During COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers complement cascade by interacting with mannan-binding lectin (MBL) serine proteases (MASPs) or possibly through the induction of (auto)antibodies or/and immunocomplexes. Activation of C3, as a point of convergence of all complement pathways, leads to C3a, C5a and sC5b-9 (terminal complement complex/TCC) generation. Subsequently, C3a activates platelets (PLT), while C5a and PLT-derived thrombin induce both neutrophil tissue factor (TF) expression and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) carrying active TF. These thrombogenic NETs may induce endothelial cells activation towards TF expression increasing their procoagulant activity. This may further amplifies (e.g. via PAR1), both inflammation and PLT activation constructing thus a complement/NETs-driven vicious cycle of immunothrombosis. Complement, thrombin and NETosis represent promising candidate therapeutic targets. The pink box includes components of COVID-19 thromboinflammatory environment. Cp40, compstatin analog; FP, properdin; PAR1, protease-activated receptor 1; PMX-53, specific C5a receptor antagonist; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.",

AMY-101 treatment resulted in rapid normalization of inflammatory markers and improvement of respiratory function, indicating a pronounced effect of C3 inhibition on COVID-19 thromboinflammation (13). In this regard, the impact of C3 inhibition on neutrophil-derived TF expression may provide important mechanistic insights into how AMY-101 can broadly suppress the thomboinflammatory response that culminates in pronounced microvascular injury and thrombosis in severely ill COVID-19 patients. A phase II clinical trial has been launched to assess the impact of AMY-101 in patients with severe COVID-19 (NCT04395456). Many pieces of the immunothrombosis puzzle have been identified as components of the complement/neutrophil/TF axis in various disorders (14-17). In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that C3aR signaling can mediate platelet activation in coronary artery disease (33). The ability of Cp40 to attenuate neutrophil-driven thromboinflammation in our study could reflect a broader impact of C3 activation on neutrophil-platelet interactions that promote thrombogenic responses. In fact, C3 inhibition by compstatin disrupts CR3-dependent platelet-neutrophil complex formation which could likely enhance thrombotic reactions relevant to COVID-19 pathology (34). Moreover, enhanced C3 expression is part of the unique host transcriptional signature in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (35) and C3aR upregulation in the lung microvascular endothelium was recently correlated with",

Our findings argue for the timely application of therapeutic strategies that can disrupt the vicious cycle of COVID-19 immunothrombosis by targeting complement activation or/and NET formation (10, 12, 13, 24, 25, 31, 32) (Figure 4).",
