As of 22 January 2021, the global number of confirmed COVID-19 cases have exceeded 96 million cases, with more than 2.07 million known fatalities. Up to date, there is no sufficiently effective antiviral drug to treat COVID-19. Therefore, the development of accurate and reliable diagnostic serological assays that can be readily applicable is crucial [1, 2] . These assays should provide guidance to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the individual and community levels, identify immune presumptive protected persons who can serve as potential plasma donors, and for vaccine development [1] . In addition, serology assays are expected to play a critical role in testing the currently approved vaccines' efficiency by measuring the level of produced antibodies, determining their durability, and identifying thresholds of protection [3, 4] . This is particularly important since it is still unknown how long immunity against SARS-CoV-2 lasts after vaccination [3] . Due to the lack of sensitive and specific serological assays early in the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a delay in the precise estimation of the burden of infection; and hence, the proper implementation of public health measures to control viral spread [5] . Currently, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on patient history, laboratory testing, and chest X-ray examination. The reference method for SARS-CoV-2 detection is nucleic acid testing (NAT) of respiratory specimens. However, this method is low throughput, time-consuming, should be performed by professional technicians and requires additional sampling for an accurate diagnosis. Thus, NAT may not be the best choice for large-scale screening of populations infected with SARS-CoV-2 [6] .",

IgM antibodies are produced as the first line of defense during infection, where these antibodies are used to evaluate the acute phase of infection as they indicate recent exposure. In contrast, IgG antibodies are generated afterward to provide long-term immunity and immunological memory [7] . As has been shown in several studies, the seroconversion of IgG and IgM occurs about one to two weeks after disease onset, and the levels of IgM significantly drop while IgG persists for a longer period of time [8, 9] . Hence, IgM and IgG antibodies, when captured within the correct timeframe after disease onset, can add value to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Understanding the antibody kinetics over time is essential to distinguish thresholds of immunity, especially since it is still unknown how long the immunity to this novel coronavirus might last [1, 5] . Although RT-PCR remains the reference method for identifying acute infection, as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread, serological testing has become essential to understand the pandemics' past and predict its future [5] .",

Studies performed on large populations have shown a 1.2-12.9% SARS-COV-2 incidence rate of asymptomatic cases, which significantly contributed to the disease transmission [10] [11] [12] [13] . Early identification and quarantining of these individuals are urgently needed to better control the COVID-19 pandemic. This study evaluated the antibody immune response in symptomatic and asymptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients using different CE-marked IgM and IgG ELISA kits coated with different SARS-CoV-2 antigens. IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in samples collected at three different time-intervals post symptoms onset or positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test (\u226414, 14-30, >30 days). Specificity was investigated using pre-pandemic control samples with positive antibodies against other coronaviruses, non-CoV respiratory viruses, non-respiratory viruses, and nuclear antigens. A strength of this study is that it evaluated the antibody response using a large sample size from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients of a very diverse population in Qatar, where 89% of the total population are expatriates from over 150 countries [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

Nasopharyngeal swab specimens from all patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the Superscript III One-Step RT-PCR reaction mix with PlatinumR Taq DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher, Waltham, Massachusetts, Mass, USA). Each sample was tested by three PCRs: the screening assay for the envelope (E) gene and two confirmatory assays targeting the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, all performed as recommended by Corman, V.M. et al. [18] . Quant Studio 6 Flex real-time PCR System was used, and cycle threshold (CT) values below 32 were considered positive. For the negative control group, serum samples collected from healthy blood donors before 2019 were selected. Details about the collection, transport, and storage methods of the control samples were described in previous studies [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . The demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and the control group are shown in Table 1 . The median age of the control group was 36 years (interquartile range: IQR = 15). Most of the control group samples were within the 31-60 years age group (n = 82, 68.9%). In the control group, there was an equal representation of females (n = 57, 49.6%) to males (n = 59, 51.3%). In the COVID-19 patient group, the median age was 43 years (IQR = 21), and most patients were within the age group 31-60 years (n = 195, 67.0%). There was a higher proportion of COVID-19 male patients (n = 242, 83.2%) compared to the females (n = 33, 11.3%). Among COVID-19 patients, there was an approximately equal distribution of symptomatic (n = 147, 55.9%) and asymptomatic patients (n = 116, 44.1%). ",

            "text": "Among the 291 samples collected from positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR patients, 23 samples (7.9%) were seronegative by all IgG ELISA kits despite testing with multiple assays targeting different antigens ( Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 showed that IgM antibodies could be detected as early as three days post-infection, providing the first line of humoral immunity defense, while high-affinity IgG antibodies are produced after seven days [30, 31] . In this study, the sensitivity for IgM antibody detection decreased gradually with time using all ELISA kits. The highest sensitivity was obtained during the first two weeks of sample collection (Figure 1 and Figure S1 ). Three IgM ELISA kits that either target the nucleocapsid protein (NP) or both the nucleocapsid and spike protein (SP) showed relatively lower sensitivity than Lionex, which solely targets the SP of SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivities of all IgG ELISA kits increased proportionally to the elapsed time from symptoms onset or positive RT-PCR test, peaking one month after sample collection, except for DiaPro. AnshLabs IgG ELISA attained the highest sensitivity within the first two weeks of sampling (78.2%), while Lionex achieved the highest sensitivity after one month (96.6%). This indicates a very good performance for the evaluated IgG ELISA tests, particularly Lionex, compared to other automated assays such as Roche Elecsys (sensitivity of 97.2%), Abbot (sensitivity of 92.7%) [32] , and DiaSorin (sensitivity of 95.0%) [33] . Previous studies reported slightly better IgG sensitivity results for EDI and DiaPro; 76.1% vs. 82.7% for EDI and 53.5% vs. 92.2% for DiaPro [34] . NovaLisa showed comparable IgG sensitivity to other studies, 81.5% vs. 89.7% after two weeks post symptoms onset, and 90.0% vs. 91.2% after one month [35] . The IgM sensitivity for NovaLisa was higher in our study after two weeks (54.2% vs. 30.8%), but it significantly dropped after this (12.8% after one month vs. 38.2% after three weeks) [35, 36] . This could be because many samples (~67%) collected at this time-interval were from asymptomatic patients whose samples were collected between 30 and 98 days post positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. In addition, to our knowledge, serum IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 decrease rapidly, potentially accounting for the poor assay sensitivity obtained after one month [8, 35, 37, 38] .",

However, the performance of the IgM assays was variable and showed low sensitivity, consistent with other studies [36, 49] . Therefore, combining IgM and IgG serology testing may not provide much diagnostic value during the later stages of the disease, questioning the rationale for measuring IgM antibodies. In addition, the early appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is interesting to note as similar studies have reported detectable responses as early as 3-5 days post-infection [32, 50, 51] . Usually, early detection of specific IgG antibodies is expected in secondary immune responses when there is a memory to cross-reactive antigens from a previous infection with a coronavirus [52, 53] . A phenomenon known as the \"original antigenic syndrome\" has been suggested to explain the underlying immune response in SARS-CoV-2, where previous infections influence the response to future virus encounters [50] . The early IgG response is possibly a memory response from earlier coronavirus infection, producing cross-reactive antibodies that do not have neutralizing potency [52] . This was observed in several infections with closely related viruses, where some caused antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) disease, leading to a worse clinical course [52, 54] . In addition, this could explain why the symptomatic patients had a higher IgG detection rate than the asymptomatic patients.",

In addition, 291 samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients were used to assess the ELISA kits' performance based on different time-intervals and disease classifications. Another strength is that we investigated the added value of measuring IgM antibodies along with IgG. One limitation of our study is that the onset time of illness was obtained from that patient medical records. This could have affected the precision of the time-intervals due to subjectivity in the perception of timing. In addition, most of the samples used from the asymptomatic patients were collected after one month of a positive PCR test. Hence, a more accurate evaluation of the IgM response in asymptomatic individuals could be obtained if more samples were available at the first two time-intervals.",

They will also be critical in determining the magnitude of antibody response needed for protection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, determining the antibody response's durability, and distinguishing between natural and vaccine-induced immunity by differentiating binding antibodies from neutralizing antibodies elicited by the vaccines. Our study provided evidence that serological testing can be a powerful approach in achieving timely diagnosis and determining the level of humoral immunity in symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. The main expected use of antibody testing in the upcoming months is to confirm past infection, determine herd immunity, determine the durability of antibodies targeting different antigens, and test the currently approved vaccines' efficacy.",

The sensitivity was significantly higher in the symptomatic COVID-19 patients by all kits where Lionex demonstrated the highest sensitivity at 75.5% (95% CI: 68.6-82.5), followed by AnshLabs at 57.1% (95% CI: 49.1-65.1), then EDI at 52.4% (95% CI: 44.3-60.5), and finally NovaLisa at 45.6% (95% CI: 37.5-53.6). The sensitivity in the asymptomatic COVID-19 patients ranged from 3.4% (95% CI: 0.13-6.8) to 39.7% (96% CI: 30.8-48.6) for AnshLabs and Lionex, respectively.",
