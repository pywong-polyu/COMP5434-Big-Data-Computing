As exemplified in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in the absence of an efficacious treatment or vaccine, rapid identification of infected patients is the only control measure available to curb transmission and ensure timely containment of the infectious disease. The use of PCR and real-time PCR (qPCR)-based methodologies in clinical diagnostic virology demands high sensitivity and specificity for the selected viral nucleic acid target. Analytical specificity comprises the extent of inclusivity by which all viral phylogenetic variants are captured at the exclusion of its genetic near neighbors. This is facilitated by directing primer and probe design to evolutionarily conserved regions identified through multiple sequence alignments that portray geographical and temporal genomic variability. Subsequent primer and probe designs are selected primarily on two interdependent factors: the oligonucleotide melting temperature (T m )governed principally by oligo length and GC contentand its complementarity with the target nucleic acid.",

The average sensitivity of published qPCR assays for RNA viruses, which accumulate considerable diversity over a short timeframe 1 , has been predicted to be approximately 70% 2 . Sequence divergence within oligonucleotide-binding sites creates primer-template duplex instability and lowers T m . This can be offset by increasing the primer length or GC content to confer a degree of mismatch tolerance or mitigated using degenerate nucleotides. These approaches must balance the amplification of heterogeneous quasi-species with non-specific amplification by off-target mispriming 3 . qPCR probe design is more averse to similar modifications because increasing probe T m through nucleotide degeneracy or sequence lengthening may lead to high T m variations that reduce specific target discrimination. Importantly, neither approach can account for future de novo allelic variants arising in the oligonucleotide-binding sites. Frequent in silico re-evaluation is therefore necessary to identify escape variants that necessitate assay primer and probe design, assay reoptimization, and clinical validation.",

As a model system, we optimized and validated PANDAA to detect single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) associated with HIV drug resistance (HIVDR). As HIVDR mutations (DRMs) occur at key genomic positions 16 , we were constrained to predefined regions and could not target more conserved genomic regions. HIVDR emerges from the continuation of an antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimen in the absence of virological suppression. This limits the efficacy of current and future regimens by rendering one or more of the antiretrovirals (ARVs)or even whole drug classesineffective 5 . The presence of a single DRM yields a high predictive value of reduced ART efficacy and treatment failure 16 and genotyping of six codons can detect major (non-)nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ([N]NRTI) DRMs in >98% of patients failing treatment 16 . Although resistance genotyping allows clinicians to classify virological failure as resistance-or adherence-mediated, and to select an alternative ART regimen conferring the highest likelihood of virological success, in lowand middle-income countries (LMICs), Sanger-based resistance genotyping is restricted until a patient fails two standardized regimens. Thus, a focused genotyping HIVDR diagnostic would address a profound gap in clinical care globally that is currently addressed ineffectively by more esoteric techniques.",

Conventional degenerate oligonucleotide design, using all available sequences, or an equivalent number of sequences from each subtype, to determine the consensus sequence, generally overestimates naturally occurring genomic variation as each variant nucleotide is incorporated as a discrete change. This generates oligonucleotides that do not occur naturally. PANDAA differs by considering the complete primer-or probe-binding site as a discrete genomic allele. Using codon 65 in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) as an example, the 95% consensus sequence for a 15-nt probe would generate 16 probe sequences (Supplementary Table 1 ). This is reduced to six sequences using our allele-based algorithm using HIV-1 subtype prevalence (Supplementary Table 2 ) to determine the probability of encountering a given subtype. By weighting primer-and probe-binding site allele frequency using subtype prevalence, the likelihood of encountering a matched target is increased. By contrast, an uncorrected approach that uses an equal number of sequences from each subtype to determine the most frequent primer-/probe-binding site, introduces bias from lowprevalence subtypes, particularly circulating and unique recombinants.",

For PANDAA validation, we constructed DNA templates incorporating 19 probe-binding site alleles (Supplementary Table 3 ).

To facilitate mismatch tolerance during adaptation, PANDAA primers have a T m 65-75\u00b0C. Therefore, a PANDAA probe would have a T m > 75\u00b0C when applying canonical design rules, which would provide inadequate DRM nucleotide discrimination.

Using two homogenous templates with different 2830 F and 2896 R primer-binding sites ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ), single-clone sequencing ascertained that adaptation occurred across the PDR binding site at positions containing degenerate nucleotides, demonstrating a broad spectrum of degenerate PANDAA primer utilization ( Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). These sequences represent the predominate populations at the qPCR completion; therefore, those containing multiple substitutions may not Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using a 55-65\u00b0C annealing temperature gradient. Although predicted T m values ranged from 59 to 63\u00b0C, there was little impact sensitivity with the AAC probes (yellow circles) for any probe length as the annealing temperature increased; however, non-specific hybridization of the AAA probe (blue circles) to the mismatched AAC template was reduced as annealing temperature increased. b The performance of four 5\u2032 hydrolysis probes with various placement of LNA nucleotides (yellow) was compared to a TaqMan-MGB probe (blue) of the same length. LNAs were found to have comparable performance to MGB probes although LNA nucleotide placement also had to be determined empirically. c Increasing probe length did not reduce sensitivity, as 13-nt probes (blue circles) had similar Cq values to 17-nt probes (yellow) at 10 4 and 10 3 copies per reaction. d To confirm that amplification efficiency was not proportionally inhibited as the number of overlapping nucleotides increased, PANDAA reactions utilizing 13-17-nt probes were resolved on a 4% agarose gel, demonstrating comparable band intensities of a 66-bp amplicon across all probe lengths at both 10 3 and 10 4 DNA copies per reaction (middle lane: 10-bp DNA ladder). Furthermore, no non-specific products were evident.",

DNA template 001 was diluted from 10 6 to 100 copies per reaction and was amplified using either the a majority consensus primers with no degenerate bases or b PANDAA primers. Both sets of primers contained the same 3\u2032 ADR. A single mismatch was present in both the forward and reverse consensus primers (Supplementary Table 4 ). Using the K103N DRM-specific probe, both primer sets showed similar sensitivity down to 10 4 copies; however, the lowest copy number quantified using consensus primers was 10 4 copies compared to 100 copies for the PANDAA primers. Although <10 4 copies were detectable using consensus primers, the copies were not accurately quantifiable. PDR degeneracy, co-expressed DRMs, and melt curve: c Using 10 3 copies of template 014, which contains a mismatch in each ADR, optimal PDR degeneracy was determined empirically. d The 2830F-99% PDR variant with either the 2896R-95% (blue) or 2896R-99% (yellow) variant in a SYBR green qPCR with the 014 template showed a similar relationship between PDR degeneracy and reaction efficiency to that with probe-based PANDAA. The lower amplicon T m and broader melt curve with the 2896R-99% primer reflected the wider range of predicted GC% content compared to 2896R-95% (25.8-58.1% versus 29.0-54.8%, respectively), and therefore the wider primer Tm range (63.0-78.7\u00b0C versus 64.2-77.3\u00b0C, respectively). e Additional degeneracy was introduced at co-expressed DRMs included codons 100 and 101 in primer 2830 F and 106 in 2896 R.

Table 7 ). We surmised that this pro-amplification (pro-amp) effect arose from the partial decoupling of amplification from its dependence on adaptation during the initial qPCR cycles. By increasing the pool of unadapted template, pro-amp offsets the amplification penalty linked to adaptation, such that a higher proportion of newly adapted amplicons can be generated within the initial qPCR cycles ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). We evaluated allele-specific proamp using low-concentration ADR-matched primers (eight 2830 F ADR variants and six 2896 R ADR variants), representing the 19 probe-binding site alleles. Sensitivity improved with individual pro-amp primers for each probe-binding site allele, with a median \u0394Cq of \u22121.0 cycles compared with without pro-amp (Supplementary Table 8 ). Pooling individual pro-amp primers negated this modest increase in sensitivity, with a median \u0394Cq of 0.0 cycles.",

Here we describe the design, validation, and evaluation of PANDAA, which addresses these shortcomings and the technical limitations. PANDAA adapts the probe-binding site to mitigate the negative impact of sequence variability on qPCR performance, thus enabling sensitive and specific detection when conventional qPCR would have failed 19, 20 . Using HIV-1 as a model system, PAN-DAA quantified drug resistance mutations regardless of the number or position of sequence variants. We demonstrated the robustness of PANDAA adaptation by showing that multiple points of nucleotide variation in the same ADR can be adapted sequentially by including a limiting concentration of singlemismatched primer. By systematically violating codified design principles of qPCR, we demonstrated the flexibility of three canonical rules. First, that primer-and probe-binding site overlap and sequence complementarity do not impede amplification or generate spurious non-specific products. Rules forbidding this were inherited from qPCR design employing probes longer than those used here. By minimizing probe length, we reduced the number of probebinding site sequence variants to be adapted. Theoretically, primer-probe hybridization can generate a non-specific amplicon incorporating the complete probe-binding site. With PANDAA, complementary exists only with the primer ADR of the opposite orientation, e.g., the first 7 nt of the sense-oriented probe is complementary to the antisense primer 3\u2032 ADR. Unfavorable hybridization of so few nucleotides at the 60\u00b0C annealing temperature, and the absence of the probe 3\u2032 terminal hydroxyl group, reduce the likelihood of artificially generating the probebinding site.",

Without appropriate action, HIVDR will significantly undermine the global response to the HIV epidemic. Our work represents a major advancement in diagnostic development, and we aim to empower centralized laboratories with the ability to implement focused resistance genotyping as a reflexive diagnostic after a detectable viral load. PANDAA confers several advantages that support this goal. The geographic disparity related to the high failure rate of sequencing assays for non-B subtypes 26, 27 is addressed by the subtype-independent universality of PAN-DAA. As our design algorithm incorporates either global or regional subtype prevalence data, an assay incorporating local HIV-1 sequence diversity in a specific geographical region can be readily designed, which may facilitate local research efforts in LMICs. Once PANDAA is optimized for probe-binding site adaptation, there is substantial interchangeability between targeting a single DRM (e.g., M184V) or multiple DRMs at a codon (e.g., M184I/V) without the need for primer re-design or re-optimization. DRMspecific probes can be labeled with the same fluorophore if there is no clinical utility in differentiating between DRMs. This intrinsic flexibility removes redundant or superfluous detection reagents to maximize sample throughput and reduce costs. We showed that PANDAA quantifies DRMs present at \u22655% to return a focused genotyping result in approximately 90 min using RNA in a one-step RT-qPCR. With the excellent agreement between PANDAA and both population sequencing and NGS for four major RT DRMs, PANDAA has a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 96.9 and 97.5%, respectively, in patients with firstline ART failure using conventional population sequencing. The superior selectivity of PANDAA to detect low-frequency DRMs, below the 15-20% threshold of Sanger 28 , is an additional strength to further improve patient outcomes 29, 30 . This study does have several limitations. Although PANDAA was optimized using synthetic templates from multiple HIV-1 subtypes, only patient samples from subtype HIV-1C were available. A direct comparison using prospectively collected samples from independent cohorts in multiple geographical regions would evaluate the relative benefits and clinical utility of PANDAA compared with existing genotyping methods. This iteration of PANDAA was optimized for four DRMs; however, ongoing studies are expanding PANDAA to two additional first-line DRMs and for DRMs conferring resistance to second-line protease inhibitors. We are currently investigating multiplexed PANDAA for HIV-1 resistance genotyping.",

This would significantly bolster clinical diagnostics against the risk of false negatives from uncharacterized de novo genetic variation in the oligonucleotidebinding sites. This has previously led to severe sensitivity loss in commercial influenza A assays 31 and has quickly rendered diagnostics all but obsolete, such as was seen with the 2009 CDC that saw mismatches arising in the primer-and probe-binding sites within three years 32 .
