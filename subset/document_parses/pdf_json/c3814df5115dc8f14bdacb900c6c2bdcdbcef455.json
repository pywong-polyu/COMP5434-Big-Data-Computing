The most frequent complication during a tracheostomy procedure is ETT cuff damage when the trachea is incised; this can result in ventilation difficulty and infectious aerosol dissemination. One way to prevent ETT cuff damage is to ensure that the cuff is in an optimal position-distal to the sternal notch (away from the tracheostomy incision point) but above the tracheal carina. The ETT cuff position can sometimes be confirmed by tracheal palpation; however, the relevant anterior neck structures are not always easily palpable. Moreover, if the ETT is advanced too deeply, there is a risk of endobronchial ventilation. Lastly, neck extension during tracheostomy positioning can easily move the ETT proximal to the sternal notch. As there are no reliable methods to protect the ETT cuff from damage during tracheostomy, we developed the PCV method.",
