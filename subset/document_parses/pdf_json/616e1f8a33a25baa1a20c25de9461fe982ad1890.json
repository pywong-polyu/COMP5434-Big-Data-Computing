            "text": "Background: Clozapine (CLZ) is used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Adverse reactions to clozapine include neutropenia. In March 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic and after, psychiatrists raised concerns regarding continuation of clozapine, due to multiple restrictions. We aimed to provide a study on the association between neutropenia and clozapine in patients with schizophrenia and COVID-19. Aim: To assess the neutrophil count in patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine and infected with COVID-19. Methods: The study patients with schizophrenia, according to DSM-5, admitted to the Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry and Neurology Brasov, Romania, between April 2020 and October 2021. The inclusion criteria included positive RT-PCR (real-time PCR) test for COVID-19 and treatment with clozapine. We assessed three values of ANC (absolute neutrophil count): before COVID-19 infection (last ANC obtained at mandatory check), during infection and 1 month after resolution (first negative PCR test). Results: Of the 105 cases, 95 did not have neutropenia. Fifty-nine patients were males (62.1%), mean age was 43.5 years (SD = 12.1) with an average of clozapine treatment of 52.4 months (SD = 11.9). At baseline, they had a small reduction in the ANC mean value (4.41 \u00d7 109/l; SD = 2.22) which did not constitute a statistically significant decline from the prior to COVID-19 mean value of 4.66 \u00d7 109/l (SD = 2.34; p = 0.45). Values were also normal in the first month after negative PCR testing (4.45 \u00d7 109/l; SD = 2.35; p = 0.91). A total of 10 patients (9.5%) had neutropenia. The age, dose of clozapine and duration of treatment were not statistically different compared to the group without neutropenia.",

            "text": "Clozapine (CLZ) remains the gold standard for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). 1 In many cases, it is also used in severe manic episode 2 and for its anti-aggressive anti-suicidal properties in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorder, intellectual disability, dementia, etc. 3 Rare but serious side effects such as agranulocytosis, seizures, myocarditis and orthostatic hypotension and increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia (clozapine black box warnings) cause the underuse of clozapine even where it is strongly indicated. 4 The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that was declared in March 2020 has had a major impact on mental health, especially in patients with schizophrenia. 5 Lockdown, social isolation, difficulties to contact psychiatrists, GPs and limited or restricted access to hospitals have led to an increase in morbidity and mortality in this group of patients. 6 In a recently published paper, we noticed that patients who received adequate treatment and care in dedicated wards appeared to be protected from severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). 7 Other authors have suggested that COVID-19 associated with inflammation may accelerate clozapine toxicity. 8 Due to the nature of the treatment, clozapine requires white blood cell and neutrophils monitoring in order to avoid potentially dangerous situations (neutropenia). 9 Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 1500/\u03bcL. It could be mild (between 1000/\u03bcL and 1500/\u03bcL), moderate (between 500/\u03bcL and 1000/\u03bcL), or severe (less than 500/\u03bcL). 10 It has a variety of causes, such as viral infections, medications, therapeutic radiation, autoimmune disorders, malignant diseases, nutritional deficiencies, congenital causes and others. 11 A particular congenital cause of neutropenia is benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN), one of the most common causes of chronic neutropenia in members of some ethnic groups, mainly African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern and West Indian, without any increased risk of infection. 12 This condition is important for patients receiving therapies that have neutropenia as a side effect, such as clozapine. In this context, the experts proposed guidelines for the continuation of clozapine treatment during the pandemic. 13 On the other hand, the interaction between antivirals that act as protease inhibitors (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir combination) and clozapine may lead to an increase in antipsychotic plasma concentration and should therefore be closely monitored. 13",

Previous studies have shown a reduction in neutrophil counts in patients treated with clozapine and infected with COVID-19. Neutropenia can occur in many situations including BEN (benign ethnic neutropenia). No such cases have been identified in our patients. For BEN patients who are on clozapine, Manu et al described that the frequency and severity of infections were similar to others on the same medication, despite the difference in ANC. 14 A neutrophil count >1000/\u03bcL is safe for initiating and/or resuming clozapine therapy, and it should be discontinued only when the ANC falls below 500 \u03bcL for those who have BEN. 15 Another particular cause of neutropenia is the infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The COVID-19 pandemic has also raised issues for patients treated with clozapine because clozapine is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (higher rates of smoking, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and chronic renal failure), 16 weight gain, the reduction in immunoglobulins, neutropenia (usually in the first 18 weeks) and progression to agranulocytosis (in a minority of cases). Recently published data suggest that patients treated with clozapine are at increased risk for COVID-19. 17 Gee and Taylor, in a retrospective chart review study, showed a significant reduction in ANCs, lymphocyte counts and total WCCs in the week after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. They suggest that mild neutropenia in the acute phase of COVID-19 illness in patients who are well established in clozapine is more likely to be a consequence of the infection than related to clozapine treatment and the rapid return to baseline counts supports this conclusion. 18 Our research included only white individuals and it partially confirmed the results reported by Gee and Taylor on a larger sample. In this respect, we have observed that about 10% of patients on clozapine who were COVID infected had significant neutropenia. This is more than double the expected rate (3.8% in Myles 2018) 19 and, even more importantly, has been found in patients on long-term clozapine treatment. In our clinic, the percentage of cases of neutropenia is below 1%.",

            "text": "There are 4 possible explanations for this finding: a) it could be a late adverse effect of clozapine -very unlikely; b) it could be a consequence of COVID 19 infection by itself -unlikely, given very small (relatively) number of case reports; c) it could be produced by other medications/diseases -possible, but much more research will be necessary; d) it could be produced by the COVID virus in patients taking clozapine -probable, and the most interesting finding since the patients were on this type of treatment for more than 18 months and the ANC were normal before coronavirus infection. This group did not differ from the rest of the patients in terms of age (older but not significant), dose of clozapine or 980 treatment duration, although we noticed more metabolic comorbidities and anemia. However, their evolution was complicated by the switch from clozapine to another antipsychotic along with other possible causes (COVID-19 infection, hospitalization-associated infections, experimental treatments, etc.). Clozapine cessation could have severe consequences (relapse, hospitalization, prolongation of admission, and severe stress for patient and family). In our study, patients switched from clozapine relapsed with prolongation of hospitalization. Mandatory WCC (white cell count) daily monitoring (including ANC) has been an effective strategy for mitigating this risk because mild-to-moderate neutropenia does not increase the risk of infection. 20 Data suggest that COVID-19 infection can cause transient mild neutropenia and this is not purely clozapine induced. Patients who have been taking clozapine for more than 6 months and have not had previous episodes of neutropenia should continue treatment even if their ANC drops below 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L during the period of COVID-19 illness. 17 Cranshaw and Harikumar 21 presented a case of clozapine toxicity in relation to COVID-19, with concurrent mild and transient neutropenia. Luykx et al 22 described a case of a patient who was taking clozapine and developed \"severe neutropenia\", while he had COVID-19. In a recent paper, Dotson et al 23 showed clozapine toxicity in 3 cases of patients treated with clozapine, while they had COVID-19, one of whom also experienced neutropenia. Gee and Taylor suggest that mild neutropenia in the acute phase of COVID-19 in patients who are well established in clozapine, is more likely to be a consequence of the virus than of clozapine treatment. 24 In essence, all these results show that patients with COVID-19 and clozapine treatment registered an initial decline in the ANC value by 17% but subsequently it increased to around 95% of the pre-infection value due to the resolution of the infection. 25 For patients treated with clozapine who develop COVID-19, Gee and Taylor suggest continuing clozapine when it is possible (even during ventilation), reducing the dose if necessary in relation to blood results and cease if there is a significant fall in neutrophils (COVID-19 is linked to lymphopenia but not neutropenia). 26 All this aims to prevent relapse due to untimely changes in clozapine, a fact confirmed by our results. Furthermore, for protection against the severity of respiratory infection, they also recommend adding vitamin D to all clozapine patients, since psychotic patients are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. In one study from the United Kingdom, about half of the psychotic patients were vitamin D deficient. 27 The study has some limitations. One of them could be the relatively small number of patients. Another limitation could be the limited data regarding antipsychotic adherence before COVID-19 infection in outpatients. The novelty of the study resides in comparing the pre-pandemic laboratory values to those obtained during COVID-19 infection and in the post-infection period. Results led us to conclude that the ANC reduction was temporary and most likely caused by the viral infection and not by clozapine. Future analysis of patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics and infected with COVID-19 may provide new information on whether this virus may cause a decrease in ANC independently of clozapine treatment.",
