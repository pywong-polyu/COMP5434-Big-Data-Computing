Our main aim is to show if the rise-in-cases proceeds in a gradual and staggered manner instead of soaring quickly then we can suppress the burden of the health system. In this new case study, we are attempting to show how to control the outbreak of the infectious disease COVID-19 via mathematical modeling. We have examined that the method of flattening the curve of the coronavirus, which increases the recovery rate of the infected individuals and also helps to decrease the number of deaths. In this pandemic situation, the countries like Russia, India, the United States of America (USA), South Africa, and the United Kingdom (UK) are leading in front where the virus is spreading in an unprecedented way. From our point of view, we establish that if these countries are following the method of flattening the curve like China and South Korea then these countries can also overcome this pandemic situation. Method: We propose a Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) mathematical model of infectious disease with onset data of COVID-19 in Wuhan and international cases, which has been propagated in Wuhan City to calculate the transmission rate of the infectious virus COVID-19 until now. To understand the whole dynamics of the transmission rate of coronavirus, we portray time series diagrams such as growth rate diagram, flattening the pandemic curve diagram, infected and recovered rate diagram, prediction of the transmission of the disease from the available dataset in Wuhan, and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.",

The spike locks the receptors on the surface of the cells of the human lung line. In both cases, the receptor is of the equivalent kind, which is allowing the virus to interrupt into the cell. After the virus attack, it hijacks the cell's reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out the cell again and killing it. 1 The Chinese City Wuhan is considered the epic-enter of SARS-CoV-2 and is locked down since January 23 and the government banned all the transportation. In South Korea, public and personal laboratories have been established, which provide the medical facility to the affected people via dozens of mobile centers. 2 The effect of MERS virus gave the perfect lesson on how to approach infectious diseases. The centers for disease control of MERS virus found a special department to organize for the worst cases, which was a great movement that appears to have paid off. The country has seen two waves of infection, the primary beginning was on 20 January with the primary confirmed cases, and after that, the second wave comes with mass infections among the people. Now there is a fear that the imported cases could fuel a third wave. Susceptible (S) individuals are those who have never been infected with and thus have no immunity against COVID-19. Once susceptible people are infected with the disease, they become infectious with the disease. When the individuals become infectious then they experience non-critical symptoms like fever and cough and may even have mild pneumonia but do not require hospitalization. These individuals may either recover or progress to the critical stage of the disease. One step further when the Infected individuals with a critical infection experience respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure then they must require treatment in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). These individuals may either recover or die from the disease. Recovered (R) individuals are those who have recovered and are assumed to be immune to future infection with COVID- 19 . Previously many studies have been done on the natural clinical progression of COVID-19 infection. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Infected (I) individuals do not immediately develop severe symptoms, but instead go through the mild stages of infection first. In some studies, what we call mild infection is divided into two separate categories, that is, mild and moderate, where individuals with moderate infection show radiographic signs of mild pneumonia. These mild and moderate cases occur at roughly equal proportions. 10 There is some debate about the role of pre-symptomatic transmission (occurring from exposed cases) and asymptomatic infected cases for coronavirus, which are not include in the present model. We use a compartmental epidemiological model, followed by the traditional SIR model, to illustrate the spread and clinical progression of COVID-19. Tracking the different clinical outcomes of infections is very important because taking care of them requires different levels of healthcare resources and in many cases, isolation may be necessary. The study shows that an individual is most infectious during the stage of non-critical infection period. At this period, population would still be in the community and feeling well enough to interact with others. However, there is also a chance to transmit the disease into the further stage such as critical stage. We cited this phenomenon as an In the final, Section 5, conclusion of the study is described.",

The primary purpose is to explore the dynamics of COVID-19 cases and the associated strain on the health care system in the near future. The outbreak is influenced by infection control measures such as school closures, lock-down, etc. In Figure 2A , we illustrate the effect of lockdown, applied by the government to calculate the infected cases and it gives us a proper idea about the effect of quarantine period and also suggests that the population ratio of infected peaks have decreased after the lockdown period. Here we consider the time period about more than 6 months. However, Figure 2B indicates the mortality rate does not significantly fluctuate after more than the 6 months period of lockdown. After the lockdown period is over, a fraction of the exposed population can again restart the coronavirus spread. In Figure 2C , it is observed that the recovery rate has been increased after the lockdown period and the effect of the significance of this phenomenon plays a major role to fight against COVID-19. In Figure 2D , we investigate the effect of healthcare system capacity, reaches to its threshold point for the model system (2) during the lockdown period. We consider that the dominant source of transmission is the individuals having non-critical infections who are likely to be in the community, as opposed to isolated in the hospital.",

            "text": "example of an infection between hospitalized patients and their healthcare providers. At a population level, infections are most likely to spread from these non-critical people because most of the patients are not aware at this stage. In the case of COVID-19, we can assume that the period of the first stage starts from the time when the non-critical symptoms start, the time from symptom onset to hospitalization (eg, progress to critical stage), or it is the period of viral shedding through the sputum or throat swabs and from this time onwards the onset of various symptoms start. The probability of progressing to the critical stage is proportional to all infections that end up to critical. Individuals with critical infection need hospitalization. The duration of critical infection could be reported from the time of hospitalization to recovery for individuals or the time from hospital admission to ICU admission (since critical cases require ICU-level care). Since there is no accurate estimate of this period, we instead use the total time estimate from the onset of symptoms to ICU admission (eg, the length of critical infection). Generally, at the critical infection stage of ICU care, mechanical ventilation is required. The duration of this stage is the time from ICU admission to recovery or death. Different case study reports show that the total time from hospital admission to death, which can approximate the duration of the critical stage. 11-19 The case fatality ratio describes the fraction of all symptomatic infected individuals who eventually die. Since individuals must progress to critical infection to die, the conditional probability of someone in the critical stage dying vs recovering is given by the case fatality ratio divided by the fraction of all critical infections. Generally, such micro-organisms grow at an exponential rate with plenty of resources and thus it has been observed that the decline of the population makes reduction of the resources. In the case of infectious viruses, the primary resource is the existence among the susceptible individuals. The virus can spread rapidly without taking care of enough obstructive measurements in presence of an infected individual in a massive population. At the initial stage, the expansion of the infectious virus is considered exponentially and the total number of infected individuals along with the time is counted at double rate from the initial number. Therefore, if we consider that 10 individuals are infected initially without taking care of obstructive measurements such as putting masks on faces, keeping social distancing, and maintaining hygienic conditions, then the curve of expansion can reach up to 20 individuals over the time. In this exponential way, the number of estimated expansions becomes bigger and bigger such as 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and so on. This phenomenon seems to be non-identical with the growth of linear curve in which the number of identical cases may grow such as 10, 20, 30, 40, and so on. However, all the exponential growth rates are not similar and thus we can understand how the growth rate is reaching massive and the corresponding situation is going to be the worst. For instance, if the number of cases increases by 1% on a daily basis (a hypothetical situation) then it is important to note that the spread is benign. On the opposite hand, if a situation arises where the infection doubles on a daily basis, it may represent a worrying situation. 20-24 With the perception of transmission of the infection in human population, we propose a mathematical model termed as SIR model with vital dynamics of infectious disease and show the flattening curve method is a possible way to decrease the spread rate of coronavirus. China and South Korea follow the same way to flatten the curve method of SARS-CoV-2 and control this infectious disease. Here, we endorse if Russia, India, USA, South Africa, UK, and rest of the world can follow the same method like China and South Korea from which they are being benefited and can sustain to transmit this infectious disease from human-to-human population and reduce the number of severe cases, causing less burden on public health systems.

It would require computationally intensive methods such as bootstrapping. We note also that the estimates of undiagnosed infections can also be used as an alternative way to forecast new cases, since future diagnoses depend on past infections. This is another area of possible future development. 5 | CONCLUSION Some recent reports have suggested that healthcare workers are disproportionally infected with COVID-19, suggesting there is some role to hospital-based transmission (eg, from individuals in infected state, or individuals who are hospitalized with only mild infection). In China, approximately 5% of all infections were in healthcare workers, and in Italy, the number is currently around 10%. One of the biggest dangers of a widespread COVID-19 epidemic is the strain it could place on hospital resources, since individuals with critical infection require hospital care. The critical stage of infection requires mechanical ventilation, which is ICU-level care. Individuals with non-critical infection do not require hospitalization, and could recover at home on their own or can be treated in a regular hospital ward. However, in many countries these individuals have also been hospitalized, likely as a way to isolate them and decrease the transmission rate, as well as to observe them for progression to more aggressive disease stages. In recent studies on COVID-19, it has been noticed that in most of the cases, individuals had symptoms, since the presence of symptoms was used to determine whether someone would be admitted for a test of COVID-19. However, it is possible that some individuals may be infected and able to transmit to others without developing symptoms. Recent studies show that asymptomatic individuals were also screened for infection and tested positive. The model also suggests the possibility of pre-symptomatic transmission. The general compartmental epidemiological models assume that the onset of symptoms and the onset of infectiousness coincide, but recent evidence indicates that symptoms may be delayed relative to when an individual is infectious. Viral loads are measured over time in symptomatic individuals. Studies show that they are at a peak on the first day of symptoms, suggesting that they were already high before symptoms started. Detailed contact tracing studies that have tracked transmission chains, where the infector and the infected are both known, have found the serial interval, which is the time between symptom onset in the infector and infected and this is sometimes less than the incubation period. This means there must be pre symptomatic transmission. A wide range of values for the proportion of all transmission that is pre-symptomatic has been estimated (12%\u00c062%), so we choose an intermediate value of 25%, consistent with. 30 A related line of evidence for the presence of pre symptomatic infection is that the average length of the serial interval is quite close to the average length of the incubation period in a few studies. This suggests either a very short symptomatic and infectious period, or, significant pre-symptomatic transmission. Undetected cases of COVID-19 are the primary incertitude of this pandemic.",

To understand the whole dynamics of the transmission rate of coronavirus, we portray the time series diagrams such as growth rate diagram, flattening the pandemic curve diagram, infected and recovered rate diagram, and the transmission of the disease from the available dataset in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. Via flatten the curve method, China and South Korea are able to control the fatal disease COVID-19 from the transmission into the human population. We show by our results that the above techniques can sustain the epidemic at an oversized portion of the human population by pruning the virus at the beginning, which basically stops the virus from spreading further and makes a way to prevent community transmission and its effect on the capacity of healthcare system. The condition of human lives is becoming such metastable so that we all need to think unitedly against the deadly coronavirus and make a way through this fatal phase. Except for the parametric conditions, nothing is specified about the coronavirus. So, we can only predict the infected and mortality rates with all possible patterns of the epidemic disease over the progression of time.",

This situation is like climbing a mountain without knowing how high the top of the mountain should be or what obstacles might come in the way. The people of Europe are so worried about their dire situation that if they give up even a little bit, it could be extremely unfortunate for them. 3,4 To understand the whole dynamics of the transmission rate of coronavirus, we portray time series diagrams such as growth rate diagram, flattening the pandemic curve diagram, and SIR model diagram. We have observed that the basic reproduction number in Wuhan declined from 2.2 (95% [CI] 1.15-4.77) to 1.05 (0.41-2.39) and the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% [CI], 4.1-7.0). Interestingly the mean value of incubation period lies between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19. The doubling time of COVID-19 was registered 7.4 days (95% CI, 5.3-19) in the early stages and now the value decrease to 4.9 days.",

Effectively, it is impossible for a country to diagnose all the active cases of COVID-19. So naturally, the number of active cases always remains less than the actual cases in the country. We can describe the non-detected cases in two categories such as undiagnosed and undetected. Undiagnosed individuals are considered the infected individuals whose symptoms are yet to visualize and they will come under diagnosis very soon. Undetected individuals never come under the scanner of treatment as they are having mild symptoms. A delay has been noticed between the time period of infection and treatment. If somehow, we are able to know about the delay, then we can be able to investigate about the number of undiagnosed individuals. The most significant time of the delay is the infection's incubation period of time, which can be mathematically modeled with the help of probability distribution, termed as incubation distribution. In general, the average period of incubation is between 5 and 6 days. It has been observed that in 95% of the cases, infections have maximum period of incubation time as 12 to 13 days.Everyday analysis of the COVID-19 in the population has registered a larger section of infected individuals. Here we totally ignore the undetected cases. To calculate these, we consider that the death individuals should not be avoided such as undetected cases. In addition, we have to count the cases of community transmission in a dense population, to figure out the mortality rate of the symptomatic cases. As a result, there are a larger number of death population than the registered cases in the countries associated to undetected cases.As of now, there is no vaccination procedure to overcome this fatal disease. So, we have to emphasize on testing over infected population. The United Nations health agency has urged people across the world to wash their hands in regular interval, avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth from hands, maintaining social distancing, and make themselves home isolated, practice respiratory hygiene, and",
