Toward this, we report a reagent-free electrochemical aptasensor with a nanocomposite antifouling layer for sensitive and continuous detection of cortisol in human serum. A thiolated, methylene blue (MB)tagged conformation-switching aptamer was immobilized over a gold nanowire (AuNW) nanocomposite to capture cortisol and generate a signal proportional to the cortisol concentration. The signal is recorded through differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and chronoamperometry. The aptasensor exhibited a sensitive response with 0.51 and 0.68 nM detection limits in spiked buffer and undiluted serum samples, respectively. Interference from other structurally similar analogs, namely, epinephrine and cholic acid, was negligible (<10%). The developed nanocomposite-based aptasensor showed excellent stability in undiluted human serum, outperforming several other nanocomposite materials even after prolonged exposure. This work lays the foundation for new biosensor formats such as implantable and wearable sensors.",

            "text": "Stress affects the physical and mental health of everyone. It is recognized as a major risk factor and a silent contributor to various health-related disorders. 1 The American Institute of Stress reported that 120 000 deaths per year are directly caused by stress and that stress leads to an annual economic burden of more than $200 billion. 2 The number of stress-related health disorders has increased significantly over the last decade 3 and will likely see a significant spike due to the added pressures of COVID-19. Stress comes in many forms, from long-term, chronic stress caused by workload or health issues to shortterm, extreme situations such as the flight or fight reaction caused by life-threatening situations. 4 An individual's physical and emotional makeup can escalate or de-escalate the effects of stress. 5 Continuous or routine monitoring of stress levels is a vital yet neglected aspect of our health, especially for highstress professions (e.g., military, law enforcement, and emergency personal), athletes, and people with pre-existing medical conditions. The human body responds to stress by modulating the release of hormones that alter the biochemistry of the whole body. 6 Thus, hormones provide a view into the nervous system and serve as powerful biomarkers, specifically serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol. 1 Among these, cortisol is a very attractive biomarker as it is present in high concentrations in various bodily fluids (blood, urine, saliva, and interstitial fluid), and its concentration directly fluctuates with the individual's stress level. 7 Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone secreted by the adrenal gland. It follows the circadian rhythm (also known as the natural sleep\u2212wake cycle) and works in cohort with other hormones in the neuroendocrine system. Besides stress, increased cortisol levels are linked to other disorders such as inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and post-traumatic stress disorder. 8, 9 Moreover, cortisol is highly active, has a low molecular weight (362 Da), is released directly in an unbound form, and has a rapid response time compared to other stress biomarkers. Cortisol is rapidly cleared from circulation, unlike larger stress biomarkers, which provides a more real-time assessment. 1, 10 While cortisol is secreted directly into blood (100\u2212600 nM), it is found in other biofluids as well, such as sweat (22\u2212392 nM) , urine (27\u2212276 nM) , and saliva (2.7\u22124.4 nM). 11\u221213 Currently, cortisol is detected via a spectrophotometric (absorbance or fluorometric) assay, 14 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), 15 liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS), 16 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or surface plasmon resonance (SPR). 17, 18 These techniques tend to be time-consuming, require skilled personnel, and are instrument-dependent, leaving them laboratory-bound. Recently, electrochemical-based assays have gained popularity due to their low cost, high sensitivity, and high level of integration, especially in portable form factors. 19\u221224 While most electrochemical techniques use an assay similar to ELISAs, a new format using affinity reagents with conformation-changing properties is appealing since the electroactive reporter can be directly conjugated to the probe molecule, removing the need for a second recognition element. 25\u221227 Aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides developed through systemic evaluation of ligand by exponential enrichment process (SELEX) with a high affinity toward the target molecule. 28 They have advantages in terms of stability, cost, shelf-life, and ease of chemical modifications compared to traditional antibody-based systems. 29, 30 Furthermore, aptamers can be engineered to have a conformationswitching property that allows them to modulate the label's position during a binding event when labeled with a redoxactive molecule. 26, 31, 32 These properties make conformationchanging aptamers attractive for wash-free, reagent-less, continuous monitoring applications.",

            "text": "Optimization of the Aptamer Density and Incubation Time. The aptamer density on the sensor surface plays a critical role in determining the overall sensor performance. Loosely packed aptamers significantly reduce the signal, especially in redox-labeled conformation-switching aptamers. 50 In contrast, densely packed aptamers can cause steric ACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article hindrance and not provide enough space to allow the aptamer to adopt a suitable 3D conformation resulting in reduced binding efficiency. 51 The surface coverage was studied through a matrix of experiments to maximize the electrochemical response. The best response was obtained with 2 \u03bcM of aptamer across the entire range of cortisol concentrations ( Figure 3A ). Higher concentrations resulted in a lower signal, as expected from the previous discussion. EIS was used to optimize the incubation time with 1 \u03bcM of the cognate protein. The data in Figure 3B show R ct decreasing over time as the binding to cortisol brings the redox reporter close to the surface, reducing the charge-transfer resistance. R ct increased linearly for the first 30 min (point of inversion) and then started to plateau ( Figure 3C ). These conditions were used for all subsequent assays. Cortisol Detection. The proposed aptasensor strategy for enhanced antifouling properties and reagent-less sensitive cortisol detection through a conformation-switching aptamer is illustrated in Figure 1 . The enhanced sensitivity and antifouling property are reinforced by the immobilization of the aptamer on an NC matrix. BSA (pI \u223c4.7) in the NC prevents the sensor surface from biofouling via charge repulsion, whereas the AuNW functions as a nanowire to sustain electron transfer from the MB-tagged aptamer. Aptamer conformation switching occurs when binding with cortisol, and the ostensible distance between distal-appended MB and electrode surface decreases. Such conformational changes instigate a fast interfacial rate of electron transfer (k ET ) from 13.6 to 40.7 s \u22121 between the redox molecule and the electrode surface, as calculated from the Laviron equation before and after interaction with cortisol (Supporting Information Figure S5A ). Based on this principle, we measured contrived samples by spiking cortisol into a buffer or undiluted human serum and incubating the sample on the aptasensor for 30 min. The sensor response was observed using DPV with the typical MB oxidation peak (\u2212260 mV), as shown in Figure 4 . The aptasensor response exhibited a monotonic increase in peak current with increasing cortisol concentration between 1 and 1000 nM in buffer ( Figure 4A ) and undiluted human serum ( Figure 4C ). The gradual current increase results from the accumulation of MB near the sensor surface due to cortisol binding with the structure-switching aptamer. Compared to larger targets (e.g., proteins), small molecules like cortisol have better accessibility to the aptamer and greatly benefit from the confirmation-switching property. 52 The background signal in the control trace (buffer) is likely due to the MB-tagged aptamer's misorientation on the electrode surface. This background signal is further increased in serum due to the basal cortisol level in the pooled serum as no attempt was made to deplete it. As depicted in Figure 4A ,C, a slight peak shift was observed and attributed to the binding of partially charged cortisol 44, 53 with the MB-tagged aptamer. The modified Nernst equation, 54 E 0 \u2032 = E 0 + \u03d5 pet \u2212 \u03d5 s , explains this, where E 0 \u2032 is the formal potential, E 0 is the standard electrode potential, \u03d5 s is the solution potential, and \u03d5 pet is the potential of the electron transfer plane, i.e. the plane where the electroactive molecule lies. It is clear from this equation that the solution potential remains constant in a fixed ionic strength solution; however, a change in \u03d5 pet takes place upon binding of a charged molecule and leads to a peak shift.",

A linear detection range from 1 to 1000 nM for contrived samples in both buffer and serum was observed, covering the physiological cortisol range of 100\u2212600 nM in humans. 7 Further extending the concentrations beyond this range to get saturation is not significant as per clinical requirements. A linear response calibration model is preferred for biosensing over other models (curvilinear or nonlinear) due to its implementation simplicity. 55 A slightly lower sensitivity was seen in serum, likely due to the presence of off-target proteins, different ionic strength, and different conductivity compared to that of buffer. 56 More importantly, repeated measurements were highly reproducible and consistent. We measured a high signal-to-noise ratio compared to the background, which varies from 22 to 74 times in buffer and 6 to 48 times in serum from the lowest (1 nM) to the highest (1000 nM) cortisol concentration (Supporting Information Figure S3A ). The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 0.51 and 0.68 nM in buffer and undiluted human serum, respectively, whereas the sensitivity was 84.0 and 78.0 nA/ mm 2 /[cortisol/nM] in buffer and serum, respectively. Both calibration curves had very linear fits (R 2 > 0.97). These data demonstrate the ability to detect cortisol in both buffer and undiluted human serum with high sensitivity across the physiological range.",

Each of these potential interferents was spiked in buffer at a concentration of 1000 nM and measured using the same optimized parameters previously described ( Figure 5A ). The signal was much lower (<10%) than the target molecule spiked in at the same concentration in each case.

We performed measurements where the sensor was exposed to serum for an extended duration to demonstrate the sensor's stability and antifouling properties. For comparison, we constructed aptasensors with gold nanospheres (AuNSs), gold nanowires (AuNWs), and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in equal densities by drop-casting on a clean gold electrode. The electrodes were then functionalized using the previously described protocol. The layer-by-layer assembly was characterized by CV (Supporting Information Figure S5B \u2212D) and DPV (Supporting Information Figure S6 ). The results confirmed the successful fabrication of nanomaterial-based aptamer sensors. The signal due to cortisol was investigated before and after a 3 h incubation in serum, as shown in Figure  5B . The responses were normalized to the initial signal to remove the conductivity differences. After 3 h, reduced sensor performance was observed for all other nanomaterials except the Au/NC/Au layer, demonstrating superior stability and antifouling properties. The performance of the aptasensor was tested for real-time detection of cortisol in buffer with chronoamperometry. As depicted in Figure 5C , the aptasensor responded to increasing concentrations from 50 to 1000 nM in measurement buffer with well-defined chronoamperograms. The control experiment was performed in similar conditions in the absence of cortisol (red line). The kinetics followed a diffusion-limited process with a concentration-dependent increase in the current Figure 5C exhibits good sensitivity (0.769 pA/[cortisol]/nM) and linearity (R 2 = 0.98). These data provide proof that the developed aptasensor is suitable for real-time monitoring applications. The sensor regeneration capability was analyzed with a timedependent DPV response through aptamer association and dissociation in buffer ( Figure 5D ). The binding of cortisol with the aptasensor led to increased current density, reaching a steady-state level after 50 min. After plateauing, the cortisolspiked buffer was replaced with measurement buffer, and unbinding of the target from the aptasensor was observed, indicating partial recovery response by the aptasensor. An increase in binding affinity of the surface-immobilized aptamer 21, 42 and the absence of washing or chaotropic agents in the buffer are possible reasons for the partial recovery. 31,39 Fitted globally with a 1:1 kinetic binding model, an association rate (k on ) of 1.16 \u00d7 10 5 M \u22121 s \u22121 and a dissociation rate (k off ) of 8.03 \u00d7 10 \u22121 s \u22121 were measured.",

The proposed sensor utilizes a 3D nanocomposite matrix offering antifouling and ease of aptamer immobilization with high sensitivity in complex biofluids. The aptasensor demonstrated a rapid response time (<30 s), a sub-nanomolar level limit of detection (0.68 nM), and a wide dynamic range (1\u22121000 nM) in undiluted human serum samples. Although clinical validation is needed to establish the clinical utility, the findings of studies are promising and encouraging. These attributes (i.e. reagent-less, wash-free continuous monitoring without surface biofouling) make it a suitable approach to integrate with implantable devices 20 to fulfill the unmet need for real-time stress monitoring. Notably, cortisol levels fluctuate throughout the day based on internal and external milieu; hence, an implantable device with continuous monitoring is needed for longitudinal, real-time assessment. We envision that the advent of improved state-of-the-art wireless implantable devices will help integrate the developed aptasensor for application in continuous wireless monitoring with the implantable biosensor.
