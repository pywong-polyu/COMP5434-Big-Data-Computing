            "text": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a hyperinflammatory response observed in children several weeks to months after acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). On review of all published cases of thromboembolism (TE) as a complication of MIS-C, 33 cases of TE were found with incidence ranging from 1.4 to 6.5%. TE occurred mostly in children aged 12 years and above. One-third of the cases were cerebral infarcts and the remaining cases included intracardiac and radial arterial thromboses, upper and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and splenic infarcts. Five were asymptomatic cases and 3/33 (9%) patients (all three with cerebral infarcts) died. To conclude, TE appears to be a significant complication of MIS-C caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, associated with morbidity and/or mortality. Patients \u226512 years are affected more often, and TE occurs despite thromboprophylaxis in some patients. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered in all cases after reviewing the concomitant bleeding risk. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the role of standard-dose thromboprophylaxis and to explore whether higher-dose thromboprophylaxis is required in certain high-risk patients with MIS-C.",

The terminology multisystem inflammatory syndrome of childhood (MIS-C) was coined to describe this disease process. 1 First published in April 2020 with the occurrence of fever, cardiovascular instability, and a diffuse inflammatory process in eight children with positive antibody tests for SARS-COV-2, MIS-C has now been reported all across the world. 2 It is broadly defined as an inflammatory condition affecting the cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, renal, gastrointestinal, and/or neurologic systems. It often presents as fever along with variable symptoms such as abdominal pain, emesis, diarrhea, skin rash, and generalized fatigue. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definitions of MIS-C are outlined in Table 1 . 3, 4 The increased risk of thrombosis with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) in adults as well as in children has been described in several studies. 5, 6 The clinical manifestations of MIS-C have also been systematically reviewed by multiple researchers across the world, but the risk of thromboembolism (TE) related to MIS-C specifically has not been reviewed to date. The purpose of this review is to consolidate reports of TE events in children with MIS-C related to SARS-CoV-2 infection with the description of different types of TE events reported, associated laboratory features, and management approaches.",

The same center reported two patients with TE in MIS-C cases on ECMO, including the case already described above by Riphagen et al. 2 and another child developing a right atrial thrombus despite being on high-dose aspirin and UFH with a level higher than their center's typical interquartile anti-factor Xa range; the thrombus resolved in 48 h without any long-term sequelae. 10 The largest observational cohort reporting TE is a multicenter study from New York, United States (USA) with 4/186 (3.3%) patients with MIS-C developing either deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). This included 1/75 children aged 5-12 years (1%) and 3/45 aged 12-20 years (7%), with the site of TE not reported. 11 Although many patients received anticoagulant therapy including UFH, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), bivalirudin, warfarin, and argatroban, thromboprophylaxis, management, and outcome of the four patients with TE were not separately reported. An intensive care unit (ICU) cohort from the United Kingdom (UK) reported three TE cases in 78 children with MIS-C (3.8%), all of whom received therapeutic anticoagulation, with site and outcome not described. 12 In this study, 41% of patients received prophylactic anticoagulation, but the thromboprophylaxis received by the patients developing TE is not reported.",

Heparin (type not specified) was reported as the most commonly used anticoagulant agent (46%) by Hoste et al. with prophylactic versus therapeutic dosing not specified. Tang et al. reviewed 24 studies and reported the case already reported above by Riphagen et al. 9 Another patient placed on ECMO (within 24 h of presentation) is described in a New York study of 33 MIS-C cases, who developed an ischemic brain infarct on day 6 of ECMO, and died due to hemorrhagic stroke. 15 In this study, all patients received either prophylactic enoxaparin or therapeutic anticoagulation with enoxaparin or UFH. Two studies from India described central nervous system infarcts in one MIS-C patient each, with clinical improvement in both cases; both of these patients were not on ECMO but had a prolonged stay in the pediatric ICU (>7 days). 16, 17 One patient was treated with a therapeutic dose of enoxaparin. One of these studies by Shobavat et al. also reported two cases of N.M. Menon and L.V. Srivaths radial artery thrombosis related to arterial line placement; both resolved with therapeutic anticoagulation. 16 More recently, two cases of acute onset hemiparesis were described from the Southwest US, 3-4 weeks after acute symptoms of COVID-19, both confirmed to be severe cerebral infarcts. 18 One was an 8year-old girl with positive COVID-19 antibodies, anticoagulated (agent not specified) for 5 days followed by a transition to aspirin, and the other was a 14-year-old boy with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test from the time of initial symptoms, treated with UFH followed by enoxaparin (duration not reported). 18 Acute hemiparesis, along with fever and a diffuse rash, is also described in a 6-year-old boy in India with positive COVID-19 antibodies, not confirmed by imaging to be infarcts. 19 He received enoxaparin, intravenous immunoglobulin, and steroids with complete resolution of symptoms in 3 days without any residual neurological deficits.",

The patients who developed thrombosis were on prophylactic anticoagulation with either enoxaparin or UFH, with the exception of the child with a cerebral infarct on admission and a critically ill child admitted in shock. There were seven cases of DVT (two asymptomatic), one cerebral infarct in a critically ill patient admitted with stroke symptoms, and one intracardiac thrombus occurring post-ECMO. One patient with asymptomatic DVT died due to multiorgan failure, unrelated to thrombosis.",

With no standardized method of prophylactic anticoagulation, it is difficult to compare these studies or even patients within each study. However, it is noteworthy that seven out of nine cases reported by Whitworth et al. developed TE while on thromboprophylaxis with some form of heparin. 21 Aronoff et al. also reported more than half of the patients in their systematic review to be on prophylactic anticoagulation. 7 Nineteen out of the 28 cases (68%) where age was reported occurred in children aged 12 years and above and Whitworth et al. reported a high MIS-C-related TE incidence of 19% in this age group.

Patients with MIS-C and TE appear to have significant morbidity and/or mortality. Based on these results, it appears reasonable to consider thromboprophylaxis in children with MIS-C, after careful review of the concomitant bleeding risk. Prospective studies are needed to look at the impact of standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in MIS-C and the need for higher-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in select high-risk patients, in preventing TE in MIS-C.",
