First, it is a global health crisis with vast and potentially longlasting economic, social, and political consequences that eclipse those of prior crises like the tech bubble or the global financial crisis (e.g., IMF, 2020). Second, it has led to governmental responses of unprecedented scale, both economically (e.g., forced business closures, access to credit, subventions, investment programs) and socially (e.g., quarantines, curfews, social distancing, travel bans) (e.g., Fairlie & Fossen, 2021a; Nicola et al., 2020; Pedauga et al., 2021; Sebhatu et al., 2020) . These responses affect how VC investors and entrepreneurs work, preventing in-person meetings, and making travel more difficult and costly, thus interfering with due diligence, monitoring, and other activities. Third, the pandemic spread rapidly worldwide, creating an almost instantaneous and global crisis (Baker et al., 2020) .",

We assume the impact is not uniform; some investors and investments are affected more severely than others. Our conceptual arguments focus on four sources of uncertainty that VC investors try to mitigate in their investments: portfolio firm uncertainty, industry uncertainty, foreign country uncertainty, and solo investment uncertainty. We argue that investors shy away from more uncertain investments in these areas because they find it challenging to deal with multiple layers (or sources) of uncertainty simultaneously (Conti et al., 2019; Howell et al., 2020; Rosenbusch et al., 2013) . We also argue that these declines are moderated by investor prominence because prominent investors, who are highly connected and visible, will be particularly reluctant to engage in more uncertain investments to preserve their position.",

We extend initial studies of VC investor response in single countries by showing a global decline in VC activity due to the increased economic uncertainty and social disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic. We then show that this decline is larger for investments with higher portfolio firm uncertainty (i.e., seed-stage investments), industry uncertainty (i.e., investments in the travel industry), foreign country uncertainty (i.e., international investments), and solo investment uncertainty (i.e., nonsyndicated investments).

This is consistent with the finding that VC investors are reluctant to close new deals during economic crises and focus instead on companies in their portfolios. For example, Bernstein et al.'s (2019) survey of 319 experienced private equity (PE) investors showed they became more involved with their ventures during the GFC (e.g., increased interactions, strategic advice, and monitoring) and were more likely to commit additional equity to these ventures to alleviate financial constraints but engaged in fewer new deals. They attributed this to the features of PE investments: majority control, private ownership, connections to banks, and the availability of uninvested funds.",

These investors are typically adversely affected by crises, reducing their investments in risky asset classes (Hochberg et al., 2018; Kahle and Stulz, 2013) . Thus, VC investors experience difficulty raising new funds or calling on additional funds promised by current investors. Second, the accompanying economic downturn can negatively affect VC investors' portfolios (Block & Sandner, 2009) , making it more difficult for them to generate returns on their investments.

Explanations for differences in how VC investors behave typically refer to how they deal with uncertainty. There are multiple sources of uncertainty in VC investments. The first relates to the characteristics of the portfolio firm (portfolio firm uncertainty). Investments in early-and late-stage portfolio firms systematically differ in their associated uncertainty and risk profiles (e.g., Cochrane, 2005; Conti et al., 2019) . The second is the portfolio firms' industry (industry uncertainty), which influences its prospects (e.g., Gompers et al., 2020; Rosenbusch et al., 2013) . The third refers to the location of the portfolio firm (foreign country uncertainty). Prior research assesses how investors mitigate uncertainty when investing in foreign countries (e.g., Liu & Maula, 2016; Meuleman et al., 2017) . The fourth refers to how investors structure deals and whether and how they use syndication or instead invest alone (solo investment uncertainty) (e.g., Dimov & Milanov, 2010; Wright & Lockett, 2003) .",

Increased uncertainty requires higher discount rates for long-term prospects, making seed investments harder to justify. Indeed, several studies find that investments in early-stage ventures are more heavily affected by crises than are later-stage investments (e.g., Conti et al., 2019; Rosenbusch et al., 2013; Howell et al., 2020) . Initial evidence suggests that a more pronounced decline in early-stage investments is also evident in the COVID-19 crisis. Howell et al. (2020) find that early in the COVID-19 outbreak in the USA, later-stage investments declined a little, but early-stage investments declined significantly more. Similarly, use data on Chinese VCs to show that investments in early-stage ventures declined more than laterstage investments. While both studies focus on a single country, we argue that the increased portfolio firm uncertainty induced by COVID-19 leads to a more severe reduction in seed-stage investments compared to laterstage investments globally. We hypothesize Hypothesis 1a (H1a): As the number of COVID-19 cases increases, VC investors are less likely to invest in seed-stage ventures. Hypothesis 1b (H1b): As the number of COVID-19 cases increases, VC investors are more likely to invest in late-stage ventures 3.2.2 Industry uncertainty: investments in specific industries (i.e., biotech industry vs. travel industry)",

For instance, most countries restricted mobility to reduce the spread of COVID-19 while boosting emergency healthcare investments. These restrictions include stay-at-home orders and domestic and international travel restrictions (Nicola et al., 2020; Pedauga et al., 2021; Sebhatu et al., 2020) . Such restrictions are especially detrimental to the travel, tourism, and hospitality industries (which we refer to as the travel industry), which have suffered massive job losses and steep declines in revenue (Becker, 2020; Haydon et al., 2020) . A plethora of anecdotal evidence supports this. For example, governments undertook considerable efforts to save airlines from bankruptcy: Germany offered a $10b loan to the struggling Lufthansa (Bender, 2020) , while the USA loaned $25b to the American Airlines Group (Siderm & Davidson, 2020) .",

Foreign markets are less certain than domestic markets are (Liu & Maula, 2016) . However, during times of economic stability, international investments enable VC investors to invest outside their core areas to diversify portfolio risk and allocate capital more efficiently (e.g., Conti et al., 2019; Stein, 1997 ). Yet peripheral investments can lead to fewer economies of scale and scope since specialization in a sector or country enables a greater understanding of markets and people (Gompers et al., 2019) . Economic stability makes experimentation less costly because VC investors have better access to funds and can rely on otherwise more predictable returns (Conti et al., 2019; Nanda & Rhodes-Kropf, 2017) .

These explanations suggest that investors engage in syndication to mitigate uncertainty (Dimov & Milanov, 2010; Wright & Lockett, 2003) . From a financial perspective, syndication allows investors to pool funds with other investors, reducing individual investors' financial commitment and potential losses and enabling better portfolio diversification (Block et al., 2019; Dimov & Milanov, 2010) . From a networking perspective, investors invite other investors to join their investment syndicate because they expect their invitation to be reciprocated (Block et al., 2019; Bygrave, 1987) . Hence, investors also use syndication to reduce future deal flow uncertainty. Finally, from a resource accumulation perspective, investors reduce uncertainty by attracting additional resources that can benefit their portfolio ventures (Hochberg et al., 2018) .

We exclude other investment types such as crowdfunding, initial coin offerings, loans, convertible notes, or corporate rounds. Our sample comprises 28,380 funding rounds involving portfolio firms in 130 countries. The unit of analysis is the funding round because our conceptual arguments focus on the investment's stage, location, and industry. Crunchbase reports the funding round public announcement date, which we use to assign a week-year timestamp to each round.

To test H1a and H1b, we create dummy variables that categorize each funding round into a different stage based on Crunchbase's round categorization: seed-stage, early-stage, late-stage, and PE-stage. According to Crunchbase, seed-stage funding rounds include angel, seed, and pre-seed; early-stage rounds include series A and B; late-stage rounds include subsequent rounds from series C onward; while the PE-stage only includes rounds categorized as private equity. 5 A similar classification based on Crunchbase is used by Block et al. (2019) . To test H2a and H2b, we create a categorical measure that accounts for the portfolio firm's primary industry. The variable takes a value of 1 if the venture is in the biotech industries, 2 if the venture is in the travel industries, and 0 otherwise. 6 We use Crunchbase's industry categorization to allocate each funding round to an industry. To test H3, we create a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 when the venture's and lead investor's location match (national investment) and 0 otherwise. Finally, 1 Our main models only include data from 2020. This period includes 7045 funding rounds. We include 2019 data in our robustness tests.

The first variable takes a value of 1 if the venture is in the biotech industries, and 0 otherwise. The second variable takes value of 1 if the venture is in the travel industries, and 0 otherwise. to test H4, we create a dummy variable that takes a value of 0 if the funding round is syndicated and 1 if it is independent (no syndication).",

For example, using before and after the beginning of the pandemic would have two shortcomings. First, we would need to choose a starting date arbitrarily.

Table 4 reports a logistic regression using the Stata command logit to fit a logit model for a binary response by maximum likelihood. This approach models the probability of a positive outcome (e.g., a national investment) given a set of regressors. We cluster the standard errors around the country where the portfolio firm is located in all our models. In robustness tests, we add five dichotomous variables representing the countries with the most investments (USA, UK, China, India, Canada). Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for our estimation sample. On average, there were 42,820 COVID-19 cases a week in the location where the portfolio firm is located. Of the ventures in our sample, 57% are in the seed stage, 30% in the early stages, 3% in late stages, 4% in private equity, and the remainder do not report a stage. To better understand our data, we conduct t tests. Before governments implemented COVID-related policies, there were almost no cases. In contrast, cases reached an average of 47,410 after government interventions (i.e., when the Oxford University tracker government intervention has a value higher than 0). Funding stages also differ before and after governments intervened. The average funding stage is 0.51 when there is no government intervention and 0.60 after governments started to intervene (t = \u22128.33; p = 0.000). Our t test shows that, after governments intervene, the proportion of biotech funding rounds increases from 18 to 20% (t = \u22125.06; p = 0.000), while travel funding rounds decline from 2.7 to 2.3% (t = 2.50; p = 0.01). The proportion of solo investments decreases from 55 to 45% (t = 13.77; p = 0.000). Additionally, national investments represent 34.2% of investment prior to COVID government interventions and 34.3% after (t = \u22120.12; p = 0.45). Table 2 reports pairwise correlations. We find positive correlations between the number of COVID-19 cases and government responses. Figure 1 illustrates how the development of the COVID-19 pandemic affects the VC landscape. We show the global number of new COVID-19 cases and the 4-week moving average of funding rounds. Figure 1 shows that, although the number of funding rounds was declining slightly in 2019, the pandemic significantly accelerated the decline. On average, between January and July 2019, 603 weekly funding rounds were finalized. This compares with an average of 350 weekly funding rounds between January and July 2020, a decline of 42%. This decline is less pronounced than, for example, the 60% decline in funding rounds in China between Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 . We also find a correlation of \u22120.76 between the number of new COVID-19 cases and funding rounds in 2020. \"Mean prior\" includes observation prior to COVID-related government interventions, while \"mean after\" includes observation after government interventions. T test compares the mean of \"prior\" and \"after\". *p < 0.05 Table 3 reports our main results for H1, H2, H5a, and H5b. In models 1 to 8, the base outcome is early stage, which facilitates comparison between seed-stage and late-stage investments. In models 1, 3, 5, and 7, the dependent variable is whether the venture involved in the funding round is a seed-stage company or not. In models 2, 4, 6, and 8, it is whether the venture is a late-stage company. We start by including only our independent variable (models 1-2), followed by all controls (models 3-4), and the moderators (models 7-8). Models 1 and 2 assess the independent variable's impact on funding rounds without incurring the risk of multicollinearity. Consistent with H1a and H1b, we find that the number of COVID-19 cases reduces the chance of a funding round being seed stage, compared to early or latestage deals. In model 4, we also find that the number of COVID-19 cases significantly increases the chances of a late-stage company receiving funding. The odds ratios (Table 3 , models 3 and 4) indicate that a one standard deviation increase in COVID-19 cases decreases the chances of a deal being in the seed stage by 16% and increases the chances of a deal being in the late stage by 24%. Hence, we find support for H1a and H1b.",

Here, the base outcome is the portfolio company being in an industry other than biotech or travel, where biotech and travel investments are compared with those in other industries. In line with our hypotheses, we find that as the number of COVID-19 cases rise, the likelihood of a venture in the travel industry receiving funding declines. At the same time, it increases for firms in the biotech sector. In model 11, the coefficient for COVID-19 loses statistical significance, seemingly due to the inclusion of the variable accounting for emergency investments in healthcare. The odds ratios (Table 3 , models 11 and 12) indicate a one standard deviation increase in COVID-19 cases increases the chances of a deal being in the biotech industry by 8% (not statistically significant) and decreases the chances of a deal being in the travel industry by 41%. Hence, we find support for H2a, but not for H2b. In models 13-16, we add our prominence moderator to test H5b. Models 15 and 16 show that investor prominence positively moderates the impact of COVID-19 cases on the likelihood of a travel venture receiving funding but does not significantly moderate the likelihood of a biotech venture receiving funding. Figure 2c and d illustrate this relationship. The likelihood that an investment is in biotech increases for all investors. However, contrary to our hypothesis, we find that investors with low prominence reduce their investments in the travel industry at a higher rate than their more prominent peers. Hence, we do not find support for H5b. Table 4 reports our main results from logit regressions related to H3, H4, H5c, and H5d. In models 1-8, the dependent variable is whether the funding round is national, meaning the venture and the lead investor are in the same country. In models 1-4, the variables relate to the venture's location (e.g., the number of COVID-19 cases in the country where the venture is located). In models 5-8, the variables are measured in the country where the lead investor is located. If the venture and the lead investor are co-located, there is no difference.

Our analyses demonstrate that VC investors significantly reduce their investments as the number of COVID-19 cases increases. Arguably, they might invest countercyclically, benefiting from lower valuations during economic downturns, as their relatively long holding periods mean exits will likely occur All models fit a logit regression. This accounts for the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable. We restrict the sample to investments closed in 2020. In models 1-4, variables are associated with the country of the venture (e.g., COVID-19 cases). In models 5-8, variables are associated with the country of the lead investor (if different from the venture's country). In models 9-12, the sample is restricted to investments where the venture and the lead investor are located in the same country. Standard errors, clustered around the country of the venture, in parenthesis. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, and \u2020p < 0.10 (two-tailed tests) during the next economic cycle. However, studies in multiple contexts show that the VC investment process is not robust when multiple layers of uncertainty increase simultaneously (e.g., Conti et al., 2019; Howell et al., 2020; Rosenbusch et al., 2013) . VC investors have evolved strategies, including specialization, selection, monitoring, value-adding, and syndication, to deal with uncertainty. During crises, investments with the highest uncertainty become less attractive, and investor mitigation strategies are less effective. Thus, VC investors \"flee to quality\" (Bernanke et al., 1996) even in the context of their riskier investment market, just as investors in traditional (less risky) credit and stock markets do.",

The findings are consistent with this expectation. Our final set of hypotheses concerns how an investor's prominence may moderate the use of uncertaintymitigating strategies in response to increased uncertainty. The overarching hypothesis is that more prominent investors behave conservatively, reducing their investments in relatively uncertain investments more than less prominent investors do.

We extend this research to the COVID-19 crisis. Like , , and Howell et al.

In line with our theoretical considerations, we find that VC investors react to the COVID-19-induced spike in uncertainty by adapting their investment behavior. VC investors reduce their investing the most in the least certain areas (i.e., investments in seed-stage ventures, foreign portfolio firms, industries affected more heavily by the COVID-19 crisis, and non-syndicated investments).

This finding echoes Dimov et al. (2007) , who suggest that reputational considerations shape VC investors' decisions. Our results suggest that future research on VC investment should account for the role of prominence.",

The evidence on how crises affect entrepreneurial firms is mixed (e.g., Bradley et al., 2011; Cowling et al., 2015; Klapper & Love, 2011) . Studies suggest crises coincide with fewer high quality, high potential start-ups (e.g., Bartz & Winkler, 2016; Davidsson & Gordon, 2016; Grilli, 2011) , perhaps due to their reduced access to external finance (i.e., a \"credit crunch\") (Cowling et al., 2012; Bartz & Winkler, 2016) . We contribute to this research by documenting that the COVID-19-induced decline in equity investments creates a similar situation that may lead to a funding gap for some entrepreneurial firms, especially those at the seed stage, in specific industries (i.e., travel), and those seeking international investment. We also add to research on crises and entrepreneurship by showing that financial instability does not affect all ventures equally and is partially driven by VC investors' behavior changes.",

The development of the VC market is intertwined with the development of other financial markets, like the main market for IPOs (e.g., Black & Gilson, 1998) and the second tier market for IPOs (e.g., Vismara et al., 2012) .

            "text": "Such developments could interfere with our results. For example, our finding that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with decreased investments in seed-stage ventures. Both crowdfunding and ICOs are especially attractive for seed ventures, in part because of low transaction costs enabled by digitalization (e.g., Block et al., 2020; Fisch, 2019) . Hence, VCs' lower investments could partially reflect seed-stage ventures relying more heavily on digital finance instruments. Similarly, we find that VC investments in international ventures decrease. Again, this finding could be affected by a shift towards digital finance, allowing ventures to collect funds from investors worldwide. Thus, ventures located in remote areas without an active VC scene might opt for such alternatives, especially during a pandemic. This argument is related to recent research that explores how digital finance can democratize entrepreneurial finance. Initial evidence suggests that both crowdfunding (e.g., Cumming et al., 2021) and ICOs (e.g., help democratize entrepreneurial finance and enable more remotely located ventures to access funding.",
