BSS have known a rampant growth during recent years, through technological advances, re-evaluated business models and reinvention of the mean's utility. Yet, for a realized use of dockless BSS and a successful integration in the urban mobility ecosystem to be achieved, the factors that promote willingness to use them need to be explored. By using a sample of 500 stated preference data, classification trees and random forest models are built for three groups of potential BSS users; car users, bus users and pedestrians. Among the considered factors are BSS cost gains, BSS In Vehicle Time (IVT) and Out of Vehicle Time (OVT) gains, trip frequency, purpose and duration. More specific, it was found that BSS potential, increases for short duration trips of up to 21 min for car users. Bus users and pedestrians were found to be more likely to choose a BSS option for a higher cost up to 0,60 and 0,75 euros respectively. On the other side sociodemographic characteristics such as household income, gender, education level and occupation did not found to be the dominant factors for the mode choice decision. OVT is found only to be relatively important for bus users, while the cost gains are comparatively more significant for bus users and pedestrians.",

This combined with the cardominant paradigm of recent years, makes adopting socially, environmentally and economically sustainable practices an urgent necessity. The emergence of sharing economies and shared mobility in particularly is widely considered a much promising solution to this predicament. More specifically, increased usage of Bike Sharing Systems (BSS) and cycling in general has been correlated with an abundance of positive externalities, such as health benefits [2] , reduced traffic congestion [3] such as environmental benefits [4] .",

            "text": "BSSs' evolutionary history can be summed up in four generations of systems. The first generation of BSSs first appeared in 1965 in Amsterdam and they became known as \"White Bikes\" [5] . The bikes were randomly allocated in the city center and free for public use, something that made them susceptible to wear, vandalism and theft and resulted in the system's cease of operations. The second generation, known as \"Coin Deposit Systems\" began operations in Denmark in 1991 consisted of bikes with a lock installed, that users could unlock by a refundable deposit [4] . While this attempted to improve on the first generation's failures, it only partially did, as there was no mechanism in place to limit the bike-share usage times and the users often kept the bicycles for extended periods of time. The third generation of BSSs, that started operating in France in 1998 (known as \"IT based systems\") was better equipped to handle those problems [5] . It included docking stations with smart technology that made it possible to know when a bike was taken to and from a station [6] . It also incorporated electronic means of payment and high deposits that made it possible to identify the users and deter theft. While the fourth generation of BSS was already defined by many field experts before the rise of dockless BSS, as a system that is demand responsive and a fully integrated part of the city's transportation system, during recent years it has come to be identified with the rise of dockless BSSs [6, 7] . Dockless BSS' explosive growth started in China in 2015 and expanded worldwide. The systems' flexibility allows users to choose the starting and ending point of their trips without depending on rigidly placed docking stations. This is made possible by Global Position System (GPS) sensors that are installed on its bike and the widespread use of smart devices by users that allow them to easily locate, unlock and ride the bicycles in the urban environment [8] . Currently, the operational BSSs around the world are a mix of third and fourth generation systems, that often operate complimentary to one another.",

The survey was answered by users of the three currently dominant modes of transport in Thessaloniki; car users, bus users and pedestrians, depending on which of those modes they used for their most frequent trip. The interviewees were asked about the characteristics of their last typical trip, including duration, IVT (In Vehicle Time) and OVT (Out of Vehicle Time), cost etc. Using those answers, competing values of cost, IVT and OVT for the BSS (or total trip time in the case of pedestrians) were calculated by the survey algorithm and presented to the interviewees in the last section of the survey as a set of 9 mode choosing scenarios. In those scenarios the interviewees had to choose between their current mode of preference, with the cost, IVT and OVT they stated, and the dockless BSS with varying competing combinations of cost, OVT and IVT.",

As can be easily interpreted from the tree, variables related to mode specific features such as duration and cost are closer to the root node (upper part of the tree). Reduced trip duration and especially increased IVT gain appear to be critical factors towards preferring the BSS. The thresholds chosen by the model for those factors are relatively low, as the first split of the dataset happens for trips shorter or longer than 21 min, while car users would require significant IVT benefits in order to make the switch to BSS. On the other hand while reduced cost gain does make preferring the BSS more likely, car users can prefer the BSS even at a slightly higher cost per trip. The combination of factors that seems to increase the likelihood of prefering the BSS over the car is a combination of low trip duration, high IVT gains, relatively younger age groups and work as a trip purpose. The random forest model that was fitted for car users had a classification error of 10.70%. The relative importance of the variables that were used in the model is shown in Fig. 2 . Similarly, to the results of the classification tree the variables that contribute most to decision making are cost gain, trip duration and IVT gain, while household income also stands out.",

Both car and bus users would be willing to use the BSS even if its cost is slightly higher compared to their mode of preference but only if using it is accompanied with IVT gains, while pedestrians would consider using BSS if the cost is low and it offers them trip time gains. OVT gains can be a significant factor towards using BSS for bus users, something that is true to a much lesser degree for car users. If the times it takes to locate a shared bike and get to its location is significantly less than the time it takes to walk to the bus stop and wait for the bus, this time gain is more likely to make them consider using the BSS. Furthermore, the relative importance of the possible cost gain that comes with using the BSS is higher for bus users and pedestrians compared to car users, indicating that for those groups of users keeping the BSS costs as low as possible is a more crucial factor.",
