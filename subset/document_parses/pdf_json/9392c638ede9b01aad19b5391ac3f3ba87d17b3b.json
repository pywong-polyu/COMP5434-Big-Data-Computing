            "text": "Today, there is a level of panic and chaos dominating the entire world due to the massive outbreak in the second wave of COVID-19 disease. As the disease has numerous symptoms ranging from a simple fever to the inability to breathe, which may lead to death. One of these symptoms is a cough which is considered one of the most common symptoms for COVID-19 disease. Recent research shows that the cough of a COVID-19 patient has distinct features that are different from other diseases. Consequently, the cough sound can be detected and classified to be used as a preliminary diagnosis of the COVID-19, which will help in reducing the spreading of that disease. The artificial intelligence (AI) engine can diagnose COVID-19 diseases by executing differential analysis of its inherent characteristics and comparing it to other non-COVID-19 coughs. However, the diagnosis of a COVID-19 infection by cough alone is an extremely challenging multidisciplinary problem. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid framework for efficiently COVID-19 detection and diagnosis using various ML algorithms from cough audio signals. The accuracy of this framework is improved with the utilization of the genetic algorithm with the ML techniques. We also assess the proposed system called CR19 for diagnosis on metrics such as precision, recall, F-measure. The results proved that the hybrid (GA-ML) technique provides superior results based on different evaluation metrics compared with ML approaches such as LR, LDA, KNN, CART, NB, and SVM. The proposed framework achieve an accuracy equal to 92.19%, 94.32%, 97.87%, 92.19%, 91.48%, and 93.61% in compared with the ML are 90.78, 92.90, 95.74, 87.94, 81.56, and 92.198 for LR, LDA, KNN, CART, NB, and SVM respectively. The proposed framework will efficiently help the physicians provide a proper medical decision regarding the COVID-19 analysis, thereby saving more lives. Therefore, this CR19 framework can be a clinical decision assistance tool used to channel clinical testing and treatment to those who need it the most, thereby saving more lives.",

The new state-of-the-art digital technologies are being applied in such a pandemic for diagnosis, detection, and tracking. The straightforward application comes from utilizing the artificial intelligence (AI) technique for automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 infection from computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images (Goel et al. 2020; Zebin and Rezvy 2020; Apostolopoulos and Mpesiana 2020a, b; Malhotra et al. 2021; Lalmuanawma et al. 2020) . The strategy works with a dataset of COVID-19 and normal chest X-ray images. The difficulty with this technique is that many people are waiting for hours in hospitals for scan examinations that burden the medical system. This makes a late diagnosis of the infectious causes, which leads to an outbreak of the disease. In another direction, tremendous efforts are being made to early diagnose infectious people to prevent the spread of the disease using mobile apps or websites, such as the strategies in China and South Korea, by discovering patients, tracing, and isolating them (Imran et al. 2020; Maghdid et al. 2020; Menni et al. 2020) . New technologies in ICT help the medical sector monitor, diagnose, and track infected patients to control the spread of COVID-19. But with the spreading of the pandemic worldwide nowadays, this strategy needs development to tackle the change of the situation in our lives. The danger of this disease is that most people who develop COVID-19 do not show any symptoms, and thus they are one of the main reasons for the outbreak of the disease. Thus, the most reliable technique is required, composed of several modern technologies such as the internet of things (IoT) with machine learning for diagnosis and tracking the infected patient.",

John Holland invented it in 1975, and it is typically employed by biological theory such as mutation, crossover, and selection into computer science to produce high-quality solutions for optimization and search problems. Evolutionary algorithms need a data structure to depict and assess solutions from old solutions to solve problems. For example, in Gas, the search problem's variables are encoded into finite-length strings of symbols of specific cardinality. So, each solution is represented by chromosomes which are composed of genes. These genes reflect a proposed solution to the problem that the GA is trying to solve. Both chromosomes are called population collection. The working principles of GA begin with the population, which is initialized randomly based on the data. This population in solution is then modified using different operators, namely reproduction, crossover, mutation. The steps for GA are as follow: 1) Evaluation: Once the population is initialized or an offspring population is created, the fitness values of the candidate solutions are evaluated. This determines the fitness value of each of the chromosomes and produces as output how \"fit\" our how \"good\" the solution is concerning the problem in consideration. (a chromosome is a set of parameters that define a candidate solution to the problem that the genetic algorithm is trying to solve). 2) Selection: This step is used for reproduction to select the best-fitted chromosomes as parents pass the genes for the next generation and create a new population. The commonly used technique for selection is Roulette-Wheel selection (Goldberg and Holland 1988) . In roulette, selection chromosomes are selected based on their fitness relative to all other chromosomes in the population. Thus, the ith string in the population is selected with probability (Fi) proportional to the fitness value (Ai), where Ai is the fitness value of each individual in the population. The roulette wheel selection scheme can be implemented as follows (Burke et al. 2014 ):",

However, these mentioned speechbased COVID-19 analysis procedures necessitate massive attempts for the collection of large data sets. Therefore, these procedures can be supported by telemedicine care or smartphone applications. Brown et al. (2020) developed an application with crossplatform to collect crowdsourced information of breath and cough sounds to differentiate between unhealthy and healthy individuals. The voice signals are employed to discriminate between asthma, healthy, and COVID-19 individuals. The authors constructed three binary classification algorithms to (a) differentiate persons with asthma who acknowledged a cough from positive COVID-19 persons with a cough, (b) differentiate positive COVID-19 persons from healthy persons, and (c) discriminate healthy persons who have a cough from positive COVID-19 persons who have a cough. Approximately greater than 10 K samples (7000 distinctive persons) contributed to collecting crowdsourced data, out of which greater than 200 registered to be positive COVID-19 cases. Different audio augmentation processes are utilized to expand the size of the data set samples. The SVM, gradient boosting trees, and logistic regression classifiers are employed for the categorization mission. This analysis employs the cumulative measure of the AUC (area under the curve) for execution evaluation. AUC of larger than 70% is obtained in the whole suggested classification algorithms. Sharma et al. (2020) developed efficient cough-based COVID-19 diagnosis algorithms. The speech, breath, and cough sounds are utilized to measure biomarkers in the suggested audibility applications. Various nine vocal sounds accumulate for every patient, including vowel, breath (deep and shallow), and cough (heavy and shallow) phonations. The employed nine different vocals depict distinct physical situations of the breathing procedure. Multidimensional temporal and spectral characteristics are obtained from the files of the audio signals. The data curation and classification assignments are under development for further future research directions. The suggested work is complemented by a web-based application for data collection and an open voice dataset source of roughly 1000 trials.",

The sounds of the person breathing can be input into the person's smartphone through the attached microphone. Deep learning, machine learning, and signal processing algorithms can be employed to the sound of breathing to extract the main features and categorize the input sound into negative and positive COVID-19 cases. Also, the suggested smartphonebased mobile application can be utilized as a self-test while eradicating the costs and risks related to visiting hospitals and healthcare medical institutions. The suggested system can be supplemented with data acquired from blood oxygenation estimated from a pulse oximeter and a lung volume (spirometer). The collected data must be primarily labeled as negative and positive COVID-19 cases by therapeutic professionals based on medical outcomes to prepare the suggested framework. Then, ML algorithms can obtain the main features and categorize new input sounds based on the training of the suggested framework. Trivedy et al.

The device of the spirometer is utilized to determine the volume of inspired and expired air.

GA-KNN gives superior results compared to other classifiers, which indicates that this will provide a very good diagnosis for COVID-19 from the patient's cough. As we observe from Fig. 11 , the accuracy of GA-ML increases for all classifiers as compare non-GA based techniques. We also observe that out of these six classifiers, GA-KNN shows more than 97% accuracy in the diagnosis of COVID-19 from cough audio signals, as also shown in Fig. 12 . Also, Table 3 illustrates the comparative study between machine learning algorithms (ML) and proposed hybrid genetic algorithm with machine learning (GA-ML) for COVID-19 detection-based cough data as positive or negative status. Finally, Table 4 compares the proposed CR19 framework in comparison to the previous related methods.
