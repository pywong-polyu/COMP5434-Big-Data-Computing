The main objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of T helper (Th) cell subtypes, including Th1, Th17, and Treg cells, in moderate-to-severe and critical COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Twenty-nine moderate-to-severe and 13 critical patients confirmed for COVID-19, and 15 healthy subjects were included in this study. Interferon-c (IFN-c)-producing Th1 and interleukin-17A-producing Th17 and Treg cells in peripheral blood were measured with flow cytometry. The frequency of Th1 and Th17 was significantly decreased in critical patients compared to healthy subjects (aMD: \u00c02.76 and \u00c0 2.34) and moderate-to-severe patients (aMD: \u00c01.89 and \u00c0 1.89), respectively (p < 0.05). Differences were not significant between moderate-to-severe patients and healthy subjects for both Th1 (p = 0.358) and Th17 (p = 0.535), respectively. In contrast, significant difference was not observed between study subjects regarding the frequency of Treg cells. Patients with critical COVID-19 had a markedly lower Th1/Treg and Th17/Treg ratios compared with the controls and moderate-to-severe cases. Our study showed a dysregulated balance of Th1 and Th17 cells and its relation to the severity of COVID-19.",

Many COVID-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which leads to pulmonary edema and lung failure, as well as liver, heart, and kidney damages [8, 9] . Severe proinflammatory response or a cytokine storm causes ARDS and dysfunction of several organs. It has also been suggested that inflammatory response is very different in adults and children. Aging is associated with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, which control neutrophil functions, and is correlated with the severity of ARDS [10] . According to the results of epidemiological studies, older male patients with comorbidity are more likely to die.",

The impaired innate immune response also affects subsequent adaptive responses, and therefore, viral innate immune evasion often weakens completely protective immunity. Cellular responses are initiated days after innate immunity. Recent studies have shown that there is a reduced count of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls [12] [13] [14] . However, there is poor information regarding the concomitant role of Th1 and Th17 cells, which are two inflammatory subsets of CD4 + T cells.

A significant reduction in the frequency of lymphocytes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may deplete immune cells and prevent host cellular immunity. SARS-CoV-2, like the older sister of this family (i.e., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]), may able to activate the apoptosis pathways and promote apoptosis of T lymphocytes [19] . However, no evidence shows the direct infection of T cells by SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, apoptosis of T cells, which was observed in the spleens and lymph nodes of patients who had died from COVID-19, was related to increased FAS expression [20, 21] . Apoptosis of T cells might be a key element, leading to exacerbations of infected subjects [22] . A similar mechanism could occur in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the much more increase in D-dimer in the critical COVID-19 patients could be considered as a sign of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in these patients [23] .",

It seems that proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes migrate from blood to the lung of critical COVID-19 patients and cause the reduced frequency of these immune cells in peripheral blood. The shift to proinflammatory T helper cells (Th1, Th17) in the lungs gives rise to diffuse alveolar destruction with abundant neutrophils and macrophages [25, 26] . In acute respiratory distress syndrome, IL-17 promotes the damage of the lung by several mechanisms such as inappropriate neutrophil recruitment, apoptosis inhibition through stimulating the production of granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF), and induction of proinflammatory mediators [26] . Moreover, recruited Th1 cells to the lung will trigger macrophage activation syndrome, which results in cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. In support of this concept, a recently published study has shown higher proportions of neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) of patients with severe-to-critical SARS-CoV-2 infection [27] .",

            "text": "It seems that Th1 and Th17 cells have the main role to increase the inflammatory condition of critical patients. T helper cells (Th1, Th17) perform their effector functions through producing inflammatory cytokines including IFN-c and IL-17, respectively. In this regard, it seems that inhibition of IFN-c or IL-17 may improve the clinical status of critical patients. In support of this concept, some studies showed that critical patients had an increased amount of IFN-c or IL-17 compared with moderate patients or healthy control subjects [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Moreover, studies reported that patients with ankylosing spondylitis or rheumatic diseases who were on IL-17 inhibitor showed better clinical improvement [33] . It could be concluded that early inhibition of IL-17 may contribute to the better clinical status. Now we know that clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not limited to the respiratory system. Some other organs can be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, evidence indicates that the brain can be targeted by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may infect the brain through two pathways; (i) ACE2 receptor-dependent pathway in which SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, which is expressed in the brain and (ii) ACE2 receptor-independent pathway in which SARS-CoV-2 infect the brain via the olfactory bulb upon inhalation. As a consequence of brain infection, neurological complications may appear in patients, including encephalopathy, encephalitis, seizures, and cerebrovascular events. Critical patients are more likely to have neurological complications compared with moderate patients. Thus, a better understanding of the immunological characteristics of patients may improve the clinical status of them and reduce the complications related to other organs [34] [35] [36] . Moreover, identifying biological pathways and transcriptomic profiles which were altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help to characterize new targets for controlling the COVID-19. By using computational analysis, studies suggested that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), serine-threonine kinase (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and I kappa B Kinase (IKK) inhibitors could be considered in patients with COVID-19 [37, 38] . Our study has several limitations, that is, the small number of subjects, heterogeneous patients, lack of lymphocyte subset analysis from alveolar lavage fluid, and lack of patient monitoring before and after infection. Therefore, more studies regarding to the role of these immune cells in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 are required.",
