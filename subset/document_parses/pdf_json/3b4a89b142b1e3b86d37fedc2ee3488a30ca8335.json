(b) From 1750 to 1975, income inequality spread worldwide as profits from industrial and post-industrial technologies were not equally shared to all. (c) From 1850 to 1914, living standards and labor productivity levels converged in the global North, as 50 million people left Europe to settle in places with abundant resources, transferring institutions, technologies, and capital. (d) From 1870 to 1914, domestic inequality increased in the global North, as entrepreneurship, industrialization, and financial manipulation channeled new profits mainly to the wealthy. (e) From 1930 to 1980, higher taxes on the wealthy helped to provide benefits and support public programs. (f) From 1980 till present, economic policy choices have again resulted in increasing inequality in favor of the global North. The arrival of Covid-19 crisis affects income and wealth inequality, exacerbating the phenomenon.",

Initially, the cultural background affects the quality and functioning of political institutions and this consists the firstround effects. Then, political institutions shape economic institutions, and this is the second-round affect, which in turn create structures and provide incentives for individuals to take action. The prevailing economic institutions ultimately determine the wealth distribution and the extent of economic growth. This amounts to the third round of effects. The first and very critical level of influence, the interconnection between cultural background and political institutions, is located when different portfolios of cultural values and practices prevail in a society, developing different political institutions. Societies, for example, that place a big emphasis on the notion of collectivism naturally form participatory institutions at different levels of organization in society. If, on the other hand, the concept of results has a dominant position in a socialcultural organization, then society itself, especially in times of crisis, will more easily accept a solution of authoritarian rule. Inglehart (1997) states that it is foolish to believe that culture is neutral. Every society legitimizes the establishment of a social order, in part because the ruling class seeks through culture to shape the values that will help perpetuate it (Inglehart, 1997) . Alesina and Glaeser (2004) argue that in order to identify the forces that have shaped the current form of society, one must include in the analysis a review of historical events, while one must also identify what interests are being served by the dominant cultural background. At the same time, while referring to the Western world, what is needed, is to be focus on how Western political leaderships managed to direct the public into supporting their ideas and positions.",

The cultural backlash theory of Inglehart and Norris, which sees populism as being the result of rigidity in traditional social categories driven by social change, does not allow us to understand why so many voters have gone from an economic definition to a cultural definition of their identity. Political identity is a group stereotype. As neither \"camp\" exactly meets our expectations, we choose the one we are closest to and which is also the furthest from the ideas we reject (Pisany-Ferry, 2020). This identification, once implemented, colors our perceptions of reality. There are, however, different ways of defining ourselves politically: on an economic basis, based on work challenges, income distribution, and social mobility and, alternatively, in a cultural basis, in relation to levels of openness to minorities or attitudes toward migration. The coexistence of these two dimensions (and possibly more) can lead voters to move from one stereotype to another.

This is a broad increase and includes markets of advanced and emerging economies, right and left-wing parties, as well as existing and new entrants. While parties labeled as being populist by political scientists tend to have far more nationalist proposals for economic policy, the shift in preferences toward economic nationalism is broadly visible. Clearly, these shifts are not universal. In advanced economies, the biggest changes are being related to limitations on migration and trade. In emerging economies, the biggest shifts in preferences were in connection to industrial policies that favored specific sectors and industrial concentration. Trade protectionism and skepticism toward multilateral organizations and agreements have increased in both advanced and emerging economies. Right-wing parties tend to be more nationalistic than left-wing parties in terms of imposing restrictions on migration and foreign direct investments and in being involved in confrontations, but there is no significant difference in terms of trade protectionism (de Bolle & Zettelmeyer, 2019) .",

Non-democracies are excluded, since there is no real meaning in comparing countries where democratic rights systematically are being limited or violated to consolidated democracies.

Very few parties call themselves populist and even fewer brag about their authoritarian streak. It is also, given the scope of the material, not possible to scrutinize each and every party. Since the aim of the categorization is to reflect deeply held ideological views of the party, the index relies heavily on secondary sources. To the extent that it has been possible, it follows typical and existing categorizations. Thus, a number of different sources have been used: scholarly literature on the European party system focusing in general on populist parties, as well as particular parties; ideological labels from internet sources, and the expert study Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), a quantitative summary of where parties belong on the left-to-right spectrum, combined with additional dimensions that serve to identify right-wing populists (but not left-wing populists) using, for instance, views on minority rights, immigration and multiculturalism. In general, it is not as difficult to categorize political parties as one might expect. Despite some disagreement on labels, there is a rather wide consensus among scholars on where parties fit in-when in doubt, Timbro has tried to judge the very core of a party's ideology using both secondary and primary sources (such as official party platforms). The division between \"authoritarian\" or \"extreme\" depends on the specific view on the concept of democracy. Only explicitly anti-democratic parties have been categorised as anti-democratic. Parties embracing nazism, fascism, communism, trotskyism and maoism have been regarded extreme. Parties classified as authoritarian are anti-liberal, but still democratic.",
