In memory of his many contributions to coal and mineral processing, he will be honored by a gathering of renowned engineers and scientists for two special sessions on \"Frank F. Aplan: Between Theory and Practice\" to be held in conjunction with the MINEXCHANGE 2022 SME Annual Conference & Expo in Salt Lake City, Utah. He influenced his students and colleagues alike with his enthusiasm for living, love of jazz, wine and history, and passion for mineral processing, especially putting theory into practice. Much of his work was based on process mineralogy principles-knowing first the characteristics of the mineral or material and then understanding the appropriate processes for beneficiation. This special issue and the special sessions will include papers focused on applications of process mineralogy in the areas of the froth flotation of coal and ores, beneficiation of rare earth elements and other critical minerals, flocculation, heavy media separations, process design, and other related topics.",
