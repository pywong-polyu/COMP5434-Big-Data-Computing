WBSNs assist human beings in various monitoring applications such as health-care, entertainment, rehabilitation systems, and sports. Life-critical health-care applications of WBSNs consider both reliability and delay as major Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. In addition to the common limitations and challenges of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), WBSNs pose distinct constraints due to the behavior and chemistry of the human body. e biomedical sensor nodes (BMSNs) adopt multihop communication while reporting the heterogeneous natured physiological parameters to the nearby base station also called local coordinator. Routing in WBSNs becomes a challenging job due to the necessary QoS considerations, overheated in-body BMSNs, and high and dynamic path loss. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing routing protocols integrate the aforementioned issues in their designs. In this research work, a multiconstraint-aware routing mechanism (modular-based) is proposed which considers the QoS parameters, dynamic and high path loss, and the overheated nodes issue. Two types of network frameworks, with and without relay/forwarder nodes, are being used. e data packets containing physiological parameters of the human body are categorized into delay-constrained, reliability-constrained, critical (both delay-and reliability-constrained), and nonconstrained data packets. NS-2 is being used to carry out the simulations of the proposed mechanism. e simulation results reveal that the proposed mechanism has improved the QoS-aware routing for WBSNs by adopting the proposed multiconstraint-aware strategy.",

Now, this trend is changing by the rapid increase in the elderly population living with chronic diseases and thus requires continuous monitoring [1] . According to the World Population Ageing 2019, the worldwide elderly population (65 + aged people) is expected to be increased from 703 million to 1500 million between 2019 and 2050 [2] . Similarly, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world's population of 60 + aged people between 2015 and 2050 will be almost doubled (12%-22%) [3] . e rate of growth in the elderly population is high in developing countries as compared to developed countries [4] . Besides the people suffering from chronic diseases, the patients inside the hospitals also require various levels of monitoring-ranging from a couple of times a day to continuous monitoring. e continuous and on-and-off health monitoring require a huge amount of additional medical and health-care costs [3] . WBSN has emerged to provide continuous and unsupervised physiological parameters monitoring of the human body. It may be helpful to solve the issues of chronic diseases, increased elderly population, and continuous and on-and-off inhospital monitoring [5] .",

            "text": "In WBSNs, the tiny, lightweight, cost-effective, and lowpower BMSNs are implanted inside the human body to capture and observe the physiological parameters [6] . e heterogeneous nature of BMSNs generates various kinds of data packets that require different QoS parameters among which delay and reliability are of key importance [7] . ere may be some data packets that require the shortest delay and highest possible reliability and others can allow some losses but need to assure the delivery with the shortest delay. Some data packets should be delivered with no or minimum losses but not within a specific time frame while others containing routine readings of physiological parameters do not have any such constraints. e electromagnetic waves are absorbed by the human tissues during wireless communication among different inbody BMSNs as they are saline water in nature. e electromagnetic waves absorption and the energy consumed by the implanted BMSNs to carry out their routine operations are the two main reasons that may overheat the in-body BMSNs [8] . ese overheated nodes may harm or affect the growth of human tissues [8] . Furthermore, in conventional wireless communication, path loss occurs due to two main reasons: multipath fading and free-space wave propagation. As WBSNs deal with the human body thereby resulting in high and dynamic path loss, therefore the conventional models used for path loss are not directly applicable. e reasons behind this dynamic and high path loss are the wireless communications among the different in-body BMSNs being through the human body and the human body movement [9] . e aforementioned issues of the WBSNs make routing a challenging task [10] . During the last decade, a number of routing protocols have been proposed to address the aforementioned issues that may be categorized based on QoS parameters, postural movement, and temperature rise. It is observed that most of the existing routing protocols are designed to address a single issue while few of them are designed to handle two of these issues. To the best of the authors' information, none of the existing routing protocols integrate the demanding QoS data, the human body movement, in-body wireless communications issues, and the overheating issue of the in-body BMSNs in their designs. In our previous research articles, critical data routing (CDR) [11] focuses on critical data, reliability aware routing (RAR) [12] considers reliability conscious data, and data-centric routing (DCR) [13] works on delay as well as reliability conscious data.",

Recently the researchers have proposed various routing algorithms for WBSNs that might be categorized based on QoS parameters, postural movement, and temperature rise. It is observed that most of the existing routing protocols are designed to address a single issue while a few of them are designed to handle two of these issues. e captured physiological parameters demand different QoS parameters and can be classified as critical data (CD), reliability-conscious data (RCD), delay-conscious data (DCD), and nonconscious data (NCD) [7, [13] [14] [15] . QPRD [14] uses RCD and NCD and QPRR [15] uses DCD and NCD, while ZEQoS [16] uses DCD, RCD, and NCD classes of data. All these routing schemes are designed considering a hospital-based scenario where the physiological parameters are displayed. PARA [17] classifies the captured data into emergency, on-demand, and periodic classes. All these routing schemes take care of the demanding QoS parameter and are not considering the overheated nodes and human body movement issues of WBSNs. e routing mechanisms considering the demanding QoS data have shortcomings in their decision making while selecting a suitable next hop. Some of them such as QPRD, QPRR, and ZEQoS consider the demanding QoS parameter on the node level. Others such as TQMoS use a minimum hop-count strategy in the selection of suitable next hop for all types of data; even the RCD packets can tolerate some delays. Secondly, it uses redundant transmission for CD packets.",

It is based on the withdrawn policy to forward the data using nonoverheated nodes. LTR [20] is another routing scheme where the next-hop selection decision is made by not considering the overheated nodes. On the other hand, LTRT [21] based on Dijkstra's algorithm evaluates the end-to-end path temperature level and follows the path having less temperature level. e routing protocols addressing the overheated nodes issue overlook the demanding QoS of the captured data and human body movement. TTRP [22] is another routing protocol that considers the trust and overheated nodes while selecting the next-hop node. MTR [23] is the only routing protocol that considers both the overheated nodes issue along with the human body movement but it overlooks the high path loss due to the inbody wireless communication and demanding QoS data.",

It is the main reason that the normal path loss models cannot be used with WBSNs.

As the TTL deadline is becoming relaxed, MCARMR results in improved performance when compared with others at low DGR. For high DGR, its performance remains below MCARM because of high network congestion on the RNs caused by high DGR [44] . At tight TTL deadlines, the slightly poor performance of MCARMR compared with MCARM considering both high and low DGRs is because of the delays at the RNs. e performance of TMQoS and LTRT in terms of OTAPSR for DCD packets is improving as the TTL deadline becomes relaxed; however, they are still poorly performing when compared to MCARM and MCARMR due to not considering the in-body wireless communication and human body movements. TQMoS results in improved performance compared to LTRT because of the provision of demanding QoS data which is not considered by LTRT. Figures 12(a) and 12(b) illustrate the OTAPSR for CD packets against demanded TTL at different wireless link quality threshold levels by averaging their results at high and low GDGRs, respectively. By comparing the results of TQMoS for DCD packets with CD packets, it is clear that it gives comparatively better results for DCD packets because of the redundant transmission in the case of the CD packets. Moreover, there is no difference in the results of other mechanisms. Figures 13(a) and 13(b) present the maximum temperature increase of the inbody BMSNs for DCD/RCD/NCD packets and CD packets against DGRs at different wireless link quality threshold levels by averaging their results, respectively. It is clear that the temperature increase is becoming more with the rise in the DGRs for all mechanisms. More communications occur at high DGR that results in a temperature increase of the inbody BMSNs [45] . MCARMR results in a lower temperature increase when compared with other mechanisms because the RNs are used to forward the captured data of the BMSNs. LTRT outperforms MCARM and TQMoS as its main aim is to address the temperature increase issue of the in-body BMSNs.",
