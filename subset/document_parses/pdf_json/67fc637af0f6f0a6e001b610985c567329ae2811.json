Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), as a temporary life support technique for refractory respiratory or cardiac failure, has been applied in COVID-19 patients [1] . However, the impact of ECMO on outcomes from COVID-19 was controversial. Referring to the present case series and the COVID-19 cohort in China, the mortality of patients undergoing ECMO ranged from 42 to 83% [2, 3] . The Chinese Society of Extracorporeal Life Support (CSECLS) performed a survey of ECMO programs for COVID-19 in China, aimed at investigating the program organization and the potential factors associated with outcomes during the pandemic.",

Twenty-seven respondents belonged to the medical assistance teams which were dispatched to aid Hubei and 39 respondents aided other hospitals in their original province, while 45 respondents managed COVID-19 patients with ECMO within their original hospitals. Fifty-one of 79 ECMO programs (15 in Hubei and 36 outside Hubei) were organized temporarily in response to the crisis. Thirty-two hospitals with temporary ECMO programs did not have any ECMO cases before. The geographic distribution of the 79 ECMO programs and responders' aid to Hubei is shown in Fig. 1 . Patient management characteristics are illustrated in Table 1 . Compared with ECMO programs in Hubei, more programs outside Hubei initiated ECMO in older patients (36.7% vs 3.3% in age \u2265 75, p = 0.001; 55.1% vs 26.7% in age 65-74, p = 0.014).",

With limited medical resources in Hubei, patients with a higher likelihood of survival were chosen to receive ECMO, namely younger patients. However, medical resources were adequate outside Hubei. That might be the main reason for more ECMO programs outside Hubei applied ECMO in older patients (age > 65), aiming at minimizing the local mortality of COVID-19. Age is a key driver of mortality, helping clinicians to select the most appropriate candidates for ECMO among severe ARDS patients [6] . However, age should be reconsidered in the discussions of indications for ECMO in COVID-19. To the limitation, the patient's detailed characteristic was not obtained in the present study. Further multicenter registry on COVID-19 patients receiving ECMO support would be performed. To summarize, our large national survey provided detailed information regarding the organization of ECMO programs for COVID-19 in China. To improve outcomes with ECMO during the pandemic, it is key to provide information about ECMO experience, patient selection, and resource allocation to ECMO programs throughout the world. ",
