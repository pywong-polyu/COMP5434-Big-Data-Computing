In this study, we assess the multispace long-term cumulative exposure and infection risks of occupants considering practical occupant behaviors. Accordingly, a novel methodology combining occupant trajectory analysis and ventilation rate measurement is presented herein. This methodology is applied to a typical nursing unit in an inpatient building in a hospital in Shenzhen, China. Furthermore, multiple functional spaces are considered in the nursing unit.",

Multiple studies have verified that this method can be used to accurately measure the air change rate of confined spaces [42] [43] [44] . The average air change rate in the 17 wards was 1.1 h \u2212 1 , with the highest air change rate of 2.0 h \u2212 1 . Detailed information is available in Ref. [41] . The average air change rates of the treatment and hazardous material storage rooms are 1.6 h \u2212 1 and 3.0 h \u2212 1 , respectively. According to ASHRAE 170-2021 [45] , the air change rates for inpatient, treatment, and hazardous material storage rooms should be above 2.0 h \u2212 1 . Therefore, the air-conditioning system in the surveyed nursing unit does not provide sufficient fresh air in most wards and treatment rooms, which is unfavorable for controlling infectious disease transmission. In the infection risk assessment, the ACH value was set as follows (based on the field measurements): 1.1 h \u2212 1 for wards, 1.6 h \u2212 1 for treatment rooms, 1.5 h \u2212 1 for the office, 1.8 h \u2212 1 for medical rest rooms, 0.9 h \u2212 1 for the corridor and nurse station, and 0.6 h \u2212 1 for the elevator halls.",

While some of the aerosols were removed through filtration and surface deposition, the rest were assumed to be uniformly distributed in the space. The surface deposition, filtration, and total removal rates in different functional spaces are illustrated in Fig. 3 . The removal rates in Eq. (2) were confirmed based on the on-site measurements (ACH) and data from several references. Detailed information is available in Ref. [48] , which also focused on COVID-19 infection risks in built environments. Considering a particle size range of 0.5-10 \u03bcm, the deposition rate increases with the increase in particle diameter (see Fig. 3 (a)). Furthermore, the surface deposition rates were almost the same in different functional spaces. The filtration rate was higher for larger particles, as depicted in Fig. 3(b) . Consequently, the total removal rate was also higher for larger particles, as shown in Fig. 3 (c). The total removal rate for different particle sizes is 1.5-4.0 h \u2212 1 . Considering different functional spaces, the total removal rate of viral aerosols was lowest in the nurse station, followed by that in the wards and the office. These differences can be primarily attributed to the different outdoor air change rates in these spaces.",

Each occupant was assigned a timetable in the simulation, that is, the occupants were assigned to certain rooms inside the nursing unit at any given time during the week-long simulation. The assignments were based on the temporal-spatial occupancy status of the occupants (i.e., the trajectories obtained from the timetable) obtained from the on-site survey, which represents the real case. If more than one occupant was present in a given room, they shared the room and made \"contact\" with each other. If one of the occupants in the shared room was the infector, the other occupant(s), that is, the susceptible, were exposed to viral aerosols and infection risks. An interesting situation occurs when a susceptible occupant enters a certain room after the infector has left. The susceptible occupant is possibly exposed to a low viral aerosol concentration with a low infection risk, as the viral aerosols may not be completely removed through dilution, filtration, deposition, and inactivation. In contrast, if a susceptible occupant enters the room before the infector, the exposure to viral aerosols only occurs after the infector enters the room, and the exposure duration is shorter than the total duration spent by the susceptible occupant in the room. The total viral dose inhaled by all the susceptible occupants in different functional spaces was calculated using Eq. (4), and the results are depicted in Fig. 8(a) . The accumulated COVID-19 infection risks of all the susceptible occupants were calculated using Eq. (5), and the results are illustrated in Fig. 8(b) .",

The results obtained herein contradict those obtained in Ref. [34] , which assessed the infection risk of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in a hospital room using the dose-response model. The results in Ref. [34] indicated that nurses have the highest infection risk, followed by healthcare workers and patients. The differences in the results can be attributed to the fact that the study in Ref. [34] only focused on a single room, whereas our study focused on an entire nursing unit with different functional spaces and better reflects the real conditions. Assuming that one occupant is the infector, the cross-infection risk is defined as the probability of infection for a certain susceptible occupant group by an infector from the same or different occupant group. The cross-infection risks of the occupants after they had shared the nursing unit for a week are shown in Fig. 9 . The highest cross-infection risk (0.0031) occurred between the attendants and patients. The second highest cross-infection risk (0.0028) occurred among the nurses. The cross-infection risk among the patients was 0.0021. The cross-infection probabilities of the other occupant group pairs were less than 0.002. The infection risk for the doctors was primarily from other doctors.",

The aerosol filtration rates of the surgical mask for exhalation and inhalation were set to 50% herein, that is, the masks block 50% of the viral aerosols exhaled by the infected individual and inhaled by the susceptible occupants. This was simulated by multiplying the exhaled and inhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers by 50%. Enforcing mask wearing for doctors and nurses (Scenario 4) reduced the infection risks of all the occupants. The infection risk of the nurses decreased by 66%, as they tended to work long hours in multiple functional spaces and the surgical masks protected them from the viral aerosols. Similarly, the infection risk of the doctors reduced by 65%. In contrast, the infection risks of the patients and attendants did not reduce significantly. The benefits of surgical mask wearing are also highlighted by comparing Scenarios 3 and 5. When all the patients and attendants were required to wear surgical masks, their respective infection risks decreased significantly (Scenario 5). In Scenario 6, all the occupants in the nursing unit were required to wear surgical masks. In this scenario, the infection risks of all the occupant groups decreased significantly.

Despite demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed airborne infection risk assessment method, this study has some limitations. First, only aerosol transmission of COVID-19 was assessed herein. Therefore, in our next study, we intend to analyze the infection risk considering the close contact and fomite routes, using the occupant trajectories collected herein. Second, the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in the enclosed space was assumed to be homogeneous. However, this is an acceptable assumption as the rooms in the nursing unit were small, and the air was well-mixed owing to continuous mechanical ventilation and occupant movement. Third, the uncertainty parameters introduce errors in the calculated infection risk. Addressing this limitation requires in-depth research on the virological properties of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the simulation assumed only one infector, which corresponds to the initial stages of the pandemic, when few infectors are present among the population. Finally, the week-long accumulated exposure to inhaled SARS-CoV-2 exaggerates the infection risks of the occupants in the nursing unit. In reality, week-long exposure may cause third generation transmission or worse, whereas the proposed model only considers second generation transmission. As the reported results are based on speculative virological properties of SARS-CoV-2 and specific occupant trajectories, the corresponding infection risks are a conservative estimate with redundancy. Accordingly, the adopted protection measures should be able to cope with such conservative estimates to suitably control infection transmission in a built environment.",

Assuming one undetected infector in the nursing unit, the COVID-19 infection risks of all the occupants were calculated based on first-hand data. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The occupants in the inpatient building exhibited repetitive behavior. The patients and attendants primarily stayed inside the wards (19.4 h/d and 15.1 h/d, respectively), the nurses were primarily in the nurse station and wards (3.0 h/d and 2.4 h/d, respectively), and the doctors primarily stayed in the offices (2.6 h/d). (2) The weekly accumulated infection risks of the patients and attendants were almost equal (both averaged at 0.002) and were higher than those of the nurses (0.0013) and doctors (0.0004). The highest cross-infection probability (0.0031) occurred between the attendants and patients. The cross-infection probability among nurses (the same occupant group) was 0.0029. The cross-infection probability among patients was 0.0021. Doctors experienced the highest infection risk from other doctors. (3) A total of three infection control policies-reducing the number of attendants, increasing ventilation rates, and requiring surgical mask wearing-were analyzed herein. The effectiveness of these measures was compared through different simulation scenarios. Based on the infection risk assessment results of the different scenarios, we recommend the combined application of all three control policies.",
