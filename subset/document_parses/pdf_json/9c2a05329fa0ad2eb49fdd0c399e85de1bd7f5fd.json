After Andalusia, the Valencian Community, the Canary Islands, and Catalonia, which would have experienced an increase in August 2020 in this type of accommodation compared to August 2019.

This evidence one of the most appropriate options for the development of sustainable tourism, providing quality of life for residents and safety for tourists (Proposition 6). We have seen how the data shows a faster recovery of domestic tourism than the experienced in international tourism, which in our opinion is an opportunity for regions that are not tourism leaders, although they have been developing alternative offers linked to rural tourism; these regions are for example Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Asturias, and Cantabria, which in this pandemic have focused their strategies on the promotion of domestic tourism (Proposition 6). In turn, the Spanish regions that traditionally lead the tourism sector, such as Andalusia, Valencia, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, and Madrid, have not developed many alternative offers to mass tourism. In this context, experiential, rural and active tourism represents one of the strong points of the sector; the accommodations associated with these tourism practices are the ones that have recovered the fastest and have experienced relatively lower rates of decline. This type of tourism offers opportunities for the regions most affected by the impacts of the pandemic, helping to diversify the tourism activity, especially in those areas suffering from high seasonality levels.",

The current moment, in the collapse of the tourism model in Spain, which we trust is conjunctural can help to develop certain implications, is the time to continue moving towards a more sustainable tourism model from an economic, social, and environmental point of view. The post-pandemic period could align the tourism industry more closely with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and lead to a greener, more inclusive and resilient industry that provides decent work for all tourism workers. It also has implications for safety and health, including for the national health system, which is key for all destinations. This should be reflected in their marketing and communication strategies, by planning procedures to regain the confidence of potential visitors, developing protocols to ensure health safety, to ensure the competitiveness of the tourism industry and guarantee the safety of all. There are also implications in terms of communication: Government communication strategies must be aligned with these solutions in order to obtain maximum benefits. As an example, the domestic tourism campaign that Spain has launched for the first time in history, '#DescubreLoIncre\u00edble' [72] , which is being promoted on social networks. This type of communication campaign should target rural accommodations and campsites to help the tourism sector.",

The evolution of domestic tourism in Spain could be a great hope for the country resilience and, with the right measures, it could favor a change in the tourism development model of countries like Spain, focusing more on sustainable, less intensive proposals with less impact on the population and the environment.
