            "text": "Objectives To assess the long-term effects of various exercise modes on psychological distress in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients and methods 135 prostate cancer patients aged 43-90 years on ADT were randomized to twice weekly supervised impact loading and resistance exercise (ImpRes), supervised aerobic and resistance exercise (AerRes), and usual care/ delayed supervised aerobic exercise (DelAer) for 12 months, and completed measures of psychological distress using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18). BSI-18 provides three subscales for anxiety, depression, and somatisation, as well as the global severity index (GSI) where higher scores indicate higher distress. Results Following the intervention, somatization was not different to baseline, however, there were significant interactions (p < 0.01) for depression, anxiety, and the GSI. In ImpRes, depression was reduced at 12 months compared to baseline and 6 months (0.78 \u00b1 1.39 vs. 1.88 \u00b1 3.24 and 1.48 \u00b1 2.65, p < 0.001), as was the GSI (3.67 \u00b1 4.34 vs. 5.94 \u00b1 7.46 and 4.64 \u00b1 4.73, p < 0.001) with anxiety reduced compared to baseline (1.08 \u00b1 1.54 vs. 1.98 \u00b1 2.56). Depression and the GSI decreased (p < 0.05) in AerRes at 6 months but increased by 12 months, while in DelAer the GSI was reduced at 12 months compared to 6 months (3.78 \u00b1 3.94 vs. 5.25 \u00b1 4.22, p = 0.031). Men with the highest level of anxiety, depression, somatization, and the GSI improved the most with exercise (p trend < 0.001). Conclusion Various supervised exercise modes (aerobic, resistance and impact loading) are effective in reducing psychological distress in men with prostate cancer on ADT. Those with the highest level of psychological distress improved the most. Supervised exercise should be prescribed to improve psychological health in prostate cancer patients on ADT.",

Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that ADT may be associated with greater psychological distress compared to other PCa treatments. For example, ADT has been associated with a threefold greater risk of depression compared to radiation alone in men treated for recurrent PCa [6] . In addition, longer ADT duration has been associated with an increased risk of depression and inpatient and outpatient psychiatric treatments in men with localized PCa [7] . The impact of psychological distress in men with PCa, particularly when not addressed, can result in compromised quality of life [5, 8] . Importantly, men with PCa and with depressive disorders are less likely to undergo definitive therapy and are at increased risk of suicide [9] [10] [11] . Consequently, the management of psychological distress in patients with PCa should be an important clinical objective in efforts to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes [12, 13] .",

            "text": "We have previously observed that physically inactive men with PCa experience higher global distress and anxiety than those who were physically active [14] . In non-PCa populations, exercise has been shown to have a significant antidepressant effect in people with depression [15] , and in those with other chronic conditions [16] . Recently, exercise interventions that included specifically resistance-based exercise have been shown to reduce depressive symptoms in adults [17] . Nevertheless, in our previous systematic review on interventions to improve PCa survivorship, we reported that there were insufficient data available to determine the effects of exercise on depression or anxiety outcomes [18] . Similarly, others have only reported initial positive trends for the effect of exercise on anxiety and depression in men with PCa with few studies available [19] . Therefore, despite increasing evidence in other clinical populations, there is limited research examining the impact of exercise and different modes of exercise on psychological distress in men with PCa. In this report, we examined the effects of various exercise modes on psychological distress in men with PCa on ADT who undertook a yearlong randomized controlled trial. We hypothesized that a year-long intervention of different exercise modes would result in reduced psychological distress and improved physical function in men with PCa on ADT.",

In brief, 130 patients were excluded for various reasons which included: declined to participate, too far to travel, ineligible, and unable to obtain physician consent resulting in 163 patients entering the study. The Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) to assess psychological distress was included after recruitment commenced and was administered to 135 patients and this forms the basis for this report. Inclusion criteria included: histologically documented PCa, a minimum exposure to ADT of 2 months, without prostate specific antigen (PSA) evidence of disease activity, and anticipated to remain hypogonadal for the subsequent 12 months. Regarding without PSA evidence of disease activity, this was operationalized in two ways by the study clinicians (NS, DJ). For those who recently initiated ADT, PSA needed to fall significantly and anticipated to remain low for the next year, while for those with established disease, low PSA had to remain low and stable with no indication of relapse in the next year. Exclusion criteria included: bone metastases, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, or neurological disorders that could inhibit them from exercising as determined by their physician, inability to walk 400 m or undertake exercise, and resistance training performed in the previous 3 months. All participants obtained medical clearance from their physician. The study was approved by the University Human Research Ethics Committee and all participants provided written informed consent.",

In brief, ImpRes underwent 12 months of supervised exercise twice weekly in University-affiliated exercise clinics. The impact-loading component to target bone consisted of a series of bounding, skipping, drop jumping, hopping, and leaping activities that were progressive in nature. Resistance training consisted of six principal exercises as well as supplementary exercises that targeted the major upper and lower body muscle groups with 2-4 sets of each exercise performed at an intensity of 6-12 RM (maximal weight that can be lifted 6-12 times). In addition, the ImpRes group undertook training at home 2 days/week that consisted of skipping, hopping, leaping, and drop jumping. The AerRes group underwent supervised exercise in the clinic twice weekly for the initial 6 months consisting of 20-30 min of aerobic-based exercise such as walking/jogging and cycling or rowing on stationary ergometers at 60-85% of estimated maximal heart rate (HR), and the same resistance exercise program undertaken by ImpRes. In addition, participants were encouraged to undertake home-based aerobic activity such as walking/ cycling with the goal to accumulate 150 min/week of aerobic-based activity. During the second 6-month period, patients were provided with a home-based maintenance program which required 150 min/week of aerobic activity and resistance exercise using body weight and elastic bands. The DelAer group were provided with a printed booklet with information about exercise for the initial 6 months, followed by 6 months of twice weekly exercise on a cycle ergometer at an intensity of~70% HR max for up to 30-40 min and flexibility exercises in the clinic under supervision. All supervised exercise sessions for ImpRes, AerRes, and DelAer were undertaken with the guidance of an Accredited Exercise Physiologist and included small groups of up to ten participants. During the 12-month study period, all participants were asked to maintain customary physical activity and dietary patterns.",

In our sample, the prevalence of clinical distress at baseline ranged between 4 and 38% as this variation was dependent on the case rule employed (4.4% Standard; 12.6% Zabora; and 38.5% Recklitis). Exercise has been proposed to have a significant antidepressant effect in people with depression [15] . However, previous systematic reviews reported insufficient data available or only initial positive trends for the effect of exercise on anxiety and depression in this patient group [18, 19] . Here, we expand on these initial findings by reporting the long-term effect of different exercise modalities on psychological distress in men with PCa undertaking ADT. The results indicate that various modes of supervised exercise are effective at reducing elements of psychological distress in men with PCa receiving ADT. Interestingly, in two of the exercise groups (ImpRes and AerRes), the exercise interventions included some form of resistance-based exercise which has been shown to be an important exercise mode to reduce depressive symptoms in adults [17] .",

These results are consistent with those of a metaanalysis demonstrating that the effects of exercise on depressive symptoms were larger with programs supervised or partially supervised [30] . Thus, elements of a supervised exercise program such as social interaction with peers and professionals, learning new skills and receiving positive feedback may contribute to improvements in symptoms of distress [30, 31] . From 6-12 months the AerRes patients continued to perform resistance training, but at home with elastic bands and the likely reduced intensity and volume of resistance exercise may have also contributed to the initial benefits of clinic-based exercise being diluted. We have recently proposed strategies to improve the long-term efficacy and adherence in non-clinic settings using digital health technology such as the use of wearable sensors, utilizing digital exercise platforms for prescription, delivery, and instruction, and video chat with a qualified exercise professional to monitor and support the patient [32] .",

Distress screening for men with PCa has been well validated [33] and contemporary models of psychological care in cancer propose a stepped approach where the depth of intervention is matched to the extent of distress [34] . As we proposed for patients with higher fatigue [20] , and in this case for distress, screening patients on ADT for such symptoms and directing tailored and supervised exercise interventions to those with clinical symptoms should be part of PCa treatment care strategies. Further, we would hypothesize that interventions that integrate tailored exercise programs with evidence-based psychological interventions [13] may well provide the optimal platform for survivorship care for this patient group [35] .",

This is the largest RCT to date examining the effect of different supervised exercise modes including resistance, impact loading and aerobic training on psychological distress in men with PCa on ADT. Psychological distress was assessed using the BSI-18 which includes subscales of anxiety, depression, somatization, and GSI and is a reliable instrument for the assessment of psychological distress. Nevertheless, there are some limitations that warrant attention. Although positive effects of exercise on psychological distress were found, we did not specifically target patients who were diagnosed or distressed using specific cutoffs. Thus, an investigation of the impact of different exercise modalities on symptoms in those clinically distressed or depressed to gain further understanding of the interaction between exercise and personal characteristics is warranted. However, our results do indicate that those with higher scores for anxiety, depression, and somatization, as well as the GSI, and those classed as clinically distressed based on the case-finding rules employed in the study, responded better to exercise. In addition, although patients in the AerRes group were encouraged to accumulate further activity, the volume of additional activity outside of the supervised sessions was not recorded. Lastly, the men in this study were primarily in their first year of ADT. Thus, these results may not be generalizable to men on different treatment regimens or of a more advanced disease stage.",
