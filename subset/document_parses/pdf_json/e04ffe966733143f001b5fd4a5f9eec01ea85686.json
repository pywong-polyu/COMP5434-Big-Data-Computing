STEM Images obtained at the BIoCryo Laboratory revealed virus contained on the cell wall but none intra-cellular, possibly due to D-xylose (xylitol) production of glycoaminoglycans decoy targets. Xylitol and grapefruit seed extract are not exotic nor expensive rare high technology answers to viral epidemics. The potential in saving lives and the economies of the world by using X-GSE combination therapy should inspire large clinical trials, especially in those nations whereas the healthcare system would be dangerously compromised by the adoption of less effective and significantly more financially demanding therapies. Because there are no risk factors in using the X/GSE combination therapy, and the nasal spray is over the counter available without a prescription, and the spray allows for comfortable long term mask-wearing, adoption of this preventive anti-viral therapy should be encouraged.",

The effect of dietary xylitol on hRSV infection was investigated in a mouse model with significant results reported. 4 The mice received xylitol for 14 days before virus exposure and for a further three days post-viral exposure. The mice receiving xylitol had significantly reduced viral lung titers than the controls receiving phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fewer CD3+ and CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes, whose numbers are indicative of inflammatory status, were recruited in the mice receiving xylitol. These results demonstrated improved hRSV infection outcomes and reduced inflammation-associated immune responses to hRSV infection with dietary xylitol. The same researchers previously reported positive effects of xylitol on mice with influenza A virus infection (H1N1) also with a decrease in recruitment of inflammatory lymphocytes. 5 It has been reported that a decrease in CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes is a predictor of mortality for COVID-19 patients. The antiinflammatory and antiviral properties of D-xylose/xylitol in respiratory conditions are subject to a patent application (number WO1999048361A1) filed in 1998 in the United States. 6",

            "text": "Indeed, there have been three important recently published peer review articles, two in Medical Hypothesis and one in the British Dental Journal that reinforce how important oral health care is in regards to COVID-19 itself. Periodontal disease is another of the pre-disposing comorbidities. 27 This is certainly not surprising as PD creates systemic inflammation, increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels. This would exacerbate the cytokine storm of COVID-19, and the oral pathogens in the saliva could cause an increase in the pneumonia risk. 28 Xylitol and grapefruit seed extract are not exotic nor expensive rare high technology answers to viral epidemics. The potential in saving lives and the economies of the world by using X-GSE combination therapy should inspire large clinical trials, especially in those nations whereas the healthcare system would be dangerously compromised by the adoption of less effective and significantly more financially demanding therapies. Also, the potential mechanism by which xylitol may pose as a decoy target for the SARS-CoV-2 virus was just recently published. 13 Because there are no risk factors in using the X/GSE combination therapy, and the nasal spray is over the counter available without prescription, and the spray allows for comfortable long term mask wearing, adoption of this preventive anti-viral therapy should be encouraged.",
