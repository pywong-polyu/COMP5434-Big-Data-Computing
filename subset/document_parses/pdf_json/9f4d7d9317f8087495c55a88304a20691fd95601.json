Nakajima et al. noted that \"CT imaging is helpful for the evaluation of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Infection control inside the CT suites is also important to prevent hospital-related transmission of COVID-19 [1] \". The role of CT scan in diagnosis of COVID-19 is widely discussed. In our country, Thailand, the second country that COVID-19 appeared [2] , the diagnosis of all 272 patients (19 March 2020) is based on PCR diagnosis. The CT finding is negative in many cases of early infection. The infection control in CT room is an important issue, but usually under-recognized. There is usually no sufficient fund for rearrangement of the CT room to correspond to COVID-19. The risk of the radiologists and radiotechnologists who practice in the CT room is also unknown.",
