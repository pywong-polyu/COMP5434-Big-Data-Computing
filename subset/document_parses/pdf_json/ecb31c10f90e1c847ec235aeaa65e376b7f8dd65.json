It is handled by persons with different hygiene standards and can transit in different environments. Hence, money can constitute a reservoir for different types of human pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of Algerian banknotes to shelter opportunistic pathogenic and multiresistant bacteria. To that end, 200 circulating notes of four different denominations were collected from various places and analyzed for their bacterial loads and contents. Besides, predominant strains were identified and characterized by biochemical and molecular methods, and their resistance profiles against 34 antibiotics were determined. Our results indicated that 100% of the studied banknotes were contaminated with bacteria. The total bacterial concentrations were relatively high, and different bacterial groups were grown, showing important diversity. In total, 48 predominant strains were identified as belonging to 17 genera. Staphylococcus and Micrococcus were the most prevalent genera, followed by Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that all the isolates harbored resistance to at least two molecules, and worrying resistance levels were observed. These findings prove that Algerian currency harbors opportunistic multiresistant bacteria and could potentially act as a vehicle for the spread of bacterial diseases and as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes among the community. Therefore, no cash payment systems should be developed and generalized to minimize cash handling and subsequent potential health risks.

The high rates of bacterial contamination found in Algerian currency could be explained by necessary money handling as most commercial services are paid in cash. Indeed, Algeria's banking system is poorly developed, and keeping cash in houses is part of the Algerian practices. Also, it is to be noted that Algerian bills are made of a cotton-linen mix, which offers a good surface for bacterial attachment and development, especially when the latter is moist and damaged, as it has already been suggested (Vriesekoop et al. 2010) . Besides, keeping money underbody surfaces and other poor hygiene practices like inproper hand washing or counting banknotes with fingers wet with saliva may play a role in the dirtiness degree.",

However, it has to be noted that 2000 DZD banknotes were issued and sent for the first time to circulation in 2011, whereas the other analyzed denominations circulate since the 1990s. The longer the banknotes remain in circulation, the greater are their chances to be soiled. Thereby, 2000 DZD notes were generally cleaner and less or not damaged when compared to 200 and 500 DZD denominations in a bad physical condition (moist and smelly). More generally, bacterial loads are a function of the banknotes' physical conditions since in the present study, bacterial counts were higher on dirty and damaged notes than on relatively clean ones, as has already been demonstrated (Kalita et al. 2013; Akoachere et al. 2014) .",

It can be explained by the fact that these molecules have a broad spectrum of activity and are frequently prescribed for a large panel of community-acquired infections leading to the selection of resistant bacterial strains (Melander et al. 2000) . Resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins is often due to the production of extended-spectrum-\u03b2-lactamases (ESBL), which are generally plasmid-mediated and can rapidly spread among bacteria. Accordingly, a recent study conducted in Algeria describes the presence of ESBL producing Gram-negative bacteria isolated from currency and reports that the implied determinants were members of the bla CTX-M genes family known to be carried by highly transferrable plasmids (Bendjama et al. 2020) .",

In this work, two highly multiresistant Gram-negative strains identified as Klebsiella oxytoca (DM1C2) and Serratia rubideae (DM2C3) were found to be ERT resistant. These findings are corroborated by Bendjama et al. (2020) , who report the isolation of a carbapenem-resistant strain of Enterobacter cloacae from Algerian currency. It has to be noted that the reported strain carried the carbapenemase bla OXA-48 gene, which is known to be endemic in Mediterranean countries. The existence of carbapenemresistance genes in the community and more specifically in Gram-negative bacteria is to take very seriously since it could lead to therapeutic failures.",

Given that most commercial transactions are paid in cash in Algeria, our banknotes are very frequently exchanged and handled by the population, leading to more and more bacterial contamination and greater exposure to infections. For these reasons, poor hygiene practices should be discouraged, particularly in restaurants and food shops. Furthermore, no cash transactions should be encouraged by generalizing e-payments and bank cards, and damaged or old banknotes should be frequently replaced. At the time of writing, the urge to implement these recommendations is very well illustrated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Indeed, in the battle against the new Coronavirus, it is strongly advised to avoid cash and favor electronic and bank card payments when no cash transaction systems are poorly or not available at all in Algeria.",
