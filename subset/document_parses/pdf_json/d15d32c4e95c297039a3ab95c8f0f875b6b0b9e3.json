This innovative data source can improve the precision of epidemiological modeling to understand the penetrance of SARS-CoV-2 in specific vulnerable communities. Here, we tested wastewater collected at a major urban treatment facility in Massachusetts and detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the N gene at significant titers (57 to 303 copies per ml of sewage) in the period from 18 to 25 March 2020 using RT-qPCR. We validated detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Sanger sequencing the PCR product from the S gene. Viral titers observed were significantly higher than expected based on clinically confirmed cases in Massachusetts as of 25 March. Our approach is scalable and may be useful in modeling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and future outbreaks. IMPORTANCE Wastewater-based surveillance is a promising approach for proactive outbreak monitoring. SARS-CoV-2 is shed in stool early in the clinical course and infects a large asymptomatic population, making it an ideal target for wastewaterbased monitoring. In this study, we develop a laboratory protocol to quantify viral titers in raw sewage via qPCR analysis and validate results with sequencing analysis. Our results suggest that the number of positive cases estimated from wastewater viral titers is orders of magnitude greater than the number of confirmed clinical cases and therefore may significantly impact efforts to understand the case fatality rate and progression of disease. These data may help inform decisions surrounding the advancement or scale-back of social distancing and quarantine efforts based on dynamic wastewater catchment-level estimations of prevalence.",

Despite pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, broad access to testing in the United States (US) has thus far been severely limited. While it is impractical to test every US resident for SARS-CoV-2, the virus has been found in the stool of confirmed COVID-19 patients (1), making it a promising candidate for wastewater-based surveillance (WBS).",

First, we examined raw (unfiltered) sewage precipitated with polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG), which recovers both bacterial and viral nucleic acids. Next, we looked at samples taken from 0.2-m-filtered sewage: we considered both the material collected on the filter and the filtrate.

This factor is prominent especially during this dynamic winter-spring season in Massachusetts. To correct those variations, we use pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) as an internal reference for quantification of SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have shown that PMMoV is the most abundant RNA virus in human feces and it is shed in large quantities in wastewater across the United States (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . PMMoV is remarkably stable in the wastewater, and its concentrations showed little seasonal variation (15, 16) . Furthermore, like SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV is also a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, making it suitable as an internal reference to help control for sample-to-sample variability in wastewater dilution or processing. These properties allow us to calibrate the SARS-CoV-2 titers across the samples.",

Estimating an average of 600,000 viral genomes per ml in stool (19) would suggest that roughly 5% of all fecal samples in the treatment facility catchment were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the 18 to 25 March period, a number much higher than the 0.026% confirmed for the state of Massachusetts (a similar prevalence is obtained using individual counties represented by the wastewater treatment facility's catchment or statewide estimates) on 25 March (17).

This simple protocol does not rely on expensive chemicals or materials and thus could be widely employed for viral detection in wastewater samples. Furthermore, we avoided the competitive usage of commercial kits like viral RNA extraction kits and one-step RT-PCR enzyme master mix kits that were recommended by the CDC protocols widely used in clinical testing (10) . Viral titers were quantified based on standard curves for the three primer sets (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). However, a complete quantification of viral titers needs further investigation of recovery rates for each step including the pasteurization, filtering, viral precipitation, RNA extraction, and reverse transcription. Recently, Ahmed et al. used the beta-coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) as a closely related surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 to quantify the recovery rates from wastewater; using various methods including PEG precipitation, they found that MHV recoveries ranged from 26.7 to 65.7% (20) . To adjust the variations from the initial sample concentrations and RNA losses during these experimental procedures, we used PMMoV, the most abundant RNA virus in human stool (13, 16) , as a reference. Our results showed that the PMMoV concentrations varied across the 12 samples with a standard deviation of less than 1.34 units, which also fall in the variation range of PMMoV concentrations in different seasons in a previous study (15) . However, studies with more wastewater samples over a longer period are needed to understand whether the PMMoV loading is stable over time for the catchment population.",

First, our estimates are based on numbers and assumptions that are currently subject to significant uncertainty, as discussed above, and therefore could be inaccurate. However, we note that our calculations are conservative because we (i) apply the lower limit of our observed viral titers in wastewater; (ii) assume no loss in viral titer due to degradation, sample processing, or RNA extraction; and (iii) consider high viral loads per infected stool, thus requiring fewer positive stools to generate the observed wastewater titers. The estimates of viral titer per positive stool may be too low if a small number of individuals shed very high levels of virus. While this can be determined, it will require more extensive testing of individual stool specimens from patients with documented COVID-19 disease in order to arrive at an accurate estimate. Given the importance of assessing the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infections that present with symptoms, we note that our results are consistent with the idea that a significant fraction of cases are not detected with current testing algorithms, and that this fraction may include a large number of asymptomatic individuals (21, 22) . Limitations of testing capacity and stringent criteria for testing would lead to an underestimate of clinically confirmed cases, whereas wastewater-based surveillance provides an anonymous, unbiased sample of the entire infected population, potentially explaining the magnitude of the difference we observe.",

Briefly, samples resuspended in the TRIzol reagent were thoroughly mixed with 300 l chloroform for 1 min and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before centrifugation (16,000 \u03eb g, 15 min, 4\u00b0C). Six hundred microliters of aqueous phase was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube and thoroughly mixed with an equal volume of isopropanol. After centrifugation at 16,000 \u03eb g for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed twice with 75% ethanol. Thirty microliters of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) water was used to recover the RNA. cDNA was synthesized by the reverse transcription with random hexamers (IDT) based on manufacturer's protocol (NEB catalog no. M0368). PCR includes TaqMan Fast Advanced master mix (4444557; ThermoFisher Scientific); CDC N1, N2, and N3 primer-probes (IDT); and cDNA as a template. The qPCR was SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance in Wastewater carried out for 48 cycles on a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) based on the following program: polymerase activation (95\u00b0C for 2 min) and PCR (48 cycles, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1 s, and annealing/extension at 55\u00b0C for 30 s). Three replicates were performed for each primer, mean values were reported, and the coefficient of variation between replicates was \u03fd8%. The positive control for qPCR and construction of the standard curve for N1, N2, and N3 assays was a plasmid (initial concentration: 2 \u03eb 10 5 copies/l; IDT catalog no. 10006625) containing the complete nucleocapsid gene from SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Output from the qPCR assay for the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) (primers shown in Table 1 ) was used to calibrate the SARS-CoV-2 titers. To adjust the SARS-CoV-2 viral titers for each sample, we first calculated the deviation of its PMMoV copies from the median of PMMoV copies in all samples, i.e., deviation factor \u03ed 10^[k \u03eb (sample C T \u03ea median C T )], where k is the slope of the standard curve and equals \u03ea0.2991 (amplification efficiency is 99.11% for the PMMoV primer set) based on our test. We then divided the SARS-CoV-2 viral titers by this deviation. We noted that viral titers for 24 March samples (Southern and Northern) increased by 1.6-to 3.5-fold after PMMoV adjustment (Fig. 3) . This is because the PMMoV concentrations for the two samples were lower than the median of PMMoV copies in the 12 sewage samples, suggesting that the two samples were more dilute than the other samples. It is interesting that there was significant precipitation in the Boston area during 23 to 24 March (https:// www.timeanddate.com/weather/). The inflows from snow and heavy rainfall might explain the diluted wastewater samples on 24 March. PCR, gel electrophoresis, and Sanger sequencing. To test SARS-CoV-2 identity in the wastewater samples and avoid potential contamination from N gene positive control (IDT catalog no. 10006625), we amplified an S gene fragment using primers shown in Table 1 . PCR was performed with KAPA Hi-Fi Hot Start ready mix 2\u03eb (Fisher Scientific; KK2602), and cDNA was used as the template with the following program: 95\u00b0C for 5 min and 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s for 42 cycles. PCR products were run on a 2% precast agarose E-gel (ThermoFisher; G402002). The positive control was cDNA reversed transcribed from synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Twist catalog no. 102024). PCR products were sent to Genewiz (Cambridge, MA) for purification and Sanger sequencing with forward and reverse primers (Table 1) , and low-quality sequence adjacent to sequencing primers and terminal N's were removed. Sequencing results were subjected to BLAST search with NCBI BLASTN (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).",
