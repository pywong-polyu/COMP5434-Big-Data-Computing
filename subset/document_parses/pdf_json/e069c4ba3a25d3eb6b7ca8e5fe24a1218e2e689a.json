It employs a dual-mirror optical design to remove comatic aberrations over an 8 \u2022 field of view, and a high-density silicon photomultiplier camera (with a pixel resolution of 4 arcmin) to record Cherenkov emission from cosmic ray and gamma-ray initiated particle cascades in the atmosphere. The prototype SCT (pSCT), comprising a 9.7 m diameter primary mirror and a partially instrumented camera with 1536 pixels, has been constructed at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory. The telescope was inaugurated in January 2019, with commissioning continuing throughout 2019. We describe the first campaign of observations with the pSCT, conducted in January and February of 2020, and demonstrate the detection of gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula with a statistical significance of 8.6\u03c3.",

[4] with remarkable success. Over two hundred astrophysical sources of > 30 GeV gamma-ray emission have been measured 1 , revealing relativistic particle acceleration processes in a variety of Galactic and extragalactic environments. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) [5] is an observatory currently under development and construction which will explore this gamma-ray sky with greatly improved sensitivity, energy and angular resolution. It will consist of two large telescope arrays: one in the northern hemisphere, on the Canary Island of La Palma in Spain, and the other in the south, at Paranal in Chile. Multiple telescope designs are being implemented in order to provide sensitive coverage over at least four orders of magnitude in energy, from 30 GeV to 300 TeV.",

            "text": "Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes are designed to image and record the few nanosecond-duration Cherenkov emission from cosmic ray and gammaray initiated atmospheric particle cascades (e.g. [6] ), leading to some unique design constraints. In particular, they require a field of view wider than a few degrees to capture all of the Cherenkov emission from air showers, which are offset from the optical axis of the telescope and can extend over a few degrees at the highest energies. A wide field of view also allows the study of astrophysical sources with large angular extent, which are relatively common in the gamma-ray regime, and improves the prospects for detecting serendipitous, or poorly located, astrophysical transient events such as gamma-ray bursts, and astrophysical neutrino and gravitational wave counterparts. This wide field of view must be coupled to a large aperture mirror in order to collect a sufficient number of Cherenkov photons to form a shower image. Both requirements (wide field of view and large aperture) push towards a small focal ratio, ideally less than f/1.0. This presents its own problems, however, since off-axis optical aberrations, particularly coma, become severe. Existing wide-field designs mitigate this to some extent by using a prime-focus Davies-Cotton approach [7] , in which a single tessellated reflector is constructed using identical mirror facets placed on a spherical surface with a radius equal to the focal length of the facets.",

In addition, it provides a greatly reduced focal plate-scale which allows to take advantage of high density, high photon detection efficiency, silicon photosensor arrays at the focal plane, which is curved in order to reduce astigmatism. A Schwarzschild-Couder optical system has been selected for the small-sized telescopes (SSTs) of CTA, which will be the most numerous CTA telescopes, providing sensitive coverage of the highest energy gamma-ray band up to 300 TeV. The ASTRI Project has successfully demonstrated the practicality of this design with the ASTRI-Horn SST prototype instrument [11] , which has been used to detect gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula with a camera based on silicon-photomultiplier (SiPM) sensors [12] . The ASTRI design has a 4.3 m diameter primary mirror and a 1.8 m secondary, giving an effective photon collection area (after accounting for shadowing) of approximately 5 m 2 .",

The mirrors are equipped with edge-sensors, composed of a laser diode/ webcam pairing, which allows an initial panel-to-panel alignment and monitoring of the optical system alignment during operations. Optical tables located at the center of the primary and secondary reflectors house a laser-based global alignment system which aligns the complete primary, secondary and the camera focal plane (see [18] for further description of alignment system design).

We note that operating parameters were varying during these commissioning observations, during which the telescope performance characteristics were still being investigated. In particular, significant changes to the hardware trigger were implemented, including the masking of particularly noisy regions of the camera. A temperature stabilization period of \u223c 5 minutes prior to observations was also introduced, which improved system stability and noise performance. Additionally, a changing subset of typically 3 of the 64-pixel camera modules were not operating for all of the observations, due to hardware and communications problems. However, all operating parameters were held constant for the full duration of each ON/OFF pair, to reduce any chance of the changing conditions introducing a systematic bias which could mimic a signal.",

These simulations are used to establish the gamma-ray selection criteria, and to calibrate algorithms used to estimate the gamma-ray primary energy [28] . However, the pSCT camera is an experimental prototype, with known limitations. The camera will soon be significantly revised, and substantially replaced, during the forthcoming camera upgrade. A major investment in accurate simulation, including a full description of the complex electronic noise performance, is therefore not justified. Fortunately, the fact that the pSCT is co-located with the VERITAS array means that simulations are not required, if the goal is simply to establish proof of concept by detecting an astrophysical gamma-ray source. VERI-TAS, co-located with the pSCT, is a well-calibrated, mature facility, which can provide independent information about the nature and properties of air showers observed simultaneously by the two instruments. In particular, it can clearly identify true air shower events (as opposed to electronic or nightsky-background noise-triggered events) and determine, with high confidence, which of these were initiated by gamma-ray primaries.",

Both VERITAS and the pSCT are equipped with high frequency oscillators (125 MHz for the pSCT, and 10 MHz for VERI-TAS), which provide precise event timestamps. After accounting for systematic timing offsets and drifts (primarily a run-dependent linear drift term on the order of 1 \u00b5s s \u22121 ), these timestamps can identify air showers observed simultaneously by both instruments, within a coincidence window of \u00b150 ns ( Figure 5 ). The data sample used for this step consists of 2.2 hours of coincident observations from January 28, 2020, recorded with a source el-evation above 60 \u2022 . A total of 11615 coincident air shower events were identified, with a typical coincident event rate of 1.5 Hz. This low rate (and correspondingly high energy threshold) is primarily a consequence of the high trigger thresholds which are required for operation of the electronic noise dominated prototype camera. Working with this cosmic ray event sample, we next establish analysis procedures to process and parameterize the raw pSCT images. The pSCT data consist of a list of camera events which contain the 128-sample digitized waveforms for each of the 1536 SiPM pixels. These waveforms are calibrated by subtracting the pedestal (the response in the absence of any signal), which is tabulated as a lookup table accounting for the position of each storage cell in the switched capacitor array, as illustrated in Figure 6 .",

Events triggered by the calibration LED flasher are also removed, based on their arrival times. The images for events which pass these criteria are then cleaned to remove image pixels which do not contain a clear Cherenkov signal. For this step, we use a modified version of the aperture image cleaning procedure of Wood et al. [33] , with an aperture cleaning radius equal to twice the image pixel size (0.134 \u2022 ). In this procedure, at each pixel location, the signals from all other pixels within the aperture cleaning radius are summed together, with signals from pixels partially contained by the aperture weighted appropriately. If this summed signal crosses a threshold, the pixel on which the cleaning aperture is centered is kept for future analysis. For this work, reasonable thresholds were determined empirically for each cleaning aperture, by examining the effect of the cleaning on a sample of randomly triggered noise events which do not contain Cherenkov light. We stress that, in contrast to most operating Cherenkov telescopes, the dominant noise component in the signal traces for this prototype instrument is electronic and readout noise, as opposed to night sky background photons.",

While the Crab Nebula (or its OFF source counterpart) was nominally at the center of the camera during these observations, the telescope bending model was not yet determined, and pointing corrections were not applied during tracking, resulting in a residual pointing offset. Offline pointing corrections for Cherenkov telescopes are typically calculated using independent CCD cameras that view the sky and the Cherenkov camera at the same time. For finelypixellated cameras such as the pSCT, the photosensors of the Cherenkov camera itself can be used to derive pointing corrections with a similar level of accuracy, using the locations of stars within the field of view [35] . In this analysis, the star locations are measured using the SiPM anode currents, as illustrated in Figure 7 . During each run, the SiPM currents are read out every 3 minutes. For this analysis, we first measured the pointing offset using a few current maps taken from each run, and then calculated the offset at a given time using a linear fit to these offsets as a function of telescope elevation. The maximum calculated offsets are typically on the order of a few SiPM pixels (\u223c 0.2 \u2022 ), as illustrated in Figure 8 . The true position of the Crab Nebula in the field of view is then used to derive the Hillas parameters for each image. This includes \u03b1, defined as the angle between the major axis of the image and a line joining the image centroid to the putative source position. The final stage of the analysis concerns the separation of gamma-ray initiated events from the cosmic ray background. In addition to identifying cosmic ray air shower events, the standard VERITAS reconstruction tools can be used to establish, with high confidence, which events are likely to be due to incident gamma-rays. For the 2.2 hour January 28 th data sample, 18 coincident events passed the VERITAS gamma-ray selection cuts. Figure 5 illustrates the arrival times of a subset of these gammaray candidates, while Figure 9 shows one of these events as seen by both the pSCT, and by VERITAS Telescope 4. Telescope 4 is closest to the pSCT, at a distance of only 35 m, and therefore has a very similar view of the Cherenkov emission from most air showers.",

Figure 10 illustrates the size-dependent cut boundaries for the image width and length parameters. For this first analysis all cuts were optimized manually, and constrained to retain \u223c 95% of the very limited gamma-ray sample after all cuts were applied. The full set of optimized cuts is detailed in Table 1 . These cuts are then applied to the full remaining sample (17.6 hours) of ON/OFF observations of the Crab Nebula with the pSCT. We stress that the data used to derive the cuts are excluded from this final stage, as are any ON source observations without matching OFF source data. Figure 11 shows the distribution of the \u03b1 parameter for both ON and OFF source observations. An ON-source excess is apparent at low values of \u03b1, corresponding to a statistical significance of over 8 standard deviations (\u03c3, calculated using equation 17 of [38] ), providing a clear detection of gammaray emission from the Crab Nebula.

While they are encouraging, and represent an important milestone in the project development, it is clear that the telescope is currently operating far below its ultimate design sensitivity. The reasons for this were foreseen, for this experimental prototype, and are reasonably well understood. In particular, both the online triggering behavior and the offline waveform and image analysis performance are dominated by electronic noise, as opposed to nightsky-background light. This issue will be addressed with the upgrade to the full, 8 \u2022 field of view camera, which is currently in production. Critically, the upgraded camera will use a revised version of the TARGET chips, in which the independent trigger and digitization functions are implemented in two separate ASICs (T5TEA and TARGET C, respectively [40] ), to remove electronic noise coupling between the two paths. It will also include improved pre-amplification, SiPM bias voltage control and pulse-shaping through the use of the SMART ASIC. A physical redesign of the camera electronics modules will improve reliability and shielding, and further minimize cross-talk and noise pickup on the analog lines. Laboratory tests indicate that these modifications are effective, reducing the electronic Table 1 noise to the single digital count level. The pSCT will continue to operate while the upgraded camera is under construction. The F.L. Whipple Observatory re-opened in October 2020, following its temporary closure in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 epidemic. An intensive program of pSCT observations and engineering tests are planned for 2020-2021. These include work on the optical alignment, to ensure stable and optimum optical performance over the full field of view and over all azimuth and elevation angles. The telescope's mechanical pointing model will also be tuned, and various improvements to the camera hardware, operational software and observing procedures will enhance reliability and stability.",

The goal of the SCT team is to deliver at least 10 SCTs to the CTA observatory, which will considerably enhance the overall performance of CTA. Much of the pSCT effort over the next few years will be in support of this goal, including a focus on developing the manufacturing and systems engineering required for an SCT contribution to this major astronomical observatory. The timely addition of SCTs will help CTA to play a leading role in multimessenger astrophysics, and to achieve its wide-ranging key science goals: studying astrophysical particle acceleration, probing extreme environments in the Universe and addressing fundamental physical questions, including the nature of dark matter [41] .
