            "text": "Background: Despite increasing life expectancy (LE), cross-sectional data show widening inequalities in disability-free LE (DFLE) by socioeconomic status (SES) in many countries. We use longitudinal data to better understand trends in DFLE and years independent (IndLE) by SES, and how underlying transitions contribute. Methods: The Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS I and II) are large population-based studies of those aged !65 years in three English centres (Newcastle, Nottingham, Cambridgeshire), with baseline around 1991 (CFAS I, n \u00bc 7635) and 2011 (CFAS II, n \u00bc 7762) and 2-year follow-up. We defined disability as difficulty in activities of daily living (ADL), dependency by combining ADLs and cognition reflecting care required, and SES by area-level deprivation. Transitions between disability or dependency states and death were estimated from multistate models. Results: Between 1991 and 2011, gains in DFLE at age 65 were greatest for the most advantaged men and women [men: 4.7 years, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3.3-6.2; women: 2.8 years, 95% CI 1.3-4.3]. Gains were due to the most advantaged women having a reduced risk of incident disability [relative risk ratio (RRR):0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.8], whereas the most advantaged men had a greater likelihood of recovery (RRR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.2) and reduced disability-free mortality risk (RRR: 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.6]. Risk of death from disability decreased for least advantaged men (RRR: 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9); least advantaged women showed little improvement in transitions. IndLE patterns across time were similar.",

            "text": "Countries worldwide are experiencing population ageing because of rising life expectancy (LE), but many do not experience healthy ageing. Years lived in good health, or without disability, combining morbidity and mortality through health expectancies (HE), have increased over time in most countries worldwide. A critical question for society however, is whether HE gains exceed those in LE thus compressing morbidity, or whether there is expansion of morbidity through an increase in years with ill health or disability, or a dynamic equilibrium where years with ill health or disability increase overall but reduce in severity. In countries where the gains in LE and HE have been studied, there is a lack of consistency. 1 A relative compression of disability has been observed in some countries (USA, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, China), whereas others (Spain, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore) have experienced a relative expansion of disability. 1 Findings are dependent on the populations studied; for example in France there is evidence of both compression 2 and dynamic equilibrium, 3 and in Australia trends differ between men and women. 4 In the UK expansion of disability and dependency has been evident from specific population studies, 5, 6 and from national surveys. 7 Not only do time trends in LE and HE differ between countries, but also within countries, by region or socioeconomic status (SES; e.g. income, education, deprivation). Evidence is emerging that in the UK and the USA, LE is stalling and even declining in the most deprived socioeconomic groups. 8, 9 Studies at single time points show that SES inequalities in HE exceed those in LE, 10 with those of lowest SES having the double disadvantage of spending a greater proportion of their shorter lives with ill health and disability. 11 The difference in HE between the most and least advantaged at age 50 appears similar in England and the USA, 12 although another study found variations across European cohorts with the smallest difference in Sweden (2.1 years at age 50) and largest in Finland (6.8 years). 13 Widening or persistent inequalities have been reported across time, the former for Denmark, the USA and Belgium, [14] [15] [16] and the latter for Denmark, France and Norway. [17] [18] [19] The small number of recent studies suggest inequalities in healthy and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) have widened over time. 20, 21 In England, DFLE differences have been reported across housing tenure, 22 educational groups 23 and wealth. 12 Increasing inequality trends by area deprivation have also been reported. 24 To date in England, HE by SES trends were estimated from repeated cross-sectional studies that",

For men overall, DFLE50% increased by 3 years, from 79 years in CFAS I to 82 years in CFAS II (Figure 1 ), but the gain was greatest in the most advantaged group (6 years) compared with the least advantaged (2 years) ( Figure 3 ). Women's DFLE50% increased by 3 years, from 68 to 71 years (Figure 1 ), but the least advantaged experienced a reduction of 1 year, from 68 years to 67 years (Figure 3 ). To explore these changes further, we examined differences in the underlying transitions to, and from, disability, and to death, between men and women, over time, and between SES groups. For men, the overall expansion of disability was a result of lower risks of death (50% from no disability and 20% from disability) in CFAS II compared with CFAS I, despite a 20% decrease in risk of incident disability ( Table 2 ). Between CFAS I and CFAS II, more advantaged men experienced a reduction in the risk of incident disability (30% reduction), an increase in the likelihood of recovery to a non-disabled state (80% increase), Figure 3 Life expectancy, disability-free life expectancy, life expectancy with disability, and age when years with and without disability are equal (DFLE50%) for men and women in the Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS I and CFAS II), by socioeconomic status group and a substantially reduced risk of death from no disability (60% reduction). More advantaged women experienced a reduction in the risk of incident disability of the same level as men. Together these provide a huge improvement in life experience for the most advantaged. In contrast, the least advantaged men experienced a reduction in death from disability (30% reduction) between the two studies i.e. prolongation of life with disability, whereas there was little evidence of improvement in transitions for the least advantaged women ( Table 2 ).",

In England, comparative trends over 1991-2011 in LE and DFLE at age 65 indicated expansion of disability for men and a relative compression of disability for women overall. This resulted from reductions in the risk of death for men, and in incident disability for men and women over the period. Although overall men experienced an expansion of disability, the most advantaged experienced a relative compression of disability, a pattern also found in the most advantaged women only. The least advantaged men and women had the smallest gains in LE and DFLE and the largest gains in years with disability, resulting from little reduction in incident disability over the period.",

The baseline samples included individuals living at home, in care settings and in semi- Figure 4 Life expectancy, independent life expectancy, life expectancy with dependency, and age when years with and without dependency are equal (IndLE50%) for men and women in the Cognitive Function Ageing Studies (CFAS I and CFAS II), by socioeconomic status group dependent housing, thus providing results for the total population. This is particularly important for robust estimation of time trends as the proportion of older people entering care homes, and their health profile, has changed considerably over time. 34 Moreover, we included informant interviews to minimize missing data for the cognitively frail. Our measure of SES, area-level deprivation, is both a strength and a limitation. As a measure of SES in late life, it is more representative of an individual's current circumstances than occupational status which may have ceased many years previously, or is problematic for these cohorts of women. However it is not an individual measure, such as wealth or pension income, which were not measured in CFAS, rather being reflective of the neighbourhood. There were other limitations to this study that concern the populations studied, response rates, measures used and analytical approaches. First, ethnic minorities are under-represented in CFAS. This under-representation will have increased over time with the ageing of those populations, but this might affect socioeconomic groups differentially. The initial response was lower in CFAS II than in CFAS I, though factors associated with non-response remained stable 35 and were accounted for in the inverse probability weighting. In terms of measures used, information on two ADLs was not present for one of the CFAS I waves. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in CFAS II, where all ADLs were present, and found an alternative measure having high agreement with the original dependency measure (Supplementary Table S7 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online). Finally, there were some limitations concerning the analytical approach. Although CFAS I had follow-up interviews at 2, 6 (Cambridgeshire only) and 10 years, we had to limit analysis to match the 2-year follow-up only in CFAS II, thereby restricting the number of transitions observed. Last, given how few individuals recover from severe disability to no disability or from high dependency back to independence, severity could not be modelled as all transitions need to be present for IMaCh. The association between deprivation and transitions between mild/moderate and severe disability or low, moderate and high dependency may therefore differ.",

Primary prevention strategies focusing on proximal factors such as diet, obesity, smoking, and hypertension have appeared to benefit only the most advantaged, possibly because the least advantaged may be less likely to adapt behaviours if they perceive their life expectancy is limited. 37 Additionally, there is a role for action outside the health and care system and traditional prevention approaches focused on lifestyle. 38 Evidence reviews from the World Health Organization 39 and national and international governments 40 advocate action to tackle the social determinants of health (e.g. housing and employment conditions, income) as a way of reducing health inequalities and improving healthy life expectancy for all. Comparative analysis of changes in self-rated health between 1991 and 2010, the same period as our study, and a period of recession in England and Sweden, confirmed the deterioration in perceived health in the least advantaged women and improved health in the most advantaged in England. 41 However, in Sweden health improved across all socioeconomic groups in the context of a more universally supportive welfare system in times of recession. Comparisons of SES differences in health expectancies from longitudinal data across four European cohorts also found the smallest inequalities in Sweden. 13 The '10 years on' report from the 2010 Marmot review documents the differential effect of the large funding cuts on deprived areas which have undermined their capacity to improve the social determinants of health. 42 The reduction of the health inequalities weighting within the NHS budget, from 15% to 10%, in 2015 will have contributed to this.",

Action needs to be taken on improving individual health behaviours, but also encompassing wider determinants (access to care, improved job opportunities, community initiatives), as well as better understanding the barriers from those most affected. Moreover, in the light of suggestions that mortality from COVID-19 is higher in men and in more deprived communities, 44 our findings of the prolongation of years spent with disability and dependency in the least advantaged men may provide some explanation.
