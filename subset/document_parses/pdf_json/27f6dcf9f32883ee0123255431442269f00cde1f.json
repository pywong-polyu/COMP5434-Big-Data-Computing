            "text": "Background: The highly transmissible Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2), first identified in India, is currently replacing pre-existing variants in many parts of the world. To help guide public health policies it is important to monitor efficiently its spread. Genome sequencing is the gold standard for identification of Delta, but is time-consuming, expensive, and unavailable in many regions. Objective: To develop and evaluate a rapid, simple and inexpensive alternative to sequencing for Delta identification. Methods: A double-mismatch allele-specific RT-PCR (DMAS-RT-PCR) was developed. The technique exploits allele-specific primers, targeting two spike gene mutations, L452R and T478K, within the same amplicon. The discriminatory power of each primer was enhanced by an additional mismatch located at the fourth nucleotide from the 3 \u2032 end. Specificity was assessed by testing well characterised cell culture-derived viral isolates and clinical samples, most of which had previously been fully sequenced. Results: In all cases the results of viral genotyping by DMAS-RT-PCR were entirely concordant with the results of sequencing, and the assay was shown to discriminate reliably between the Delta variant and other variants (Alpha and Beta), and 'wild-type' SARS-CoV-2. Influenza A and RSV were non-reactive in the assay. The sensitivity of DMAS-RT-PCR matched that of the diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR screening assay. Several samples that could not be sequenced due to insufficient virus were successfully genotyped by DMAS-RT-PCR. Conclusion: The method we describe would be simple to establish in any laboratory that can conduct PCR assays and should greatly facilitate monitoring of the spread of the Delta variant globally.",

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been intensively studied since then and more than four million genome sequences have been accumulated and made freely available [1] . As SARS-CoV-2 has evolved, many variants have emerged in different parts of the world and four of these, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta have been designated variants of concern (VOC), primarily on the basis of their increased transmissibility, increased virulence and/or ability to evade immunity. The first three VOC to emerge were the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), originally identified in the UK, the Beta variant (B.1.351), first identified in South Africa and the Gamma variant (P.1), first identified in Brazil [2] [3] [4] . The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was first detected in India in December 2020 and rapidly increased in prevalence, replacing pre-existing lineages and becoming the most common variant in that country by April 2021. Since then, it has also become the dominant variant in the UK and is out-competing pre-existing variants in many other countries [5, 6] .",

There is also evidence that infection with the Delta variant is associated with higher viral loads, more severe disease, and a greater risk of hospitalisation [7] . It is, therefore, important to monitor the spread of the Delta variant globally to inform public health policies and interventions [8] . The gold standard methodology for identifying Delta is full genome sequencing. Although this gives very detailed information and the opportunity to discover new variants, it has the disadvantage of being comparatively expensive, complex, and time-consuming (days or weeks), and is not available in many locations due to lack of expertise and resources. Alternative methods offering rapid, high-throughput, low-cost genotyping for efficient surveillance of the Delta variant are therefore required.",

However, this proxy marker method is by no means specific for Delta because both Beta and Gamma variants would also be detected by this strategy [10] . In contrast, the double-mismatch allele-specific real time RT-PCR (DMAS-RT-PCR) method that we describe here does not exhibit such non-specificity because it targets two separate Delta spike gene mutations, L452R and T478K, within the same amplicon.",

Fortuitously, these point mutations are located close enough to each other to permit them to be targeted by a pair of allele-specific primers that generate an amplicon of a length (122 bp) suitable for efficient PCR amplification and detection by a fluorescently-labelled hydrolysis probe. Lefever [11] demonstrated that the discriminatory power of allele-specific primers could be significantly enhanced by adding a second mismatched nucleotide four nucleotides from the terminal mismatch at the 3 \u2032 end. We, therefore, designed a pair of double-mismatch allele-specific primers (DMAS) according to these principles.

Primers and probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies IDT, Belgium.

Thermal cycling was performed in a Bio-Rad CFX real-time PCR system with reverse transcription at 54 \u2022 C for 10 min, followed by 94 \u2022 C for 3 min, then 40 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 15 s and 58 \u2022 C for 30 s. Data were processed using Bio-Rad CFX maestro 2.0 software with baseline subtracted curve fit, fluorescence drift correction, automatically calculated baseline cycles and manual threshold settings. Each run included IC19 RNA and Delta #395 RNA, both diluted a million-fold, as positive controls. Several no-template nuclease-free water negative controls were also included in each run.",

Similarly, samples confirmed non-Delta by sequencing were efficiently amplified and detected by Reaction 'A' but not by Reaction 'B'. These results are summarised in Table 3 . Seven of the 42 samples (Sample 1 to Sample 7) had not been submitted for sequencing but were expected to be the Delta variant because they were taken from patients during July 2021 when approximately 99% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the UK were caused by Delta. DMAS-RT-PCR genotyping confirmed that, as expected, all were in fact the Delta variant. Of the remaining 35 samples where sequencing was intended, 6 had such low levels of virus that sequencing was not possible. Sample numbers 8, 29, 33, 40, 41 and 42 all had E gene PCR Ct values greater than 33 cycles. However, all these low virus level samples were successfully genotyped by DMAS-RT-PCR, and all proved to be the Delta variant as expected on the basis of the sample dates. In summary, the DMAS-RT-PCR assay was able to correctly identify all 24 clinical samples that were known or assumed to be Delta variant by sequencing or by sample date, and it also correctly identified all 18 samples that had been confirmed to be non-Delta by sequencing.",

We observed that four samples (1, 2, 20 and 37) with very high viral concentrations, corresponding to Ct values \u2264 22 cycles, also produced a weak signal in the non-matching Reaction. For example, Sample 1, a Delta variant with a Reaction 'B' Ct value of 20 cycles, generated a very high Ct value of 37.4 in Reaction 'A'. This is presumed to be due to a very minor degree of non-specific hybridisation of the non-matching primers despite the double mismatch design. This in no way compromises the ability of the DMAS-RT-PCR robustly to distinguish between Delta and non-Delta variants because there is always a very wide gap between the Ct value generated by the two Reactions 'A' and 'B'. Typically, this Ct difference is around 17 cycles (range 14.3 to 18.8 cycles).",

The mean difference for Alpha variant samples was only 0.3 cycles and the mean difference for Delta variant samples was 0.7 cycles. Rowan et al. [13] demonstrated that the E gene PCR assay has a limit of detection of around 6 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per reaction and so we assume that the sensitivity of the DMAS-RT-PCR is approximately the same. This is equivalent to a limit of detection of approximately 150 viral genome copies per ml of viral transport medium.",

Resource limitations mean that even in countries where genome sequencing is available it can only be used on a small proportion of positive samples. DMAS-RT-PCR could provide a comparatively inexpensive, simple, rapid, highly sensitive and specific non-commercial alternative to sequencing for epidemiological surveillance of Delta in many settings. An additional advantage of DMAS-RT-PCR is that it is capable of genotyping SARS-CoV-2 when the level of virus in clinical samples is too low for successful sequencing. Counterintuitively, in countries such as the UK where the Delta variant is already dominant, one might consider using DMAS-RT-PCR for rapidly identifying the small minority of non-Delta cases and subjecting these to genome sequencing to increase the chance discovering novel, emergent non-Delta variants. In conclusion, the DMAS-RT-PCR assay that we describe would be simple to establish in any laboratory that can conduct PCR assays and should greatly facilitate monitoring of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant globally.",
