With the transition to a more integrated and collaborative TB control model in China, Phase II of the project (2012-2015), which was implemented in three prefectures in eastern, central, and western provinces of China, demonstrated how to ensure that innovative diagnostic, treatment, and financing approaches for all TB patients could be effectively adapted to the new model.

This phase aimed to expand the comprehensive model of TB control at the provincial level and introduce new policies, technologies, and approaches to cope with the challenges identified in the previous phases and thus improve the performance of TB control in China. Phase III centered on three domains. The first domain focused on strengthening the TB care delivery system, including (a) planning, policy development, and advocacy to support scale-up of the comprehensive TB control model through local government commitment; (b) capacity-building of TB care professionals through innovative training approaches; and (c) developing a new TB surveillance and information system. The second domain focused on improving the quality of TB care, including the (a) upgrade of laboratory capacity for TB and MDR-TB diagnostics; (b) standardization of diagnosis, treatment, and patient management of TB and MDR-TB; (c) scale-up of using EMMs to improve community-based case management; and (d) introduction of new anti-TB drugs. The third domain focused on improving the mechanism for financing TB care and included (a) introducing multisource financing for TB clinical care, (b) exploring the reform of payment methods for TB clinical care, and (c) simplifying the process of medical assistance for patients who are eligible to benefit.",

The evaluation team undertook performance-based monitoring, using routine data from all counties of the three project provinces and an in-depth site evaluation in the selected prefectures in each province. For each province, two prefectures were selected, representing a variety of socioeconomic levels. Within each prefecture, two counties were selected using the same criteria; in total, six prefectures and twelve counties were involved in the site evaluation. The team applied both quantitative and qualitative methods for the baseline and final evaluation. Quantitative data collection included a patient survey with TB and MDR-TB patients, a survey with TB professionals, an institution-based survey for TB-designated hospitals and local CDCs, as well as routine data from the health information system in the TB-designated hospitals, medical records of TB and MDR-TB patients, and surveillance data on TB and MDR-TB diagnosis, treatment, and case management. Qualitative data included data extracted from local policy documents; qualitative interviews with decision-makers and key informants from the local health authority, health insurance agency, CDC, TB-designated hospitals, and focus group discussions with TB care providers and TB and MDR-TB patients; site observations; and field notes.",

The qualitative results reveal that the achievements were mainly attributed to successful scale-up of the new rapid diagnostic technologies as well as training and monitoring of TB clinical services. Meanwhile, the qualitative findings raise concerns on the sustainability and affordability of applying new diagnostic technologies. In terms of appropriate application of new anti-TB drugs, the safety profile of bedaquilinecontaining treatment for patients with MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) was examined [8] . The result shows that bedaquiline was generally welltolerated by MDR-TB patients, and support the use of bedaquiline for treatment of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. In addition, the TB treatment success rate slightly increased with the expansion of coverage of EMMs in the project provinces. The further study is proposed to test improved EMMs with real-time feedback, according to the knowledge gained from the implementation [9] .",
