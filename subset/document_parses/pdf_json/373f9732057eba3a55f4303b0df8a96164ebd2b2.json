These older adults are more likely to have multiple comorbidities and as a result require more complex management. It is known that older adults are the largest consumers of healthcare resources, so as our global population ages, health services must adapt to support older adults in the hospital and community settings and across transitions of care. 2 Up to 60% of older adults who present to the emergency department (ED) are admitted for inpatient care as demonstrated in a retrospective cohort study of 550 older adults byKennelly et al. 3 Of those who were discharged home from the ED, 46.5% reattended the ED within 1 year. Older adults functional ability is negatively correlated with older age and an increasing number of comorbidities. 4 In the 2 weeks prior to a hospital admission, half of older adults will Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba This is the first systematic review to synthesise the totality of evidence in relation to the effectiveness of early supported discharge (ESD) on clinical and process outcomes in older adults with an acute medical admission. \u25ba Reporting is in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. \u25ba ESD interventions for stroke, surgical and elective hospital admissions will not be included. \u25ba Robust and transparent methods used to identify, select, appraise and synthesise findings. \u25ba The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the GRADE Framework used to assess methodological quality.",

Loyd et al 6 reported that up to 30% (95% CI 24% to 33%) of older adults experience hospital associated disability in their meta-analysis of 15 longitudinal studies of older adults hospitalised in acute care. By reducing hospital LoS for older adults, their functional abilities can be preserved and in turn reduce their risk of adverse outcomes such as falls or hospital readmission. Early supported discharge (ESD) is an acute hospital discharge intervention aimed at linking inpatient care and community services to allow patients to return home more than would be otherwise possible with community care, by receiving additional input from healthcare professionals. 7 ESD for people with acute stroke has been widely researched. A Cochrane review of 17 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining ESD in acute stroke care found it to decrease LoS by an average of 6 days, and also decrease admissions to long-term care. 7 Those with mild-moderate disability (broadly defined as a Barthel Index score >9 on initial assessment) made the greatest improvements. ESD has also been explored in surgical populations. Kapur et al 8 demonstrated a significant reduction in LoS among patients undergoing hip replacement in their controlled before-after study.",

While carer outcomes (subjective health status, mood status and carer satisfaction) were analysed in the systematic review of ESD interventions for acute stroke care by Langhorne and Baylan, 7 the role of carers in assisting with an ESD intervention was not explicitly noted. However, research demonstrates that involving caregivers in the discharge process can reduce the risk of readmissions in older adults by 25% 90 days postdischarge and 24% 180 days postdischarge. 11 As per these NICE guidelines, ESD is a discharge intervention model that would potentially reduce the risk of readmission, while inevitably involving families/caregivers in a shared decision-making process.",
