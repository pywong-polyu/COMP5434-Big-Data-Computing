However, the diagnostic tests used to identify the target disease typically suffer from imperfect sensitivity and specificity, leading to biased vaccine effectiveness estimates. Here we present a solution to this problem via a Bayesian statistical model which can either incorporate point estimates of test sensitivity and specificity, or can jointly infer them directly from laboratory validation data. This approach enables uncertainties in the performance characteristics of the diagnostic test to be correctly propagated to estimates, avoiding both bias and false precision in vaccine effectiveness. By further incorporating individual covariates of study participants, and by allowing data streams from multiple diagnostic test types to be rigorously combined, our approach provides a flexible model for the analysis of TNDs with explicitly stated assumptions.",

In turn, these false positives or false negatives, alternatively called outcome misclassifications, will lead to biased estimates of vaccine effectiveness unless statistical corrections are made [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] . Thus, appropriate statistical consideration of imperfect diagnostic tests, as well as potential confounders, is important for vaccine effective estimation and public health decision making. 1 Aspects of this problem have been studied by others. For instance, Endo et al. [4] proposed a frequentist bias-correction method for TNDs that accounts for imperfect sensitivity and specificity along with potential confounders (e.g., age and sex). Their method assumes that the true sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test are known, yet in practice, these values are not known exactly because they are, themselves, estimated from data. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies, failure to incorporate such uncertainty in sensitivity and specificity has led to incorrect conclusions [8, 9] . More broadly, small discrepancies between the assumed and actual sensitivity and specificity values can produce large biases [10, 11] .",

Based on this framework, we showed how data from both the field site and validation labs may be used to produce joint posterior estimates of vaccine effectiveness, sensitivity, and specificity. This allowed us to demonstrate how vaccine effectiveness estimates may be made more precise simply by better validating the performance characteristics of diagnostic tests. We further showed how our Bayesian model can be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness from multiple data streams at once, each based on a different diagnostic test.",

The horizontal axis corresponds to the proportion of 400 diagnostic tests that were allocated to validating specificity. For each proportion, sensitivity and specificity validation studies were simulated along with a vaccine effectiveness (VE) study of 5000 individuals. Independent uniform priors on the interval [0, 1] were used on test sensitivity and specificity before seeing the validation data. We fixed vaccine effectiveness and the probability a study participant is vaccinated at 0.75 and 0.5, respectively. The true relative prevalence of the target disease (prevalence), sensitivity (se), and specificity (sp) were varied to generate the curves shown. For each curve and each proportion of validation tests used to validate specificity, we conducted 50 simulations. Over these 50 simulations, we computed the average vaccine effectiveness 95% HDPI (A) and posterior mean bias (B). The curves show how one can allocate validation tests to maximally benefit vaccine effectiveness inference (i.e., to produce 95% HDPIs of minimal width and bias). and accompanying software allow one to explore various choices for these sample sizes, linking them to uncertainty of vaccine effectiveness inferences measured via the width of the vaccine effectiveness posterior credible interval. This, in turn, allows for decisions as to whether or not a larger study or additional test validation efforts are likely to be worth the additional effort (Fig. 4) .",

The uncorrected HDPIs generally have narrower HDPIs as they assume sensitivity and specificity are perfect (i.e., they assume se = sp = 1) which leads to erroneously confident (i.e., narrow) credible intervals. As specificity nears one, the HDPI widths become narrow reflecting the importance of high specificity in estimating vaccine effectiveness. Interestingly, as a function of prevalence, the vaccine effectiveness HDPI is narrowest when the target disease is approximately equally as prevalent as the non-target diseases, i.e., when prevalence \u2248 0.5 (Fig. S1D) .",
