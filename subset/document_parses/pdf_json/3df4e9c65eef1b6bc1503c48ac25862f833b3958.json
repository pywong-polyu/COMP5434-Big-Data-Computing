This technique bypasses some steps in the traditional drug approval system, which saves time and lives in the case of pandemics. Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have repeatedly repurposed from treating one virus to another. In this study, 16 FDA-approved hepatitis C virus (HCV) DAA drugs were studied to explore their activities against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) human and viral targets. Among the 16 HCV DAA drugs, telaprevir has shown the best in silico evidence to work on both indirect human targets (cathepsin L [CTSL] and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2] receptor) and direct viral targets (main protease [M pro ]). Moreover, the docked poses of telaprevir inside both hACE2 and M pro were subjected to additional molecular dynamics simulations monitored by calculating the binding free energy using MM-GBSA. In vitro analysis of telaprevir showed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture (IC 50 \u00bc 11.552 \u03bcM, CC 50 \u00bc 60.865 \u03bcM, and selectivity index \u00bc 5.27). Accordingly, based on the in silico studies and supported by the presented in vitro analysis, we suggest that telaprevir may be considered for therapeutic development against SARS-CoV-2.",

The main advantage of drug repurposing in drug development is that it spares the time, cost, and efforts that are exerted in the research and development process [6, 9, 10, 11] . Interestingly, drug repurposing or repositioning strategies have been intensively applied during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a large-scale drug repositioning survey for SARS-CoV-2 antivirals has so far been achieved [6, 12, 13] . For instance, eight out of the 12 FDA-approved antivirals from 2012 to 2017 were HCV antivirals repurposed to treat other viruses (e.g., Zika and Ebola viruses) [14, 15] . HCV direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are predicted to target some coronavirus-related elements, including indirect human targets (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme 2 [ACE2] and cathepsin L [CTSL]) or direct viral targets (e.g., S protein and main protease [M pro ]) [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] .",

In the case of the docked pose of telaprevir in the hACE2 pocket of SARS-CoV-2, the amino acids Ser43, Ser47, Tyr50, Asn51, His345, Phe274, Pro346, Ala348, Thr371, Glu375, Tyr510, and Arg518 contributed mainly to the hydrogen bonding interactions (5%-50%), and Phe40, Tyr50, Ile54, Met62, Val343, His345, Pro346, Trp349, His374, His378, Phe504, Tyr510, and Arg514 had the greatest contribution to the hydrophobic interactions (2%-28%) with the docked pose of telaprevir. Ser43, Ser44, Ser47, Tyr50, Tyr51, Met62, Asn63, Trp69, Glu145, Arg273, Val343, Cys344, His345, Pro346, Thr347, Ala348, Cys361, Lys363, Asp367, Asp368, Thr371, His374, Glu375, Glu398, Glu402, Glu406, Ser409, His505, Tyr510, Arg514, Tyr515, and Arg518 contributed mainly to the water bridge hydrogen bonds (1%-27%) with the docked telaprevir ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, telaprevir formed stronger interactions inside the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M pro compared to its hACE2 pocket throughout the simulation time, as can be observed from the timeline protein-ligand contacts ( Figure 4B ). His41, Asn142, Cys145, Glu166, Arg188, Gln189, and Trr190 amino acids contributed to 5%-100% to the hydrogen bonding interactions with telaprevir in the M pro pocket. However, the amino acids Leu27, Met49, Cys145, Met165, Leu167, and pro168 contributed mainly to the hydrophobic interactions (5%-25%), while Thr24, Ser46, Asn142, Gly143, Glu166, Gln189, and Thr190 showed the highest contribution to the water bridge hydrogen bonds (30%-70%) to the telaprevir pose in the M pro pocket of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, regarding the docked pose of N3 inside the binding pocket of M pro , it was found that amino acids Thr26, His41, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His164, Glu166, Gln189, Thr190, and Gln192 had the largest percentage of hydrogen bonding interactions (10%-70%); the amino acids Met49, Cys145, Met165, Leu167, and Pro168 contributed to the hydrophobic interactions with (5%-20%); and the amino acids Thr24, Thr25, His41, Ser46, Asn119, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His163, His164, Met165, Glu166, Leu167, Pro168, Arg188, Gln189, Thr190, Ala191, and Gln192 contributed to (5%-190%) of the water bridge hydrogen bonding ( Figure 4C ). Figure 5 shows the heat map for the total number of contacts and interactions for telaprevir within the hACE2 and M pro pockets, in addition to the N3 inhibitor inside the M pro pocket of SARS-CoV-2 protein. It was observed that the main binding site for telaprevir inside the hACE2 pocket was Tyr510 throughout >80% of the simulation time ( Figure 5A ). In contrast, the main binding residues inside the M pro pocket were found to be His41, Gln189, and Glu166 throughout the simulation time (80%-99%) ( Figure 5B ). However, the main binding amino acids for the N3 A: hACE2 receptor of SARS-CoV-2. P: M pro protein of SARS-CoV-2. a R: The target receptor pocket. b S: The score of a compound inside the protein-binding pocket (kcal/mol). c RMSD: The root mean squared deviation between the predicted pose and crystal structure. inhibitor inside its M pro binding pocket were Glu166, Gln189, Thr26, Gly143, and Asn142 during the simulation (75%-99%) ( Figure 5C ). Therefore, the higher number of contacts, especially for telaprevir within the M pro binding pocket, compared to its N3 inhibitor, reflects its superior stability and confirms the previously obtained higher docking score. The ligand property study describes the ligand root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (rGyr), molecular surface area (MolSA), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and polar surface area (PSA). For the docked pose of telaprevir (hACE2), the RMSD was within the range of 2 \u00c5. Its rGyr -, which measures the extendedness of a ligand, was in the range of 4.8-6 \u00c5 and the equilibrium was approximately 5.4 \u00c5. The MolSA -, which is equivalent to a van der Waals surface area calculated with1.4 \u00c5 probe radius, fluctuated from the start of the simulation until reaching equilibrium at 30 ns, and its range was observed between and 550-625 \u00c5 2 with an equilibrium around 610 \u00c5 2 . Moreover, the surface area of telaprevir accessible by a water molecule (SASA) showed heavy fluctuations up to 20 ns, showed equilibrium between and 20-70 ns, and then fluctuated again until the end of the simulation time. The SASA range was approximately 150-600 \u00c5 2 , and the equilibrium was approximately 450 \u00c5 2 . Furthermore, the PSA, which refers to the SASA in telaprevir, contributed only to oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Its range was approximately 140-200 \u00c5 2 , and the equilibrium was approximately 160 \u00c5 2 ( Figure 6A ). In contrast, regarding the docked pose of telaprevir (M pro ), the RMSD was within the range of 1.75 \u00c5. The rGyr was observed to be in the range of (4.75-5.50 \u00c5) and the equilibrium was around 5.25 \u00c5. It fluctuated only at the beginning until 10 ns and then reached equilibrium until the end of the simulation time. The MolSA also fluctuated from the start of the simulation until reaching equilibrium at 10 ns, and its fluctuation range was between and 560-640 \u00c5 2 , with an equilibrium around 610 \u00c5 2 . Moreover, the SASA range was approximately 240-420 \u00c5 2 , and the equilibrium was approximately 330 \u00c5 2 . In addition, the PSA range was between 120 and 185 \u00c5 2 , and its equilibrium was approximately 160 \u00c5 2 ( Figure 6B) . Collectively, the telaprevir property studied for its docked pose inside the M pro pocket were superior compared to its docked pose inside the hACE2 pocket, which matches greatly with the previously discussed sections. Furthermore, for the docked pose of N3 (M pro ), the RMSD was within the range of 3 \u00c5. The rGyr was observed in the range of 5-7 \u00c5, and the equilibrium was approximately 6 \u00c5. The MolSA also fluctuated from the start of the simulation until it reached equilibrium at 10 ns and returned to fluctuations again at 80 ns. Its fluctuation range was between and 570-660 \u00c5 2 , with an equilibrium around 630 \u00c5 2 . Moreover, the SASA range was approximately 300-550 \u00c5 2 , and the equilibrium was approximately 350 \u00c5 2 . In addition, the PSA range was 200-275 \u00c5 2 , and its equilibrium was around 250 \u00c5 2 ( Figure 6C ).",

As antivirals showed a great ability to be repurposed against different viruses, we selected a group of 16 HCV DAAs to study their potential for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2. Among the studied drugs, telaprevir showed the best in silico evidence for its repurposing potential against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking results revealed the superior ability of telaprevir to fit with the M pro pocket of SARS-CoV-2 through the formation of three H-bonds with the key protein residues. Additionally, molecular dynamics studies of the docked pose of telaprevir inside the M pro pocket revealed its greater stability compared to that inside the hACE2 pocket, which confirmed the previously obtained docking results. Furthermore, the MM-GBSA binding energy showed that telaprevir docked pose inside the M pro pocket had very promising binding energy compared to that of the N3 inhibitor. In vitro studies have inferred this potential (IC 50 \u00bc 11.55 \u03bcM, CC 50 \u00bc 60.865 \u03bcM, and CC 50 / IC 50 \u00bc 5.27), and we recommend further preclinical and clinical studies for the ability of telaprevir to be successfully repurposed against SARS-CoV-2. Although different publications were published on SARS-CoV-2, to our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on telaprevir as a promising drug member to be repurposed towards SARS-CoV-2 using both computational and in vitro confirmatory aspects.",
