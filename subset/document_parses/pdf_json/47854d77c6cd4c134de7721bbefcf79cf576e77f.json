This would require health promotion interventions in the three main settings recommended by WHO: schools, workplaces (as this is considered as a non-work hindrance stressor that may affect employees' performance and productivity in the workplace) and primary health care settings. The implementation of health registries would enable to monitor the health of the general population and evaluate any public health intervention. The involvement of civil society and affected communities, including those in humanitarian settings, is key for decision-making and monitoring processes. Finally, ensuring a people-centered and inclusive approach as well as the availability of NCD medicines, supplies, and care alongside those for communicable diseases like COVID-19 is of paramount importance towards Universal Health Coverage.
