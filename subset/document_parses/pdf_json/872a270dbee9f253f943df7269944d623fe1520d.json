The peak corresponding to the nsp10-nsp16 complex (highlighted in cyan) was kept for further experiments. The purified nsp10-nsp16 complex is also shown on an SDS-PAGE gel.

The residues involved in the interface interactions are shown as sticks. A) Coiled-coil region of nsp10 (residues 40-47) involved mainly in hydrophobic interactions.
