No significant effect of baricitinib was observed on 28-day [39 events; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.76; 95% CI, 0.31-1.86], 60-day (49 events, aHR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.55-2.52), or 90-day mortality (49 events; aHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.53-2.47), or on the composite outcome 28-day IMV/death (aHR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.45-1.72). Secondary infections during hospitalization were not different between groups (17.9 vs. 10.5%, respectively; p = 0.212) and thromboembolic events were higher with baricitinib (11.6% vs. 3.2%; p = 0.048), but differences vanished after the adjustment [aHR 1.89 (0.31-11.57), p = 0.490].",

Therapeutic strategies in this setting are based on a combination of antiviral and primarily immunomodulatory therapy although there is no consensus on the optimal regimen composition (2, 3) and mortality remains unacceptably high (4) . Among immune modulators, dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality (5) and is currently considered the mainstay of treatment for severe and critical illness (2, 3) . Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist, improved the survival in hospitalized patients with hypoxia and systemic inflammation and critically ill patients (6) (7) (8) , and was incorporated into treatment guidelines for severe non-critical and critical disease (3) . More recently, the inhibitors of the Janus kinase (JAK) family have also been associated with a decreased risk of mortality (9) (10) (11) . Baricitinib is a JAK1/2 inhibitor that has emerged as an alternative therapeutic option, mainly for patients requiring high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation (NIV), in whom the drug has shown the most pronounced benefit in reducing mortality and accelerating improvement (2, 3, 9, 10, 12) . The mechanism of action of baricitinib includes theoretical advantages over tocilizumab, as baricitinib decreases the concentration of several cytokines and inflammatory mediators involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in addition to IL-6 and has an additional potential antiviral activity (13) .",

Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to examine the balance of a covariate distribution between treatment groups. Because SMD is independent of the unit of measurement, it allows a comparison between variables with different units of measurement. Matched patients were compared for the primary and secondary outcome variables and the safety outcome risk of secondary infection or thromboembolism. To further adjust for the covariates that remained unbalanced between treatment groups after matching, adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression for binomial outcomes or Poisson regression for ordinal outcomes were run. To represent the temporal changes of the levels of the biomarkers, local polynomial regression models were employed using weighted least squares to estimate the performance of each biomarker according to the day of initiation of baricitinib or the day of high-flow oxygen requirement for the tocilizumab group. Differences in temporal trends between biomarkers were analyzed through linear mixed models in which an interaction term of the day of tocilizumab initiation and response was included.

IL-6 has been shown to play a central role in the immune dysregulation that characterizes COVID-19 pneumonia, in which the levels of this cytokine have been associated with disease severity (18). Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits IL-6 binding to its receptor, thereby blocking IL-6 signaling and reducing inflammation (6) . Baricitinib has a broader anti-cytokine activity than tocilizumab as it has been shown to in vitro decrease SARS-COV-2-specific response mediated by IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IL-13, IL-1ra, IL-10, GM-CSF, FGF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b2 (13, 19) , and the general immune response through a rapid recovery of circulating T-and B-cell frequencies (20) . In addition, baricitinib also acts as a potential antiviral drug through the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 into cells (21) . In light of this, a sequential combination of baricitinib after tocilizumab therapy could be expected to have an additional beneficial impact. However, we found no advantage of JAK inhibition after IL-6 receptor blockade on the survival of patients. This may suggest a preponderant role of IL-6 over other cytokines in the pathogenesis and outcome of severe COVID-19 (22) . Tocilizumab has a prolonged halflife of 11-13 days (23), and the effects on IL-6 are likely to persist when baricitinb is administered. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of baricitinib on interferon-gamma, which has a broadspectrum antiviral activity at multiple stages (24) , might result in a hypothetical negative impact when added to the analogous effects in the defense against viral infections of IL-6 blockade. Another factor potentially contributing to the absence of a benefit with baricitinib could be related to the concurrent therapy with corticosteroids, which have also been shown to increase survival, although baricitinib demonstrated in a randomized trial a reduction in mortality against placebo in patients mostly on corticosteroid therapy (10). While we found no benefit of the addition of baricitinib to a regimen containing tocilizumab and dexamethasone, our study does not allow comparing the effect of baricitinib with that of tocilizumab or dexamethasone in patients with severe COVID-19, as all patients received the SOC including tocilizumab and dexamethasone.",

Our patients were thoroughly monitored during their hospital stay, with lab tests every other day including biomarkers of infection, and an additional protocol for patients experiencing fever or clinical progression that included further diagnostic tests to exclude opportunistic infections and empirical antimicrobial therapy. While both agents have been linked with an increased risk of infections in patients with rheumatic disease (30) (31) (32) (33) , clinical trials, and meta-analyses with each drug have not verified a higher frequency of serious infections in patients with COVID-1 (9, 10, (34) (35) (36) . We neither observed significant differences in the incidence of secondary infections with the combination of baricitinib plus tocilizumab compared to tocilizumab in our cohort even though all patients received additionally corticosteroids. The shorter duration of the immunomodulatory therapy in COVID-19 compared to rheumatic diseases, the frequent use of antibiotics in our cohort, and the fact that the comparator was tocilizumab plus corticosteroids might have contributed to minimizing differences between treatment groups.",
