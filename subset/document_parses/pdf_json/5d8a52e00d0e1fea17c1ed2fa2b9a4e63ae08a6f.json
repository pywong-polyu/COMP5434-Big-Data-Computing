However, less is known about its impact on vulnerable populations, such as veterans with preexisting psychiatric conditions. Data were analyzed from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative cohort of U.S. veterans. Pre-pandemic and 1-year peripandemic risk and protective factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) were examined in veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. 19.2% of veterans screened positive for SI peri-pandemic. Relative to veterans without SI, they had lower income, were more likely to have been infected with COVID-19, reported greater COVID-19-related financial and social restriction stress, and increases in psychiatric symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. A multivariable analysis revealed that older age, greater pre-pandemic psychiatric symptom severity, past-year SI, lifetime suicide attempt, psychosocial difficulties, COVID-19 infection, and past-year increase in psychiatric symptom severity were linked to peri-pandemic SI, while pre-pandemic higher income and purpose in life were protective. Among veterans who were infected with COVID-19, those aged 45 or older and who reported lower purpose in life were more likely to endorse SI. Monitoring for suicide risk and worsening psychiatric symptoms in older veterans who have been infected with COVID-19 may be important. Interventions that enhance purpose in life may help protect against SI in this population.",

During the same period, veterans have shown a higher (48.6%) increase in suicide rate and 27.5 deaths by suicide per 100,000 persons in 2018 (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, 2020). In 2018, veterans comprised 7.1% of the U.S. population (Vespa, 2020) while accounting for 13.8% of all deaths by suicide (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, 2020). Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed people's lives dramatically, with increased social isolation, economic recession, and sense of powerlessness (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, 2020; Reger et al., 2020) . Preliminary reports show a substantial increase in prevalence of depression and anxiety in the general public during the pandemic (Ettman et al., 2020; Czeisler et al., 2020; Pierce et al., 2020a; Wathelet et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) , and it has been suggested that this may be accompanied by a possible increase in deaths by suicides (Reger et al., 2020; Gunnel et al., 2020; Sher, 2020) .",

Another potentially vulnerable population for suicide during the pandemic are older adults who are more likely than younger adults to have underlying physical illnesses and functional impairments, which may be exacerbated by stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., difficulties accessing health care, social distancing measures), and may contribute to late-life suicide (Yip et al., 2010; Sheffler et al., 2020) . However, preliminary large surveys of the general population conducted during the pandemic show the opposite, with older adults actually being less affected by psychiatric issues compared to other age groups (Vahia et al., 2020) . Thus, whether older age is protective or a risk of worse mental health during the pandemic remains to be elucidated.",

However, protective factors such as purpose in life, resilience, optimism, gratitude, community integration, and social support, which have been linked to lower likelihood of suicidality (Straus et al., 2019 , Mclean et al., 2008 Mcclatchey et al., 2019) , have received less attention in the suicide literature.",

First, nearly all published studies have used cross-sectional or retrospective surveys carried out after the start of the pandemic, and are thus prone to selection bias (Pierce et al., 2020b) . Second, scarce research has examined how pre-pandemic factors relate to mental health factors such as SI during the pandemic. Hence, little is known about the longitudinal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal behavior (Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2020) . Third, most research has focused on general population samples, and no known study has investigated the mental health impact of the pandemic in veterans. Consequently, it is unclear whether observed results apply to groups at higher risk for suicide, such as veterans or those with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Fourth, although some studies have reported increased prevalence of SI in those infected with COVID-19 (Mazza et al., 2020) , it is unknown to what extent COVID-related stressors may influence SI risk in those with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Fifth, possible interactions between COVID-19 infection and age and protective factors on SI risk have not yet been examined. It is thus crucial to identify the risk and protective factors, including both COVID-related and non-related factors, in individuals at high-risk of suicide, such as veterans with pre-existing psychiatric disorders, as such data can help inform targeted, effective, and timely suicide prevention strategies (Gunnel et al., 2020) .",

A total of 4069 veterans completed the Wave 1 (median completion date: 11/21/2019) survey prior to the first documented COVID-19 cases in the US and 3078 (75.6%) completed a 1-year follow-up Wave 2 (median completion date: 11/14/2020) survey. Wave 1 survey will be referred to \"pre-pandemic survey\" and Wave 2 survey will be referred to \"peri-pandemic survey.\" Details of the study, including the recruitment protocol, has been described previously (Fogle et al., 2020) . Briefly, the NHRVS sample was drawn from KnowledgePanel\u00ae, a survey research panel of more than 50,000 U.S. households maintained by Ipsos, a survey research firm. To ensure generalizability of the results to the US veteran population, poststratification weights were computed based on the demographic distribution of veterans in the US Census Current Population Survey. In the current study, a total of 661 veterans (23.8% of peri-pandemic sample) screened positive for major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), PTSD, and/or SUD at the pre-pandemic assessment. We focused on this subsample based on previous research suggesting that individuals with pre-existing psychiatric conditions are at higher risk of mental health problems during the pandemic (Yao et al., 2020) . The study protocol was approved by the Human Subjects Subcommitee of the VA Connecticut Healthcare System, and all participants provided informed consent.",

COVID-related stressors such as economic stress and social isolation due to pandemic restrictions have been suggested as possible risk factors of suicidal behavior during the pandemic (Reger et al., 2020; Banerjee et al., 2021; Gunnel et al., 2020) . In our study, veterans with peri-pandemic SI reported worse COVID-related financial and social restriction stressors compared to those without SI. This finding is consistent with the Conservation of Resources Theory, which suggests that a loss of resources may lead to traumatic stress (Hobfoll, 1991) , as well as studies showing that economic distress during the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected people's mental health (Codagnone et al., 2020) . While COVID-related stressors were not significant when considered in the context of other factors, pre-pandemic lower household income was a significant risk factor for peri-pandemic SI. This finding is consistent with a nationally representative study of U.S. adults in which financial strain, including lower household income, was linked to an increased likelihood of suicide attempt (Elbogen et al., 2020) . Veterans with lower pre-pandemic income may have had less access to services, less savings to endure economic hardship, and/or greater anxiety related to the future, which in turn contributed to SI risk.",

            "text": "It has also been proposed that COVID-related worries and media consumption may exacerbate mental health burden (Su et al., 2021; Gunnel et al., 2020; Bendau et al., 2020) . In our study, COVID-related media consumption did not differ between those with and without peri-pandemic SI, suggesting that frequency of media consumption may be unrelated to SI in veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. While veterans with peri-pandemic SI were on average younger than those without SI, older age was associated with increased risk of SI when considered in the context of other risk and protective factors, thus underscoring the importance of assessing suicide risk in older veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Further, veterans aged 45-59 and 60 and older who were infected with COVID-19 were at highest risk of peri-pandemic SI, with 58.7% and 39.9% of these groups endorsing SI, respectively, compared to 23.4% of veterans aged 18-44. It is well known that older adults are more likely to suffer from a more severe illness course and sequelae of COVID-19 infection (Shahid et al., 2020) . Thus, one possible interpretation of this interaction is that older veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions who were infected with COVID-19 may have experienced more severe psychological distress and/or negative mood symptoms given heightened worries associated with higher mortality risk related to COVID-19 in older individuals. It is also noteworthy that greater pre-pandemic psychiatric symptom severity and psychosocial difficulties, and aggravation of psychiatric symptoms over the past year were associated with increased risk of peri-pandemic SI. The finding that an increase in psychiatric symptom severity during the pandemic was linked to peri-pandemic SI above and beyond baseline levels of distress is consistent with studies in the general population, which have similarly observed increases in psychological distress during the pandemic (Czeisler et al., 2020; Ettman et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Pierce et al., 2020a) . Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of continued monitoring and intervention for worsening psychiatric symptoms in both high-risk individuals and the general population at large. Greater pre-pandemic purpose in life protected against peripandemic SI, even after accounting for a broad range of other risk and protective factors. Further, purpose in life interacted with COVID-19 infection, with three-quarters of veterans in the lowest quartile of prepandemic purpose in life who were infected with COVID-19 endorsing peri-pandemic SI relative to 17.7% of veterans in the highest quartile of purpose in life who were infected with COVID-19. This finding extends prior work linking lack of meaning in life or feeling needed by others with suicide risk (Ozawa-de Silva, 2020; Van orden et al., 2010; Heisel and Flett, 2014) , including high-risk veterans (Straus et al., 2019) to suggest that high-risk veterans with low purpose in life who were infected with COVID-19 may be at particularly elevated risk for suicide. Higher purpose in life, which has been linked to more effective regulation of the stress response (Van reekum et al., 2007; Ishida and Okada, 2006) , may help promote engagement in adaptive coping strategies, such as soliciting social support or engaging in physical exercise to help manage distress and suicidality (Van reekum et al., 2007; Ishida and Okada, 2006; Hooker and Masters, 2014) .",
