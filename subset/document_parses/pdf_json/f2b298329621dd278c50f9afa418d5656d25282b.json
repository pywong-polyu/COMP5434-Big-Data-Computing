We present our experience in managing the patients at Government-run non-COVID-19 trauma center in Delhi in an algorithmic form. Our standard operating protocols were mainly based on recommendations of Indian Orthopaedic Association and targeted to provide healthcare at a minimum risk to the treating team as well as other patients admitted to the hospital. Methodology We describe the inflow, in-hospital management and outflow of patients at our facility during the lockdown period and in the following unlock period (from 23 March to 8 July 2020). Those patients who had absolute indications for surgery were offered surgery, while conservative treatment was more favored in those with relative indications. We also highlight the changes incorporated in OT settings as well as in rehabilitative and follow-up period. Results Following the described protocol helped us maintain a balance between the safety of patients and our front line workers which was evident by very low COVID-19-positive rate in admitted patients (4.22%) and health care providers (16.67%) in the above-mentioned time period. Conclusions We need to be prepared to cohabitate with this deadly Novel Coronavirus and adapt our surgical practices according to the need of the hour by minimizing surgical indications and strengthening the training in conservative principles.",

In India, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 30 January 2020, and the number has reached 1,287,945 as on 25 July 2020, with 30,601 deaths [4] . The most effective strategies against COVID-19 include preventing exposure and staying indoors. Keeping this in mind, the Government of India (GOI) declared a nationwide lockdown on 23 March 2020 for a period of 3 weeks which was extended further to 3rd May. The lockdown was still further extended till 17th May but this time with ease of some restrictions. Thereafter, unlock procedure was started in many states and over the time period, several states have reopened various public facilities with adequate precautions. The GOI has designated the 733 districts of India into red, orange and green zones according to varying levels of restriction aimed at containing the virus [5] . Restrictions are being imposed/withdrawn depending upon the rate of increase/decrease in number of active cases across various states [6] . We are still far away from the pandemic being over and now is the time that we start implementing our exit strategies and prepare ourselves to coexist with this deadly disease.",

All the patients were screened with an infrared thermometer and history pertaining to COVID-19 symptoms like fever, dry cough, difficulty in breathing, contact with a known positive case, travel, etc. was elicited. If there was any positive history, the patient was sent to isolation zone and was assumed to be a suspect, while patients with no history of COVID-19 like symptoms were shifted to non-isolation zones.

All attempts were made to manage the patients non-operatively. Those patients who had absolute indications for surgery were offered surgery, while the relative indications for surgery in a particular injury were considered as low priority.

Proper donning and doffing areas were designated for equipping PPE kits. Anesthetic induction and use of orthopaedic power tools are aerosol generating procedures and require negative pressure maintenance in OTs [12] . Minimum number of personnel were allowed inside the OT at any given time. All theater staff were advised to wear enhanced PPE that consists of FFP3mask (Filtering face piece and the number denotes level of protection), full face shield, head cover, double pair of gloves, full sleeve waterproof gown and shoes. All staff were trained to do donning and doffing in the designated areas provided. General Anesthesia (GA) involving intubation has shown to increase the production of aerosols leading to an increased risk of infection to the healthcare workers [9] . The aim was to do most of the procedures under regional block, but this was not possible for all procedures. If GA was administered, then it was carried out with minimal number of staff. The same was applied when the patient was extubated [13] . Recovery of the patient was done in theater, and once stable, he/she was shifted directly to post-operative ward. Another important aspect in OT setting was careful management of waste.

Follow-up visits were restricted to suture removal days. A separate floor was designated to run the follow-up OPD. Most of the complaints and apprehensions of the patients were attended telephonically. During the postoperative stay, the patients were told about what exercises they needed to do and at what time in sessions conducted by our physiotherapist with adequate social distancing. The patients who were COVID-19-positive (including those who tested positive after emergency surgery) were shifted to our COVID-19-dedicated facility for the further management of their illness after they were deemed stable for transportation. Stay of such patients was tried to be kept as small as possible.",

This division of the work force into units was done on the premise that if even one patient with COVID-19 infection was operated or admitted in the ward for a significant duration, the team coming in contact would need to be quarantined else they would place the nonexposed staff at risk. With two teams, it would be possible to replace the quarantined team.",

Fifteen (1.89%) patients with open fractures required emergency surgery before COVID-19 sampling could be done. One patient with fracture of lumbar spine with partial neurological deficit (including bladder and bowel involvement) was planned for early decompression and stabilization of the spine, who was detected as COVID-19-positive later. All the members of the operative team (including the anesthetist and the paramedical staff) were quarantined for a week in the post-op period and were tested negative after 7 days. Table 2 shows the COVID-19 positivity rate among HCWs with an overall rate of 16.67%, the source of infection, however, could not be validated in them. Out of total 17 COVID-19-positive individuals, seven (41.2%) were asymptomatic, 10 (58.8%) were mildly symptomatic, and none were seriously ill requiring intensive care. Most of these infections were during the first week of lockdown and more than 50% of the workers were of the same category, sharing a common room. This practice of sharing room by multiple workers was discontinued after the initial spike.",

Patients having emergent conditions like grade three open fractures, mangled extremities, vascular injury, polytrauma or compartment syndrome need to be considered as COVID-19-positive (or suspects) and should be managed on urgent basis (with enhanced PPEs) with appropriate resuscitation and operative intervention. Enhanced PPEs and special considerations like separate isolated wards, on table intubation and extubation, minimal use of orthopaedic power tools, reducing the operating time and blood loss, aiming for quick and adequate fixation instead of aggressive and rigid fixation are some extremely important measures that we need to adopt in these times of crisis when the infection is rampant in our health care force leading to compromised patient care and increased stress on our already overburdened medical system. So far in India and other South Asian countries, we do not have specific and detailed guidelines for management of orthopaedic accidental injuries. The IOA and BOA have published some extensive guidelines; however, the experience and consensus regarding those are remotely available. Hence, the experience we are sharing here may be of value in enhancing the acceptability of such guidelines especially in the burdened Government set-up with minimal facilities and when there was no clarity about resolution of this pandemic. We were able to operate the negative patients within 48 h of their test reporting. During the surgery of these negative patients, we did not believe it was absolutely necessary to wear full PPE although the choice was left to individuals getting scrubbed in the surgery. Spending long duration in full PPE hampers the proficiency of the chief operating surgeon but operating the patient within 48 h of negative report without hazmat suits (which are not available at most places) definitely allowed us to pull off the best possible surgical outcome.",

Hence, there is an urgent need to shift back to conservative principles of fracture management and keep the threshold for operative intervention at a higher level. This will ensure the safety of the frontline task force, as was evident from our experience and control the cross-spread of infection to patients coming to the hospital. These changes need to be adopted till efficacious and safe vaccine and targeted drugs for treatment and prevention become available in market.",
