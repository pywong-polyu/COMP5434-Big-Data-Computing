A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by realtime reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction amplification for both the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 a/b and pan-Sarbecovirus E-gene (RT-PCR, cobas R 6800 system, RocheDiagnostics), but the initial chest radiograph showed only mild bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion. He was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed bacterial superinfection with improvement in fever and leukocytosis, but continued to require supplemental nasal oxygen. The serum inflammatory markers ferritin (752 ng/ml, reference range 30-400ng/ml) and C-reactive protein (43.74 mg/L, reference range < 5.1 mg/L) were noted to be elevated. Repeat chest radiograph on hospital day 8 revealed new dense patchy left mid-lung and retrocardiac opacities, and a hazy opacity in the right lower lung. On day 9, the patient complained of increasing left inspira-tory chest pain and tenderness; 30 minutes later the patient was found to have pulseless electrical activity.",

Examination at admission was notable for a temperature of 38.4 0 C and SpO2 of 93% on room air; multiple bilateral lung opacities were noted on chest radiography. Elevated serum ferritin (411 ng/ml) and C-reactive protein (271.6 mg/L) were noted, and these values continued to rise despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Of note, prothrombin time/INR was measured on multiple days and was not prolonged. His condition deteriorated, requiring intubation and ventilator support; over the next 3 days he became hemodynamically unstable requiring multiple pressors. Eight days following admission he developed pulseless electrical activity.",

Lung sections were initially placed in neutral buffered formalin and later transferred to 3% buffered glutaraldehyde. Following post-fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide, tissues were serially dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin in standard fashion. One micron toluidine-stained scout sections were prepared for light microscopic orientation and 80nm ultrathin sections for electron microcopy were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in an Hitachi 7650 transmission electron microscope at 80kV.(A) Transmission electron microscopy image showing an infected pneumocyte. Note the cytoplasmic vacuole loaded with viral particles in various stages of bud formation ( \u2190 ), and shedding into the luminal compartment ( * ) (30 0 0x). (B) Typical morphology of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) showing a symmetrical arrangement, outer envelope and surrounding electron dense shell with central zone. Note the distinctive projections conferring a solar corona appearance. (C) Multiple capillaries showing deposits of fibrin deposition ( \u2190 ). (D) Coarse electron dense areas of cytoplasmic fibrin deposition. (E) Pure platelet thrombus within the arterial lumen and (F) Detail on platelet thrombi.
