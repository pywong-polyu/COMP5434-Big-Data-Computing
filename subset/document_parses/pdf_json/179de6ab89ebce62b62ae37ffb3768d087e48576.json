In this regard, lichen metabolites may offer a vast reservoir for the discovery of antiviral drug candidates. Therefore, to find novel compounds against COVID-19, we created a library of 412 lichen compounds and subjected to virtual screening against the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (Mpro). All the ligands were virtually screened, and 27 compounds were found to have high affinity with Mpro. These compounds were assessed for drug-likeness analysis where two compounds were found to fit well for redocking studies. Molecular docking, drug-likeness, X-Score, and toxicity analysis resulting in two lichen compounds, Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid with Mpro-inhibiting activity. These compounds were finally subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to compare the dynamics behavior and stability of the Mpro after ligand binding. The binding energy was calculated by MM-PBSA method to determine the intermolecular protein-ligand interactions. Our results showed that two compounds; Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid had the binding free energy of \u2212 42.42 kJ mol/1 and \u2212 57.85 kJ mol/1 respectively as compared to reference X77 (\u2212 91.78 kJ mol/1).

According to the Worldometer's report, about 81,285 people in China have been infected with coronavirus and 3287 deaths since its emergence in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province. After China, USA and Italy have been affected most from the coronavirus followed by Spain, Germany Iran, and France. The outbreak of coronavirus is increasing day by day. By now, more than 1,804,128 people have been diagnosed, and more than 112,223 deaths have been recorded worldwide from COVID-19, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures till 13 April, 2020. The outbreak of corona is also affecting India and to date 13 April 2020, total 8447 total cases and 273 death reports from COVID- 19. Due to its disseminating rate and fatality, COVID-19 is declared as a pandemic disease by WHO to coordinate scientific and medical efforts to rapidly develop a cure for patients. Currently, there is no appropriate vaccines and antiviral agents are available that can effectively prevent or treat the COVID-19 infection, and mortality is increasing day by day. This situation is putting the whole world under high pressure to develop novel vaccines or drugs against it. On the date, March 17, 2020, the USA reported starting vaccine trial against COVID-19 but it will take more than one year to come in markets. Therefore, effective treatment or control mechanism is needed to prevent Coronavirus [1] . Consequently, to develop new drugs against COVID-19, we have conducted computational screening of compounds from lichen species which may be a natural treasure for many types of pharmacologically active compounds against coronavirus.
