Such a picture can emerge as a natural consequence of previously terminated epidemic process or arise in formerly vaccinated population. To this end, we apply the synchronous cellular automata algorithm studying stationary states and spatial patterning in SI, SIS and SIR models on a square lattice with the fraction p of active sites. A concept of \"safety patterns\" of susceptible agents surrounded by immune individuals naturally arises in a proposed system, which plays an important role in the course of epidemic processes under consideration. Detailed analysis of distribution of such patterns is given, which in turn determine the fraction of infected agents in a stationary state I * (p). Estimates for the threshold values of the basic reproduction number R c 0 as a function of active agents fraction p are obtained as well. In particular, our results allow to predict the optimal fraction of individuals, needed to be vaccinated in advance in order to get the maximal values of unaffected agents in a course of epidemic process with a given curing rate.",

The population is assumed to be homogeneously mixed and contains three main classes -compartments -of individuals: susceptible S (which are healthy and can be infected), infected I (able to transmit the disease via air or physical contact), and removed R (either by recovery and acquiring immunity or by death). The way each particular infection is spread and cured is described by simple differential equations governed by parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3 [3] . The infection rate \u03b2 is dependent on the mechanism of infection transmission (air or direct physical contact) and may in general be tuned by changing the averaged frequency of contacts of individuals (e.g. it is sensitive to seasonal fluctuations [5, 6] or age of individuals [7] ). The curing rate \u03b3 is basically intrinsic for the given disease and its progression. Their ratio R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3 called basic reproductive number is the expected number of secondary cases produced by an infectious individual in a population [5, 8] and is directly measured for a number of diseases.",

Within the frames of SI model, individuals without proper treatment stay infected and infectious throughout their life and remain in contact with the susceptible population. This model matches the behavior of diseases like cytomegalovirus (CMV) or herpes. The SIS model describes the disease with no immunity, where the cured individuals can be infected repeatedly. This model is appropriate for diseases like the common cold (rhinoviruses). It consequently describes the emergence of so-called endemic state of the disease, where starting with R 0 > 1 the infection spreading process continues in time without termination. The SIR model describes the opposite situation when recovered person becomes immune, as in the case of influenza or measles. This mechanism leads to possibility of epidemic outbreak (at R 0 > 1). Further refinements have been done by taking into account the latency period (with its duration dependent on the type of the disease, the dose of infectious agent, the host immune response etc.) by introducing the additional compartment for so-called exposed individuals (E). This leads to so-called SEIS and SEIR models. In particular, SIR and SEIR models have been used to describe and predict epidemic processes of respiratory infections (influenza A, H1N1 etc.) [13, 9, 10, 11, 12] as well as COVID-19 [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] .",

            "text": "Another approach of mathematical modeling of disease spreading is based on discrete lattice models, motivated by cellular automaton implementation of synchronous-update Markovian process on a lattice [28, 29] . In particular, such approach allows to take into account the local characteristics of the system, e.g. to include variable susceptibility for different individuals, and to analyze the patterns (clusters) formation in spreading process [30, 27, 31, 32] . The evolution of system is discrete in time and is governed by a specific update algorithm which takes into account the state of each agent [29, 33, 34, 13] . In particular, the special case when \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 \u03b3 in SIS cellular automata model (with R 0 = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)/\u03b3), can be directly connected to dynamics of the so-called contact process [35, 36] , which exhibits a non-equilibrium phase transition with critical behavior of the universality class of directed percolation [37] . The critical value of creation rate \u03bb c of this model thus is directly related with the threshold value of reproduction number R c 0 in disease spreading process. In contrast to continuous SIS model, in this case the threshold value of reproduction number which separates the non-spreading and endemic states is R c 0 = 1.64874(4) [36] , and thus is larger than the result obtained within homogeneous mixing assumption R c 0 = 1. Corresponding critical value of curing rate \u03b3 c = 0.3775. In the SIR cellular automaton, it was argued [38] that a continuous phase transition between non-spreading and spreading regimes is of the bond percolation universality class. A deep connection between the epidemy spreading and percolation theory is discussed in Ref. [39] .",

On the other hand, it may correspond to the starting point of the \"second wave\" of an epidemic process, when some fraction of population already get removed (or obtained lifelong immunity) after termination of the first wave. The proposed model is related to the contact processes on heterogeneous lattices, where the spreading is restricted only to the fraction p of available sites [41] . There, the threshold value of the reproduction number R c 0 was shown to increase when p decreases. The related problems of contact processes on heterogeneous surfaces in the shape of deterministic fractals like Sierpinski gasket [42, 43, 44, 45] or two-dimensional percolation cluster [43, 46] have also been studied.

            "text": "To extract clusters of different sizes numerically, we apply an algorithm developed by Hoshen and Kopelman [55] . This algorithm is successfully applied in studies of percolation phenomena in disordered environments [56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62] . As the first step of the algorithm, all susceptible sites of the lattice are labeled (numbered in an increasing order). At the second step, for each of the labeled sites (say, for the site with the label n), we check whether its nearest neighbors are also susceptible. If yes, two possibilities appear. If the label of the neighbor is larger than n, we change the label of the neighbor to n. If the label of the neighbor is smaller than n, we change the label of the site n to that of the neighbor. This procedure is applied until no more changes of site labels is needed. As a result, we obtain groups of clusters of susceptible sites of different sizes, where all the sites in a given group have the same label. Our numerical data for n s (p) are given in Fig. 1 in a double logarithmic scale. On the upper panel of Fig. 1 we present results for p values increasing from p = 0.1 up to the percolation threshold. Whereas only small clusters are present in system at small p, the probability to find larger clusters increases with increasing p. The scaling behavior in vicinity of the percolation threshold p \u2243 0.6 is observed, corresponding to a straight line in a log-log plot. One notices the pronounced fluctuations in sizes of large clusters emerging in a system at the threshold point. Also, as noted above, the violation of the scaling law at large s is caused by finite system size. The lower panel of Fig. 1 shows results for p values above the percolation threshold. The probability of observing small clusters is decreasing with increasing p, whereas the fraction of sites in spanning clusters increases. Let us estimate also the \"diversity\" of clusters, i.e. the number of all possible clusters, that can be found on a lattice with given fraction p of susceptible sites. The lattice of size L \u00d7 L contains n s (p) \u00d7 L 2 different clusters of size s, and thus s n s (p) \u00d7 L 2 different clusters of any size. Effective \"diversity\" of clusters per one site n(p) = s n s (p) can be estimated, using available analytical values for n s (p) from Ref. [50] mentioned above. These estimates are compared with our numerical data in Fig. 2 . As expected, n(p) increases with p, when p values are relatively small, and there is a large amount of small clusters. At larger p, small clusters tend to segregate into larger ones, so the number of different clusters decreases. Nice coincidence of analytical results that take into account only small clusters up to s = 17 and numerical data is due to the fact, that though at large p the prevailing number of sites is located in very large clusters, the number of such clusters is very small, so that the main contribution into n(p) is given by numerous small clusters.",

[50] and substituting them into (5) . Resulting curves at several values of i 0 are presented in Fig. 3 . It is important to note the limitation of the analytical estimates, since they do not take into account the contribution of larger clusters. However, at any p there is a larger amount of small clusters than the large ones, as discussed in the previous Section. The \"diversity\" (number of different clusters) n(p) increases with p, until it reaches some critical value, as shown in Fig. 2 . This can help us to understand the general tendency of P safe (p, i 0 ) curves. At fixed i 0 , number of unaffected clusters grows with increasing p, since the number of different clusters grows, and thus the probability for one of them to get infected gets lower. On the other hand, above the threshold value of p the number of various clusters decreases (small clusters start to segregate into larger structures), which makes it easier to infect one of them. Let us compare the analytical estimates with our numerical results for P safe (p, i 0 ), as shown in Fig. 3 . Discrepancy at small i 0 is explained by the fact, that also the larger clusters (despite the small amount of them) which are not taken into account in analytical prediction, with higher probability remain unaffected by infection. At larger i 0 , there is perfect coincidence with analytical prediction. This tells us, that mainly the clusters of small size remain safe in such processes.",

Note that at p < 1 our results could have been compared with those obtained for contact processes on disordered lattices where only fraction p of sites are available for spreading [41] . However, two different types of ensemble averaging are Figure 11 : The threshold value of the reproductive number R c 0 (p) as a function of p for two initial concentrations of infected sites i 0 performed in our work and in Ref. [41] . Whereas we put the fraction i 0 of initially infected sites randomly and apply averaging over all clusters of initially susceptible sites in the systems, in the mentioned study only averaging over the spanning percolation cluster was performed and the process started with single active site on this cluster. As a result, the values for \u03bb c at various p obtained in that study are larger than our corresponding R c 0 (p). Note also, that at p < 1 the results for R c 0 are sensitive to the value of initial concentration i 0 . Plots of Fig. 10 reflect behavior of a finite-size system and therefore manifest both universal and non-universal features. Indeed, for large values of p > p c \u2243 0.592746 [52] there is a non-zero probability to find a spanning cluster of active sites. Therefore, an infinite system possesses at \u03b3 = \u03b3 c (p) a well-defined transition to an endemic state I * (p, \u03b3) = 0 for any non-zero value of i 0 . This is reflected by upper curves in Fig. 10 . On opposite, for p < p c probability to have a macroscopic equilibrium value I * depends of an initial value of i 0 , as shown in Fig.  11 .",

To this end, we have considered three archetypal spreading models, SI, SIS and SIR on structurally-disordered lattices, when only a part of lattice sites (agents) is active and takes part in spreading phenomenon. One of possible interpretations of such a problem statement is infection spreading in population where only a part of individuals is susceptible to disease. The rest is non-sensitive to infection, as may happen after the first wave of epidemic in over and a part of population gets immune. Another interpretation may be that some randomly chosen part of agents gets immune due to the formerly performed vaccination of a part of population. In our analysis, we have considered the case, when the probability of arbitrary chosen lattice site to be susceptible is uniquely determined by their concentration p. In turn, this leads to emergence of different size clusters of active susceptible sites. As it becomes evident from the analysis, spreading process in such \"patchy\" population is characterized by a number of distinctive and sometimes unexpected features. In particular, absence of connetivity between finite-size clusters of susceptible sites causes existence of the so-called \"safety patterns\": if no infected sites fall into such pattern, its state remains unchanged untill the stationary state is reached. Detailed analysis of distribution of the \"safety patterns\" en-abled us to determine the fraction of infected agents in a stationary state I * (p). Subsequently, this lead to the estimates for the threshold value of the basic reproduction number R c 0 as a function of active agents fraction p for different spreading scenarios.",

            "text": "Within the homogeneous mixing hypothesis [3] , consideration of a part of population as being susceptible is trivial and leads to renormalization of an active fraction. However, this is not the case for the lattice model considered here. In this respect it is instructive to compare processes of spreading and ordering on an inhomogeneous lattice. To give an example, inhomogeneities in lattice structure caused by dilution of a magnet by a non-magnetic component, may cause severe impact on a magnetic phase transition [48, 66] . However, for a short-range interaction, the spontaneous magnetization can be non-zero only if the concentration of magnetic sites is above the percolation threshold, p > p perc . No ordering is expected for p < p perc : indeed, in this region only the finite-size clusters of magnetic sites exist, and their contribution to overall magnetization vanishes in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e. As we have shown above, this is not the case for the spreading phenomenon on disordered lattices: there, the spreading is non-trivial for any concentration of active sites p, also at p < p perc . The reason is that although in this region the contribution from each finite-size cluster vanishes, their steady-state value may be non-zero also in the limit N \u2192 \u221e, depending on the basic reproduction number R c 0 . It is obvious that results obtained in our analysis crucially depend on the distribution of susceptible sites. Here, we have considered the simplest case, when correlations in distribution are absent. It may be interesting to re-consider the problem for the case when such correlations are present, taking them from available real-world data. Returning back to the above discussed comparison of spreading and ordering on inhomogeneous lattices, this example may find its counterpart in and impact of long-range-correlated impurities on magnetic phase transitions [67] and scaling [68] . Another work is progress is to apply similar methodology to analyze spreading processes on complex networks [69] .",
