Though a previous study conducted in Nepal identified positive attitudes among medical and nursing students, so far there are no studies assessing the health professional students' readiness toward IPE. The aim of the study was to assess the readiness for IPE among medical and dental students. Methods: The present cross-sectional study explored the readiness of conveniently selected first-year medical and dental students towards IPE and compared readiness among subgroups of respondents. The readiness was assessed through an online survey using the standard Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) during June 2021. The nineteen questions in RIPLS were categorized under four domains: teamwork and collaboration (items 1-9), negative professional identity (items 10-12), positive professional identity (items 13-16), and roles and responsibilities (items 17-19). The individual statements were scored and assessed as per the study objectives. The scores were not normally distributed, so non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal Wallis test) were used. Results: A total of 83 students (69 medical and 14 dental) students responded. The median total score was 75, IQR 6 with the maximum score being 95. The median (IQR) scores for the domains teamwork and collaboration were 38 (IQR 3), negative professional identity 11 (IQR 2), positive professional identity 16 (IQR 3), roles and responsibilities 10 (3). The scores were different between students aged 20 years and below = 37, and above 20 years = 38; (p =< 0.001) in the negative professional identity domain and the total score (p = 0.001). The scores were also different among those with and without previous learning exposure with other discipline students in the same class (p = 0.046). A high median score of 5 was achieved for 8 out of 19 statements in the questionnaire. Conclusion: The findings showed a high level of readiness for IPE among student respondents. Study findings can be considered as a positive factor for implementing IPE sessions.",

            "text": "The holistic nature of health-care demands effective collaboration between various health-care providers. 1 For effective collaboration, there should be respect, trust, and communication between diverse health-care workers. To address this issue, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended interprofessional education (IPE) which offers a platform among students from different health-care professions to appreciate the strengths of various disciplines and be able to develop and improve teamwork and communication. WHO defines IPE as \"an experience that occurs when students from two or more professions learn about, from, and with each other\". 2 IPE prepares the future health professional for using the right care efficiently and utilizing everyone's roles and responsibilities to improve health outcomes. 3 Due to the increase in diversity, complex medical cases and limited health-care budgets, health-care students are expected to work effectively in a team after graduation. 4 To practice interprofessional collaboration, health workers should be oriented and adapted towards working together with multiple health professionals. This culture can be incorporated while they are students by introducing them to the concept of \"learning together\" which helps them understand each other's roles and develop a positive attitude towards each other. Thus, many institutions worldwide have implemented IPE in their curriculum to implant the culture of learning and working together right from the student level. The concept of IPE is well developed in certain countries and health profession students learn various topics together using student research projects, collaborative case presentations, seminars, etc. 5 In the United States (US), IPE has been recognized as a core component of health professions education and accreditors seek evidence of the same as a mandatory requirement. The Health Professions Accreditors Collaborative (HPAC) 6 and National Center for Interprofessional Practice and Education on Guidance on Developing Quality Interprofessional Education for the Health Professions provide detailed guidance on requirements of health programs to incorporate IPE in their curriculum.",

            "text": "Nepal is a lower-middle-income country with low health-care indicators. Healthcare is delivered through publicfunded and privately-run health-care centers. Like the health-care centers, health profession education is also provided by both government and private institutions. 7, 8 Considering the shortage of the health workforce in Nepal, as evident during the COVID-19 pandemic 9 it is important to include health personnel from different fraternities in the health-care team and optimize the existing resources. A study published over a decade ago from Nepal showed a positive attitude among medical and nursing students towards IPE. 10 A similar observation was noted in a neighboring country, India. 11 There exists a hierarchical nature in Asian culture, and medical doctors hold the highest position in the health-care team whereas other health professionals hold less important positions, which can affect IPE and interprofessional collaboration. In a country like Nepal, where the education system is arranged as single health professions disciplines, and where practitioners of a discipline teach students of the same discipline, 12 learning from different professions together becomes a difficult task. This difficulty can be lessened by IPE by its innate nature of learning from students from diverse professions. In Nepal, students who have studied medicine or dentistry on a government scholarship, have to serve in rural areas for two years after graduation. 13 Rural Nepal faces several problems such as lack of access to basic medical care, poorly developed health-care facilities, shortage of essential medicines, migration of health workers, inadequate financing of health-care facilities. 14 In such challenging situations, recent graduates must work together and often lead health-care teams and IPE can serve achieving these goals by fresh graduates. IPE faces challenges for effective implementation in terms of differences in work schedules of different professions, differences in student number, in curricula and teaching approaches but student's attitude towards this new learning approach is considered as the most challenging factor. 14 IPE has a positive impact on students' role regarding interprofessional collaboration. 15 However, IPE can be effective only if health professional students are willing to learn from each other and hence it is crucial to assess the readiness of students toward IPE.",

Readiness for IPE was studied at the University of Kansas Medical Center in the US and the authors observed that an interprofessional educational experience significantly improved scores among medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and students of other health professions. 18 The scores were also studied among students enrolled in medical, veterinary science and dual degree programs at an offshore university in Granada in the Caribbean. 19 The authors did not calculate the total subscale scores and only measured the scores for individual statements.

The degree of agreement of respondents with different statements was measured using the following scale: 1 = strongly disagree with the statement, 2 = disagree, 3 = undecided, 4 = agree and 5 = strongly agree. Upon scoring, the total score attainable by any respondent ranges from 19 to 95. A higher score represents greater readiness for IPE. The statements 10, 11 and 12 were negatively worded. Their scores were reversed while calculating the scores of individual statements. 20 Validity and Internal Consistency of the Tool Though this questionnaire has been used in various studies previously, there have been concerns regarding the validity of the tool. 22, 25 However, the authors decided to use this questionnaire due to its wide use, simplicity, and availability free of cost. It is also worth mentioning that the tool had demonstrated good validity and internal consistency in studies conducted in Iran, 26 and China. 27 Moreover, the tool has been already used successfully in the neighboring country India, with minor modifications. 11 In another research involving general practitioners, nurses and pharmacists, RIPLS yielded a Cronbach alpha value of 0.76. 28 In order to confirm the internal consistency, the reliability was calculated by administering the questionnaire to 10 students and the overall Cronbach alpha value was 0.57. Performing the reliability analysis with a greater number of students may have been better. However, due to the low number of available respondents the authors decided to choose only 10 respondents for the reliability analysis. The authors did not remove any questions from the tool since it could lead to deficiency in measuring the specific domains if items were deleted.",

The negative professional identity score was higher among students below 20 years of age and the total score was also higher in this subgroup. The positive professional identity scores varied according to ethnic groups and so did the total score.

            "text": "The textbook by Maxwell titled \"Teamwork Makes the Dreamwork\" clearly demonstrates that a person cannot achieve one's dream by working all alone by himself/herself. 29 The healthcare settings traditionally were physician dominated with the physician being considered as the team leader and assisted by trained professionals/nonprofessionals supporting the physician. More recently, the concept of patient-centered care has been adopted by health-care practitioners and every professional is given their due importance in managing patients, and the focus is more towards the \"patient\" rather than an individual health-care member. Teamwork in healthcare is expected to improve patient care as mentioned by several researchers. 15, [30] [31] [32] The present study assessed the readiness towards IPE among first year medical and dental students in Nepal where the curriculum is offered as integrated organ system-based system modules. The need for interprofessional collaboration among medical and dental practitioners is well documented in the literature 33 and these professionals are required to collaborate with nurses, pharmacists, laboratory technologists and others to optimize care to their patients. A previous study from Nepal in 2010 conducted among final year medical and third year (four-year course) nursing students demonstrated students to be aware about the concept and importance of IPE. 10 The present study had a different focus, assessing the readiness towards IPE among first year medical and dental students. The findings overall show medical and dental students were aware of the importance of IPE and ready to collaborate with other health professional students as reflected by a total RIPLS score 75 (maximum score 95). Thus, the study findings were similar to other studies reported from Saudi Arabia (mean score 86.8) 34 and Iran (mean score 84.2) 35 where students showed a high readiness for IPE. It is important to notice that the total score in the present study was not influenced by demographic parameters like the Saudi Arabian study wherein gender, and year of study had no association with the scores. 34 The students felt that learning with students from other health disciplines will enable them to be a more effective member of a health and social care team as demonstrated by a high score of 38 out of 45. Similar findings were reported by other researchers wherein student respondents felt teamwork to be important. 36 However, one can clearly note the lacunae in interprofessional collaborative practice in health-care settings. Such a shift in attitude from studentship to practitioners shows that students who initially appreciate other professions may change their perspective during their educational programs. This shift can be further promoted by the existing culture of practice in health-care settings. Interventions may be required to sustain the readiness. In the present research, a high median score of \"5\" was achieved for the statement \"Patients would ultimately benefit if health-care students/professionals worked together\". This is a positive and welcoming attitude that shows students' willingness to participate in IPE. Willingness to learn together can be also considered as a predictive factor for working together in the future. 37 Patient benefits due to professionals' teamwork and collaboration are significant.

It is advisable to incorporate IPE skills in health professions education at a much earlier stage 42 as they are vulnerable to hierarchical work patterns observed from their role models during the later phase of educational programs especially during clinical training. Thus, implementing IPE is feasible and sustainable only if the practice perspectives also incorporate interprofessional collaboration. As shown by the present study results, students felt that shared learning will help them understand their own professional limitations and help them think positively about other health-care professionals. In general, health professionals, mainly physicians, might not perceive the importance of other professionals and prefer to work independently. 43 This barrier can be overcome if these concepts are incorporated earlier in their course so that they can appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each professional and be able to take help from other professionals in the future. Students also felt that respect and trust among students/professionals are needed for small group learning to work. The scores obtained on teamwork and collaboration were not different among subgroups according to age, gender, method of financing and most other characteristics.",

As reported in this research, the negative professional identity domains were influenced by age wherein respondents with age 20 years or less had a slightly higher score further suggesting the importance of an early introduction of IPE modules to have maximum impact. A scoping review of 49 published articles showed age to have an influence on the readiness of IPE. 47 There is a possibility that as age increases the student is exposed more to the hierarchical constructs which can prevent them learning from others. This can be more among medical students as reported in a Korean study conducted among medical, nursing and pharmacy students, wherein nursing students had a high perception about the importance, preference, and effectiveness of IPE compared to a lower score among medical students. 48 For positive professional identity, the median score was 16 (maximum score 20). It was good to know that students felt they will be able to communicate better with patients and other professionals if they learned together. Like the Pakistani study 44 in which 70-80% of respondents showed a positive professional identity, the present study also demonstrated the same. They welcomed the opportunity to work together on small group projects and felt working in groups comprising other profession students helps them clarify the nature of patients' or clients' problems. The medical student focuses on the diagnosis, nursing students on the nursing care, and pharmacy students on pharmacotherapyrelated issues. For roles and responsibilities, the median score was 10 with the maximum score being 15. Student had a high agreement for the statement \"Shared learning before and after qualification will help me become a better team worker\", which is to be welcomed.",

The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic wherein students were mostly attending online sessions and hence may not perceive the importance of collaboration. The sample size of the study is also low limiting its generalizability. The responses were gathered by faculty members who were involved in the academic teaching of the students which could have influenced students. Moreover, this study was conducted among first-year students at the preclinical level and their readiness could change while progressing to subsequent years, potentially influenced by their mentors and role models. The RIPLS used in the study is the initial one developed by Parsell and Bligh in 1999. 24 The revised version by McFadyen et al in 2005 20 may have yielded more reliable results. The internal consistency of the questionnaire was studied only among 10 responses due to the lesser number of available respondents and can be considered a limitation.",

To begin with IPE can be started with students from two health professions and later more professions can be added.

This approach gives an opportunity for everyone to appreciate the strength and expertise of other professions. Since the respondents had a positive attitude towards IPE it would be easier to implement. Research evidence clearly shows IPE training significantly influences students' understanding of collaboration and improves their attitudes towards interprofessional teamwork. 15, 49 To begin with there can be IPE sessions such as collaborative case presentations, seminars, role plays, etc. The universities and councils should make it mandatory to incorporate IPE in health professional curricula.
