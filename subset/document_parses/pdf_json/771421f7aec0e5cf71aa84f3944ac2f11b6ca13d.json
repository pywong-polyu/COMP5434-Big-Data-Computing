            "text": "In the neocortex, functionally distinct areas process specific types of information. Area identity is established by morphogens and transcriptional master regulators, but downstream mechanisms driving area-specific neuronal specification remain unclear. Here, we reveal a role for RNAbinding proteins in defining area-specific cytoarchitecture. Mice lacking Pum2 or overexpressing human TDP-43 show apparent 'motorization' of layers IV and V of primary somatosensory cortex (S1), characterized by dramatic expansion of cells co-expressing Sox5 and Bcl11b/Ctip2, a hallmark of subcerebral projection neurons, at the expense of cells expressing the layer IV neuronal marker Ror\u03b2. Moreover, retrograde labeling experiments with cholera toxin B in Pum2; Emx1-Cre and TDP43 A315T mice revealed a corresponding increase in subcerebral connectivity of these neurons in S1. Intriguingly, other key features of somatosensory area identity are largely preserved, suggesting that Pum2 and TDP-43 may function in a downstream program, rather than controlling area identity per se. Transfection of primary neurons and in utero electroporation (IUE) suggest cell-autonomous and post-mitotic modulation of Sox5, Bcl11b/Ctip2, and Ror\u03b2 levels. Mechanistically, we find that Pum2 and TDP-43 directly interact with and affect the translation of mRNAs encoding Sox5, Bcl11b/ Ctip2, and Ror\u03b2. In contrast, effects on the levels of these mRNAs were not detectable in qRT-PCR or single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization assays, and we also did not detect effects on their splicing or polyadenylation patterns. Our results support the notion that post-transcriptional regulatory programs involving translational regulation and mediated by Pum2 and TDP-43 contribute to elaboration of area-specific neuronal identity and connectivity in the neocortex.

You have convincingly demonstrated translational modulation of Sox5, Bcl11b, and Rorb by the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) Pum2 and TDP-43, with thoughtful experiments supporting cell-autonomous effects of the RBPs on the translational regulation of Bcl11b, Sox5, and Rorb. Your in vivo gain and loss-of-function data in a range of genetically manipulated mouse lines, coupled with in vitro neuronal culture experiments, provide strong evidence for the control that Pum2 and TDP43 exert on these key regulators of neuronal diversification during corticogenesis. Thank you for completing such a deeply informative body of work and for discussing the complexities involved so thoughtfully within your paper.",

Two prominent architectural features of the neocortex are its 'tangential areal' and 'radial laminar' organization. Neocortical areas, defined by Brodmann as the 'organs of the brain,' form the basis for sensory perception and mediate our behavior (Rakic, 1988; Zilles and Amunts, 2010) . The basic plan of the neocortex comprises four primary areas, spatially organized into six horizontal layers, each containing a heterogeneous population of neurons, distinguished by their morphology, connectivity, molecular code, and function (O'Leary and Nakagawa, 2002; Rash and Grove, 2006; Sur and Rubenstein, 2005) . Within each area, the relative number of neuronal subtypes appears to be tuned to correspond with area function. For instance, the primary motor area (M1) has a thick layer V with numerous subcerebral output neurons, but a very thin layer IV for receiving thalamic input. In contrast, the primary somatosensory area (S1) has exactly the opposite organization and is therefore adapted to receive input (Dehay and Kennedy, 2007; Glickfeld et al., 2013; Yamawaki et al., 2014) .",

This areal commitment of newly born projection neurons is followed by laminar fate determination. Opposing molecular programs direct their differentiation into one of the major neuronal subtype identities (Greig et al., 2013; Jabaudon, 2017; Molyneaux et al., 2007) . Most work to date has addressed these two major regulatory schemes separately. Thus, how they interact and how neurons integrate area and subtype identities remains mysterious. Area-specific differences in layer-neuron identity imply exquisite molecular control over cell fate within specific areas. Nevertheless, downstream molecular mechanisms that define area-specific patterns of neuronal identity and connectivity remain poorly understood.",

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are major mediators of post-transcriptional control and can influence different steps of mRNA metabolism, including splicing, stability, translation, and localization (Pilaz and Silver, 2015) . Recent studies have revealed roles for RBPs in many aspects of cortical development that affect cortical cytoarchitecture and suggest potential connections between these effects and both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases (Jung and Lee, 2021; Kanemitsu et al., 2017; Kiebler et al., 2013; Kraushar et al., 2014; La Fata et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2019; Pilaz and Silver, 2015; Sena et al., 2021; Vessey et al., 2012; Zahr et al., 2018) . However, whether RBPs regulate cytoarchitecture area-specifically remains unknown.",

We chose to focus on these specific proteins based on their known and distinct roles in post-transcriptional regulation in the nervous system and because of TDP-43's importance in neurodegenerative diseases that affect cortical neurons (Buratti and Baralle, 2014; Goldstrohm et al., 2018; Lagier-Tourenne et al., 2010; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2019; Vessey et al., 2012; Zahr et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017) . Pum2, a quintessential RBP enriched in the nervous system, is found exclusively in the cytoplasm and dendrites, where it controls post-transcriptional steps of gene expression that take place in these subcellular compartments Vessey et al., 2012; Vessey et al., 2010) . As such, we consider it a particularly interesting neuronal RBP to investigate in control of area-specific cytoarchitecture. Previous work has implicated the combined action of Pum2 and its ortholog Pum1 in many aspects of brain development , and Pum2 has recently been implicated in control of cortical axonogenesis (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2019) . However, areaspecific phenotypes resulting from selective knockout of Pum2 in developing neocortical neurons have not previously been described.",

However, the impact of lower-level, post-mitotic overexpression of TDP-43 on area-specific cytoarchitecture has not previously been examined. TDP-43 is heavily implicated as a key causal factor in the neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] ) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), both of which show some degree of area-selective pathology in the neocortex of both patients and animal models (Taylor et al., 2016) . While diseases are typically classified into either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative, there is long-standing interest in the idea that altered neuronal specification and wiring during development might ultimately contribute to degenerative disease later in life (Greig et al., 2013) .

            "text": "The online version of this article includes the following figure supplement(s) for figure 1: cortical neurons co-expressed NeuN and DAPI, but GFAP was essentially absent from cortices of both mutants and controls. This is consistent with gliogenesis starting at E18.5-P0 in WT animals (Miller and Gauthier, 2007; Sarnat, 1992) and shows that this is not affected in either mutant. The same experiment showed significant hippocampal staining with both NeuN and GFAP, in accordance with earlier gliogenesis in the hippocampus (Figure 1-figure supplement 2d) . Overall, these findings support use of DAPI as a normalization factor in our following analysis. We focused our analysis on the frontal/motor (F/M) and somatosensory cortices, which show characteristic differences in neuronal subtype ratios related to their specialized functions. The frontal motor area F/M is characterized by a thick layer V (Dehay and Kennedy, 2007; Polleux et al., 2001) , in which many cells co-express the molecular determinants of subcerebral projection neurons (SCPNs): Sox5 and Bcl11b (Chen et al., 2008; Kwan et al., 2008; Lai et al., 2008) . In contrast, the primary somatosensory area (S1) has a thick layer IV, in which most cells express Ror\u03b2,a bona fide marker of layer IV stellate cells (Jabaudon et al., 2012; Nakagawa and O'Leary, 2003 Figure 1-figure supplement 4a and b) . In P0 WT coronal sections, we observed dramatic differences in the prospective somatosensory area (pS) compared to the frontal motor area (F/M) when we analyzed key molecular identity determinants that define specific neuronal subtypes (Figure 1figure supplement 4b; Arlotta et al., 2005; Bedogni et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2008; Jabaudon et al., 2012; Kwan et al., 2008; Lai et al., 2008; McKenna et al., 2011) . In both mutants, the number of Sox5 + and Bcl11b + neurons in the upper region of layer V was significantly increased and radially expanded in pS, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the number of Ror\u03b2 + neurons in layer IV (Figure 1, Figure 1-figure supplements 4a and 5a) . DAPI staining revealed no significant differences (Figure 1, Figure 1-figure supplement 5a) , consistent with a potential switch in neuronal identity specification, rather than effects on cell number or migration. Similar effects were not observed in F/M cortex, where neither the number nor the radial distribution of Sox5 + , Bcl11b + , or Tbr1 + neurons in the mutant lines differed from controls and Ror\u03b2 was not expressed, as expected ( Figure 2 , Figure 1 -figure supplements 5b and 6b). Unlike the dramatic effects on layer IV/V in pS, we detected no significant changes in the layer VI neuronal marker Tbr1 or the upper layer marker Cux1 (Nieto et al., 2004) , implying normal neuronal specification in these layers ( Figure 1-figure  supplement 6a ).",

In particular, we wanted to determine whether regulation was due to a specific property of the mutant protein or reflected a gain of function due to overexpression. To this aim, we examined a transgenic line reported to overexpress human Prnp-TARDBP (TDP43) at relatively low levels in the brain, which does not develop symptoms (Arnold et al., 2013) . We first compared expression of the respective transgenic proteins in the two lines. Both hTDP-43 and hTDP-43 A315T were broadly expressed in neocortical areas and layers, including layers IV and V of the pS, in a pattern qualitatively like endogenous TDP-43 ( Figure 1-figure supplement 8a) . Although the distribution of cells expressing transgenic hTDP-43 or hTDP-43 A315T was qualitatively similar across layers in both F/M and pS, the intensity of the expression of the protein variants was different in developing neocortex. Interestingly, layer V neurons expressed higher levels of hTDP-43 A315T , which was confirmed using hTDP-43 and Flag antibodies (Figure 1-figure supplement 8a and b ). In addition, using quantitative immunoblotting, we confirmed overexpression of TDP-43 in the cytoplasmic fraction of neocortical lysates of the TDP43 line and in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of the TDP43 A315T line (Figure 1-figure  supplement 8c ). Consistent with higher intensity for mutant hTDP-43 in immunostaining, quantitative immunoblotting indicated that hTDP-43 A315T protein levels were significantly higher than the hTDP-43 protein levels in cytoplasmic-enriched fractions of neocortex ( Figure 1-figure supplement 8c) .",

Although the magnitude of these phenotypic effects with TDP43 was not as strong as those observed with hTDP-43 A315T , finding them with the TDP43 line demonstrates that they are not line-or mutation-specific. Moreover, since this line does not develop ALS-like symptoms, our observations further suggest that the underlying effect on altered neuronal fate marker expression in the pS is likely due to gain of WT TDP-43 function and that altered cortical architecture in S1 during development per se is not sufficient to result in ALS-like symptoms (see 'Discussion'). To simplify the experimental workflow and analysis for TDP-43, we focused in our following analyses on the TDP43 A315T line since it showed qualitatively identical, but quantitatively stronger, phenotypes relative to WT TDP43 in multiple assays.",

We therefore wondered whether the increase and radial expansion of neurons expressing molecular determinants of SCPNs (Bcl11b and Sox5) would be accompanied by increased SCPN connectivity Chen et al., 2008; Kwan et al., 2008; Lai et al., 2008) . To examine this directly in Pum2 cKO and TDP43 A315T mice, we injected fluorophore-labeled cholera toxin B (CTB) into the pons for retrograde labeling of SCPNs (Conte et al., 2009; Figure 3a) . This revealed significantly increased labeling in layer V and a striking radial expansion in both Pum2 cKO and TDP43 A315T vs. their respective littermate controls (Figure 3b and c) .",

Our analysis showed an increase in the number of Sox5+/Bcl11b+ neurons in both mutants, suggesting that ectopic expression of Sox5 corresponds with that of Bcl11b ( Figure 4a ). We next combined retrograde labeling of SCPN with staining for either Sox5 or Bcl11b 2 to test whether the increased number of SCPN in S1 directly corresponds with the increased number of Sox5+/Bcl11b+ neurons. Our co-immunostaining showed that all retrogradely labeled neurons in controls and mutants co-expressed both Sox5 and Bcl11b (Figure 4b and c) . Thus, the typical area-specific neuronal connectivity of S1 is dramatically altered in both Pum2 cKO and TDP43 A315T , with more SCPNs in layer V and ectopic SCPNs in the position normally occupied by layer IV in S1. This pattern is reminiscent of motor cortex (Armentano et al., 2007; Harb et al., 2016; Tomassy et al., 2010) , and thus, reflects apparent \"motorization\" of layer IV/V in S1.",

Thus, we envisaged two hypotheses to explain apparent motorization of layer IV/V in Pum2 cKO and TDP43 A315T mutant mice. On the one hand, Pum2 and TDP-43 might control area identity, like previously described transcriptional regulators mentioned above. Alternatively, they could control layer IV/V specification and connectivity without affecting area identity per se. To test these hypotheses, we examined two hallmarks of area identity in S1 of Pum2 cKO and TDP43 A315T mice. We first checked the expression pattern of two standard molecular markers of neocortical area identity: Lmo4 (motor) (Huang et al., 2009) and Bhlhb5 (sensory) (Joshi et al., 2008) . Both Pum2 cKO and TDP43 A315T mice showed overall a wild-type pattern of Lmo4 and Bhlhb5 expression (Figure 5a ). Quantitative analysis of the total number of Lmo4 and Bhlhb5 cells normalized to DAPI showed major differences between motor and somatosensory cortex in all genotypes, as expected, suggesting that the pS maintains its areal identity and does not show an F/M identity. On a laminar level, comparison of Lmo4 and Bhlhb5 analysis between controls and mutants (source data related to Figure 5a ) showed no significant changes in Lmo4 and Bhlhb5 in the pS of Pum2 cKO compared to controls, but a significant increase in Lmo4 in bin1 and decrease in Bhlhb5 in bins 3 and 4 in TDP43 A315T . In the case of the motor cortex, an increase in Bhlhb5 was observed in bin 6 of TDP43 A315T while Lmo4 was unaltered in all bins. Pum2 cKO did not show any change for Bhlhb5, but Lmo4 expression was decreased in bins 1 and 4. These differences are not surprising since both Lmo4 and Bhlhb5 regulate area-specific laminar identity (Cederquist Greig et al., 2013; Harb et al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2008) and do not affect our conclusion regarding the unchanged areal identity of pS or F/M. Next, we examined another major hallmark of area identity in S1: the specialized 'barrels' in layer IV. These clusters of glutamatergic interneurons receive somatosensory input from the whiskers via the thalamus and can be visualized by serotonin (5HT) staining of the thalamic presynaptic terminals. In contrast to previously described mutants with motorized somatosensory areas (Armentano et al., 2007; Tomassy et al., 2010) , barrels formed efficiently at the same tangential position and their numbers are not significantly different from controls in S1 of either Pum2 cKO and TDP43 A315T mice (Figure 5b) , supporting a lack of major changes to thalamocortical axonal targeting and patterning in S1. Taken together, these experiments suggest that Pum2 and TDP-43 contribute to elaboration of area-specific cytoarchitecture of layers IV and V without strongly affecting area identity per se.",

For these experiments, we prepared primary neuronal cultures from pS-enriched neocortices at E18.5 and transfected them with plasmids containing either WT TDP43, TDP43 A315T , or EGFP as a control via electroporation before plating. After 2 days in culture, we fixed and stained the cells for both the transfected protein and for endogenous Sox5, Bcl11b, or Ror\u03b2 protein. We identified transfected cells by immunostaining for one of the epitope tags on hTDP-43 or EGFP for control transfections (Figure 6a-c) . Subsequently, we quantified the number of transfected neurons that were also positive for Sox5, Bcl11b, or Ror\u03b2 protein in the three different transfections. This revealed that expression of either WT hTDP-43 or the hTDP-43 A315T mutant in transfected cortical neurons could strongly induce Sox5 and Bcl11b proteins to a similar extent (Figure 6a and b) . Expression of either protein also significantly reduced Ror\u03b2 protein expression ( Figure 6c ). These results are consistent with our observations with transgenic lines and suggest that increased levels of TDP-43, rather than a mutant-specific activity, contribute to altered layer neuron identity determinant expression through a gain-of-function mechanism. In addition, they further imply that TDP-43 overexpression can act cell-autonomously to control layer IV/V identity determinant expression in developing cortical neurons in the pS.",

All electroporated plasmids used the pNeuroD promoter, which drives expression post-mitotically in newly born neurons and is not expressed in progenitors (Guerrier et al., 2009) . We confirmed the efficiency of Pum2 deletion and hTDP-43 overexpression by double staining for GFP to label electroporated neurons and either for Pum2 or hTDP-43 ( Figure 7-figure supplement 1) . As shown in Figure 7 , electroporating plasmids at E13.5, encoding either pNeuroD-Cre in Pum2 fl/fl mice or WT TDP43 or the ALS-derived mutant TDP43 A315T in WT mice, respectively, was sufficient to cell-autonomously drive a switch in expression of Sox5, Bcl11b, and Ror\u03b2 in pS. Post-mitotic deletion of Pum2 ( Figure 7a ) and expression of either WT hTDP-43 or the hTDP-43 A315T mutant ( Figure 7b ) in newly born deep-layer cortical neurons led to robust induction of Sox5 and Bcl11b proteins and reduction of Ror\u03b2 protein expression; accordingly, mutant TDP-43 showed a slightly stronger effect than WT TDP-43. These in vivo results obtained after IUE are strikingly reminiscent of those seen in Pum2 cKO or TDP43 A315T mice ( Figure 1, Figure 1 -figure supplement 5a) or after transfection of pS-enriched primary neurons ( Figure 6 ) and provide another line of experimental evidence that loss of Pum2 and gain of TDP-43 function, respectively, yield these phenotypes.",

Evidence that Pum2 and TDP-43 probably use post-transcriptional mechanisms to regulate layer IV/V neuronal identity determinants We next investigated the molecular mechanisms used by Pum2 and TDP-43 to control area-specific neuronal identity and connectivity in S1. For these studies, we again focused for simplicity on the TDP43 A315T line since it showed quantitatively stronger phenotypes relative to WT TDP43. Because both RBPs are known to post-transcriptionally regulate their target mRNAs, we first analyzed mRNA levels for the previously characterized layer IV/V molecular determinants Sox5, Bcl11b, and Rorb, which we showed in Figure 1 and Figure 1 -figure supplement 9 to have an increased or decreased number of cells positive for these proteins in the neocortex of Pum2 cKO mice and in mice overexpressing either hTDP-43 A315T or WT hTDP-43 protein transgenically. In parallel, we also analyzed mRNA levels for Fezf2, a master regulator of subcerebral identity, which functions upstream of Bcl11b to specify the fate of layer V subcerebral neurons Chen et al., 2008; McKenna et al., 2011; Molyneaux et al., 2005; Rouaux and Arlotta, 2013) . qRT-PCR with RNA obtained from dissected pS-enriched neocortex at P0 indicated no significant differences in steady-state mRNA levels of any of these mRNAs in either Pum2 cKO or TDP43 A315T relative to littermate controls (Figure 8a and b; Table 1 ). This suggests that altered mRNA levels are not likely to be the basis for altered levels of Sox5, Bcl11b, and Ror\u03b2 proteins in S1, although effects within specific cell types might potentially be missed in a pS-wide assay.",

To this end, we performed RNA-specific single-molecule fluorescenct in situ hybridization (smFISH) to enable quantification of mRNA levels within newly born neurons in specific layers of the pS. To enable direct comparison, these experiments were also performed at P0, the time when protein levels and cell fate were strongly altered in the Pum2 cKO and TDP43 transgenic lines. In order to determine whether a change in mRNA levels within specific layer neurons might explain the protein level changes observed by antibody staining in Figure 1 , we hybridized specific antisense probes to Sox5, Bcl11b, Rorb, and Fezf2 mRNAs and analyzed mRNA levels in pS using the same binning approach, but now for the mRNAs (Figure 8c) . Specifically, we counted the number of smFISH dots, which correspond to single mRNAs, in specific regions of the pS for confocal images obtained from each genotype. As shown in Figure 8d , this revealed no significant differences in the levels of Sox5, Bcl11b, or Fezf2 mRNA levels in either mutant relative to controls. In contrast, we observed a paradoxical increase in Rorb mRNA in both genotypes (Figure 8d) , even though Ror\u03b2 protein levels were decreased (Figure 1 ). Taken together, our qRT-PCR and smFISH data do not reveal evidence for transcriptional or stability effects on mRNA levels. Accordingly, such changes may therefore not be the reason for altered Sox5, Bcl11b or Ror\u03b2 protein levels in the pS of Pum2 cKO or TDP43 A315T mutants. .",

As shown in Figure 9 -figure supplement 1a and b, we detected expression of these mRNA variants at different levels in pS at P0 using this approach, consistent with alternative splicing occurring in this tissue. However, we did not observe any significant changes in their levels relative to littermate controls in tissue from either Pum2 cKO or TDP43 A315T mice. To further probe the potential effects on alternative splicing of Sox5 mRNA with an independent approach, we used previously described RT-PCR primer sets ( Table 3 ) that produce different amplicon sizes resolvable by agarose gel electrophoresis depending on alternative splicing (Edwards et al., 2014) . Consistent with qRT-PCR, this approach revealed that mRNA variants previously characterized in non-neuronal tissues are also generated by alternative splicing in developing neocortical pS. However, these splicing patterns were not altered significantly in either Pum2 cKO or TDP43 A315T mice ( Figure 9 -figure supplement 1c).

Strikingly, Rorb mRNA was regulated in exactly the opposite manner, showing a significant shift to a lighter gradient fraction corresponding to approximately one ribosome/mRNA (i.e., monosomes) in TDP43 A315T compared to the percentage of mRNA signal present in a heavier fraction (corresponding to greater than approximately seven ribosomes/mRNA).

Therefore, we performed additional polysome analyses at other stages to gain insight into when during development translational control by Pum2 might be detectable using this assay. At P0, when neurogenesis is complete (Buratti and Baralle, 2014; Chen et al., 2008) and it is technically possible to enrich for the pS by dissection (Figure 9b) , we found evidence for increased ribosome engagement with Sox5 and Bcl11b mRNAs and reduced ribosome density on Rorb mRNA ( Figure 9d) . Conversely, we did not observe an effect on Sox5, Bcl11b, or Rorb mRNA translation at E13.5, the peak birth time for layer V neurons (Greig et al., 2013; Molyneaux et al., 2007) , or at E18.5 (Figure 9 -figure supplement 3b). Taken together, these data support the idea that translational regulation of the mRNAs encoding Sox5, Bcl11b, and Ror\u03b2 proteins by Pum2 may begin after birth and is therefore more likely to occur in post-mitotic neurons, rather than in neuronal progenitors. Consistent with this idea, when we directly examined nascent neurons of Pum2 cKO mice at E13.5, we did not observe increased protein expression of regulators of layer VI and V neuronal identity Sox5, Bcl11b, or Tbr1 ( Figure 9-figure supplement 3c) , providing further evidence that regulation might be post-mitotic, rather than at progenitor level. Because our polysome gradient assay detects changes in translational status independently of mRNA levels and because we did not find any evidence of corresponding effects on mRNA levels, splicing, or polyadenylation of these mRNAs, we conclude that increased translation of Sox5 and Bcl11b mRNAs, together with decreased translation of Rorb mRNA, is likely to be at least one molecular mechanism contributing to the corresponding changes detected at the protein level in developing pS of the Pum2 cKO and TDP43 A315T lines. Taken together, our genetic and biochemical data establish a correlation between effects on the translational status of Sox5, Bcl11b, and Rorb mRNAs and area-specific effects on levels of the encoded proteins in S1.",

Bcl11b and Rorb mRNAs were observed as discrete foci primarily in the cytoplasm, whereas Sox5 mRNA foci were detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 10a and b) . Cytoplasmic mRNA foci overlapped with the diffuse staining seen throughout the cytoplasm for both Pum2 and TDP-43 (Figure 10a and b) . These data demonstrate that both these mRNAs and the RBPs that regulate them are present in the cytoplasm of post-mitotic neurons in developing pS, suggesting that they could potentially interact there in neuronal messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. In addition, our immunoblot analyses in Figure 1 -figure supplement 8 demonstrated increased levels of both hTDP-43 and hTDP-43 A315T proteins in the cytoplasm at P0.

            "text": "To assess whether Pum2 and TDP-43 might directly interact with Sox5, Bcl11b, or Rorb mRNAs, we examined several published genome-wide binding studies for Pum2 (Hafner et al., 2010; Sternburg et al., 2018; Uyhazi et al., 2020) and TDP-43 (Colombrita et al., 2012; Herzog et al., 2020; Kapeli et al., 2016; Narayanan et al., 2012; Polymenidou et al., 2011; Tollervey et al., 2011) . However, as far as we could tell, these mRNAs were not detected in these studies. Presumably, this is because they show a relatively specific temporal and spatial expression pattern in the developing neocortex, whereas most published studies examined cultured cell lines or whole brain/adult material from patients or mice. Interestingly, Bcl11b was detected in a RIP study of TDP-43 targets on E18.5 rat cortical neurons after 14 days in culture (Sephton et al., 2011) . Moreover, iCLIP of Pum2 from neonatal mouse brain revealed interaction of Pum2 with Sox5 mRNA and the same study found that Bcl11b mRNA was deregulated in brains of Pum1/Pum2 double knockouts . Encouraged by these positive observations, but recognizant of the inherent potential for false positives and negatives in genome-wide studies (Williams et al., 2017) , we decided to assess potential interactions ourselves in developing neocortex using a directed approach. To this end, we adapted a directed UV-cross-link immunoprecipitation (UV-CLIP) protocol for neocortex that we used previously with cultured motor neuron-like cells (Neelagandan et al., 2019) . To determine whether Pum2 and endogenous mouse TDP-43 can bind directly to Sox5, Bcl11b, and Rorb mRNAs in developing neocortex, we performed UV-CLIP assays with cytoplasmic lysates from wild-type C57Bl/6J mouse neocortex followed by qRT-PCR. After first verifying enrichment relative to rabbit IgG control immunoprecipitations (IPs), we next measured the percent of input RNA in the IPs, comparing this to 18S rRNA to assess biologically relevant interactions ( Figure 10c) . As a control for cross-linking dependence of detected interactions, we also included an IP from non-UV-treated lysates. Enrichment in the IP that is UV-dependent implies that direct physical interaction between the protein and the RNA tested was occurring in vivo in the neocortex prior to lysis. As expected, we found strong UV-dependent interaction of each RBP with its own mRNA, consistent with previous reports (Ayala et al., 2011; Galgano et al., 2008; Hafner et al., 2010; Polymenidou et al., 2011; Tollervey et al., 2011) . In contrast, Pum2 interacted with TDP-43 mRNA to a much lesser extent, and we did not detect significant interaction of endogenous mouse TDP-43 with Pum2 mRNA, suggesting minimal cross-regulation. Both Pum2 and mouse TDP-43 showed significant interaction with Sox5 and Rorb mRNAs in UV-CLIPs. Pum2 also showed significant cross-linking to Bcl11b mRNA, whereas for TDP-43 this was just above conventional thresholds for statistical significance. We did not see significant interaction of Fezf2 mRNA with Pum2 or Cux1 mRNA with either protein relative to 18S rRNA, consistent with our finding that neither these mRNAs nor the encoded proteins showed altered regulation in developing neocortex in the Pum2 cKO or TDP43 A315T lines. Together with our imaging assays, these directed UV-CLIP experiments support the idea that both Pum2 and TDP-43 can directly interact with specific mRNAs encoding layer IV/V neuronal identity determinants in vivo in the cytoplasm of cells in the developing neocortex. This suggests that direct interaction of Pum2 and TDP-43 with these mRNAs could potentially mediate the post-transcriptional regulatory effects described above (Figure 9 ).",

            "text": "In the neocortex, functionally related neuronal ensembles are grouped into areas specialized for processing certain types of information. Within areas, neuronal subtypes with similar projection patterns and connectivity are grouped into characteristic layers (Rakic, 1988; Rash and Grove, 2006; Zilles and Amunts, 2010) . Although all neocortical areas have a similar six-layer architecture, layer identity and connectivity are sculpted in an area-specific manner to serve its specialized functions (Dehay and Kennedy, 2007) . Genetic approaches in the mouse have identified many proteins that determine neocortical area identity and other proteins that control neuronal sub-specification across the cortex to give rise to the layers (Greig et al., 2013; Jabaudon, 2017; Molyneaux et al., 2007; O'Leary et al., 2007; O'Leary and Nakagawa, 2002; O'Leary and Sahara, 2008) . However, a fundamental, unresolved issue is the nature of the downstream molecular mechanisms that control neuronal subtype specification in an area-specific manner. Previous work addressing this issue has highlighted roles for transcriptional regulators, such as Bcl11a/Ctip1 and Lmo4, in sculpting area-specific cytoarchitecture somatosensory region from P0 brains using millimeter paper to eliminate 1 mm from the rostral end and 1 mm from the caudal end of cortices. Lysates for polysome profiling were made from the remaining part. F/M: frontal/ motor area; pS: prospective somatosensory cortex; A1: primary auditory cortex; V1: primary visual cortex.

Samples in heavier gradient fractions were virtually pooled at analysis to simplify visualization in (d) and in the case of the Bcl11b B1 primer in (c). Levels of specific mRNAs in each fraction were analyzed by qRT-PCR with normalization to an RLuc mRNA spike-in control, which was added in an equal amount to the fractions prior to RNA preparation.

Here, we combined genetic approaches with molecular imaging and in vivo biochemical assays and generated evidence supporting a new role for posttranscriptional regulation by RBPs in elaboration of area-specific cytoarchitecture. Specifically our results reveal cell-autonomous and post-mitotic roles for the RBPs Pum2 and TDP-43 in shaping the specialized neuronal cytoarchitecture of layer IV/V that is a hallmark of the sensory cortical area, S1. Moreover, our biochemical analyses support the possibility that these RBPs achieve this regulation, at least in part, through effects on the translational status of mRNAs encoding key molecular determinants of layer IV/V neuronal identity. The similar neurodevelopmental phenotypes in S1 and common effects on downstream molecular targets (Sox5, Bcl11b, and Ror\u03b2) that we observed upon Pum2 loss of function or hTDP-43/hTDP-43 A315T overexpression suggest mechanistic overlap. Collectively, our data support the notion that these two RBPs directly interact with mRNAs encoding key regulators of layer IV/V neuronal fate to regulate them post-transcriptionally, at least in part through effects on translation.",

            "text": "To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms through which Pum2 and TDP-43 affect the expression of layer IV/V molecular determinants, we examined many different steps of gene expression, including transcription/mRNA stability, isoform diversity generated by splicing and alternative 3\u2032 end processing, as well as translation. However, we only detected significant effects on the distribution of Sox5, Bcl11b, and Rorb mRNAs in sucrose density gradients from pS (Figure 9 ), providing evidence that translation is affected. How strong is the case for translational regulation based on our sucrose density gradient polysome profiling assays? Two big advantages of this assay vs. tagged-ribosome alternatives (Heiman et al., 2008; Sanz et al., 2009 ) are that it is independent of mRNA levels and can reveal shifts of an mRNA between gradient fractions. The latter reflects translational regulation driven by changes in ribosome number/mRNA, rather than just ribosome access. For example, in the case of Rorb, there is a shift of almost half the mRNA from a fraction with approximately seven ribosomes per mRNA to the fraction with approximately one ribosome/mRNA. In our view, this is a fairly strong effect on ribosome density that would be predicted to lead to a significant reduction in protein output from this mRNA, in perfect agreement with and offering a reasonable explanation for the proteinlevel phenotypes in the pS. The effects on Sox5 and Bcl11b mRNAs are arguably more subtle, but this might be expected in a bulk tissue assay. Importantly, although our sucrose gradient assays lack cellular resolution, we see no reason why this should lead to false-positive effects. One caveat is that the shifts we observe may not reflect altered ribosome association since we do not purify ribosomes directly or demonstrate that the complexes are disrupted by puromycin treatment of neocortices prior to cell lysis. However, we think the clear congruence between the effects on mRNAs in the gradients and at the protein level favors the simple interpretation of effects on ribosome density on the mRNAs. On balance, we think our positive results in the gradient polysome profiling assays indicate that translational regulation of these mRNAs by Pum2 and TDP-43 is occurring and could therefore contribute to layer IV/V cytoarchitecture in S1. Future experimental approaches with higher cellular resolution will help to determine whether important contributions from transcriptional or other post-transcriptional mechanisms might have escaped detection in the assays that we performed here.",

Pum2 loss-of-function phenotypes indicate that Pum2 promotes normal layer IV/V cytoarchitecture in S1, whereas phenocopy by TDP-43 gain of function suggests that TDP-43 can oppose this process. While we cannot yet say the relative contribution of translational control to the overall process, this competing regulation is reflected in our polysome gradient data in Figure 9 , which imply that Pum2 normally represses translation of the mRNAs for layer V fate determinants, Sox5 and Bcl11b, whereas TDP-43 activates them. Conversely, Pum2 activates translation of a molecular determinant that can drive layer IV fate: Ror\u03b2, whereas TDP-43 appears to repress Rorb mRNA translation. Importantly, the predicted binding sites for each RBP in the 3\u2032 UTRs of these mRNAs do not overlap for the most part, suggesting that simultaneous binding and competition on the same mRNA molecule would be possible. An interesting line of future experimentation would be to delineate the exact binding sites on the regulated mRNAs for both proteins and dissect the relative contribution they make to regulation in the context of newly born layer IV/V neurons in the pS.",

Bearing this in mind, it would also be interesting to focus on specific cis-elements in the 3\u2032 UTRs of Sox5, Bcl11b, and Rorb mRNAs and their relative contributions to regulation. This would be conceptually similar to work pioneered in Caenorhabditis elegans to dissect the regulatory logic underlying terminal differentiation of specific neuronal classes (Hobert, 2008; Hobert and Kratsios, 2019) , but at a post-transcriptional level. Similar approaches in other systems have provided major insights into the molecular regulatory logic underlying post-transcriptional regulation during oocyte development (Piqu\u00e9 et al., 2008) . Given that all of these mRNAs show diversity in their 3\u2032 UTRs which is likely to impact on stability and translation, it will also be important to examine the relative amounts of specific isoforms in developing layer IV/V neurons and incorporate this information into models of post-transcriptional regulation of layer IV/V neuronal specification in S1. Autoregulation and cross-regulation should also be examined, and interplay with transcriptional regulation will clearly be a key aspect to understand.",

            "text": "Our data also provide further support for the idea that RBPs can function in a 'dual' translational regulatory mode, acting either as activators or repressors depending on mRNA context. Most previous studies examining mRNA-specific translational regulation by Pum2 and TDP-43 have characterized them exclusively as repressors (Cao et al., 2010; Coyne et al., 2014; Majumder et al., 2012; Vessey et al., 2010; Wickens et al., 2002; Zahr et al., 2018) . However, a recent study from our group revealed a translational enhancer function for both hTDP-43 and hTDP-43 A315T in cultured neuronal cells (Neelagandan et al., 2019) . Pumilio was reported to function as a translational repressor in the context where it was originally identified (Lehmann and N\u00fcsslein-Volhard, 1991; Murata and Wharton, 1995) , and this function is clearly conserved among Pumilio family (Puf) proteins (Wickens et al., 2002) . Nevertheless, there is also precedent for translation activation of specific mRNAs by Puf proteins in both Xenopus oocytes (Piqu\u00e9 et al., 2008) and C. elegans (Kaye et al., 2009) . Recent work with shRNA knockdowns in cultured cortical neurons also reported a translational enhancer function for Pum2, although this appeared to be more general (Schieweck et al., 2021) . Other studies have focused on other post-transcriptional effects. For example, simultaneous knockdown of Pum1 and Pum2 in cultured non-neuronal cells affected stability of hundreds of mRNAs (Bohn et al., 2018) , although potential effects on translation were not analyzed in this study. Our results with sucrose density gradient polysome profiling provide in vivo evidence for mRNA-specific translational activator roles for both Pum2 and TDP-43 in the context of mammalian brain development. Moreover, they suggest the possibility of dynamic switching between repressor and activator capabilities during development via mechanisms that remain to be defined.",

In addition, RBPs often work together in co-factor complexes (e.g., Vessey et al., 2012; Zahr et al., 2018) and an unidentified RBP co-factor for area-specific post-transcriptional regulation might be expressed in an area-specific manner. There is also evidence that thalamic innervation can affect the molecular composition of the ribosome itself and that this differentially impacts translation of specific mRNAs in a spatial and temporal manner (Kraushar et al., 2015) . Thus, one can also imagine that area-specific effects on ribosome composition and function might also play a role in RBP regulatory capacity within specific cortical areas. Clearly, future work will be needed to resolve the important issue of how spatial control arises through ubiquitously expressed proteins.",

An unusual feature of the S1 layer IV/V 'motorization' phenotype, which we show in Figures 1 and 3 , is its selective effect on this aspect of area identity. As shown in Figure 5 , other molecular and cytoarchitectural aspects of S1 area identity, such as expression of specific molecular markers and formation of characteristic barrels, appear largely preserved in both Pum2 cKO and TDP43 A315T mutants. In contrast, other mutants, identified to date that lead to a motorized S1, appear to affect all of these aspects of area identity (Alfano and Studer, 2013; Armentano et al., 2007; O'Leary and Nakagawa, 2002; O'Leary and Sahara, 2008; Tomassy et al., 2010) . We interpret the selectivity in Pum2 cKO and TDP43 A315T mutants as evidence that they might function as components of a downstream regulatory module for elaboration of specific aspects of area identity, rather than controlling identity per se. Future work will be necessary to resolve whether Pum2 and TDP-43 function directly downstream of previously described area identity determinants or comprise a parallel pathway. Regardless, our results raise the intriguing possibility that neocortical arealization involves at least two genetically separable components: initial 'area definition' and subsequent 'area elaboration.' This observation suggests a general genetic strategy for identifying downstream elaboration modules of area-specific architectural elements: identifying mutants that selectively affect specific elements of area identity while leaving others intact. Systematic screening for such 'area elaboration mutants' might be one fruitful strategy to elucidate the downstream molecular programs that elaborate area-specific subtype specification and connectivity. While transcriptional regulation will certainly play a crucial role here, our results also support casting a broader 'genetic net' to include potential contributions of post-transcriptional regulation.",

            "text": "The findings we report here also shed light on a fundamental issue in molecular control of cortical development: Which regulatory mechanisms are established in neuronal precursors, and which take place in post-mitotic neurons? A previous study with Pum2-targeting shRNAs delivered by IUE observed translational de-repression of a lower-layer marker, TLE4, in neuronal progenitors (Zahr et al., 2018) . However, several lines of evidence imply that the regulation we observe here with Pum2 cKO mice occurs in post-mitotic neurons. First, regulation is observed at P0, when cortical neurogenesis is complete (Figure 9d ) and binding to these mRNAs is also strong at E18.5 (Figure 10c) . Second, we did not observe any effect on Sox5 or Bcl11b mRNA translation at E13.5, E14.5, or E18.5 (Figure 9-figure supplement 3b) , the peak birth time for layer V and IV neurons and even prenatally, but at P0 when neurogenesis is completed, and neurons are already post-mitotic ( Figure 9d) . Third, our examination of nascent neurons of Pum2 cKO mice at E13.5 did not show increased protein expression of Sox5, Bcl11b, or Tbr1 (Figure 9-figure supplement 3c) . Fourth, we saw apparent neuronal fate changes in pS1 when we performed IUE with either Cre or TDP43 in the pNeuroD context, which is believed to be exclusively expressed in post-mitotic neurons (Guerrier et al., 2009 ). It will be important to verify that conclusions based on Pum2 loss-of-function phenotypes can be rescued by restoring Pum2 protein levels. Nevertheless, our results support the notion that regulation of Sox5, Bcl11b, and Ror\u03b2 protein levels can occur post-mitotically.",

            "text": "One developmental mechanism that seems to be implied by our data is that some newly born S1 neurons that are normally fated to become layer IV neurons might conceivably be re-specified if the levels or activity of Pum2 or TDP-43 would be sufficiently reduced or increased, respectively. Assuming this model is correct, two issues are raised. (1) What might be the underlying molecular basis for this hypothetical and apparently highly selective re-specification capacity? (2) What might be its biological value as a regulatory mechanism? With respect to the first point, we can speculate that these S1 neurons in layer IV, and no other layers, might be inherently predisposed to re-specification by virtue of having related genetic programs to the recently derived layer V neurons. Shared molecular expression patterns in these populations have been described at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels (Ayoub et al., 2011; Poulopoulos et al., 2019; Sadegh et al., 2021) . Interestingly, shared molecular expression signatures extend to the noncoding genome and include microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-128, miR-9, and let-7, which are functionally distinct, yet commonly involved in specifying neurons of layers VI and V and layers IV, III, and II, respectively: they can transiently alter their relative levels of expression to change from stem-cell competence towards a neurogenic stage-specific pattern. Furthermore, these shared miRNAs are able to shift neuron production between earlier-born and later-born fates to generate laminar identity (Shu et al., 2019; Zolboot et al., 2021) . Future work could validate the predictions of this intriguing model and explore potential interplay between transcriptional and post/ transcriptional regulation in this context.",

            "text": "Regarding our data, the most obvious molecular determinants to be relevant here would be Sox5 and Bcl11b, which are expressed in at least a subset of newly born layer IV neurons at a low level. In this model, regulation by Pum2 and TDP-43 can tune production of these transcription factors, with Pum2 normally putting a brake on their synthesis, and TDP-43 having the capacity to amplify the output from lower mRNA levels in these newly born neurons. However, we also see reciprocal effects on Rorb mRNA in the polysome gradients. This could be a consequence or epiphenomenon, but this observation does suggest that it might also contribute to effects on expression. Under normal conditions, Pum2 might activate translation of this mRNA, amplifying the switch to a layer IV fate, whereas increased TDP-43 levels appear able to downregulate Rorb mRNA's translation. In the most extreme version of this model, translational regulation is the key element, with Pum2 and TDP-43 governing a 'translational switch' controlling neuronal fate. A more likely scenario is that other yetto-be-defined post-transcriptional mechanisms (e.g., regulated protein turnover) may play equally or even more important roles. Determining whether this model is correct and defining the relative contribution of translational control vs. other regulatory mechanisms will require new approaches with much higher spatial and temporal resolution to correlate the fate of these specific neuronal populations with specific molecular changes within them, including assays specifically measuring translational effects. From this perspective, we find it extremely encouraging that regulation seems strikingly similar in our IUE assays in vivo and in our pS-enriched primary neuron transfection assays in vitro (compare results in Figures 6 and 7) . To us, this suggests strong potential to recapitulate the core regulatory effects on expression of proteins affecting cell fate and gene expression in an ex vivo system (e.g., slice cultures) that would be amenable to live imaging and enable more rapid experimental manipulations with a wider variety of readouts.",

According to this view, neuronal identity in S1 is not fully hardwired, but somewhat plastic. We can further speculate that optimal setting of network-level parameters in the developing brain might require fine-tuning of neuronal identity between SCPNs in response to evolving input from the hypothalamus and presumably intracortical signaling as well. In other words, neuronal fate for these populations might not yet be locked in, but rather remain plastic until particular later critical periods in cortical development have been completed. In this regard, we find it interesting that the effects we observe are manifested postmitotically and that altered translational regulation is observed at least as late as P0 in the Pum2 cKO, a time when neurogenesis per se is complete, and activity-dependent, wiring-driven effects will play an increasingly important role. One can hypothesize that there is still capacity to tune layerneuron cytoarchitecture in S1 at this stage in response to network activity and that competing regulation by Pum2 and TDP-43 might play a role in re-specification. Experiments to directly examine this possibility can be envisaged. Specifically, we think it would be interesting to integrate electrophysiological approaches with detailed cellular-level analyses of post-transcriptional regulation by Pum2 and TDP-43 and its interplay with transcriptional regulation in this specific developmental context.",

However, the contribution of altered sensory system function to epilepsy remains unclear and seizures reported by others in Pum2 KO mice might very well have a completely different origin. Other behavioral phenotypes associated with loss of Pum protein function in the brain have also been described (Siemen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017) . Although technically challenging, it would clearly be of great interest to examine whether altered wiring of S1 contributes to these behavioral effects and, if so, the underlying physiological basis.",

We found that modest overexpression of a patient-derived mutant allele of TDP-43 during cortical development significantly increases the number of layer V neurons and dramatically alters connectivity of S1, significantly enhancing the number of subcerebral projections (Figures 1 and 3) . Whether these alterations contribute causally to disease remains to be determined; however, they are not sufficient for disease since Pum2 cKO mice show a similar phenotype, but do not develop ALS-like symptoms. Effects on laminar identity in a wild-type TDP43 transgenic line that does not develop ALS symptoms (Figure 1-figure supplement 9 ) also seem to favor the idea that altered specification in S1 is unrelated to ALS/FTD. However, the effects in this asymptomatic line were weaker than those observed in the patient-derived mutant line that develops symptoms (compare Figure 1-figure supplement 9 to Figure 1) . The weaker effect on S1 specification in this line might conceivably be below a threshold needed to contribute to disease, and this might also explain the absence of ALS-like phenotypes in mice lacking Pum2. Future work should therefore examine whether altered connectivity is a general phenomenon of loss of Pum2 or gain of TDP-43 function and whether there might be a correlation between the level of TDP-43 expression and altered wiring. Assuming this proves true, it would then be of great interest to examine how developmental alterations in area-specific connectivity seen in these mice affect signaling in cortical networks and whether this ultimately contributes to degeneration of layer V cortical neurons and their subcerebral targets in spinal cord.",

Mice expressing either hTARDBP (Arnold et al., 2013) or hTARDBP A315T (Wegorzewska et al., 2009) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA; stocks 017907 and 010700, respectively) on a congenic C57Bl/6J background. Non-transgenic littermates were taken as controls. At least three independent litters were used for each analysis. All mouse lines used for experiments were congenic on C57Bl/6J and maintained by backcrossing to this wild-type background. Mouse lines were genotyped using primers in Table 5 . Early morning of the day of the vaginal plug was considered as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).",

Briefly, neurons were resuspended in 100 \u00b5l of nucleofector solution containing 3 \u00b5g of DNA and transferred into the special electroporation cuvette. The transfection program used was O-005. Cells were collected after electroporation in DMEM/FCS and left for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C in the incubator. 0.5 * 10 6 cells were grown on glass coverslips (12 mm diameter, Carl Roth) coated with polyl-lysine in 12-well plates (Sarstedt) in Primary Neuro Basal Medium (Lonza) supplemented with NSF-1, penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics to 1% (v/v) and l-glutamine to 0.5 \u03bcM.

Oxygen was delivered with a flow rate of 0.65 l/min and together with isoflurane were applied via a vaporizer (F\u00f6hr Medical Instruments, Seeheim-Oberbeerbach, Germany). The uterine horns were exposed, and respective plasmids mixed with Fast Green (Sigma) were microinjected into the lateral ventricles of the embryos. Five current pulses (50 ms pulse, 950 ms interval; 32 mV or 35 mV, respectively, for E12/13 or E14 embryos) were delivered across the heads of the embryos. Post surgery, 2-3 drops of meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg body weight) were given orally through soft food for 96 hr.

Quantification of results from UV cross-linking immunoprecipitation (UV-CLIP) from E18.5 cortices (Figure 10c ). Dissociated cells were either crosslinked with UV light or left untreated as a control. Lysates were used for immunoprecipitations with antibodies against TDP-43, Pum2, or control nonspecific IgG. RNA in the input and IP eluate were analyzed by qRT-PCR for Sox5, Bcl11b, Rorb, Fezf2, Cux1, Pum2, Tdp43, and 18S mRNAs. After verifying enrichment relative to IgG controls for UV-treated samples, histograms were generated that represent the fraction of input mRNA co-immunoprecipitated with either Pum2 or TDP-43 in the presence or absence of UV cross-linking. Statistically significant enrichment was evaluated relative to 18S rRNA, which is not known to interact significantly with either protein. Reduced signal in the absence of UV-cross-linking implies an interaction is cross-linking-dependent, that is, direct. Data are represented as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) from n = 3-6 samples.

We also thank Denis Jabaudon (Geneva, Switzerland) for retrograde labeling experiments, many helpful scientific discussions, and the pNeuroD-Cre-IRES-GFP plasmid. We also thank Christoph Janiesch for helpful advice on methods and technical assistance with qRT-PCR assays, Robin Scharrenberg for helpful advice on automated counting and planning of mice for in utero electroporations, Birgit Schwanke, Saskia Siegel, Maike Vo\u00df, Laura Maria Marcelin, Ayob Aleko, and Stine Behrman for technical assistance, and Jane Visvader (WEHI, Melbourne, Australia) and Bennett Novitch (UCLA, Los Angeles, USA) for antibodies. We also thank Laura Frangeul and Sarah Homann for initial help with CTB experiments and Pum2 KO mouse generation, respectively. The vector and ES cells used for Pum2 targeting were generated by the trans-NIH Knock-Out Mouse Project (KOMP) and obtained from the KOMP Repository (https://www.komp.org). NIH grants to Velocigene at Regeneron Inc (U01HG004085) and the CSD Consortium (U01HG004080) funded the generation of gene-targeted ES cells for 8500 genes in the KOMP Program and archived and distributed by the KOMP Repository at UC Davis and CHORI (U42RR024244).
