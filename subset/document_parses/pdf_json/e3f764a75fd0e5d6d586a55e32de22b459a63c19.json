The absence of SARS-CoV-2 in most cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples suggests the involvement of further mechanisms including autoimmunity. We therefore determined whether anti-neuronal or anti-glial autoantibodies are present in eleven consecutive severely ill COVID-19 patients presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms. These included myoclonus, cranial nerve involvement, oculomotor disturbance, delirium, dystonia and epileptic seizures. Most patients showed signs of CSF inflammation and increased levels of neurofilament light chain.",

The high frequency of autoantibodies targeting the brain in the absence of other explanations suggests a causal relationship to clinical symptoms, in particular to hyperexcitability (myoclonus, seizures). While several underlying autoantigens still await identification in future studies, presence of autoantibodies may explain some aspects of multiorgan disease in COVID-19 and can guide immunotherapy in selected cases.",

Clinical findings comprise hyposmia and hypogeusia in mild cases and agitation, diffuse corticospinal tract signs and myoclonus 1, 2 in severe cases of COVID-19. Neurological syndromes in association with SARS-CoV-2 include many autoimmune diseases, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), polyneuritis cranialis, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, epilepsy and myopathy 2, 3 . It is debated whether direct virus invasion into the brain can cause pathology, however, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected only scarcely in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 3 . Thus, cellular or humoral autoimmunity might contribute to neurological symptoms, similar to other viral diseases. Potential mechanisms include molecular mimicry between viral proteins and neuronal autoantigens and delayed stimulation of post-viral autoimmunity similar to NMDA receptor encephalitis following herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE) 4 . We therefore examined the presence of a large panel of antineuronal and anti-glial autoantibodies in serum and CSF of COVID-19 patients with predominant neurological symptoms.",

Although more than one patient each had IgG autoantibodies targeting neuropil, astrocytes or medium-sized blood vessels, it will require larger patient cohorts for linking a given autoantibody pattern to clinical symptoms. We regularly encounter similar immunofluorescence patterns in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, but not in healthy control CSF. As most of these novel autoantigens are yet to be determined, it is challenging to judge whether CSF autoantibodies in COVID-19 are pathogenic or not. The neuropil pattern in some patients suggests binding to surface receptors or ion channels and thus pathogenicity (Fig. 1A, D) , similar to the rapidly growing group of antibody-mediated encephalitides 11 . Likewise, the astrocyte pattern in two patients (Fig. 1E) is reminiscent of the relatively common form of GFAP antibody encephalitis 12 . Other antigens, however, are located intracellularly (Fig. 1F-H) , indicating that the humoral immune response is secondary to other immune mechanisms, including CNS damage from cytotoxic T cells and innate autoimmunity.",

Recent findings suggest that several viral infections can lead to secondary autoimmune encephalitis, including EBV, HHV-6, enterovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis C or HIV infections 14 . Thus, the present findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is no exception to this general principle. The following months will show whether such autoreactivity can cause persisting neurological morbidity even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and remission of COVID-19, in a way reminiscent of the unexplained severe 'encephalitis lethargica' -commonly with postencephalitic parkinsonism -in more than a million patients of the influenza pandemic in 1918 15 . Together, the high frequency of autoantibodies targeting the brain in the absence of other explanations suggests a causal association with clinical symptoms, in particular with hyperexcitability (myoclonus, seizures). While several underlying autoantigens still await identification in future studies, presence of autoantibodies may explain some aspects of multi-organ disease in COVID-19 and guide immunotherapy in selected cases.",
