            "text": "Microbial degradation is considered as an attractive method to eliminate exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), the most toxic mycotoxin that causes great economic losses and brings a serious threat to human and animal health, in food and feed. In this study, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens WF2020, isolated from naturally fermented pickles, could effectively degrade AFB1 ranging from 1 to 8 \u00b5g/ml, and the optimum temperature and pH value were 37-45 \u2022 C and 8.0, respectively. Moreover, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 was considered to be a potential probiotic due to the synthesis of active compounds, absence of virulence genes, susceptibility to various antibiotics, and enhanced lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. Extracellular enzymes or proteins played a major role in AFB1 degradation mediated by B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 into metabolites with low or no mutagenicity and toxicity to C. elegans. AFB1 degradation by the cellfree supernatant was stable up to 70 \u2022 C, with an optimal pH of 8.0, and the cell-free supernatant could still degrade AFB1 by 37.16% after boiling for 20 min. Furthermore, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 caused a slight defect in fungal growth and completely inhibited AFB1 production when co-incubated with Aspergillus flavus. Additionally, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 suppressed the expression of 10 aflatoxin pathway genes and 2 transcription factors (alfR and alfS), suggesting that B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 might inhibit AFB1 synthesis in A. flavus. These results indicate that B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 and/or its extracellular enzymes or proteins have a promising potential to be applied in protecting food and feed from AFB1 contamination.",

Among the 20 types of aflatoxins identified, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic to both humans and livestock and is classified as a group-1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, 1993) .

In the last decade, beneficial microorganisms substantially were found to be capable of reducing AFB1 in contaminated media, including Actinobacteria (e.g., Brachybacterium sp., Rhodococcus, Streptomyces, Nocardia, and Mycobacterium), Bacillus (e.g., Bacillus, Lysinibacillus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus), G-Proteobacteria (e.g., Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Brevundimonas), Ascomycota (e.g., Aspergillus, Alternaria, Neurospora, and Trichoderma), Basidiomycota (e.g., Pleurotus), Zygomycota (e.g., Mucor, Rhizopus, and Absidia), etc. (Verheecke et al., 2016) . However, bacteria have more applications for AFB1 remediation due to some advantages such as more elimination within a shorter time and producing no pigments (Laciakova et al., 2008) , and among them, Bacillus becomes an attractive candidate because of its high tolerance to various environmental stresses and application as a kind of potential probiotics (Yan et al., 2017) . For instance, AFB1 was reduced by 92.1% by Bacillus shackletonii L7 for 72 h (Liang et al., 2017) , 85.61% by Bacillus subtilis UTBSP1 for 96 h (Farzaneh et al., 2012) , 91.5% by Bacillus velezensis DY3108 for 96 h (Shu et al., 2018) , 94.70% by Bacillus licheniformis CFR1 for 72 h (Rao et al., 2016) , and 100% by Bacillus TUBF1 for 72 h (El-Deeb et al., 2013) . Although more and more Bacillus were reported to degrade AFB1, few studies have performed the safety assessment of selected strains. In addition, the narrow working temperature range and unsuitability for the processing environment in AFB1degrading bacteria reported previously also become challenges in commercial applications. Therefore, it is still worth exploring safe bacteria, including Bacillus, which are suitable for food and feed processing and detoxify AFB1 into less toxic metabolites with excellent degradation efficiency and wide temperature ranges in the future.",

Moreover, B. amyloliquefaciens could be a multifunctional microbe and potentially applied in the animal food and feed industry and in functional food processing due to the improvement in the functional, sensory, and shelf life of end products and the production of several enzymes, including G-glutamyl transpeptidase pectinase, xylanase, \u03b2-glucosidase, and amylase, which can hydrolyze complex compounds, including insoluble proteins, carbohydrates, fibers, hemicellulose, and lignans, and then increase the digestion and absorption of nutrients from food and feed and form novel functional and bioactive compounds (WoldemariamYohannes et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021) . In addition, some strains of B. amyloliquefaciens, such as B. amyloliquefaciens UTB2, UNRC52, and UNRCLR, could suppress AFB1 synthesis (Bluma and Etcheverry, 2006; Siahmoshteh et al., 2018) . However, except for B. amyloliquefaciens S8C, Y1-B1, SWUN-TP23, SG-16, and HSP-5 (Xu et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2017; Wang J. et al., 2018; Ali et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021) , little was known about the AFB1 degradation potential of B. amyloliquefaciens as well as the molecular mechanism of the loss in AFB1 production. Here, the AFB1-degrading bacterium in naturally fermented pickles was isolated and identified as B. amyloliquefaciens (WF2020), and the toxicities of the strain and its AFB1 degradation products were also assessed based on sequenced genome information, antibiotic susceptibility, the changes in the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans, and Ames mutagenicity. Moreover, the effects of cultivation conditions on AFB1 degradation mediated by B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 and its active components were investigated by measuring the concentrations of residue AFB1 in media with different temperatures, pH values, and metal ions. Lastly, the effects of B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 on the fungal growth and synthesis of AFB1 were investigated when B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 was co-incubated with A. flavus, a producer of aflatoxins. The results indicated that B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 is a potential probiotic applied in the protection of food and feed from AFB1 contamination.",

The percentage reduction of AFB1 for cell-free supernatant, intracellular extracts, and dead cells is 60. 67, 14.11, and 26.95% at 24 h, 71.01, 19.80, and 27.87% at 48 h, and 71.01, 20.95, and 27 .85% at 72 h (Figure 2A) , respectively.

In the current study, C. elegans was used to evaluate the toxicity of B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 to animals. C. elegans fed on B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 cells showed significantly increased longevity compared with the effect of the laboratoryfeeding bacterium E. coli OP50 cells when used as a food source ( Figure 3B ). Figure 2) , compared with those of AFB1 solution and the fermentation culture of B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020. Firstly, the Ames test was used to assess the mutagenicity of AFB1 degradation products by B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020. Compared with the control group, an approximately twofold increase in the number of revertant CFUs from S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 was observed in the AFB1 group, but there was no significant difference in revertant CFUs of the degradation products and the control group (Figure 3C) , indicating that B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 converted AFB1 to the metabolites with a loss of mutagenicity. Except for mutagenicity, AFB1 decreased the lifespan and increased the mortality rate of C. elegans (Yang et al., 2015) . Therefore, the effect of AFB1 and its degradation products on the lifespan of C. elegans was performed to further evaluate the toxicity of AFB1 degradation products mediated by B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020. The mean lifespan exposed to AFB1 significantly decreased by 25.14% compared with the control, but there was no significant difference in the survival rates of C. elegans exposed to degradation products and the control (Figure 3D) , implying that AFB1 degradation products mediated by B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 were not toxic to the lifespan of C. elegans. These findings demonstrated that B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 degraded AFB1 into metabolites, which exhibited no mutagenicity or toxicity to the lifespan of C. elegans.",

Pairwise interaction on agar plates proved that B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 inhibited the fungal growth of A. flavus ( Figure 5A) . Moreover, the dry weight of the co-incubation culture of B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 and A. flavus was reduced by 6.55% compared with that of A. flavus culture ( Figure 5B) . Additionally, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 completely inhibited AFB1 production when co-incubated with A. flavus in PDB for 2 days (Figure 5C ). Accompanied by a reduction of AFB1 production, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 suppressed the transcriptional expression of 10 aflatoxin pathway genes (aflA, aflB, aflE, aflG, aflH, aflJ, aflK, aflL, aflO, and aflQ) and 2 gene encoding transcription factor aflR and aflS by 22.44-100% but increased the expression of aflM, an aflatoxin pathway gene, by 146.98% ( Figure 5D ). The downregulated expression of 10 aflatoxin pathway genes and 2 transcription factors suggested that AFB1 synthesis might be inhibited by B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020, which might result in reduced AFB1 production caused by B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020.",

            "text": "Generally, B. amyloliquefaciens was considered as a safe and non-toxic producing microbe and could be used for food and pharmaceutical purposes (WoldemariamYohannes et al., 2020). It was also reported that some strains of B. amyloliquefaciens, such as B. amyloliquefaciens UTB2, UNRC52, UNRCLR, S8C, Y1-B1, SWUN-TP23, SG-16, and HSP-5, could inhibit AFB1 synthesis or accelerate AFB1 degradation (Bluma and Etcheverry, 2006; Xu et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2017; Siahmoshteh et al., 2018; Wang J. et al., 2018; Ali et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021) . Here, our results indicated that B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 derived from naturally fermented pickles could act as a potential probiotic to efficiently detoxify AFB1 in a time dependent manner in ranges of 1-8 \u00b5g/ml and inhibit the fungal growth of A. flavus and AFB1 production, as discussed below. Firstly, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 can degrade AFB1 ranging from 1 to 5 \u00b5g/ml by more than 80% after a 72h incubation, which was similar to the 85.50% reduction of AFB1 at the concentration of 0.5 \u00b5g/ml reported in B. amyloliquefaciens SG16 (Wang J. et al., 2018) and was significantly higher than the 42.13 and 58.77% reduction reported in B. amyloliquefaciens SWUN-TP23 and HSP-5, respectively (Xu et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2017) and the 40 and 73.2% reduction of AFB1 at the concentration of 0.5 \u00b5g/ml reported in B. amyloliquefaciens S8C and Y1-B1, respectively (Ali et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021) . Compared with the degradation abilities of AFB1 in the reported Bacillus species, the degradation ability in B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 is similar to that in B. licheniformis BL010 , B. velezensis DY3108 (Shu et al., 2018) , and B. subtilis UTBSP1 (Farzaneh et al., 2012) , higher than that in B. subtilis JSW-1 (Xia et al., 2017) but slightly lower than that in Bacillus sp. TUBF1 (El-Deeb et al., 2013) and B. licheniformis CFR1 (Rao et al., 2016) , suggesting that there were great differences in degradation efficiency from one strain to other. Moreover, AFB1 degradation by B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 was affected by fermentation temperatures, initial pH values, and metal ions. The temperature and initial pH value at the maximum degradation of AFB1 were 45 \u2022 C and pH 8.0, respectively. Mn 2+ , Ca 2+ , Fe 2+ , and Cu 2+ stimulated AFB1 degradation, and Mg 2+ had no effect but Zn 2+ inhibited the degradation. Compared with the reported Bacillus strains, the temperature was higher than the estimates of 30 \u2022 C observed in B. velezensis DY3108 and 37 \u2022 C observed in B. cereus CaG6 (Abdel-Shafi et al., 2018; Shu et al., 2018) , and the pH value was the same to that observed in B. velezensis DY3108 (Shu et al., 2018) . The stimulation induced by Ca 2+ and the inhibition induced by Zn 2+ were in agreement with the results in Myroides odoratimimus 3J2MO, but the stimulation induced by Fe 2+ , and Cu 2+ and unchanged degradation caused by Mg 2+ were opposite to the findings in M. odoratimimus 3J2MO (Mwakinyli et al., 2019) . Meanwhile, the stimulation induced by Mn 2+ was also opposite to that in M. odoratimimus 3J2MO (Mwakinyli et al., 2019) but was in well agreement with that in B. cereus CaG6 (Abdel-Shafi et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Secondly, the removal of mycotoxins by microbes was mainly attributed to adsorption and degradation (Hathout and Aly, 2014) . In B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020, the removal of AFB1 was mainly dependent on degradation, and extracellular proteins or enzymes were the main active ingredient, which was similar to previous studies on AFB1 degradation mediated by Bacillus, such as B. amyloliquefaciens SG16 (Wang J. et al., 2018) , B. licheniformis CFR1 (Rao et al., 2016) , B. subtilis UTBSP1 and JSW-1 (Farzaneh et al., 2012; Xia et al., 2017) , B. velezensis DY3108 (Shu et al., 2018) , and B. shackletonii L7 (Xu et al., 2017) . Moreover, the AFB1 degradation ability of extracellular proteins or enzymes was affected by temperature, the pH value, and metal ions. Increased temperatures may have promoted the bioavailability of organic compounds and facilitated biodegradation (M\u00fcller et al., 1998) . Here, the percentage of AFB1 degradation mediated by the cell-free supernatant increased with the increase of temperature up to 60 \u2022 C where 100% of AFB1 was removed, and the percentage of AFB1 degradation at 70 \u2022 C remained more than 70%. Compared with the reported Bacillus, the thermostability of the cellfree supernatant of B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 was similar to that from B. shackletonii L7 (Xu et al., 2017) and higher than that from B. amyloliquefaciens SG16 (Wang J. et al., 2018) , B. licheniformis CFR1 (Rao et al., 2016) , and B. subtilis UTBSP1 (Farzaneh et al., 2012) , but slightly lower than that of B. velezensis DY3108 (Shu et al., 2018) . Additionally, the cell-free supernatant of B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 could still degrade AFB1 by 37.16% after boiling for 20 min, which was lower than that of B. amyloliquefaciens Y1-B1 (Zhang et al., 2021) . These results demonstrated that extracellular proteins or enzymes were thermostable and could work well within a wide range FIGURE 3 | The safety of B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 and its AFB1 degradation products.

With respect to pH values, the optimal pH value of the cellfree supernatant from B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 was 8.0, which was the same to that of extracellular enzymes from E. coli CG1061 , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 35-3 (Guan et al., 2008) , B. shackletonii L7 (Xu et al., 2017) , and B. velezensis DY3108 (Shu et al., 2018) and was slightly higher than 7.5 reported in B. amyloliquefaciens SG16 (Wang J. et al., 2018) . In addition, the AFB1 degradation ability of the cell-free supernatant from B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 was increased by Mn 2+ , Mg 2+ , Fe 2+ , and Cu 2+ and inhibited by Zn 2+ but was not affected by Ca 2+ , inferring that Mn 2+ , Mg 2+ , Fe 2+ , and Cu 2+ may act as enzyme activators, membrane stabilizers, and help to maintain the structural integrity of proteins. The enhancement of AFB1 degradation ability induced by Cu 2+ and the inhibition of AFB1 degradation caused by Zn 2+ were in agreement with the findings of extracellular enzymes or culture supernatant in B. shackletonii L7 (Xu et al., 2017) , B. licheniformis CFR1 (Rao et al., 2016) , and B. velezensis DY3108 (Shu et al., 2018) . Cu 2+ may take part in the redox reaction in electron transport, transferring an oxygen atom to the AFB1 substrate, and the oxidized AFB1 would then be hydrolyzed into nontoxic products (Xu et al., 2017) . It has been reported that the inhibition of AFB1 degradation by Zn 2+ might be due to the change in enzyme conformation caused by Zn 2+ , which resulted in decreased affinity of AFB1 (D'souza and Brackett, 1998) . The stimulation of AFB1 degradation caused by Mg 2+ was similar to that of B. licheniformis CFR1 (Rao et al., 2016) , but opposite to that of B. amyloliquefaciens SG16 (Wang J. et al., 2018) and B. shackletonii L7 (Xu et al., 2017) .

On one hand, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 could act as a safe and non-toxic producing microbe. Based on the genomic sequencing analysis, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 produces several active compounds such as macrolactin, bacillaene, fengycin, difficidin, bacillibactin, and bacilysin and does not contain virulence genes and any plasmid. Additionally, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 is not an antibiotic-resistant bacterium due to susceptibility to various antibiotics, including tetracycline, penicillin, cefalexin, ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, imipenem, rifampin, erythromycin, and norfloxacin. Moreover, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 significantly enhanced the lifespan of C. elegans by an average of 20.78%, which was slightly lower than that of B. amyloliquefaciens EnB-alf1 isolated from alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) seeds . On the other hand, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 converted AFB1 into metabolites with a loss of mutagenicity and non-toxicity to the lifespan of C. elegans. The loss of mutagenicity was also observed in Aspergillus oryzae MAO103 and MAO104, Aspergillus niger RAF106, B. licheniformis CFR1, and Rhodococcus erythropolis (Alberts et al., 2006; Rao et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2020) . The detoxification of AFB1 was mainly focused on the damage of the AFB1 toxic group of coumarin, which is a carcinogenic group, and bifuran nucleus, which are basic toxic structures . The loss of mutagenicity and the mortality rate of C. elegans suggested that B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 might detoxify AFB1 into non-toxic compounds with the damage of coumarin and/or bifuran nucleus. These findings demonstrated that B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 could act as a probiotic used to degrade AFB1 in food and feed.",

(D) Quantitation of relative transcriptional levels of selected genes associated with AFB1 synthesis in A. flavus via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) after B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 was co-incubated with A. flavus for 2 days in PDB. The line represents the transcriptional levels of genes in control experiments, which were defined as 1. Different lowercase letters in the bars of each group indicate significant differences between treatments (Tukey's test, p < 0.05). Einloft et al., 2021) . The reduction in AFB1 production was similar to that in B. amyloliquefaciens UTB2, B. amyloliquefaciens UNRC52, and B. amyloliquefaciens UNRCLR, but greater than that in B. safensis RF69, Bacillus. sp. RP103, and Bacillus sp. RP242 (Bluma and Etcheverry, 2006; Siahmoshteh et al., 2018; Einloft et al., 2021) . aflA, aflB, alfE, alfG, alfH, alfJ, alfK, alfL, alfO, and alfQ are important aflatoxin pathway genes, which encode two fatty acid synthases, a norsolorinic acid ketoreductase, a P450 monooxygenase, an alcohol dehydrogenase, an esterase, versicolorin B synthase, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, O-methyltransferase B, and a P450 monooxygenase, respectively (Yu, 2012) . alfR, encoding the positive-acting transcription factor, is required for the transcriptional activation of most, if not all, structural genes in the aflatoxin gene cluster, such as aflB, alfE, alfG, alfH, alfJ, alfK, alfL, alfO, and alfQ (Price et al., 2006; Yu, 2012) . alfS, bidirectionally transcribed from aflR, is necessary for aflatoxin formation by regulating several aflatoxin pathway genes, such as alfA and aflB (Yu, 2012) . Therefore, it was speculated that B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 might inhibit AFB1 synthesis by downregulating the expression of aflR, aflS, and several important aflatoxin pathway genes. The reduction in AFB1 production might be attributed to the inhibition of fungal growth and AFB1 synthesis and AFB1 degradation caused by B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020.",

Bacterial growth and AFB1 degradation ability of B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 were also affected by metal ions, including Mg 2+ , Fe 2+ , Cu 2+ , Mn 2+ , Ca 2+ , and Zn 2+ . This degradation was mainly attributed to extracellular proteins or enzymes possessing a wide reaction temperature ranging from 20 to 70 \u2022 C and pH ranging from 5 to 9, which will be helpful for their application in the harsh conditions during food and feed processing. Moreover, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 also could inhibit fungal growth, reduce AFB1 production, and downregulate the expression of several aflatoxin pathway genes and two transcription factors (aflR and aflS) in A. flavus. Therefore, B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020 and/or its enzymes or proteins in the supernatant are new promising agents to protect food and feed from AFB1 contamination. However, the structure of degradation products and the purification of enzymes or proteins merit further investigation to elucidate the mechanisms of AFB1 degradation mediated by B. amyloliquefaciens WF2020, which will be helpful to exploit the probable agents used in food and feed processing to reduce AFB1 contamination.",
