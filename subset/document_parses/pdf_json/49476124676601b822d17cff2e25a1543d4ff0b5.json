            "text": "Background: Predicting postoperative lung function after pneumonectomy is essential. We retrospectively compared postoperative lung function to predicted postoperative lung function based on computed tomography (CT) volumetry and perfusion scintigraphy in patients who underwent pneumonectomy. Methods: Predicted postoperative lung function was calculated based on perfusion scintigraphy and CT volumetry. The predicted function was compared to the postoperative lung function in terms of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), using 4 parameters: FVC, FVC%, FEV 1 , and FEV 1 %. Results: The correlations between postoperative function and predicted function based on CT volumetry were r=0.632 (p=0.003) for FVC% and r=0.728 (p<0.001) for FEV 1 %. The correlations between postoperative function and predicted postoperative function based on perfusion scintigraphy were r=0.654 (p=0.002) for FVC% and r=0.758 (p<0.001) for FEV 1 %. The preoperative Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores were significantly higher in the group in which the gap between postoperative FEV 1 and predicted postoperative FEV 1 analyzed by CT was smaller than the gap analyzed by perfusion scintigraphy (1.2\u00b10.62 vs. 0.4\u00b10.52, p=0.006). Conclusion: This study affirms that CT volumetry can replace perfusion scintigraphy for preoperative evaluation of patients needing pneumonectomy. In particular, it was found to be a better predictor of postoperative lung function for poor-performance patients (i.e., those with high ECOG scores).",

            "text": "With recent advances in medical examinations, diagnostic imaging, targeted chemotherapy, and radiotherapy technology, the number of cases of pneumonectomy is decreasing. However, many patients still undergo pneumonectomy for locally advanced lung cancer or for severe inflammatory lung disease. Pneumonectomy has a high incidence of pulmonary complications due to the rapid and meaningful decrease in lung capacity after surgery, which adversely affects cardiovascular hemodynamics and results in high morbidity and mortality [1] . Therefore, the prediction of postoperative lung function is important for under-standing patients' short-term and long-term course. There are several ways to predict postoperative lung function, including calculation of lung function by counting the residual lobes, calculating residual lung function with perfusion scintigraphy, or using the calculated area obtained by imaging [2] . Perfusion scintigraphy is a relatively accurate method and is widely used. However, for patients in poor condition who cannot undergo preoperative perfusion scintigraphy, it is sometimes necessary to predict the postoperative residual lung function using a different method. A more convenient way to accurately predict postoperative lung function is needed. However, there are few studies on the use of computed tomography (CT) volumetry to pre-dict lung function after lobectomy [3] [4] [5] [6] . In this study, postoperative lung function and predicted postoperative lung function were compared after using perfusion scintigraphy and CT volumetry. The correlation between the 2 methods was analyzed according to several other factors described below.",

Postoperative lung function tests were performed at least 6 months after surgery. All operations were performed through posterolateral thoracotomy. The patient's age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, smoking history, past medical history, respiratory disease, and reason for surgery were identified. The patients had CT scans in the supine position in the deep inspiratory breath-holding state. The images were 3-mm thick and in a 512\u00d7512 matrix. The area of the pleural cavity was calculated from the CT images. To exclude cancerous lesions, fibrotic tissue, atelectasis, and emphysematous areas, the range was set between -600 Hounsfield unit (HU) and -910 HU [6] [7] [8] . The area was calculated for each slice of the CT images (Fig. 1) . The volume of each slice was computed by multiplying the area by the 3-mm thickness. The total lung volume was obtained by integrating all slice volumes. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Yeungnam University Medical Center (IRB approval no., YUMC-2020-05-094-002). The requirement for informed consent from individual patients was omitted since it was to be conducted on existing anonymous data from previous years.",

            "text": "When preparing for lung resection surgery, especially pneumonectomy, predicting pulmonary functional reserve is important in decision-making. There are several ways to predict pulmonary functional reserve including segment counting (the Juhl and Frost formula), the split-lung function test (the Kristersson/Olsen formula), and perfusion scintigraphy. For many years, perfusion scintigraphy has been the gold standard for estimating postoperative lung function. Recently, several trials were conducted using CT volumetry [3] [4] [5] [6] . As technology has advanced, CT volumetric analysis has provided better estimations of predicted postoperative lung function than the methods previously mentioned [3] . The development of programs that work with CT data has facilitated the construction of 3-dimensional (3D) models, allowing resected lung volume to be calculated from the virtual boundaries of the 3D model [6] . Ueda et al. [6] set the Hounsfield unit range to exclude non-functional parts of the lung such as atelectasis, organized lesions, and emphysematous areas. The results were sufficient to replace perfusion scintigraphy. In this study, the CT volumetric analysis was applied to patients who underwent pneumonectomy and the results obtained were . Additionally, preoperative and postoperative ECOG scores were higher in patients whose gap between PPO-PS and POST was larger than the gap between PPO-CT and POST. Our center routinely takes chest CT images while evaluating lung lesions. Eliminating additional scans such as perfusion scintigraphy would help to reduce costs. Patients requiring pneumonectomy are typically in poor condition, with high ECOG scores, and have difficulty undergoing perfusion scintigraphy [9] . Utilizing CT scans to predict postoperative pulmonary function for these patients makes it easier to plan surgery and predict prognosis. CT scans showed higher accuracy in patients with high ECOG scores, thus providing a valuable method to evaluate patients who cannot cooperate with perfusion scintigraphy due to their poor condition. In addition, due to the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the materials required for perfusion scintigraphy are not being imported, limiting the availability of these scans. In such situations, volumetry by CT can be a good substitute.",

Although there were more than 50 patients who underwent pneumonectomy in our center, there was no protocol for perioperative lung function testing. Therefore, we had to exclude approximately 30 patients who did not have either preoperative or postoperative lung function testing. There were several lung function tests that did not include diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and there were some with unreliable DLCO tests. Only 8 patients had both preoperative and postoperative DLCO values, which was too small a number for statistical analysis. The time interval between operation and postoperative lung function testing was inconsistent as well. As a result of this study, new protocols for lung resection operations were developed. Based on this investigation, a follow-up study is also planned for patients who underwent lobectomy.",
