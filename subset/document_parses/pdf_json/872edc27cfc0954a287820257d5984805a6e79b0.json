            "text": "Pathogen-induced cancers account for 15% of human tumors and are a growing concern for endangered wildlife. Fibropapillomatosis is an expanding virally and environmentally coinduced sea turtle tumor epizootic. Chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) is implicated as a causative virus, but its transmission method and specific role in oncogenesis and progression is unclear. We applied environmental (e)DNA-based viral monitoring to assess viral shedding as a direct means of transmission, and the relationship between tumor burden, surgical resection and ChHV5 shedding. To elucidate the abundance and transcriptional status of ChHV5 across early, established, regrowth and internal tumors we conducted genomics and transcriptomics. We determined that ChHV5 is shed into the water column, representing a likely transmission route, and revealed novel temporal shedding dynamics and tumor burden correlations. ChHV5 was more abundant in the water column than in marine leeches. We also revealed that ChHV5 is latent in fibropapillomatosis, including early stage, regrowth and internal tumors; higher viral transcription is not indicative of poor patient outcome, and high ChHV5 loads predominantly arise from latent virus. These results expand our knowledge of the cellular and shedding dynamics of ChHV5 and can provide insights into temporal transmission dynamics and viral oncogenesis not readily investigable in tumors of terrestrial species.",

            "text": "S ea turtle fibropapillomatosis (FP) is an epizootic (animal epidemic) tumor disease, affecting endangered sea turtles worldwide [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The disease is characterized by the formation of cutaneous and internal fibro-epithelial tumors, which can lead to debilitation and death. Fibropapillomatosis of sea turtles continues to spread geographically, and is now present in every major ocean basin in which green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) are endemic (www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/82638) 3, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Rates of FP are also increasing in many long-term affected locations, with incidence of the disease being the highest in near-shore habitats 3, 9, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The FP-afflicted turtles studied here were found stranded in northeastern Florida. Fibropapillomatosis only began affecting C. mydas in northern Florida in the last decade, despite being present in areas of southern Florida since at least the early 1900s 5, 12, 19, [22] [23] [24] . Concurrent with geographic expansion of the disease, incidence of FP in stranded C. mydas across the state of Florida has risen from 13.3% in 2005 to 42% in 2016 5, 9, 17, 19 .",

            "text": "Of all sea turtle species and life-stages, juvenile green sea turtles are most severely afflicted by FP. Long-lived reptiles have normally robust anti-cancer defenses, and with the exception of FP, reports of neoplasia in sea turtles are rare [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . However, nearshore environmental exposures likely impair tumor suppressor mechanisms in sea turtles, thereby enabling virally-induced tumorigenesis 3, 30 . While some environmental co-factors, such as eutrophication have been studied, their role in the pathogenesis of FP remains experimentally unconfirmed. It is possible that environmental exposures induce immunosuppression in sea turtles, thereby enabling viral loads to increase to the point of crossing an oncogenic threshold, similar to a number of human virally-induced cancers 3, 5, [31] [32] [33] . However, the pathogenesis of FP remains elusive. A chelonian-specific alphaherpesvirus (chelonid herpesvirus 5, ChHV5) has been implicated as a cause. However, Koch's postulates to confirm its causative role have yet to be fulfilled, because ChHV5 is extremely difficult to isolate and propagate in the laboratory 3, 5, [34] [35] [36] [37] . Similarly, despite advances in FP tumor research 1, 3, 5, 30, 31, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] , many open questions remain regarding the role of ChHV5 in driving FP tumorigenesis, including whether it is a cause of the disease or an opportunistic pathogen, exploiting immunocompromised tumor-afflicted turtles 3, 5, 31 . Interestingly, levels of ChHV5 (ChHV5 gB and UL30 gene DNA detected by qPCR, and ChHV5 glycoprotein H peptides detected by ELISA) in clinically healthy turtles are closer to that of FP tumors, than in non-tumored tissue of FP-afflicted turtles 34, 47 . It is also unclear whether ChHV5 is lytic or latent in FP tumors and the occurrence of viral shedding and transmission is not well understood 3, 5, [48] [49] [50] [51] .",

We postulated that ChHV5 might be latent in established tumors, but more active during crucial early stage tumor initiation events, akin to the 'hit and run' hypothesis of viral oncogenesis 5 . To investigate this hypothesis, we employed deep sequencing-based transcriptomics and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to determine the viral load and transcriptional status of ChHV5 across a variety of FP tumor stages and presentations: new external, established external, post-surgical regrowth external, internal lung, internal urinary bladder, and internal kidney tumors. Analysis of the host aspects of the current study's transcriptomic and genomic data are explored in a companion paper 38 . Here we investigate viral dynamics during FP tumor growth, post-surgical recurrence, and correlations between ChHV5 viral load and ChHV5 gene expression with patient rehabilitation outcome to identify characteristics relevant to disease severity and fate of turtles afflicted with FP. Furthermore, we investigated potential routes of transmission, primarily horizontal transmission by direct shedding of ChHV5 into the water column, but also confirming the potential role of intermediary vectors and raising the possibility of vertical transmission. Fibropapillomatosis genomics 29, 31 and eDNA-based pathogen monitoring can reveal the precise mechanisms through which the virus is transmitted and the role of ChHV5 in host cell transformation and tumor progression. Such research will provide insights into this wildlife epizootic and reveal how ChHV5 can rapidly induce novel cancer incidence on an epidemic scale. Such information is vital to enable improved management, treatment, and mitigation strategies to be developed to combat this sea turtle conservationrelevant disease epizootic.",

In line with previous studies 51 , we confirmed that ChHV5 could specifically be detected from DNA extracted from leeches that had fed on FPafflicted turtles (Fig. 1c-e) . All leech pooled samples removed from FP tumors tested positive for ChHV5 DNA (Fig. 1c, d) , while half of the leeches removed from non-tumor locations of FP-afflicted animals were ChHV5 positive (Fig. 1c) . Of 30 leeches from FP tumors assessed individually (one DNA extraction per whole leech), 90% were positive for ChHV5 (Fig. 1e) .

Another potential mode of transmission is direct ChHV5 shedding into the environment. Direct viral shedding as a route of transmission is thus far only supported by indirect evidence, i.e., cloacal swabs, urine, ocular, oral, and nasal secretions 49, 50, 64 , viral inclusion bodies near the surface of external tumors 48 and the elevated levels of ChHV5 detected in bladder tissue (see below). Direct detection of ChHV5 in the water column is lacking. Therefore, we employed environmental DNA (eDNA)-based approaches coupled with qPCR and next-generation sequencing to detect ChHV5 in patient tank water. Such novel approaches can aid in answering previously intractable questions about direct ChHV5 transmission, such as presence, abundance, and persistence in the marine environment. First, we determined that the presence of ChHV5 could be readily detected in eDNA extracted from tank sea water, using either an established 37 UL30 qPCR assay (Fig. 2a ) or next-generation sequencing (see WGS section below). ChHV5 was detectible not only from patient tank water, but also from sand after a turtle lay on it for 30 min while awaiting treatment procedures (Fig. 2b) suggesting that the tumors are the primary source of environmental ChHV5 (either through direct tumor shedding, or migration of virus throughout the body and excretion in bodily fluids). The level of ChHV5 in tank water of patients with high tumor burdens was higher than that seen in leeches feeding on FP tumors (Figs. 1c-e, 2a,c-e). Additionally, the quantity of ChHV5 eDNA in tank water was positively correlated with the C. mydas (green turtle) eDNA level (Pearson correlation coefficient test, R 2 = 0.66, p = 0.00001, df = 19), as detected by a custom C. mydas 16S rRNA DNA assay (Fig. 2f) . ChHV5 eDNA was also detectible in the saltwater fishpond (approximate size 661,000 liters, Supplementary Fig. 1a ) which receives the filtered outflow sea water from our patient tanks (Supplementary Table 1) , highlighting ChHV5's potential persistence in aquatic environments.",

In fact, levels of ChHV5 transcripts were only marginally (and not significantly) higher in FP tumors than they were in non-tumor tissue controls (Fig. 3a) . The only significant difference found in the level of viral RNA transcripts between any of the groups was between regrowth and established growth external tumors (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn-Bonferroni post hoc, p = 0.013). Furthermore, we detected no switch to active (lytic) viral transcription in internal tumors (Fig. 3a) . Supporting the paucity of lytically replicating virus, no inclusion bodies were detected in either internal or external tumors (Supplementary Table 2 ) by hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 3b) . Together this suggests that the role of lytic ChHV5 in FP is minimal and that if ChHV5 is contributing to FP oncogenesis, it is either (i) occurring transiently, during very early tumorigenesis (before visible tumor appears), or (ii) through the expression of ChHV5 miRNAs (not assessed here), or (iii) that it is the latently expressed ChHV5 transcripts that are driving oncogenesis. We therefore next examined the individual gene level transcripts to determine which ChHV5 genes were transcriptionally active in FP tumors (albeit at relatively low levels). Samples were grouped into four types: non- Supplementary Fig. 1b) . Given the paucity of lytic ChHV5, these 22 ChHV5 genes represent the most likely viral drivers able to contribute to FP initiation and ongoing tumor development and growth; therefore they warrant further functional investigation.",

Twenty-one genes were significantly differentially expressed between tumors from poor outcome (died or euthanized) and good outcome patients, all of which were upregulated in poor outcome tumors (Table 1) . However, on closer examination of the poor outcome tumors, it was predominantly viral expression in internal tumors rather than external tumors that was responsible for this differential expression (Table 1 and Fig. 4b, c) . Interestingly, the four ChHV5 genes which are atypical of alphaherpesvirus, F-lec1, F-lec2, F-sial, and F-M04 65 , were more highly expressed in internal tumors (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2b ). These four genes are postulated to play a role in viral immune evasion and viral pathogenesis 65 . Of all of the differentially expressed ChHV5 genes, both genomic copies of the latency-associated F-LANA gene showed the largest fold increase in expression in internal tumors (Table 1 and Fig. 4b) . 1 Leech ChHV5 detection. a Green sea turtle inguinal external FP tumor, infested with leeches.

By not conducting any viral enrichment steps, the resulting read numbers give a more reliable indication of the relative abundance of viral DNA compared with host DNA (all within a single sample/library). Viral DNA sequencing reads in the FP tumors covered a broad range (Fig. 5a) . Interestingly, the tank water eDNA had a higher viral load than plasma and non-tumor tissue from FP-afflicted turtles ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 2c ).

As expected, WGS reads were dispersed across the entire ChHV5 genome ( Supplementary Fig. 3a) , not being restricted to ChHV5's transcriptionally active regions ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) . This confirms that the limited transcriptional signature is not due to a sequencing artifact. Together, the ChHV5 genome-level and genelevel TPM analysis highlight the marked difference in reads between viral DNA presence and viral RNA transcription in FP tumors. Conversely, the range of viral DNA and viral RNA within nontumor tissue was largely overlapping suggesting that the ChHV5 present in non-tumor samples may be more likely to be transcriptionally active (Table 2 and Figs. 3a, 5a).",

We used our unbiased WGS to assess whether green turtle or loggerhead specific papillomaviruses (CmPV1 and CcPV1) were present in any of our samples, as although present in sea turtles CmPV1 and CcPV1 have not been strongly associated with FP tumors [66] [67] [68] . No CmPV1 reads were detected in any tumor samples, skin samples or plasma samples of FPafflicted turtles (Supplementary Table 3 ). Furthermore, unlike ChHV5 (Fig. 3a) , no shed CmPV1 or CcPV1 was detected in tank water of pooled FP-afflicted juvenile green and FP non-afflicted loggerhead hatchlings (Supplementary Table 3 ). From all 38 sequenced samples only two reads were detected for CcPV1, both in C. mydas kidney FP tumors from different individuals (Supplementary Table 3 ). This might be an artifact as the mate pair of these reads (paired-end sequencing), did not align to CcPV1. These two kidney tumors had 75 and 3,127 ChHV5 RPTM respectively (Table 2 and Supplementary Data 1), but only 0.037 and 0.014 CcPV1 RPTM respectively (Supplementary  Table 3 ). Therefore, our WGS provides no evidence for a correlation between the presence of CmPV1 or CcPV1 and FP tumors, from green turtles from Floridian waters. consequences of infections in animal populations, which are more susceptible to disease in the absence of healthy habitats and natural population sizes and ranges with their associated robust genetic variation 29 . Anthropogenic activities are likely increasing cancer rates in wild populations 75, 76 , with increased incidence and range of sea turtle fibropapillomatosis appearing to be a direct result of human activities impairing the ability of inshore juvenile sea turtles to combat the ChHV5 virus 3,31,77 . However, studies establishing functional links between environmental contaminants and fibropapillomatosis tumorigenesis, especially across large spatial scales, are required. It is thought that environmental changes are key to conferring oncogenicity upon ChHV5, potentially through compromising the immune system of sea turtles 3,10,78,79 . While hosts attempt to mount an immune response 30 tumors still develop in a large proportion of individuals 3, 5, 9 . The causal link between ChHV5 and fibropapillomatosis also requires further scrutiny. As revealed here, either the role of ChHV5 in driving FP tumor formation and progression is restricted to extremely early tumorigenesis events, or it is driven by latently expressed genes, or is overstated.",

            "text": "Similar to smaller cohorts of external FP tumors assessed by RNA-seq 5,81 , we found no evidence to support widespread lytic ChHV5 viral replication within any of the tumor types profiled here. This includes early stage new growth tumors, suggesting that the viral 'hit and run' hypothesis 82 of oncogenic transformation does not apply to fibropapillomatosis tumors, or that if it does it must be extremely temporally restricted, likely before a visible tumor develops. Furthermore, our results reveal that if ChHV5 is responsible for inducing de novo tumor formation in internal organs, then the limited expression and load of ChHV5 in some internal tumors is highly irregular, particularly in kidney and liver tumors. That even tumor samples with high ChHV5 loads (DNA-level) have only low ChHV5 gene expression (RNA-level), suggests that rapid proliferation of host tumor cells infected with latent virus is the primary driver of the high viral loads sometimes observed in FP tumors. Fibropapillomatosis cell proliferation can be rapid and tumors can double in size in less than two weeks 1 . Similarly, the paucity of elevated levels of viral transcripts across all tumor samples, in addition to the lack of inclusion bodies, suggests that lytic virus may not be driving the establishment of numerous primary tumors within the same individual. The presence of inclusion bodies in FP tumors is relatively rare. In one study, from the analysis of 381 FP tumors from 17 individuals, epidermal intranuclear inclusion bodies were only identified in 35% of FP-afflicted individuals, and even within that subset of individuals, only 7% of their tumors contained at least one inclusion body 48 . Similarly, in situ hybridization of the ChHV5 UL30 gene only detected expressed ChHV5 transcripts in three out of 25 tumors 83 . Even within those three tumors, there was only a low level of expression which was spatially restricted 83 . Processes occurring in the dermis (especially relating to fibroblasts) may also influence the development of tumors and host-viral interactions, as FP tumors involve changes to both epidermal and dermal cells. Our whole-genome viral transcriptomics confirms that lytic ChHV5 gene expression is lacking in both external and internal tumors. Even while in their latent stage oncogenic viruses can manipulate host cell signaling and contribute to oncogenic transformation and tumor development [84] [85] [86] .",

Oncogenic viruses can use latency as an immune avoidance strategy, with bouts of temporally and spatially restricted lytic activity helping to prevent a largescale immune response. This feature of oncogenic viruses may help to explain why ChHV5 is predominantly latent in FP tumors, and why lytic viral replication is so spatially restricted 48, 83 . In this context, FP tumors with higher ChHV5 expression levels may be more prone to inducing immune responses, leading to improved patient outcomes. Further supporting this hypothesis, we recently showed that, in the same Fig. 5 Variation in ChHV5 DNA load across tumor and non-tumor tissue types, as assessed by whole-genome sequencing and qPCR. a ChHV5 abundance (WGS DNA-based) across each sample type.

Fibropapilloma tumors are associated with papillomaviruses in other domesticated and wild species [87] [88] [89] , as well as a variety of human cancers, including cervical, and head and neck cancer 90, 91 . However, it remains to be resolved whether papillomaviruses have any correlation to FP tumor occurrence. Using qPCR, CmPV1 was recently detected in skin tumor samples (<10 tumors) of Australian C. mydas, while cloacal swabs, blood, and normal skin samples from the same animals tested negative 68 . However, when we assessed for the presence of PV1 by WGS we detected no CmPV1 in tumor samples, skin samples, blood plasma or tank water. While a greater number of individuals and locations should be assessed, we found no evidence for PV1 as a causative or even correlative factor to sea turtle fibropapillomatosis, despite the prominent role of papilloma viruses in papilloma tumors of other species [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] . Given their small genome and ability to induce oncogenesis at lower loads than herpesviruses, targeted qPCR approaches should also be employed, to confirm whether papillomaviruses are absent from FP tumors 68, 92 . Recently, such approaches detected PV1 in 47% of FP tumors in Australia 93 .",

Although it should be noted that ChHV5 genome coverage was not as complete in these hatchling samples as for tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. 4a ). ChHV5 DNA was also detected at low levels, by qPCR, in a pre-hatchling that died prior to successfully hatching. A key objective should be to confirm whether vertical transmission of the virus occurs from mother to offspring. This hypothesis conflicts with the predominant hypothesis that ChHV5 infection is acquired only after juvenile turtles recruit to nearshore habitats 46, 94 . If widespread vertical transmission is confirmed, the relative contribution of vertical versus horizontal transmission needs to be determined. If hatchlings are already infected with ChHV5 (vertical transmission), this has serious implications for any potential populationlevel vaccination-based mitigation strategies. On-beach (immediate nest emergence 95 ) sampling and qPCR and sequencing-based ChHV5 detection should be conducted to confirm this finding and to determine the prevalence of ChHV5 infected hatchlings. Non-invasive sampling of sand from nest chambers may also reveal whether ChHV5 is present, given that we could detect ChHV5 from sand samples exposed to FPafflicted patients.",

This difference likely arises from relatively rapid testing (3 days to 7 months) in a rehabilitation setting, as opposed to the historical frozen sample set that was used for the Rittenburg et al. 2021 study 96 . Leeches likely only represent a mechanical vector of ChHV5 transmission, as studies to determine whether leeches function as a true vector with ChHV5 replicating within leeches (as an intermediary host) have not yet been conducted. While a broad range of ChHV5 quantity was detected across leech and patient tank water samples, ChHV5 tended to be more abundant in the water column than in marine leeches.

Environmental DNA approaches have been shown to detect aquatic pathogens earlier than traditional methods and provide advanced warning of infection and mass mortality events 57, 63 . Our eDNA-based detection of ChHV5 in sea water is particularly significant given that, unlike more immediate acting pathogens, for virally-induced cancers there is generally a long lag time (years or decades) between infection and tumor formation [97] [98] [99] . It has previously been asserted that only a small percentage of FP tumors shed virus (7% of tumors in 35% of individuals) 48 . However, our eDNA-based monitoring of viral shedding demonstrated that ChHV5 could be detected even in the tanks of turtles with low tumor burdens and that ChHV5 shedding positively correlated to tumor burden. Other disease-associated green turtle herpesviruses have been shown to remain infective after exposure to sea water, though this has not yet been assessed for ChHV5 100 . Our findings regarding the predominance of latent ChHV5 within fibropapillomatosis would suggest that not all viral DNA in patient tank water may derive from lytically produced virus. Future studies should determine what proportion of detectible ChHV5 eDNA in patient tanks is derived from viral DNA within host cells compared with free viable infective virus. That urinary bladder samples had high viral loads has potential implications for the spread of ChHV5, as urine is another potential source of ChHV5 release from the body and transmission 49, 50 .",

This unique tool to dynamically track environmental viral shedding in response to disease progression and clinical interventions such as surgery and drug treatment will greatly enhance our ability to address fundamental questions relating to this disease, as well as to design evidence-based rational management strategies (e.g., containment/isolation policies).

Taken together, our results provide transcriptome and genome-level profiling of ChHV5 across external, new growth, established, post-surgical regrowth, and internal visceral tumors (Table 3) . They reveal the paucity of lytic ChHV5 replication within tumors, even those harboring high viral loads. High viral loads, where they do occur, likely represent latent virus being produced as infected tumor cells rapidly proliferate. They also revealed that a number of tumors, particularly some internal types, have extremely limited viral loads (DNA-based assessment), calling into question the role of ChHV5 in the establishment and growth of these tumors. The application of novel eDNA-based pathogen monitoring revealed that ChHV5 is shed into the water column, and quantification of ChHV5 eDNA revealed that the level of virus in patient tank water correlates to patient tumor burden. ChHV5 shedding is prevented upon excision of fibropapillomatosis tumors. Improved understanding of the oncogenic role of ChHV5 and its transmission can inform population management and clinical management strategies, including informing biosecurity and quarantine practices.",

Fibropapillomatosis-afflicted juvenile C. mydas tissue DNA-seq samples were sequenced in two batches, 6 initial samples on a HiSeq 3000, and 18 NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) samples. For HiSeq 3000 samples, DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Cat No. 69504). Libraries were generated using Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Prep kit including fragmentation with a Covaris S220 sonic disruptor. Size and purity of the libraries were analyzed on a Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent). Libraries were sequenced as paired-end reads with a read length of 100 bp on an Illumina HiSeq 3000. Six whole genomic DNA samples, comprising three FP tumor samples and patientmatched non-tumor samples from two juvenile green turtles which had also stranded in Northern Florida, were used for sequencing. These samples were further categorized by tissue type, with one tumor and patient-matched healthy tissue sample each coming from an external, kidney, and lung tissue source (see Supplementary Data 1). For NovaSeq 6000 samples (Supplementary Data 1), the 18 DNA samples were fragmented on a Covaris S220 sonicator, to generate~300 bp fragments. Fragmentation was followed by AMPure clean-up (0.9:1.0 beads:sample ratio). The cleaned-fragmented material (50 ng) was used as input for library construction. Sequencing libraries were constructed using the NEBNext UltraTMII DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Cat# E7645S), according to the manufacturer's protocol. A set amount of 10-20 ng of sample was used to barcode and generate full adapter-ligated libraries through PCR. PCR was done for only 6-7 cycles of amplification in order to minimize duplicate reads. Barcoding was done using the indexing reagents provided in the NEBNext Unique Dual Index Oligos kit (Cat# E6440S). The final libraries were quantified by fluorescence (QUBIT, ThermoFisher), and sized on the Agilent TapeStation (DNA5000 Screen Tape). A yield of 50-60 ng of library was obtained of an average size ranging from 460 to 600 bp. Libraries were normalized and pooled equimolarly. This step was followed by treatment with the \"Free Adapter Blocking Reagent\" protocol (FAB, Cat# 20024145) in order to minimize the presence of adaptor-dimers and index hopping rates. The library pool was diluted to 2.5 nM and sequenced (one S4 lane, 2 \u00d7 150 cycles [paired-end]) according to Illumina NovaSeq6000 sequencing protocol, using 180 pM loading concentration and 1% PhiX spike-in control. Approximately 10 billion paired-end reads were obtained for the entire run (Q30% > = 80%; Cluster PF = 70%),~8.7 billion paired-end reads were generated (NovaSeq 6000) for the 18 C. mydas samples, with the remainder of the reads relating to samples from other projects.",

The presence of ulceration of the epidermis and associated heterophilic (granulocytic) inflammation also was noted.

For RNA-Seq samples, total RNA was extracted using either an RNeasy Fibrous Tissue kit (Qiagen, Cat No. 74704) or RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen, Cat No. 74134) with columnbased genomic DNA removal, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ninety RNA samples, comprising 70 FP tumor samples and 20 non-tumor samples from 12 juvenile green turtles which had stranded in Northern Florida, were used for sequencing. Samples were further categorized by tissue type, as well as growth profile for the external tumors only (see Supplementary Data 1). Sequencing libraries were generated from 500 ng of total RNA using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Cat No. E7530), including polyA selection, according to manufacturer's protocol. Size and purity of the libraries were analyzed on a Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent). The RNA samples used for library construction had a RIN value range of 7.2 to 9.8, with the median RIN value of all samples being 9.1. Libraries were sequenced as paired-end reads with a read length of 100 bp on a HiSeq 3000 (Illumina). ERCC Spike-In Mix (ThermoFisher) was used as an internal control: 2 \u03bcL of 1:400 diluted ERCC Spike-In Mix with 500 ng of total RNA input.",
