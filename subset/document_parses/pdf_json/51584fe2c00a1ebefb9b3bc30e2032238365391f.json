However, traditional nursing work consumes a lot of manpower and material resources, but it is difficult to improve the happiness of cancer patients, and it also brings a lot of troubles to many nursing workers. Based on the above reasons, we reengineered the traditional nursing process based on the BPR theory and applied the new process to the analysis of the management effect of cancer patients after oral chemotherapy drugs. e data shows that there are 23 patients with no pressure ulcer risk (score greater than 19) before care, 27 patients with low risk (15-19 points), 32 patients with moderate risk (13-14 points), and 18 people at high risk (less than 12 points). After nursing, there were 82 patients with no pressure ulcer risk, 10 patients with low risk, 7 patients with moderate risk, and 1 patient with high risk. is shows that the risk of pressure ulcers in patients with cancer after the use of chemotherapy drugs is significantly reduced compared with those without nursing. Nursing intervention can improve the psychological state of cancer patients during the recovery period, and nursing intervention can promote the compliance of cancer patients in various aspects of rehabilitation.",

Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgery and oral chemotherapy drugs will have a huge impact on the quality of life of patients and may even lead to life risks; thus, good care is especially necessary [3] . e voice based on medical care reform has always existed in academia, and there are many related studies, such as the framework of cancer patient care plan formulated by Kotenko S. e purpose of intervention is to effectively solve health problems such as insufficient self-care. Low patient compliance and decreased health quality may occur during the rehabilitation process [4] . For the first time, Mayahara M has carried out the continuous care model for cancer patients from the hospital to the home for the first time, a related study of nurses intervening in the early discharge of elderly patients [5] . Flanagan J imitates the concept of continuous care, including 6 dimensions (cross-institution, intergroup, mobility, vertical position, relationship, or individual continuity) to improve the quality of care for cancer patients [6] . Chountalas P T continues to improve the care model, hoping to reduce the patient's risk of chronic diseases and the quality of care [7] . Moore K proposed the concept of BPR, which uses extraction, integration, insertion, extraction, and reshaping technology to manufacture or update the initial process, creating a new process to obtain a smooth system of time, cost, quality, and service. is improvement model is in line with the current the medical environment [8] . Rega M L has conducted various studies on deficiencies in rational intervention, the quality of intervention strategies, intervention caregivers psychology, etc. [9] .

In clinical practice, it is found that the traditional nursing process is not flexible enough to take care of the patient comprehensively. ere are many problems. e number of nurses and the function of the infirmary are still unclear. is will lead to the fact that even if nursing staff work hard, it is still difficult for patients to get high-quality care, and the quality of care for patients is impaired due to inequality in systems and capabilities [11] . Overseas, BPR has been successfully integrated into the healthcare system to restructure or improve health service processes, and this type of integrated health care application originated in the United States [12] . So far, US medical researchers have been very skilled in using BPR technology in the healthcare system. As the growing demand for health services in China, the issue of medical care arises, and BPR is used to improve processes in all aspects of hospitals, such as introducing outpatient waiting and payment, and help improve quality of service [13] . Designing new workflows specifically for nursing work can help reduce nurse mistakes, improve work quality, and increase the satisfaction of doctors and patients. Redesigning the laboratory infection control system can improve work efficiency [14] . Under the guidance of BPR theory, the process reengineering group was set up to design the process reengineering steps, principles, objectives, and other contents and reasonably and effectively evaluate the application effect of the reengineering process. e framework of nursing process reengineering based on BPR theory is shown in Figure 1 .",

            "text": "Patients. We take irinotecan (a chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of colorectal cancer) as an example to study the effects and risks of oral chemotherapeutics for cancer patients. With the listing of irinotecan, it has received extensive attention from researchers and doctors all over the world due to its direct efficacy [17] . In the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, the third phase of clinical results showed that the combination of CPT-11 and 5-FU/CF was significantly higher than 5-FU/CF in terms of survival and remission. Irinotecan has also become the European Union and the first chemical drug used by the US FDA to treat advanced colon cancer [18] . CPT-11 and oxaliplatin combined with leucovorin and 5-FU light have a better effect in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Folinic acid can stabilize the synthesis of 5-FU and thymidine synthase and increase 5-FU with parathymidine Inhibition of chemical synthase [19] . Studies have shown that the first chemotherapeutic drug CPT-11 is also slowly being used to treat gliomas. It can be used in combination with cisplatin to treat small cell lung cancer and has obvious clinical effects. e combination of CPT-11 and gemcitabine is well tolerated and has less toxicity in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In addition, CPT-11 is also used to treat esophageal cancer, cervical cancer, leukemia, etc. e toxic and side effects during treatment are mainly intestinal reactions, adverse reactions of the blood system, and complex symptoms such as hair loss, fatigue, mucositis, and skin toxicity (including hand-foot syndrome) [20] . Existing studies believe that, from the perspective of drug metabolism, this is mainly due to the toxicity of the central metabolite of CPT-11. e occurrence of diarrhea may be due to the direct damage of SN-38 to the intestinal tract [21] . Intestinal flora, such as Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and \u03b2-glucuronidase produced by Bacteroides, can convert SN-38G back to SN-38, thereby destroying the intestinal epithelium and reducing intestinal inflammation. e contact time of SN-38 with the intestinal epithelium and the concentration in the intestine are the key to causing delayed diarrhea [22] . erefore, it is necessary to care for tumor patients with oral chemotherapy drugs. Good care can effectively reduce the serious adverse reactions caused by chemotherapy drugs. Journal of Healthcare Engineering found that letting neural networks automatically learn is very effective. e method of automatically learning features is usually called \"representational learning\" by researchers. e deep learning model has a very powerful feature extraction ability, which avoids the inefficiency and cumbersomeness of manually designing features. Since deep learning features are automatically learned, deep learning is feasible for the application of hospital care business process reengineering. erefore, the use of neuron shared weights greatly reduces the number of parameters that need to be trained in the neural network [24] . In addition, the shared weight strategy used can be used to convolve the image data to achieve the forward propagation of the neural network (the filter is composed of weights). A convolutional neural network usually includes a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, a fully connected layer, and a loss layer (needed in the training phase, not required in the testing and deployment phases). A binary classification network with 2 convolutional layers, 2 pooling layers, and two fully linked layers (the last fully-linked layer is used for classification) is shown in Figure 2 .",

Formulate process reengineering goals: (1) after reengineering, the process has strong operability, which can ensure smooth progress of nursing intervention, high efficiency of rescue work, and reduction of patient tumor delay time; (2) through process reengineering, clarify the scope of work of nurses in the nursing process, and improve the coordination of medical and nursing care; (3) after the reengineering process, a clear time system and responsibility system are established to reduce the dependence of nursing work on the experience of tumor nurses; (4) the reengineered process needs to run on the basis of the original process and be stable and smooth and does not conflict with the existing overall system or other single department systems. Currently, there is basis for nursing process standards, and nurses in various hospitals also carry out nursing work based on their own experience, and the work content is similar.

However, entries 4 and 5 are most likely to be caused by unit characteristics. e experts with different opinions in the two entries come from the special specialized heart hospitals, so they may lead to inconsistent with the evaluation level of experts in other general hospitals. Finally, for items 3, 4, and 5, they chose to adopt the opinions of most experts. For individual experts with different opinions, once again communicating with the experts and further explaining the reasons for not adopting them, the experts said that they could understand and agree.",

After nursing, there were 82 patients with no pressure ulcer risk, 10 patients with low risk, 7 patients with moderate risk, and 1 patient with high risk. Pressure ulcers occur because the patient's long-term bed rest and turning over reduce pressure on the tissues, causing nutritional imbalance and circulatory disorders in the compressed parts, and progressively worsening, eventually leading to soft tissue necrosis. It is one of the three major complications of clinical care. If a pressure ulcer occurs, it will not only have a negative impact on the patient's treatment effect, but also reduce the patient's quality of life, which can even endanger the patient's life in severe cases. However, through this study, it can be seen that the risk of pressure ulcers after the use of chemotherapeutic drugs is significantly reduced, and the risk of pressure ulcers in patients without medication is higher than that of pressure ulcers with medication. A fall is a sudden, nonsubjective change in body position and falling to the ground or lower planes. Inpatients have different risks of falling due to age, severity of illness, familiarity with the environment, and change of caregivers. ere are reports showing that the incidence of falls in hospitalized patients is 3 to 7 per thousand, but it has become an important safety issue affecting the health of patients. e risk assessment of the patient falling from the bed is shown in Figure 9 .",

After nursing, the number of patients without the risk of falling from bed increased to 73, the number of patients with risk of falling from bed was 12, and only 15 patients were at high risk.

It can be seen that the difference in fall risk assessment after nursing is statistically significant. Once a fall occurs, patients are prone to coexisting diseases or injuries, length of stay in hospital, and medical expenditures increase. Preventing falls is an important part of nursing work, and it is also an important index to evaluate the safety and nursing quality of hospital patients. Tumor patients are prone to limb discomfort due to the lesion invading normal brain function areas, which is one of the high-risk factors for falling and falling from the bed. e damage to the patient's brain tissue and the resulting impaired consciousness caused by the medication can cause the patient to develop postoperatively, the main reason for the fall. e use of special drugs after medication is also a risk factor for falls. e mobility of cancer patients has also changed after medication. e proportion of patients who can move on their own after taking the medicine is greatly reduced, as shown in Figure 10 .",

In the process of nursing process reengineering, patients' service needs should be taken as the core, not exceeding the requirements of relevant norms and systems, and efforts should be made to innovate the service process. Tumor brings great pain and life pressure to people. e usual chemotherapy and surgical treatment usually cost high, and the postoperative damage to the human body is large, so oral chemotherapy is gradually becoming a common treatment, but the side effects of chemotherapy are relatively large, and patients need good nursing conditions. By comparing the management effect of hospital nursing process reengineering on tumor patients after oral chemotherapy, we found the following. e research is based on mature and applicable BPR theory and has scientific and systematic reengineering steps. By shortening DtoECG time and DtoTnI time, the established AMI emergency nursing process can accelerate the diagnosis of patients. e hospital AMI emergency nursing process established by the institute adopted a clear responsibility system, which solved the problems mentioned in the interview, such as repetitive work among nurses and difficulties for junior nurses to cope with. Nurses are also trained to improve their comprehensive ability, enhance their self-motivation in the process of work, improve their EXPERIENCE of AMI rescue, and enhance the sense of belonging of nurses.

It is because this ability can be improved through selftraining and self-adaptation. e results of anxiety and depression symptoms of patients before and after nursing were statistically different, and the patients' anxiety symptoms decreased significantly. e reason may be that as the patient's condition gradually relieved, the anxiety symptoms decreased. e results of the compliance comparison before and after patient care showed that there were statistical differences in the compliance of the five items of smoking cessation, alcohol restriction, exercise time, exercise frequency, physical activity, and self-test. ere was no statistical difference in the compliance of the two items of medication. e Barthel index scoring method was used to evaluate the self-care ability of patients, individualized care was given to patients according to different grades, and attention was paid to mobilize the self-care potential and enthusiasm of patients, guiding patients to actively participate in nursing and self-care. Because of the difference of nursing score, the nursing patients in the daily living ability have been significantly improved, so the basic care and specialized care of tumor patients are also particularly important. In addition to the implementation of comprehensive basic nursing, but also taking the initiative to analyze potential dangers, do a good job of safety precautions, timely eliminate risk factors, prevent accidents, and ensure the personal safety of patients, so as to improve the quality of nursing. In this study, by comparing the two groups of tumor patients, it was found that the low risk and high risk scores of tumor patients were significantly higher than before nursing, indicating that the risk index of pressure ulcers rose before and after nursing. How to effectively prevent pressure ulcers is the focus of cancer patients nursing.",

Nursing process reengineering requires the establishment of a nursing management team. e management team conducts investigations, analyzes and solves the problems in traditional nursing, formulates new nursing process plans, and makes modifications after preliminary trials. For the management effect of cancer patients after oral chemotherapy, we can find that the pretest not only verifies the effect of the process implementation, but also constantly discovers the problems in the practice of the nursing process transformation during the pretest process and further modifies it to ensure the actual process. e modified nursing intervention effect is better than the conventional hospital nursing effect. e modified intervention can improve the ability of daily life of cancer patients during the rehabilitation period. Nursing intervention can improve the psychological state of cancer patients during the rehabilitation period. Nursing intervention can promote the various aspects of cancer patients, rehabilitation compliance. After using chemotherapy drugs, the risk of pressure ulcers after the patients are treated is significantly reduced. e risk of pressure ulcers in patients without medication is higher than the risk of pressure ulcers with medication, and the risk of patients falling from bed can be effectively reduced.",
