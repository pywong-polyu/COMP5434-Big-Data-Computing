Upon exposure to different population and changing environment, the viral strain might experience different mutational bias that leads to genetic diversity among the viral population. Also, the diversification can be influenced by distinct selection pressure on different viral genomes. We have carried out a comparative genomic analysis of 82 SARS-CoV2 genomes. We have evaluated their evolutionary divergence, substitution pattern, and rates. Viral genomes under distinct selection pressure have been identified. Sites that experience strong selection pressure also have been identified. Our result shows that the translational preference of a few codons is strongly correlated with the mutational bias imposed by genome compositional constraint and influenced by natural selection. Few genomes are evolving with a higher mutational rate with a distinct signature of nucleotide substitution in comparison to others. Four viral strains are under the effect of purifying selection, while nine SARS-CoV2 genomes are under strong positive selection bias. Site analysis indicates a strong positive selection pressure on two codon positions at 3606th and 8439th positions. Our study elucidates adaptation of few SARS-CoV2 viral strain during the outbreak shaping by natural selection and genomic compositional constraints.",

            "text": "Recent pandemic of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, infects more than 40 million people and we have witnessed 1 million deaths already. Genomic comparison of SARS-CoV2 from infected individual shows 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV and 96% identity to bat coronavirus, BatCoV RaTG13, which suggests a possible bat origin of the new virus [1] . Genome comparison reveals the possible role of pangolin as an intermediate host during the cross-species transfer of the virus [2] , although it is still highly debatable [3, 4] . SARS-CoV2 genome is a positive single-stranded RNA of~30 kb size, comprises of a 5'-UTR, a long ORF1a/b codes different nonstructural proteins, S gene, which encodes spike glycoprotein, other genes that encode for the envelope E protein and the membrane protein M, region encoding the nucleocapsid N protein followed by 3'-UTR [5] . Data available from the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that the rate of infectivity and associated morbidity reported in different countries is different. The United States of America and Europe are severely affected by reported cases of more than 18 million and 8 million, respectively. Eastern Mediterranean regions reported 2 million cases of SARS-CoV2 infection while South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions reported cases are~8.5 million and~0.7 million, respectively. Surprisingly, there is only~1.2 million reported cases of SARS-CoV2 from Africa. Also, data on the rate of infectivity of the virus increased severely during the pandemic. The origin of such increased virulence can be hidden in the evolution of SARS-CoV2 during the pandemic. However, very little is known about the genetic variability of this novel virus across the different population. Upon exposure to different population and changing environment, the virus populations might experience different selection pressure that leads to several closely related genomic variants [6, 7] . Although the timescale of the pandemic is short, the mutation rates and rapid replicative kinetics of the viruses may lead to diverse SARS-CoV2 genomes across the whole population. Noteworthy, the RNA virus shows a high degree of adaptive potential [8] . Thus, it is important to assess the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV2 owing to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses. Genetic diversification is a dynamic and complex process. Therefore, the viral genome in the different population may be under different selection pressure, purifying/positive or neutral. Thus, it is important to access the selection pressure of different micropopulation of viral genomes to understand the origin of genetic diversification.",

However, great diversity in AT/U content has been observed at each codon position. At the first codon site, the average value decreases to 56.78% which is primarily due to the lower occurrence of T/U and the higher prevalence of G at that particular site ( Figure 1 (b)), in comparison to the average. According to the codon usage pattern, the alteration leads to nonsynonymous substitution between valine and phenylalanine in the population (Figure 1 (c)). Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values indicate higher usage of both GUU(V) and UUU(F) codon in the SARS-CoV2 population (Figure 1 (c)). However, the 2nd and 3rd codon positions are more biased towards the AT/U content with an average value of 64.19% and 65.24%, respectively. Although the GC-content is lower in those sites in comparison to the average, at the 2nd codon position, the prevalence of G content is significantly lower. Evident from the codon usage pattern (Figure 1 (c)), only six codons with G at the 2nd codon site exhibit RSCU values > 1 . These are UGU(C), CGU(R), AGU(S), AGA(R), AGG(R), and GGU(G). At the 3rd codon position, T/U is abundant in the genome, whereas C-content is lowest. Notably, no codon with C at the 3rd site is frequently used to encode viral proteins, RSCU < 1.",

In general, human coronaviruses are AT/U-rich and C-content is particularly low.

Variation in the A-content is very less significant among different coronavirus species. However, U/T content varies greatly among coronaviruses.

For example, leucine is encoded by six codons; among them, two codons, UUA and UUG, are more frequently utilized with RSCU values of 1.35. Among the rest of the four codons with C at the first site, CUU is associated with RSCU values of 1.25, while the other three codons are less frequently used (RSCU values \u226a 1). It has been often observed that both translational selection and compositional constraints dictate the codon utilization variation. Overall, we have observed that the compositional constraints mostly dictate the translational biases for SARS-CoV2 genomes. Apparent from the RSCU values of the codons in different SARS-CoV2, genomes show the clear translational preference of few codons. Notably, selection pressure also induces the nonuniformity of codon usage under the influence of compositional bias.",

Genetic distances among genomes are small which is rational because the novel virus emerged very recently and the timescale of evolution is very small. Thus, most of the viral genomes are very closely related and belong to a primary clade. Interestingly, genomic sequences of SARS-CoV2 reported in the same state of USA clubbed together, but among the states, they are differently clubbed. Noteworthy, viral genomes from Brazil, Australia, South Korea, Sweden, and Italy are clubbed together in a distinct subclade with a viral genome from California, USA. This clade does not contain any viral genome from Chinese origin which indicates that this group of SARS-CoV2 virus is evolved during the later stages of a pandemic.

This segregation process helps us to identify strongly selected sites in those viral strains evolving under strong overall selection pressure and distinct mutational bias compared to the rest of the circulating viral strains. During the early pandemic period, the rate of mutations is high which is strongly influenced by the genetic diversity of the exposed host population. The synonymous mutations are much higher than the nonsynonymous mutations. All the mutations are not significant, and mutations of the naturally selected viral strains only persist. Thus, the genome segregation based on the overall selection pressure ensures the identification of significantly selected sites. In the two datasets, we have included the viral genome from Wuhan, China, as a reference genome of origin and another sequence from USA (GI no: 1820552687; accession no: MT188341.1) which shows a higher degree of evolutionary divergence (Figure 2(a) ).

Site analysis clearly shows that more sites under strong negative selection bias in comparison to the number of sites with positive selection bias ( Figure 5(a) ). Three codon positions, namely 2839 on nsp3, 5070 at RNA- dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), and 9054 on the M protein are under strong purifying selection bias. At the 2839 position, there is a change of nucleotide from C to T, while for the other two sites, we have noticed substitution from T to C (Figure 4(a), lower panel) . Notably, the rate of substitution calculation reveals the highest transition rate from C to T or vice versa among all possible substitution rates. Site analysis of SARS-CoV2 genomes under strong positive selection bias is shown in Figure 5 (b). The calculated dN/dS is 3.03, which signifies a strong positive selection bias on those viral strains. The number of sites under strong positive selection bias is significantly higher than the number of sites with negative selection bias ( Figure 5(b) ). Numbers of positively selected sites are distributed through the genome. However, two sites are under strong selection bias. Codon position at 3606 on 3C-like proteinase is under strong positive selection bias where a change in the 3rd codon from G to T leads to a change in amino acid from leucine to phenylalanine. Both of them are hydrophobic amino acid with comparable size; however, the presence of aromatic ring in phenylalanine makes it more suitable interaction site. Thus, this nonsynonymous mutation might have a functional role. On the other hand, the site at 8439 codon position on surface glycoprotein is also under strong positive selection bias where a nonsynonymous substitution from G to T at the 1st codon position leads to a change in amino acid from valine to phenylalanine which is also a similar gain in function.",
