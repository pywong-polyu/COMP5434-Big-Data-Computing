            "text": "This case report describes an elderly patient with radioiodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer and additional multiple metastases living in a rural setting, remote from the specialist oncology service. This case is of interest because effective systemic therapies for treatment-resistant cancers, such as lenvatinib, are now available but can potentially cause significant toxicities that require extensive medical management. Here, we discuss how patient care was provided collaboratively by the local community teams integrated with remote specialist oncology services. A 77-year-old patient presented with symptoms of cauda equina secondary to a large metastatic sacral deposit. The deposit was biopsied, and histology revealed a diagnosis of differentiated follicular thyroid cancer that was treated with external beam radiotherapy and thyroidectomy, followed by radioiodine. However, the disease was found to be resistant to radioiodine therapy, and the patient subsequently developed back pain due to new bone metastases. After further palliative external beam radiotherapy, the patient was started on systemic treatment with lenvatinib. Treatment has continued for more than 2.5 years with a slow but steady improvement in symptoms and quality of life. Monitoring and assessment of lenvatinib therapy and management of associated toxicities was coordinated remotely from a specialist cancer center over 200 miles away, using the skills of the local medical and nursing teams. This case report demonstrates how a cooperative effort using local teams and video-conferencing links to a specialist cancer center can be applied to safely treat a patient with a medication that may result in significant potential toxicities that require attentive and dynamic management.",

Thus, this patient's case provides an interesting discussion of patient-centered care within a challenging, resource-scarce, environment. Further, this patient's treatment with lenvatinib, which shows promise for patients with radioiodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer, has been safely managed through coordinated care from local and specialist teams located a great distance away. This case indicates that this rare cancer can be treated remotely and safely with an agent with known toxicities and adverse events that require close monitoring, without requiring extensive travel by patients to clinics. However, patients should be assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine the feasibility of remote treatment.",

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis also showed an enlarged thyroid gland. A biopsy of the sacral mass led to a histological diagnosis of differentiated-type follicular thyroid tumor, originating in a 4-cm mass in the right lobe of the thyroid gland.

The case was discussed by the North of Scotland thyroid cancer multidisciplinary team, who recommended the standard treatment of thyroidectomy with subsequent radioiodine therapy. As there was significant retrosternal extension of the thyroid gland, the patient was transferred to the specialist thyroid cancer team based in the university hospital in Aberdeen for a radical thyroidectomy, as surgery required both the thoracic and endocrine surgical teams to resect the thyroid gland. Pathology On recovery from surgery the patient had a course of radioiodine treatment (3, 750 MBq) in the university hospital in Aberdeen that had a specialist thyroid cancer team. Iodine uptake scanning following radioiodine treatment suggested new focal uptake in the costochondral junction of the second left rib, maxilla, mandible, soft tissue around the left lateral border of the hyoid, and left anterior pelvis, in addition to the known lesion in the sacrum. There was also some uptake of radioiodine in the thyroid bed, which may have been due to residual thyroid tissue. Failure to shrink the sacral mass meant that the patient continued to experience complete urinary incontinence. The patient had a urethral catheter sited, which gave her the confidence to leave the house and improved her quality of life; her Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) was 1 at this time.",

At a review of the patient's bone scans in January 2017, metastatic disease progression was clinically determined and a trial period of lenvatinib treatment was suggested by the multidisciplinary team. The disease was suspected to be resistant to radioiodine because of the relapse after a substantial total dose of radioiodine that had been given in the prior year. A video-link consultation was coordinated by a cancer specialist nurse between the specialist oncologist, based in Aberdeen, and the patient, along with a supportive friend. As the patient's condition was stable and her ECOG PS was still 1, it was agreed that continued observation rather than additional treatment with lenvatinib was appropriate at that time, given the possibility for adverse events from a systemic treatment to impair quality of life for an elderly patient.",

There was a good response to the EBRT, with the patient remaining reasonably active and her Tg decreasing to 3,470 ng/ml by May 2017 ( Table 1 ). In the summer of 2017, the patient reported new symptoms of upper back and shoulder pain, and CT imaging at the local hospital revealed new tumor deposits in the thoracic spine, causing a compressive radiculopathy, with further tumor deposits in the left ilium. In keeping with this clinical progression, her Tg had significantly increased to 119,200 ng/ml ( Table 1) . The patient received additional radiotherapy (8 Gy in 1 fraction, covering the T3-T5 area) in July 2017 at the regional hospital in Inverness and was discharged with a reducing course of dexamethasone (starting at 16 mg/day). Despite this treatment, the patient experienced a reduction in mobility, with balance problems and difficulty walking, as well as reduced sensation and power in her legs and feet. She became immobile without a wheelchair and required social support at home. At this point, the patient's ECOG PS was 3. The dose of dexamethasone was increased, due to symptomatic burden, from a tapered-down dose of 4 mg/day back to 8 mg/day. At a subsequent video-link consultation with the specialist oncologist-based on the patient's reduced mobility, worsening ECOG PS, increased Tg levels, and discovery of new tumor lesions-it was agreed that the patient should start lenvatinib therapy. Lenvatinib treatment began in August 2017 at a dose of 24 mg/day and the patient, together with a close friend and the local cancer nurse specialist from a local hospital, joined a video-link consultation every 2 weeks with the specialist oncologist in Aberdeen. This planned close/frequent review allowed for the detection and management of any significant adverse events with lenvatinib treatment, and for appropriate dose alterations of lenvatinib. Monitoring included blood tests, weight, ECOG PS, and regular self-monitoring of blood pressure.",

The amlodipine dose was increased to 10 mg/day. Lenvatinib treatment was paused for 2 weeks until platelet levels recovered and was then restarted at a lower dose of 20 mg/day.

However, the increased dose of lenvatinib led to an increase in blood pressure, requiring further changes to antihypertensive medications (dose adjustments and the temporary addition of bisoprolol). With the increase in antihypertensive medications came metabolic disturbance, significant peripheral edema, and a decrease in ECOG PS and quality of life. On the advice of the specialist oncologist, via video-link consultation, the lenvatinib dose was reduced back to 10 mg/day.

Some patients can have slowly progressive disease, with little or no effect on the patient's quality of life for some time, while others can exhibit rapid progression and the need to commence systemic treatment (10) . This systemic treatment can cause significant toxicity and requires initial frequent monitoring and assessment by a multidisciplinary team familiar with the treatment options (currently [as of April 2020], either lenvatinib or sorafenib) (9, 11) . This poses a challenge for health services responsible for small populations spread over a large and rugged geographical area. Similar challenging rural environments for patients with rare cancers requiring specialist oversight occur throughout the world. The patient in this report lived over 200 miles from the specialist thyroid cancer regional center in Aberdeen and travelling from home would require either a flight of 45 minutes, or a 4.5-5-hour drive time each way for at least 16 appointments, a significant investment of time and money and substantial disruption to the patient's daily life. However, the use of video-conferencing with the specialist oncologist, and most importantly collaboration with not only the local cancer nursing team but also the patient's general practitioner (GP), enabled successful management of the patient's adverse events and, ultimately, stabilized the disease.",

They are used to not having specialist staff close at hand, and are willing to employ a remote, multidisciplinary approach to patient care. For this patient, the team consisted of the specialist based in Aberdeen, the local cancer nursing specialists, the local GP, staff in the local district hospital (for CT scanning), and oncology staff in the regional hospital in Inverness serving the patient's locality. The cancer nurse specialist (or the deputy when the cancer nurse specialist was unavailable) was the critical link in coordinating the patient's care and monitoring toxicity. These nurses not only have training in palliative care but also in the treatment of patients with systemic oncology therapies, with some procedures being delivered in the local hospital. This mixture of skills makes cancer nurse specialists well placed to be involved in the care of patients with rarer cancers. Additional training was provided to the nurses by Eisai, the manufacturers of lenvatinib. The success in this case is due to the collaborative approach of a number of clinicians working together with a motivated and well-informed patient. Clear communication among the members of this small team was critical to successful remote management of this patient and might be more difficult with larger teams.",

It is important that rural patients do not miss out on newer therapies that could be administered locally, despite the challenges of a remote location, by employing techniques such as coordinated remote care, using video-conferencing for example, with the staff in the specialist centers.",
