Data collection occurred between September 2020-February 2021 before the COVID-19 vaccine became publicly available. The study partnered with a Community Advisory Board, schools and immigrantserving community-based organizations who recruited through listservs, social media, and flyers. Those who reported being undocumented, Asian and/or Latinx, ages 18-39, living in California at the time of participation, and ability to take a 15-minute online survey in English or Spanish were eligible. All participants provided informed consent and were emailed a password-protected, unique and time-sensitive survey link to minimize fraudulent participation. A total of 24 respondents were excluded from our sample due to inconsistent immigration-related responses (i.e., born in the US, reported having Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) but not meeting program requirements, etc.). To conduct a complete case analysis, we excluded an additional 16 participants who were missing a response for study items. The final analytic sample included 326 participants.",

            "text": "Additionally, our exploratory data suggests that Asian undocumented may be less accepting of the COVID-19 vaccine. It should be noted that Latinx participants reported higher levels of immigration exposures compared to Asian participants. This is in line with other research and administrative data that finds that Latinx immigrants are more likely to be apprehended and deported compared to other groups (Golash-Boza and Hondagneu-Sotelo, 2013). However, our data also suggests that while Latinx immigrants are more likely to report higher numbers of immigration enforcement exposures, Asian immigrants also report high levels of exposures in their daily lives and this may contribute to their vaccine intentions. Other factors that may explain less acceptance among Asian undocumented may include recent dramatic increases in anti-Asian and xenophobic attacks during the pandemic, encouraged and reinforced through anti-Asian rhetoric and policies by US government officials (Gover et al., 2020) . Racism and xenophobia inflicted by individuals and government entities may have negatively impacted the quality of relationships and trust in community members and institutions among undocumented Asians, thereby reducing social capital. Social capital is an important social determinant of health, health behaviors, and healthcare access, and has been shown to significantly correlate positively with fully vaccinated status and negatively with vaccine hesitancy (Kawachi, 1999; Ferwana and Varshney, 2021) . Even prior to the pandemic, our past studies indicated undocumented Asians experience social isolation, discrimination, and intra-and inter-ethnic conflict to the detriment of their physical and mental health (Sudhinaraset et al., 1982; Ro et al., 2021) . Thus, in addition to immigration enforcement, sharp increases in anti-Asian racism during the pandemic may have played a role in lowering vaccine acceptance among undocumented Asians. Future efforts should pay attention to how legal status and race may intersect to further compound disadvantage and inequities.",

The online nature of the study may select for more connected or educated immigrants compared to those who do not have internet access. Related, recruitment through community partners may have biased our sample towards more connected immigrants; therefore, these results are likely to underestimate the associations between immigration enforcement and vaccine intentions. Another limitation of the study is that respondents were asked about their acceptance of a hypothetical vaccine. The response options for the hypothetical vaccine included definitely, probably, or definitely not; however, it did not include an \"unsure\" option, which may have not given participants their preferred option. However, only four participants did not answer this question in the entire sample suggesting participants were able to respond. Related, we decided to include the \"probably\" into the \"non-accepting\" group. It is possible that those who responded \"probably\" would have been \"accepting\" of the vaccines; however, this decision was made in order to more accurately estimate acceptance, as was used in other studies (Doherty et al., 2021) . Future efforts should examine whether results change with the availability of vaccines.",
