            "text": "The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread globally with males and females equally susceptible to the infection. However, males experience greater severity of infection with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. 1 A recent review of sex differences in COVID-19 including data from 38 countries reported mortality in males as 1.7 times higher than the average female. 2 Similar data have been observed in previous pandemics, including the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) outbreaks. 3 The reason for these sex differences is unclear. A range of hypotheses have been proposed from variations in patterned sex behaviours, such as smoking, co-morbidities, and sex-based immunological variations. 2 In particular, the role of oestrogen in female immune responses has received much attention. 4, 5 Younger females or those with higher oestrogen levels are less likely to experience severe COVID-19 complications. 4 Earlier studies show that females mount faster and greater immune responses to viral infections through cellular and humoral immune responses. 2 Moreover, immune responses can be modulated by oestrogen through a reduction in T-cell exhaustion and suppression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 production. 6 This potentially limits the cytokine storm and subsequent respiratory failure that is characteristically triggered by SARS-CoV-2. This may explain why fewer women compared to men have been hospitalized and admitted to ICU (Intensive Care Unit) or have died during the pandemic. 1 To date, a limited number of studies have explored the association between oestrogen-containing products and COVID-19 outcomes. Recent observational data suggest that women aged 18-45 years taking the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) have a significantly lower risk of acquiring COVID-19 (odds ratios [OR] 0.87, P < 0.001), as well as a reduction in hospital attendance (OR 0.79, P = 0.023). 7,8 Evidence on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been less consistent. Increased rates of predicted (but not confirmed) COVID-19 were seen among HRT users in a recent large retrospective cohort study 7 ; however, another recent cohort study demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality among women >50 years of age receiving oestradiol therapy (OR 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.18 to 0.62). 9 The potential protective effects of oestrogen on the severity of COVID-19 have important public health and clinical relevance. With the lack of curative treatment for the infection, repurposing of existing drugs including exogenous oestrogen products requires further investigation. Considering public and prescriber concern, it is necessary to better understand the potential impact of these drugs on women taking them.",

This included heterogeneity in sociodemographic and clinical variables. The data used are of high quality and completeness with twice-weekly updates that are also used by Public Health England to monitor the current and previous pandemics. 10 The availability of wide-ranging and precise data means that we were able to adjust for several confounders, although residual unmeasured confounding and risk of misclassification are still possible, as an inherent limitation of the retrospective cohort design. We considered both laboratory-confirmed and clinically probable cases as a single cohort due to the national inconsistency in testing availability at the time. Furthermore, data on the method of temperature measurement were not available. It is therefore plausible that not all those with clinically probable cases had SARS-CoV-2. Recent work from the Oxford-RCGP database, however, suggests that outcomes are similar in those with clinically probable and laboratory-confirmed cases. 13 Our cohort is likely to reflect women with more severe COVID-19 symptoms who went for testing or made contact with a GP for review. If asymptomatic or with milder symptoms, they may not have sought health advice and will not be captured in this cohort. In terms of the exposure, we examined medications based on prescriptions within the last 6 months rather than dispensed medications so there could be some over-ascertainment of exposure to HRT. Furthermore, as oestrogen was highlighted as having a role in COVID-19 reasonably early in the pandemic, it is possible that some women may have stopped taking their medications before contracting the infection. Our study did not examine the type of preparation or dose of HRT, as these data were not available from the database. Nor did we investigate the duration of medication use, and our follow-up period was short at less than 6 months. This might be important in oestrogen-related immune responses where longer exposures to hormones could be significant. 2 Age was included in the model as a categorical variable only, which may have limited our adjustment. This was done to reflect the much higher odds of all-cause mortality in the older age categories (compared to the <40-year reference category). We also used all-cause mortality as our outcome, and some deaths may therefore be unrelated to COVID-19. There was substantial confusion about the classification of COVID-19 mortality in the early part of the pandemic including changes in government guidance as the pandemic progressed. COVID-19-specific mortality was variable and as a new code, it may not have been widely used in primary care records. All-cause mortality is likely to be a more reliable measure especially in the early part of the pandemic in which our study is set.",

            "text": "Previous studies report lower rates of severe COVID-19 complications among women compared to men, and a number of published studies support the hypothesis that oestrogen may confer a protective effect against COVID-19. 4, 5, [7] [8] [9] This is consistent with the findings of the COVID Symptom Study, which (to our knowledge) is the largest observational study on this topic to date, including 152,637 women for menopause status. 7 Their findings across the cohort suggest that higher oestrogen levels may protect against COVID-19. The mechanism to explain this may be through increased cellular and humoral immune responses in females with higher oestrogen levels. Recent evidence suggests that females have a higher level and faster generation of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies compared to males. 20 Higher oestrogen levels may also be able to better promote the direct anti-viral activity of T cells and modulate the uncontrolled immune response (cytokine storm) that has been observed in those with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. 4,5 Immune responses and oestrogen levels decrease with age which might explain why previous studies and our results show a greater likelihood of worse outcomes in females with increasing age. 1, 7 However, among women on HRT with exogenous oestrogen, the risk of all-cause mortality is reduced, but still does not reach that of younger females (presumably related to the direct effect of ageing on the immune system and the increased number of morbidities acquired with age). 21 In the COVID Symptom Study described earlier, the associations between HRT and COVID-19 in 17,798 women were not consistent. 7 Increased rates of predicted (but not confirmed) COVID-19 were seen among HRT users, however, there was no significant association between HRT and risk of hospitalization, and the authors did not report on mortality. 7 These differences might be explained by variations in HRT preparations, doses, and duration which were not examined and (as described above) may be important in oestrogen-led immune responses. 2 Other explanations may relate to differences in adjusted covariates which were limited to age, smoking, and BMI in their study. On the other hand, a recent large 64,466 case international retrospective cohort study did demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality among women >50 years of age receiving oestradiol therapy (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.18-0.62), 9 consistent with the findings of our study. As the pandemic progresses and a greater understanding of the virus emerges, it is necessary to consider additional covariates such as household size and co-morbidities which we included. 1 Our results show that increased age, co-morbidities, extreme BMI, and immunosuppressants were all significantly associated with an increased likelihood of death among women with COVID-19; this is consistent with several recent reports. 22, 23 There is some uncertainty in the literature about the role of asthma in the severity of COVID-19 outcome, but we observed that being on HRT was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.81), suggesting that perhaps oestrogen is protective. However, these women with asthma are likely to also have been on asthma medication such as steroids which could contribute to some of the observed associations. 24 Table 3 .
