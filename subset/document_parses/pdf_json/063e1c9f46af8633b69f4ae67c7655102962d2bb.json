Neural networks dominate linear regressions and tree models in terms of performance, due to their ability to uncover and model complex latent interactions among variables. Our findings remain robust when we apply trained models to new stocks that have not been included in the training set, thus providing new empirical evidence for a universal volatility mechanism among stocks. Finally, we propose a new approach to forecasting one-day-ahead RVs using past intraday RVs as predictors, and highlight interesting diurnal effects that aid the forecasting mechanism. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology yields superior out-of-sample forecasts over a strong set of traditional baselines that only rely on past daily RVs.",

First, a measure for evaluating the commonality in intraday volatility is proposed, that is the adjusted R-squared value from linear regressions of a given stock's RVs against the market RVs. It is demonstrated that commonality over the daily horizon is turbulent over time, although commonality in intraday RVs is strong and stable. On the other hand, the analysis of the high-frequency data from the real market reveals the following interesting phenomena. During a trading session, commonality achieves a peak near the closing session, in contrast to the diurnal volatility pattern.",

However, most methods proposed by various researchers for modeling and forecasting return volatility largely rely on the parametric GARCH or stochastic volatility models, which provide forecasts of daily volatility from daily return. As pointed out by Andersen et al. [4, 2] , Engle and Patton [28] , these models employed to predict daily volatility cannot take advantage of high-frequency data, and suffer from the curse of high-dimensionality when dealing with multiple assets simultaneously. Due to the availability of high-frequency data, realized volatility (RV), computed from summing squared intraday returns, has gained popularity in recent years. Andersen et al. [4] have proposed an ARFIMA model for forecasting daily RVs, which outperforms conventional GARCH and related approaches. Corsi [20] has put forward a parsimonious AR-type model, termed Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR), for predicting daily RVs using various realized volatility components over different time horizons. Recently Izzeldin et al. [42] have made a comparison investigation for the forecasting performance of ARFIMA and HAR, and have concluded their performance is essentially indistinguishable.

For example, as reported in Table 2 , the average commonality in 65-min data is around 74.3%, while only 35.5% in daily data. Moreover, R 2 (h) is much more turbulent at the daily frequency. Table 2 also reports the results of the relation between the average commonality and the market volatility. As the horizon extends, the average commonality has a higher correlation with the market volatility 5 . .

Note that Aug-Single = (Aug-Univ) + (Univ-Single). Negative values of \u2206MSE indicate an improvement on out-of-sample data, and positive values indicate degradation. To arrive at this figure, we average the \u2206MSE values in each month, across stocks. Figure 7 reveals that the improvement of Universal compared to Single is relatively small but consistent. In terms of the benefits of Augmented, it is typically the case that incorporating the market volatility as an additional feature helps improve the forecasting performance, especially for turmoil periods. An interesting question to investigate is whether the improvements of Universal or Augmented for individual stocks are associated with their commonality with the market volatility. To this end, we present the results in Figure 8 for each quintile bucket, sorted by stock commonality (computed from Eqn (5)). From this figure, we observe that the reduction of Augmented in out-of-sample MSE relative to Universal is explained by commonality to a large extent. Generally, the out-of-sample MSE is expected to decline steadily for stocks with higher commonality. Another interesting result arises from Figure 8 values for the commonality.",

According to [7] , there is a significant fraction of the total daily trading volume in the last half-hour of the trading day. For example, for the first few months of 2020 in the US equity market, about 23% of trading volume in the 3,000 largest stocks by market value has taken place after 15:30. We also conclude from Figure 5 that the market achieves the highest level of consensus near the close. Therefore, volatility near the close in the previous trading day might contain more useful information for predicting the next day's volatility.",

For a given trading day t, the training data, including the samples in the first period [2011-07-01, t \u2212 251], are used to estimate models subject to a given architecture. Validationdata, including the recent one-year samples [t \u2212 250, t], are deployed to tune the hyperparameters of the models. Finally, testing data are samples in the next year [t + 1, t + 251]; they are out-of-sample in order to provide objective assessments of the models' performance. Due to limited computational resources, models are updated annually. In other words, when we retrain the models in the next calendar year, the training data expands by one year, whereas the validation samples are rolled forward to include the samples in the most recent one-year period, following [31]. Our testing period starts from 2015-07-01 until 2016-06-30, and the corresponding training and validation samples are [2011-07-01, 2014-06-30] and [2014-07-01, 2015-06-30], respectively. When we predict the realized volatility in [2016-07-01, 2017-06-30], the training and validation samples are [2011-07-01, 2015-06-30] and [2015-07-01, 2016-06-30], respectively. Therefore, our testing sample includes 6 years, from July 2015 to June 2021.For HAR-d and OLS, we use both the training and validation data for training, due to no requirement of hyperparameter tuning. Given the stochastic nature of neural networks, we apply an ensemble approach to MLPs and LSTMs for improving their robustness (see Hansen and Salamon[33], Gu et al.[31]). Specifically, we train multiple neural networks with different random seeds for initialization, and construct final predictions by averaging the outputs of all networks.In all of the models, the features are based on the observations in the last 21 days. For example, the number of features used to forecast 30-min RVs is 273(= 13 \u00d7 21). Prior to inputting variables in the models, at each rolling window estimation, we normalize them by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.",

The results on 10-min data are somewhat surprising, where the R-squared reaches to 55.6%. One possible reason is that economic policy uncertainty is significant in the 10-min scenario.
