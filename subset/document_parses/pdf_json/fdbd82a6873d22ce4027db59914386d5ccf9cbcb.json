This study aimed to standardize the Japanese version of the External and Internal Shame Scale (EISS-J). An online survey was conducted among university students (N = 203) at six universities in Japan (Study 1). A retest questionnaire was sent to the participants by email three weeks after the first survey (Study 2). Study 1 examined the internal consistency, factor structure, and criterion-related validity of the EISS-J, while Study 2 examined its test-retest reliability. Moreover, an additional study was conducted to examine the criterion-related validity of the scale.",

Internal shame is related to the internal dynamics of the self and how the self judges and feels about itself [2] , including tendencies to focus on negative aspects of the self and maintain global self-judgments of being bad, inferior, and flawed [3] [4] [5] . This type of shame is related to negative self-evaluations and self-directed affects, such as feelings of self-disgust [2] . On the other hand, external shame is associated with the perception that others have bad impressions of oneself, such as being inferior or worthless [6] . When experiencing external shame, people engage in defensive maneuvers, with the behavior oriented toward trying to positively influence one's image in the minds of others inferior and worthless [6] .",

Subsequently, researchers selected one pair of items from the pool that adequately expressed each domain. Consequently, a scale consisting of final eight items was developed (example items in the inferiority/inadequacy domain included \"I am different and inferior to others\" and \"People around me see me as not being up to their standards\") [7] . The English version was translated into Japanese by two experts (YH and YK) after obtaining the original authors' approval. Back-translations were conducted by two native English speakers from a translation company (Crimson Interactive Japan Co., Ltd.). The two retranslated English versions were integrated, and the resulting version was sent to the original author, who confirmed the homogeneity of the Japanese version of the scale.",

Participants were recruited by providing a link to the survey to students attending online lectures and one university also on the universities' subject recruitment websites. The survey was conducted between July and November 2020. Responses were anonymous. Participants were provided with written explanations regarding the survey's purpose, personal information protection, confidentiality, and arbitrariness of responses. Afterwards, participants were instructed, \"If you agree to complete the survey after reviewing the above instructions, please click the ' Answer' button below to proceed and answer the questions. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Chiba University (No. 3441). The number of accesses to the site was 577, and the number of respondents was 203 (35.18%). However, test accesses and multiple accesses by the same person are included. Emails were sent to the participants three weeks after the survey, requesting them to participate in the online retest study to identify the scale's test-retest reliability. The emails contained the URL of the retest questionnaire. Participants were able to respond on the same day or later. All respondents completed the survey within five weeks of the initial survey, except for one who completed it eight weeks after the initial survey. The method for obtaining informed consent was the same as that in Study 1. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS and AMOS software.",

However, a satisfactory level of fit rate could not be obtained (Additional file 2: Figure S1 ); therefore, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was implemented. Three factors were identified based on eigenvalue decay (4.001, 0.941, 0.911, 0.626), unlike the original factor structure. The first and second factors were extracted as external and internal shame, respectively; however, out of the four shame domains, only the sense of isolation/exclusion was extracted separately, forming the third factor. This factor was called Isolation (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). The CFA with error covariance between Items 2 and 3 relating to the isolation factor was conducted again using EFA results as a reference (Additional file 2: Figure S1 ), which improved the fit rate (Table 1) . Subsequent analyses were conducted using a higher-order factor and two lower-order factors, external shame (EISS-J-ES) and internal shame (EISS-J-IS), based on the CFA results, which was consistent with the original and allowed for cross-national comparisons.",

Moreover, the results of criterion-validity studies were partly different, although they were generally consistent with the predictions. No significant correlation was found between external shame and the STAXI. Similarly, external shame was not significantly correlated with humiliation, which was related to aggressive emotions focused on others, such as resentment and the desire to take revenge. Anger and humiliation are aggressive feelings toward others. Shame has a submissive aspect (damage limitation), which is a strategy to reduce attacks and exclusion by others [2] . In contrast, anger is an emotion expressed by attacking others or destroying targets [11] . External shame factors of the EISS-J may more closely reflect the aspects of submissive strategies. The relationship between the EISS-J and feelings of aggression toward others, such as anger and humiliation, requires further investigation. The findings confirmed the adequate reliability and validity of the EISS-J for simultaneously assessing external and internal shame. This study validated the three-factor model using the EFA and a higher-order factor model using the CFA. The higher-order factor model could be used for future international studies, while the three-factor model could be used for studies in Japan.",
