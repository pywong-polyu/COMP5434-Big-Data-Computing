Previous work, in both animal models and humans, supports the role of zinc in improving glucose homeostasis. We, therefore, aimed to test the effectiveness of zinc supplementation on glycaemic control in pre-diabetic adults. Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across 10 General Practitioner (GP) practices in NSW, Australia. The trial is known as Zinc in Preventing the Progression of pre-Diabetes (ZIPPeD)Study. Pre-diabetic (haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 5.7-6.4%, 39-46 mmol/mol) men and women (N = 98) were all assigned to a free state government telephone health coaching service (New South Wales Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service) and then randomised to either daily 30 mg zinc gluconate or placebo. Blood tests were collected at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months for the primary outcomes (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG)); secondary outcomes included Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 (HOMA 2) parameters, lipids, body weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure and pulse. Results The baseline-adjusted mean group difference at 6 months, expressed as treatment-placebo, (95% CI) was \u22120.02 (\u22120.14, 0.11, p = 0.78) for HbA1c and 0.17 (\u22120.07, 0.42; p = 0.17) for FBG, neither of which were statistically significant. There were also no significant differences between groups in any of the secondary outcomes. Zinc was well tolerated, and compliance was high (88%). Conclusion We believe our results are consistent with other Western clinical trial studies and do not support the use of supplemental zinc in populations with a Western diet. There may still be a role for supplemental zinc in the developing world where diets may be zinc deficient.",

The global cost to health systems in 2019 was $760 billion and is projected to increase to over $825 billion (USD) by 2030, and $845 billion by 2045 [1] .

Oxidative stress is relatively common in diabetes, and zinc also has antioxidant properties, acting as a cofactor for the superoxide dismutase enzyme that detoxifies reactive oxygen species [11] . Genome-wide association studies of Type 2 Diabetes have also identified an association with a genetic variant in the SLC30A8 gene, which encodes a zinc transporter, ZnT8 [12] . The associated genetic variant causes an amino acid change in the transporter which increases disease risk by an estimated 17% per risk allele [13] .",

How can we reconcile these results with the body of literature demonstrating an effect of zinc? Although recruitment was ceased prematurely due to COVID-19, our study still represents one of the largest RCTs in this area with the longest follow-up, and we do not believe that type II error, i.e. lack of power, is a likely explanation for our negative result. The meta-analyses [19, 20, 26] indicated effect sizes of 0.5-0.6% reduction in HbA1c and 0.8-1 mmol/L reduction in FBG. Post hoc power calculations indicate that, with our sample size, we had over 95% power to detect effects of this magnitude. It is still possible that there is an effect of zinc but that it is markedly smaller in our Western population.",

It is thus possible that zinc exerts a beneficial effect only in the setting of a zinc deficient diet. Given that zinc is found in the highest quantities in seafood (oysters and crab), meat (especially beef) and seeds/nuts (almonds, pepitas) [28] it is possible that an effect of zinc was seen in countries where vegetarian diets are more prominent, and that the effect of zinc was not seen in our Australian population due to a higher intake of meat [28] .",

[27] pooled studies across normoglycaemic and dysglycemic populations, including metabolic syndrome, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, whereas Jayawardena and Wang limited the selection criteria more strictly to populations with diabetes. Another explanation is that diabetes leads to renal pathology and subsequently to loss of zinc through the kidneys; hence, zinc replacement in diabetic patients addresses a physiological deficiency and improves glucose handling. Previous studies have confirmed increased zinc loss in diabetes [29] ; it appears that it is not necessary to have overt nephropathy for this to happen but that the presence of microalbuminuria is sufficient [30] . It is possible that the positive results from diabetes subjects skew the overall results in the Capdor meta-analysis? [27] . Nevertheless, the RCT of zinc in pre-diabetics by Ranasinghe et al. [20] is compelling in indicating that zinc does have a beneficial effect even before microalbuminuria is present, and likely points to the adequacy of the background diet as the key determinant of whether supplemental zinc influences glucose handling.",

The majority of randomized trials included across the 3 meta-analyses from Western countries (e.g. Australia, France, USA) do not show favourable point estimates; it is only previous observational studies that show this. For example, our previous study looking at a community-based cohort of older Australians found that higher serum zinc (by 1 quartile) was associated with increased insulin sensitivity (by one decile) within the pre-diabetic group, even after adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders [32] . We also analysed data from the 'Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health', a cohort of over 40,000 women across Australia, to determine whether dietary zinc was associated with risk of Type 2 Diabetes. In the stratum of middle-aged women, we found that those in the highest quintile of total dietary zinc intake had significantly lower risk of Type 2 Diabetes compared to the lowest quintile (OR = 0.50, 95% C.I. 0.32-0.77) [33] . In hindsight, perhaps the best interpretation of these results is that there was residual confounding, and that zinc (in the blood or diet) is a marker of a healthier diet and/or lifestyle that reduces the chance of developing diabetes but is not the key element on which to intervene in a Western population. This is further supported by the fact that an identical RCT protocol to the one in this study was tested in a Bangladeshi population and did show beneficial effects of zinc [34] .",
