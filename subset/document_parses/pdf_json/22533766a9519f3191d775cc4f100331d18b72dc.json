Since then, vaccines have saved millions of lives every year [4] . However, the speed for the invention of a vaccine against COVID-19 has been much quicker than any other vaccine invented in the past [5] . Numerous successful vaccines against COVID-19 have already been publicized and were approved for emergency use in some countries within a year. According to WHO's report, there are currently more than 60 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in clinical development and over 170 in the preclinical stage [6] . Among other COVID-19 vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna's and Astra Zeneca are the first three vaccines to be approved as safe and effective vaccines for emergency use by WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) and are being distributed and administered across several countries [7] . Ethiopia is one of the 92 countries eligible for donor-funded doses of COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access), a global initiative aimed at accelerating vaccine development and ensuring equitable access to all countries [6, 8] . As a result, Ethiopia has received the first shipment of 2.2 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines produced by the Serum Institute of India through COVAX on March 06, 2021. The Ethiopian Ministry of Health prepared guideline for COVID-19 vaccination and launched on March 13, 2021 in a high-level national event held at Eka Kotebe COVID-19 hospital where frontline HCWs were vaccinated to mark the beginning of the vaccination campaign. The main priority of Ethiopia's COVID-19 vaccination program was for frontline HCWs and other vulnerable populations such as the elderly population. Vaccination cascaded to other healthcare facilities given they fulfill the predefined criteria such as establishment of taskforce to manage the vaccination program, availability of trained nurses to administer the vaccine and pharmacists to monitor any adverse drug events [8] .",

The SAGE working group has defined vaccine hesitancy as \"delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite the availability of vaccination services.\" Studies showed that vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place and vaccine type and influenced by factors such as complacency, convenience and confidence [11] . Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy and associated factors among HCWs working at Addis Ababa healthcare facilities in Ethiopia.",

Since then, efforts have been made to control the pandemic from spreading and causing severe illness and death toll. Vaccine development was part of this endeavor, and the COVID-19 vaccine was distributed to Ethiopia and other LMICs under the COVAX worldwide program [16] . However, vaccine hesitancy remains a major public health problem and becoming a barrier to the prevention and containment of the pandemic [9, 14, 17] . This study aimed to assess healthcare professionals' COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and identify factors aggravating vaccine hesitancy in Ethiopia. Healthcare providers play a critical role in the control and prevention of COVID-19 as frontline workers in treating patients, providing information on preventive measures as well as setting themselves as role models to the community. Despite the fact that HCWs were given priority for vaccination due to their increased risk of infection, a significant COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was reported in many countries which ranged from 8% in the USA to 72.7% in Democratic Republic of Congo [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Similarly, in our survey, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among HCWs was 60.9% which is almost similar to studies conducted among HCWs in the Southern Ethiopia [24] and the general Ethiopian population (68.6%) [25] . Furthermore, when compared to studies conducted in the USA, Saudi Arabia, and China [18, 20, 23] , the higher prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy observed in our study could be explained by the fact that the vast majority HCWs were unsure about the vaccine's safety and effectiveness and they preferred natural immunity over COVID-19 vaccines.",

            "text": "Compared to a study done in the USA (69%) [20] , relatively higher concern on the safety of COVID-19 vaccine (89.5%) was reported in this study. However, our finding mirrors with studies conducted in the USA, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Malta that long and short-term side effects and efficacy of the vaccine, and the possibility to get COVID-19 infection from the vaccine itself associated with the speed at which the vaccines produced were mentioned by the participants as main concerns and additional reasons for vaccine hesitancy. On the other hand, factors such as lack of awareness about the vaccines, inadequate training and communication about the COVID-19 vaccines safety and efficacy by the concerned bodies were reported as factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Hence, building trust regarding the ability of the government and other concerned bodies is crucial. Thus, to increase vaccine uptake and acceptance, the Ethiopian Ministry of Health and other concerned bodies should build strategies such as organize intercultural health advocating sessions for HCWs and the community, increasing knowledge and skill of health advocators in terms of vaccine information and interpersonal communication, engage key community leaders in the information provision, engage vaccine users (HCWs and the community) in providing agreed vaccination information and make informed decisions, engage HCWs in an empathic way and design different vaccine related information communication platforms [32, 33] . Our study showed that younger age and less experienced HCWs had higher odds of vaccine hesitancy compared to those relatively older and more experienced professionals. This could be owing to the active engagement of young HCWs in various social media platforms, which are mostly disseminating negative rumors from unreliable sources [26] and the perceived lesser vulnerability to the infection [20, 30, 31] . In our study, the vast majority of study participants stated that social media was their primary source of information, which could expose them to false and misleading information. Indeed, misleading information regarding COVID-19 vaccinations is quickly circulating on social media, and these erroneous comments about COVID-19 vaccines can have a significant impact on ongoing vaccination campaigns and can pose a threat to global public health [28, 30, 31] .",

In contrary, in another study, nurses had a higher vaccine hesitancy or lower intention to be vaccinated than physicians [25] . Likewise, those who have been working in the pharmacy, laboratory and imaging were more hesitant to get the vaccine. On the other hand, HCWs in the emergency department were more willing to be vaccinated. Our findings mirror other studies that those who had a relatively lower direct patient contact have a reduced perceived risk of COVID-19 infection exposure and worrisome [20, 22, 25, 27] .",

The study participants were also selected using purposive sampling and there might be a selection bias. However, we recruited a large sample size that will improve the power of accuracy. Moreover, our study included HCWs working at various units of both public and private healthcare facilities that is something that has not been thoroughly researched in Ethiopia. Despite these limitations, this study addresses a timely and relevant researched question that has received little attention in Ethiopia and other LMICs. Thus, the findings can be used as an input to devise interventional strategies to minimize vaccine hesitancy and boost uptake by HCWs who are the gatekeepers in the healthcare system, which ultimately could have a significant impact on COVID-19 prevention and containment in the country.",
