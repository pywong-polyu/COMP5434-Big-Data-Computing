The promising development of FR systems over the past years has been challenged by the outbreak of COVID-19. Whilst increased numbers and worse outcomes of cardiac arrests during the pandemic suggest a need for expansion of FR schemes, appropriate risk management is required to protect first responders and patients from contracting COVID-19. This study investigated how European FR schemes were affected by the pandemic and what measures were taken to protect patients and responders from COVID-19.",

Before the COVID-19 outbreak 20 FR systems did not provide any personal protective equipment (PPE). After the outbreak 19 schemes still did not provide any PPE. The majority of schemes experienced falling numbers of accepted call outs and decreasing registrations of new volunteers. Six schemes reported of FR having contracted COVID-19 on a mission.",

During the last decade many different systems were implemented to dispatch first responders (FR) to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . FR are usually alerted by smartphone and arrive earlier on scene than the EMS, leading to an earlier start of CPR [6, [13] [14] [15] . Approximately half of all European countries have implemented-to some degree-FR schemes [16] and the number is growing fast. FR schemes are associated with increased survival [7, [17] [18] [19] . A European registry study indicates, that regions operating such systems have significantly higher OHCA survival rates than other European regions [16] . The American Heart Association guidelines 2020 as well as the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Guidelines 2021 strongly encourage the implementation of FR systems [20, 21] .",

To achieve this, a closer collaboration with the EMS was sought. FR were encouraged to perform an individual risk assessment and to reject alarms, if they felt sick or had any concerns regarding their own health.

The need to teach FR how to use PPE and to communicate a pandemic-specific algorithm appeared to be less, when the majority of FR were health professionals.

This led the majority of systems to suspend their operations at some point. However, the soaring rate of OHCA, the plummeting outcomes as well as the decreased rate of bystander CPR during the pandemic require the FR systems to remain operational [38] . The examples of 'good practice' we have found amongst the respondents demonstrate that the infection risk can be managed and that the challenges the pandemic poses to FR schemes could be overcome [35] . The majority of FR schemes reported that they experienced no criticism regarding their management during COVID-19.",

While this overrepresentation might decrease the external validity, it reflects the current situation, that in most European countries several FR schemes co-exist and are organised and managed independently from each other.
