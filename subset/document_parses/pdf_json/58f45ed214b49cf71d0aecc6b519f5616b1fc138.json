            "text": "Increased unemployment and the deterioration of labour market conditions are one of the main reasons why the COVID-19 crisis could impact fertility intentions and behaviour. After reaching a record high of 13.7% in May 2020 (Statistics Canada, 2020b), and remaining above 9% between March and December 2020, the unemployment rate has decreased in 2021 (Statistics Canada, 2021b) . However, the unemployment rate has remained higher than its pre-pandemic level, at 7.8%, in June 2021 (Statistics Canada, 2021b). The employment rate and self-employment also increased since March 2020 but remained below pre-pandemic levels by June 2021, whereas the underutilization rate remained higher, an indication that more people than before the start of the pandemic are working less than half their usual hours, searching for a job, in temporary lay-offs, or wanting to be employed but not finding a job (Statistics Canada, 2021b) . All these indicators point to increased labour market uncertainty and precariousness, which have been negatively linked to fertility behaviour. Before the pandemic, a meta-analysis of the impacts of unemployment and temporary employment on fertility in Europe showed that individuals who experienced episodes of unemployment tended to delay births (Alderotti et al., 2019) , consistently with the fact that unemployment results in a loss of income and increased uncertainty about future job prospects. This was particularly true of male unemployment and affected births of all ranks (the first birth and subsequent ones). Furthermore, the study showed that the impact of unemployment episodes on fertility became more negative throughout the period from 1970 to 2015.",

More recent examples of declines in fertility following a recession can be found in Europe and in the USA during and after the Great Recession of 2008-2009. Fertility rates decreased and then stagnated in most European regions, particularly those most affected by the recession, reversing in some cases the trends observed the first years of the 2000s towards increasing fertility. Matysiak et al. (2020) recently explored the impact of this recession on fertility in 28 European countries, focusing on the impact of unemployment, long-term unemployment, and GDP decline on fertility at the aggregate level. Unemployment increases had a significant effect, decreasing fertility rates. Moreover, the effect was even more negative during the period of the recession than before its start, suggesting that the impact of unemployment on fertility behaviour may be magnified during times of recessions (Matysiak et al., 2020) .",

This is especially true of some Nordic countries, where the effects of the Great Recession were mild and where fertility decline continued after 2014, when the macroeconomic conditions improved. This led some researchers to focus on the presence of \"fundamental uncertainty\" regarding the future and its impact on childbearing behaviour. Their argument is that fundamental uncertainty regarding the future of the economy, but also of politic systems at a global level, can enter the narratives of individuals regardless of their experiences in the labour market. As \"narratives of uncertainty\" become widespread, births are delayed, even when the economy is going well (Comolli & Vignoli, 2021; Lappeg\u00e5rd et al., 2020; Vignoli et al., 2020) .",

If some adults decided to forego childbearing altogether as a response to the new challenges brought about by the pandemic and its associated economic crisis, younger generations might be more likely to remain childless. Research about changes in fertility intentions before and after the pandemic will be of crucial importance to understand this key aspect of childbearing dynamics.",

Several waves of the CSS contain modules on changes in relationships since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 (such as starting or ending commonlaw unions, marriages and living apart together relationships), as well as a module on changing fertility intentions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was first developed by the Guttmacher Institute (Lindberg et al., 2020) . This module allows estimating not only whether fertility intentions changed in terms of timing of births, but also whether the intended number of children was affected, that is, whether individuals are now planning to have either fewer or more children. A question about the intended total number of children is also asked, allowing for comparisons with the same question in the 2017 General Social Survey (Family Cycle). The first wave of the CSS was conducted between April and June 2021, and the dataset is expected to be released during the fall of 2021. At a later time, the dataset will be linked with administrative data, which will allow assessing the role of policy measures such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) to potentially offset some of the negative labour market impacts.",
