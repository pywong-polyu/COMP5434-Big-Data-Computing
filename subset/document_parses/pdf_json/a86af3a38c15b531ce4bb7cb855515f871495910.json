The hypothesized mechanism underlying this phenomenon is that the type I interferons and multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by the booster vaccine, which induce injection-site and systemic inflammation (side effects), promote an antibody-producing immune response [4] . The vaccine reactogenicity may thus correlate with the immune response.",

A Japanese study among healthcare workers (HCWs) observed higher levels of anti-spike IgG antibodies after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine among those who experienced systemic symptoms [8] . In contrast, a Korean study of HCWs showed no difference in IgG spike titers according to local and systemic reactogenicity grades after the first and second dose of the AZD1222 or BNT162b2 vaccines [6] . However, no studies have reported the immunogenicity in relation to post-vaccination fever, which is an objective measure of systemic reactogenicity as well as an indicator of immunity activation [9, 10] .

The participants were vaccinated with the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) according to the standard protocol (two doses of 30 mg administered 3 weeks apart). As part of the vaccination program, the vaccinated recipients were asked to report their worst local and systemic symptoms and highest body temperature that they might experience within 4 days of vaccination via a web questionnaire. To assess humoral response by the vaccine, we quantitatively measured the IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (the AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay, Abbott ARCHITECT \u00d2 ) in accordance with the manufacturer's package insert (positive threshold: 50.0 [AU/mL]). We also qualitatively measured the IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (Abbott ARCHITECT \u00d2 ; positive threshold: 1.40 [S/C]) to exclude those with previous undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measured the antibodies using blood samples donated 7, 39, and 60-74 days after the second vaccination. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of NCGM, Japan (the approved number: NCGM-A-004175). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.",

We also calculated the mean spike IgG titers according to the grade of local or systemic reactogenicity (Supplementary Appendix 2), with reference to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance [11] . We tested the statistical significance of the differences by comparing the coefficients (i.e., ratios of means) between groups.

All participants were seropositive for spike IgG from 7 through 60-74 days after the second dose of the vaccine. Participants who had a fever of 38.0-38.4\u2103 (ratio of means, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.51) and 38.5\u2103 (ratio of means, 2.18; 95 %CI, 1.41 to 3.36) had significantly higher spike IgG titers at 7 days after the second dose ( Fig. 1 and Supplemental table 1) compared with that in the participants who reported no or slight fever (<37.5\u2103) after the second dose of vaccination. The spike IgG titers tended to decrease with time among all the participants, but participants who experienced a high fever had higher titers than those who had no or slight fever even at both 39 and 60-74 days. The grades of local or systemic reactions were not significantly associated with spike IgG titers (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2 ). These associations were virtually unchanged after excluding those with the prophylaxis use of antipyretics on vaccination.",

This result is consistent with biological mechanisms; type-I interferon is produced as a response of innate immunity after vaccination, triggering adaptive immune response including the differentiation of T follicular helper cells, which promote B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells [4] . Additionally, type-I interferons and other cytokines cause various side reactions, including fever. The onset of fever itself is hypothesized to augment the adaptive immune response [9] . A fever, which is more frequently observed after the second dose of vaccines [1, 3] , may enhance the activation of B cells generated by the first dose of vaccine.",

In the present study, we found no association between systemic reaction gradings and the spike IgG titers. According to the clinical trial of the BNT162b2 vaccine [1] , one-fourth of the placebo recipients reported systemic symptoms (fatigue 23 % and headache 24 %) after the second dose, while only 0.8 % of the recipients reported a high fever of 38.0\u2103.
