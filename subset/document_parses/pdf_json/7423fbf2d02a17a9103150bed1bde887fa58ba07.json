            "text": "Microvascular dysfunction plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of salivary gland disorders. Restoring and preserving microvascular integrity might therefore represent a promising strategy for the treatment of these pathologies. The mechanisms underlying microvascular dysfunction in salivary glands, however, are still obscure, partly due to the unavailability of adequate in vivo models. Here, we present a novel experimental approach that allows comprehensive in vivo analyses of the salivary gland microvasculature in mice. For this purpose, we employed different microscopy techniques including multi-photon in vivo microscopy to quantitatively analyze interactions of distinct immune cell subsets in the submandibular gland microvasculature required for their infiltration into the surrounding parenchyma and their effects on microvascular function. Confocal microscopy and multichannel flow cytometry in tissue sections/homogenates complemented these real-time analyses by determining the molecular phenotype of the participating cells. To this end, we identified key adhesion and signaling molecules that regulate the subset-and tissuespecific trafficking of leukocytes into inflamed glands and control the associated microvascular leakage. Hence, we established an experimental approach that allows in vivo analyses of microvascular processes in healthy and diseased salivary glands. This enables us to delineate distinct pathogenetic factors as novel therapeutic targets in salivary gland diseases.",

Subsequently, these immune cells pass the endothelial barrier, breach the perivascular basement membrane, and subendothelially locomote through gaps between pericytes to finally migrate through the interstitial tissue to their target destination (7, 8) . Neutrophils generally constitute the first leukocyte subset to infiltrate the perivascular tissue, paving the way for other immune cells such as monocytes and lymphocytes (9) . The extravasation of leukocytes is associated with enhanced microvascular permeability, which leads to edema formation, reduced oxygenation, and remodeling of the underlying tissue, thus representing hallmarks of the inflammatory response (10) . These microvascular processes are critically regulated by parenchymal sentinel cells such as tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs), which maintain microvascular homeostasis in intact and inflamed salivary glands (7, 8, (11) (12) (13) .",

            "text": "Noteworthy, leukocyte trafficking is highly subset-, tissue-, and stimulus-specific. In many tissues, intravascular rolling of leukocytes is a prerequisite for their subsequent extravasation to the perivascular space. In hepatic sinusoids, renal glomeruli, and central nervous system microvessels, however, immune cells are able to adhere without the need for such loose endothelial cell interactions (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . In addition, whereas immune cells use the paracellular route (between endothelial cells) to overcome the endothelial barrier in most tissues, they are supposed to use the transcellular transmigration route in the brain by directly penetrating the endothelial cell body (7, 8) . On molecular level, specificity in leukocyte extravasation under certain inflammatory conditions and/or in selected tissues can be explained-at least in part-by differential employment of distinct adhesion/signaling molecules and proteases (e.g., CD62P/P-selectin, CD62E/Eselectin, CD31/PECAM-1, JAM-A, JAM-C, neutrophil elastase, or MMP-9) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Similarly, the mechanisms regulating microvascular permeability are highly tissue-specific: Mirrored by the differences in their microarchitecture and function, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), for example, is tightly sealed to provide protection, whereas the microvasculature of liver and hormone-synthesizing tissues exhibits relatively large endothelial gaps to allow the release of their products into the systemic circulation (10, 23) . In salivary glands, however, the mechanisms underlying the traffi cking of leukocytes from the microvasculature to the perivascular tissue as well as the regulation of microvascular permeability remain obscure.",

For leukocyte trafficking analysis, the internal section embedding the postcapillary venules was exposed by very cautious separation of the salivary gland lobules.

In a first set of experiments, we therefore sought to analyze the trafficking of major leukocyte subsets including neutrophils, classical monocytes and non-classical monocytes, CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes, as well as B lymphocytes to mouse submandibular glands under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. TNF (Tumor necrosis factor) was used as an inflammatory stimulus since it represents one of the most prominent pro-inflammatory cytokines present in various inflammatory disorders including salivary gland pathologies (29, 30) . In gland homogenates of unstimulated animals (superfused with saline only), low numbers of neutrophils, classical monocytes/monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), CD4 + T lymphocytes, CD8 + T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were found by multi-channel flow cytometry, whereas numbers of non-classical monocytes/tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) were significantly higher (Figures 1A, B ; n = 6). Superfusion of the glands with TNF in a very low dose of 0.5 ng per ml saline, which is comparable to TNF levels in blood or saliva of humans with chronically inflamed salivary glands (31), did not significantly alter the number of leukocytes in homogenized submandibular glands (Supplementary Figure 1, n = 6 ). In contrast, superfusion with TNF in the dose of 1 \u03bcg per ml saline, a dose employed for analyzing the effect of TNF on leukocyte trafficking in various organ models (32) (33) (34) , predominantly induced infiltration of neutrophils and classical monocytes/monocytederived macrophages to the inflamed tissue, whereas the numbers of non-classical monocytes/tissue-resident macrophages, CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes, or B lymphocytes remained unaltered ( Figure 1B; n = 6 ). In line with a previous study (35) , these dosedependent effects of TNF indicate that saliva or systemic blood levels of the TNF protein do not directly mirror (local) intraparenchymal TNF protein levels required for the induction of microvascular inflammatory processes such as leukocyte trafficking. Thus, TNF dose-dependently promotes the recruitment of neutrophils and classical monocytes/monocytederived macrophages to salivary glands.",

To evaluate the expression of key adhesion and signaling molecules on the microvascular endothelium of salivary glands, we performed immunostaining and confocal microscopy analyses of gland cryosections. In unstimulated animals, surface expression of CD62P/P-selectin, CD54/ICAM-1, or CD106/VCAM-1 was low on CD31/PECAM-1-positive microvascular endothelial cells. In contrast, stimulation with TNF induced a significant increase in the endothelial expression of CD62P/P-selectin and CD54/ICAM-1 as compared to controls, whereas the endothelial expression of CD106/VCAM-1 remained unchanged (Figures 2A, B; n = 4 ). Our results corroborate previous findings demonstrating a multiplication of the expression levels of CD62P/P-selectin or CD54/ICAM-1 after 5 h of TNF stimulation in different organs (36) .

As effector cells of the adaptive immune system, lymphocytes subsequently employ more specific cellular and humoral mechanisms to further enforce host defense (42) . Previous experimental approaches granted insights into immune cell responses in superficial parenchymal regions of salivary glands (12, (43) (44) (45) but did not allow the visualization and quantitative analysis of the underlying processes in the microvasculature deep inside the gland's parenchyma (7, 8) . In the present study, we therefore combined diverse experimental approaches to explore microcirculatory events in salivary glands. Employing multichannel flow cytometry on tissue homogenates of murine submandibular glands (synonyms in veterinary anatomy: mandibular gland or submaxillary gland), we first sought to basically analyze the trafficking of immune cells to the gland parenchyma (46, 47) . Gland inflammation was induced by superfusion of the cytokine TNF, which represents one of the most prominent inflammatory mediators in salivary gland pathologies (29, 30) . In these experiments, we found that predominantly neutrophils and classical monocytes/monocytederived macrophages accumulate in the inflamed tissue, whereas responses of non-classical monocytes/tissue-resident macrophages, CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes, or B lymphocytes remained absent. These observations extend previous findings in different tissues corroborating TNF as potent, mediator of myeloid leukocyte trafficking. Interestingly, blockade of TNF has recently been reported to attenuate lymphocyte responses in Sj\u00f6gren's-like sialadenitis and other pathologies, pointing to indirect effects of this cytokine on these adaptive immune cells. In this regard, neutrophils and classical monocytes/monocyte-derived macrophages have been demonstrated to modulate activation, proliferation, and recruitment of lymphocytes either in a stimulating [e.g., function as antigen presenting cell, T-cell activation via the microbial metabolite (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMB-PP)] or an inhibiting manner [e.g., by release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), arginase-I (ARG), and TGF-beta, or by expression of PD-L1] (29, 48, 49) .",

            "text": "Extravasation of immune cells from the microvasculature to the perivascular tissue is a highly regulated multi-step process that requires a complex interplay of distinct adhesion and signaling molecules on leukocytes and on microvascular endothelial cells. In many tissues, activated endothelial cells express selectins on their luminal surface to capture circulating leukocytes and to slow them down while rolling on the endothelium. This enables endothelially expressed members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (e.g., CD54/ICAM-1, CD106/ VCAM-1) to interact with leukocyte integrins, ultimately facilitating intravascular adherence and subsequent transmigration of these immune cells into the perivascular parenchyma. Importantly, the endothelial expression of these molecules and their functional relevance for leukocyte trafficking is highly tissue-specific (8, 19, 22) . Using immunostaining and confocal microscopy on tissue cryosections (26, 27) , surface levels of CD62P/P-selectin and CD54/ICAM-1, but not of CD106/VCAM-1, were significantly enhanced on microvascular endothelial cells of inflamed glands as compared to unstimulated controls. Functional experiments further revealed that CD54/ICAM-1 and-to a lesser extent-CD62P/ P-selectin promote the trafficking of neutrophils and classical monocytes/monocyte-derived macrophages to the gland's parenchyma, emphasizing the major role of these adhesion and signaling molecules for the regulation of myeloid leukocyte responses. Although CD62P/P-selectin and CD54/ICAM-1 are required for leukocyte infiltration of liver, kidney, lung, brain, or peritoneum (50, 51) , these molecules are dispensable for immune cell trafficking under specific inflammatory conditions such experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or lymphocyte transmigration into secondary lymphoid organs (15, 52) . Conversely, CD106/VCAM-1 is not required for leukocyte responses in chronic vasculitis but is critical, e.g., for fine ambient particle matter-induced lung injury (53, 54) .",

For this purpose, we gently dissected the different lobes of the submandibular gland in anesthetized mice to gain access to the microvasculature deep inside the gland's parenchyma. Subsequently, endothelial interactions of blood cells were identified by in vivo immunostaining and multi-channel in vivo microscopy. In unstimulated gland microvessels, only few intravascular rolling and adherent leukocytes were observed, most probably due to a minimal surgical trauma as reported in different experimental models such as the cremaster muscle or the mesentery (55, 56) . Consistent with our previous findings in tissue homogenates, induction of inflammation by TNF, however, induced a strong increase in intravascular rolling and firm adherence of neutrophils as well as classical monocytes in postcapillary venules but not in capillaries or arterioles. This intravascular accumulation of myeloid leukocytes required CD62P/P-selectin and CD54/ICAM-1 (7, 8) . Mechanistically, selectins such as CD62P/P-selectin mediate molecular interactions characterized by rapid association/dissociation rates, thus allowing them to initiate the initial contact and the subsequent high velocity rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium under shear. In contrast, adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily including CD54/ICAM-1 recognize specific integrins on the surface of rolling leukocytes, hence promoting more stable interactions of immune cells with microvascular endothelial cells (7, 8) . Accordingly, rolling neutrophils and classical monocytes demonstrated a reduced rolling velocity in inflamed submandibular glands as compared to unstimulated controls. The rolling velocity of the few remaining . Quantitative data is shown in (B); mean \u00b1 SEM for n = 6; *p < .05 vs. isotype control + saline; # p < .05 vs. isotype control + TNF; n.s., non significant).",

Consequently, our data suggest that CD54/ICAM-1 represents as a key regulator of myeloid leukocyte responses in the inflamed salivary gland microvasculature. In addition to their interplay with endothelial cells, immune cells interact with each other during their extravasation to the perivascular tissue (37) . In the microvasculature of unstimulated glands, interactions of neutrophils and monocytes were absent. Upon onset of inflammation, however, loose and, later, more intense interactions of intravascularly accumulating neutrophils and monocytes gradually increased. These events particularly supported the extravasation of classical monocytes/monocytederived macrophages since infiltration of inflamed glands with these immune cells was severely compromised in neutropenic animals. These findings extend previous reports of neutrophildriven extravasation of classical monocytes in peritoneum, lung, and brain. Here, it has been shown that neutrophils deposit released granule proteins (e.g., CCL3/MIP-1a, CCL2/MCP-1, LL-37) andin advanced stages of disease-'find me' and 'eat me' signals on the microvascular endothelium and in the parenchyma, thus promoting intravascular adhesion and subsequent extravasation of classical monocytes (57) .",

            "text": "Beyond immune cell trafficking, enhanced microvascular permeability is a hallmark of the inflammatory response, ultimately leading to edema formation, remodeling, and reduced oxygenation of the affected tissue (10) . To measure microvascular leakage in salivary glands, we employed multi-photon microscopy to determine the extravasation of intravenously applied FITClabeled dextran from postcapillary venules in real time. Importantly, the salivary gland microvasculature supports the formation of primary saliva via a basal, physiological permeability for water and small molecules (<70 kDa), a process regulated by tight junctions between microvascular endothelial cells (58) . To measure hyperpermeability in inflamed salivary glands, we therefore used high molecular weight FITC-labeled dextran molecules (500 kDa) in our experiments. Accordingly, no leakage of FITC dextran to the perivascular space was observed under unstimulated conditions. Induction of inflammation, however, strongly enhanced gland microvascular permeability. This process was critically dependent on the presence of neutrophils as evidenced in neutropenic animals. On molecular level, these immune cells promote endothelial permeability via secretion of chemokines (e.g., CXCL 1, 2, 3, and 8), arachidonic acid, ATP, or adhesion-dependent processes such as integrins interacting with endothelial adhesion and signaling molecules (e.g., CD54/ICAM-1) (40) . In summary, our experimental data indicate that TNF promotes micro-and perivascular accumulation of myeloid leukocytes as well as subsequent microvascular hyperpermeability in salivary glands. Consequently, the previously reported beneficial effects of pharmacological TNF blockade on salivary gland function in autoimmune Sj\u00f6gren's-like sialadenitis (29, 48) might be-at least in part-due to interference with these TNF-dependent microvascular processes.",
