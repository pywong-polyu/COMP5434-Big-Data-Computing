For applicants, the on-site interview is an important opportunity not only to meet future peers, colleagues, and mentors, but also to learn more about the culture of the university and the surrounding neighborhood where they may be spending the next few years of their lives. However, in light of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (CAU : PleasenotethatCOVID \u00c0 19hasbeendefinedasCoronavirusDisease2019inthesentenceHowe OVID-19) pandemic, a number of programs have announced plans to eliminate inperson interviews and instead have virtual interviews [1] [2] [3] [4] . Popular video platforms, including Gather, Webex, and Zoom, offer an alternative to the traditional in-person interviews during times of social distancing and university-wide travel restrictions. However, while these formats may be familiar for participating in classes or staying connected with friends, many young scientists are less experienced with virtual school or job interviews. Here, we offer a list of 10 simple rules to assist early-stage scientists with virtual interviews in an academic or scientific setting.",

Since many admission committees and potential mentors will search for applicants' social media profiles, it is good to be mindful of damaging, inappropriate content. A post that is funny to one person may be interpreted in different ways by different audiences. One recommendation is to have both a professional and a private social media account and to clean up any old, unused accounts. Depending upon your career stage, it may be helpful to create a professional-looking web page to highlight your accomplishments and build a personal brand. There are many free or low-cost platforms that let people create a website without the need for much programming experience [5] .",

While a virtual interview allows you to choose comfortable attire options, it is important to show you have a certain degree of respect for the interviewer. If, for example, a program is known to be very formal, this may mean a jacket and tie or pants suit. However, if the program is more relaxed, a business casual sweater, button-down shirt/blouse, or a professional-looking dress can be substituted for a suit. Equally important, do not rely on the fact that the camera only shows your upper body. You may need to stand up or walk to a different room during the interview, so it is important to dress from head to toe. In some cases, graduate programs recognize that it is often your first experience with professional interviews, and they will recommend a dress code. Use this as a helpful guide when deciding what to wear, and if you are still in doubt, ask a trusted advisor or mentor. Asking about this will not reflect negatively. Ultimately, it is important to wear attire that is suitable but also makes you feel comfortable, so you can relax and concentrate on the task at hand.",

Download and install any programs or apps that may be required (e.g., Zoom, Webex, etc.), and try a practice call with a friend or colleague to check the sound and video connection. One common audio problem is static or background noise. A simple pair of earbuds or headphones can be used to reduce the noise and improve sound quality. In addition to testing the audio and video, ensure that the default screen name associated with the account is professional (Rule 1). When possible, it is strongly recommended that an Ethernet connection is used instead of a wireless connection. Using a wired connection can also improve problems with lagging or freezing video. If you are using a wireless connection, try to avoid free or guest networks if possible, as the connection may lag or be unsecured. Sometimes, unforeseen difficulties arise (Rule 7). We all run into issues with technology, and technical problems are often easily forgiven. Remaining calm and working through the problem is a chance to demonstrate how you handle unexpected challenges or stress.",

            "text": "In addition to preparing technology, preparing your environment can help ensure a smooth process on the day of the interview. As the old adage goes, \"Location! Location! Location!\" Location is important to ensure an interview free of distractions for both you and the interviewer, so that you can give it your full focus and attention. Take the time to identify a quiet space with good acoustics. For some, this might be a personal bedroom, living area, or even a large closet. For others, this space may be a conference room or office in the lab. In some cases, you might ask your advisor to help you locate a quiet space for the interview. Many trainees may not have the option of leaving home for an interview. If you live with roommates, children, or even pets, it is important to develop a plan. Inform your roommates or family members of your interview in advance. On the morning of the interview, remind them again, and hang a sign on the door, indicating that you should not be disturbed. For those with children or pets, one option might be to have a trusted family member or friend watch them. If this is not an option, inform your interviewers at the beginning of any situations that may require your attention. If you encounter difficulty identifying the perfect location, you can use technology to your advantage, such as headphones with built-in noise reduction that are designed for gaming or making phone calls.",

            "text": "Once your quiet space has been identified, there are a few additional items that you can prepare to ensure a smooth interview. It is important to check the lighting in the room. Changing the lighting angle or the position of your desk with regard to the lighting can help you avoid strange light halos around your head or screen glare if you wear glasses. Along with the lighting, be sure your camera view is free of clutter. If you are unable to change the camera angle, many video platforms offer the ability to use a blurred or virtual background. If you decide to use one of these options, be sure to test it when you test your technology. As in Rule 1, make sure the virtual background you select is appropriate. Be aware of where the camera is pointing so you can make eye contact with your interviewer, especially if you have multiple screens. It can be helpful to use books or other materials to elevate your computer so that your camera naturally sits at eye level. Most virtual platforms allow you to rearrange the layout of the windows. By moving the video of the interviewer directly beneath the camera, it gives the appearance that you are looking directly at the interviewer. Additionally, many platforms provide a self-view that will allow you to see how you appear on camera. However, be mindful that looking at yourself may be distracting. If you notice you are looking at yourself too frequently, many video platforms allow you the option of hiding this view so you can more easily focus on the other person.",

Check that all technology (laptop, headphones, etc.) are plugged in and at full charge. Lastly, silence your phone, and close any applications or websites with popup notifications and distracting sounds. An advantage of a virtual interview is that you have some control over the setting for your interview.

This can help you prepare for common opening questions such as \"Tell me about yourself,\" and \"Why are you interested in this position?\" The person speaking with you is trying to select someone they will be excited to have as a new colleague. Therefore, you want to convey your identity as a scientist and show that you have thought about your research. It can be helpful to make two to three broad overview slides describing your past research topic(s), findings, and implications. Make sure you know ahead of time how to share the slides you prepared with the video application you plan to use. It is important to practice mock interviews and practice talks with peers and mentors. As with inperson interviews, you should be prepared to answer questions about your past research, as well as the topics you are interested in studying in the future [7] . You may decide to take short handwritten or typed notes during the interview (these can be helpful for a follow-up email; Rule 9). Be aware your interviewer is likely to take the cue that you are taking notes more readily if you are briefly looking down from the camera. Consider taking notes or recording impressions between interviews to avoid unnecessary distractions.",

Often, a schedule will be shared with you ahead of the interview so you know which people you will be meeting. Take the opportunity to learn about the individuals before you begin the interviews. Faculty websites can be a great starting point to learn more about the research directions of a lab, providing an opportunity to connect with students in your field of interest. However, keep in mind that not all professors update their websites regularly. Often, the best way to learn about current research directions is by reading recent research papers published by the lab. Familiarizing yourself with recent publications and knowing the accomplishments of your interviewer will naturally make you a better conversationalist as you will more easily be able to ask intelligent questions or discuss specific research ideas. In many graduate school interviews, you may interview with an older student or current members of a research group. Take this as an opportunity to ask questions about topics such as teaching classes, living arrangements, or why the older student selected this program. While this portion of the interview may feel less formal, it can give you some important information.",

Bringing a list of questions to interviews is common and ensures that you cover all the topics that you intended. Table 1 contains examples of questions you may be asked or that you could ask current students or professors. As everyone has a different perspective, it can be beneficial to ask multiple people (professors, students, etc.) the same types of questions and compare the answers you receive.",

Small adjustments to heighten your focus during an interview can help.

Between interviews, quickly skim your notes to refresh your memory of the person you will be speaking with, as well as any specific questions you had for that person. Remember, you are both interviewing each other! Additionally, it is important to take a break between interviews. Although the itinerary might not allow for long breaks, if you are feeling stiff after a long period of sitting, try to find a couple of minutes to perform some simple stretches. Even something as simple as walking to a different room can give your muscles a chance to move and allow your eyes a break from the screen. If there is time allotted for longer breaks, try to plan snacks or meals to align with your schedule. It's better to stick with familiar foods and not eat or drink anything that you would not normally consume.",

            "text": "In virtual interviews, it can sometimes be difficult to know when another person is done speaking. If a question is asked of you, take a moment to pause to ensure that the other person has completed their thought before you begin to answer. When communicating, it can be beneficial to engage in body language to show interest during your interview. However, distractions such as pen tapping or fidgeting may take attention away from you and what you're saying [6] . If you know that you are prone to such activities, try placing your hands on your lap or the armrest of your chair where they will not be seen unless necessary [8] . Sometimes, technical questions are best answered by drawing on a white board, which may not be straightforward during a virtual interview. You may be able to use specialized software that allows you to share a screen and draw a concept in real time. These software options are becoming more widely available and evolving as virtual interviews continue. If these options are not available, you could also attempt to position a white board in the view of the camera. As in Rule 2, practice with a friend or labmate before the interview to ensure full visibility. Similarly, if you are uncertain about certain aspects of the interview itself, do not hesitate to seek clarification. It is better to ask questions than to guess at what the other person wants or expects. In some cases, you may be assigned a point of contact for the interview. This could be another student, an administrator, or even the professor. The goal of the contact person is to help you have a smooth interview experience. If you have any questions about the itinerary, the format for the interview, or are having technical issues, do not hesitate to ask. If for whatever reason the contact person is busy, others are usually more than happy to help you.",

This is particularly true in an era of video interviews, when you might not have the opportunity to interact with students, professors, or the surrounding neighborhood. Given the limitations of virtual interviews, visiting the campus or surrounding area will help establish context when talking to people about the environment. If the university offers a \"second look\" video tour or an opportunity to email or chat with students prior to accepting an offer of admission, take the time to learn more about the choices you are facing.
