Recent studies suggest that up to 15% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections develop gastrointestinal symptoms. The location of virus-host cell receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 has an important role in the pathophysiology and presentation of disease. They are expressed in the respiratory tract, as well as other organs and tissues including exocrine and endocrine pancreatic cells. These cells are therefore a possible target for the virus, which could explain the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and pancreatic injury. We report a disastrous collateral effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on a 33-year-old man with chronic renal insufficiency and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, who developed acute pancreatitis. Inflammation progressed rapidly toward necrosis and the development of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm which subsequently ruptured, causing death.",

Most (80.9%) patients with mild or moderate disease present with fever, cough, tiredness, and loss of taste or smell. 1, 2 However, recent studies show that up to 15% of patients with Covid-19 develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain; gastrointestinal complaints as the only symptoms of disease are estimated to be present in about 10% of patients. 3 Besides the respiratory tract, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus-host cell receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and trans-membrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are also expressed in other organs and tissues, which affects the pathophysiology and presentation of disease. 4, 5 In the pancreas, the receptors are expressed in both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic cells, making them a potential target for the virus, which explains the potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and pancreatic injury. 4, 6 Covid-19 is best known for causing thrombotic complications; 7 however, an increasing number of studies indicate that blood coagulation can be altered in terms of increased propensity to bleeding, regardless of the use of thromboprophylaxis. 8, 9 While most cases of acute pancreatitis in patients with Covid-19 are mild and selflimiting, complications in the form of progression to necrosis have been reported. [10] [11] [12] However, to our knowledge, little is known about pancreatic complications, and there are no previous reports about the severe forms of acute pancreatitis complicated with pseudoaneurysm formation even though the management of patients affected with this can be problematic. We report a patient who developed acute necrotic pancreatitis during Covid-19, which was further complicated by pseudoaneurysm development and its rupture manifesting as acute gastrointestinal bleeding.",

Abdominal ultrasound showed an empty gallbladder, and an enlarged and edematous pancreas with no peripancreatic collections. The patient denied alcohol and tobacco consumption, and having taken any medications known to cause pancreatitis. His medical history included hypertension and mild chronic renal insufficiency.

Surgical consultation was immediately obtained and progression towards pancreatic necrosis was suspected. Abdominal CT examination with intravenous contrast administration revealed acute necrotic collections, similar to walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN), involving the pancreatic head and pancreaticoduodenal groove. These had a compressive effect on the distal common bile duct with consequent incipient biliary dilatation.

The prognosis mainly depends on the development of organ failure and secondary infection of the pancreas or peripancreatic necrosis. 15 Although alcohol abuse and gallstones are considered two main causes of acute pancreatitis, other etiologic agents have been identified including viral infections. This could reflect the fact that the pancreas, like many other organs, contains high numbers of ACE2 receptors in both islet cells and the exocrine gland, which is one receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells. Indeed, Schepis et al. showed that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected and isolated from the pseudocyst content in patients with acute pancreatitis. 16 Besides ACE2 receptors and virus tropism for pancreatic cells, other factors such as treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and glucocorticosteroids should be considered in the etiology of COVID-19-induced pancreatic injury. 17 Additionally, pancreatic injury might be caused by an inadequate immune reaction and the development of a cytokine storm, leading to endothelial cell damage with consecutive signs of multiorgan dysfunction. 18 All of these etiological factors are likely to have influenced the development of necrotic pancreatitis in our patient.",

            "text": "The risk of rupture represents the most serious complication of pseudoaneurysms that have developed from necrotic pancreatitis. 22 To the best of our knowledge, there is no specified period of time in which a rupture could occur. In the case of rupture, a pseudoaneurysm typically manifests as melena, bleeding in the pancreatic or bile duct, or a massive hemorrhage in the peritoneal cavity with acute abdominal pain and shock. 19 Unfortunately, our patient's pseudoaneurysm ruptured shortly after its detection on CT examination. Therefore, we recommend that patients with postinflammatory peripancreatic necrotic collections should be monitored intensively in the weeks following their detection. 23 The rapid progression of necrotic pancreatitis and pseudoaneurysm rupture in our patient followed by massive gastrointestinal bleeding might have been accelerated by damage to the intestinal mucosa associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, patients with Covid-19 were recently reported to be at a high risk of such bleeding, 24, 25 likely because of vasodilation and hyperemia of the intestinal mucosa which frequently occur in these patients. 26 Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can have a direct cytotoxic effect on the gut, 27 while coagulopathy can occur following the prolonged use of anticoagulant drugs for thromboprophylaxis. 28 The management of pseudoaneurysms depends on their dimensions and the patient's condition. Modern interventional radiology provides minimally invasive endovascular treatment, which is increasingly used because of improved technical capabilities and low morbidity rates. 29 Angioembolization offers exceptional diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities for the precise identification and localization of the pseudoaneurysm. Additionally, exclusion of the blood vessel responsible for pseudoaneurysm formation from circulation can be achieved by stenting or embolization. 29, 30 Conclusion The association between Covid-19 and acute pancreatitis is not fully understood and further research into this area is needed. However, necrotic acute pancreatitis appears to be a rare but serious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while pseudoaneurysm formation following WOPN can be life-threatening. Taking into account the unpredictability of rupture, as in our case, urgent endovascular treatment is required to prevent a fatal outcome.",
