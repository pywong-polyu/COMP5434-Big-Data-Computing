Apart from the most basic use case, which is remote viewing, digital pathology includes use cases such as archiving, 2 research, 3 4 teaching, 5 6 streamlining multidisciplinary meetings, 2 remote diagnosis (eg, frozen sections), 7 remote consultation 8 9 and primary diagnostics [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] for which proper validation studies have been performed. 14 15 The worldwide 2020 COVID-19 crisis provided healthcare in general with tremendous challenges, and even though pathology may not have been in the primary line of fire, pathology labs need to find new ways of working to adapt to the volatile circumstances caused by the virus. Submitted specimens and autopsies need to be treated as potentially infectious. Rising number of infections create staffing shortages and other hospital departments might require pathology employees to fill more urgent positions. Furthermore, lockdown measures and social distancing caused many people to stay and work from home. During this crisis, it became clearer than ever what an asset digital diagnostics is to keep pathologists, residents, molecular biologists and pathology assistants engaged in the diagnostic process in a responsible way, as described below.",

As soon as the glass slides are ready, they are moved to our scanning facility where they are digitised. The scanned slides are added to the correct case based on the barcode and metadata information, and complete cases are automatically assigned to the proper worklist in the PACS based on the type of material, requesting physician or clinic, accession number and age of the patient. We have created a large number of worklists to accommodate all teams of organ specialists. A large part of our weekly workflow is the participation in multidisciplinary meetings for which we have created dedicated recurring worklists where pathologists can add cases by simply right-clicking on a particular examination to add to the worklist.",

The PACS employs a direct archive access protocol that permits us to view the archived cases without the need to retrieve them from archive (an otherwise time-consuming operation), which effectively permits us to access the history of a patient since 2008.",

Social distancing on the premises was maintained as much as possible, making sure there would be 1.5 m between individuals whenever possible during face-to-face meetings, coffee and lunch breaks, etc. The central hospital restaurants were closed during the crisis and replaced by food brought from home or food collected from several smaller take-away spots spread over the hospital.",
