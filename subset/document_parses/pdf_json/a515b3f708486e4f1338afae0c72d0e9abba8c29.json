            "text": "This study was sought to investigate the feasibility of using smartphone-based breathing sounds within a deep learning framework to discriminate between COVID-19, including asymptomatic, and healthy subjects. A total of 480 breathing sounds (240 shallow and 240 deep) were obtained from a publicly available database named Coswara. These sounds were recorded by 120 COVID-19 and 120 healthy subjects via a smartphone microphone through a website application. A deep learning framework was proposed herein that relies on hand-crafted features extracted from the original recordings and from the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as well as deep-activated features learned by a combination of convolutional neural network and bi-directional long short-term memory units (CNN-BiLSTM). The statistical analysis of patient profiles has shown a significant difference (pvalue: 0.041) for ischemic heart disease between COVID-19 and healthy subjects. The Analysis of the normal distribution of the combined MFCC values showed that COVID-19 subjects tended to have a distribution that is skewed more towards the right side of the zero mean (shallow: 0.59\u00b11.74, deep: 0.65\u00b14.35, p-value: <0.001). In addition, the proposed deep learning approach had an overall discrimination accuracy of 94.58% and 92.08% using shallow and deep recordings, respectively. Furthermore, it detected COVID-19 subjects successfully with a maximum sensitivity of 94.21%, specificity of 94.96%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves of 0.90. Among the 120 COVID-19 participants, asymptomatic subjects (18 subjects) were successfully detected with 100.00% accuracy using shallow recordings and 88.89% using deep recordings. This study paves the way towards utilizing smartphone-based breathing sounds for the purpose of COVID-19 detection. The observations found in this study were promising to suggest deep learning and smartphone-based breathing sounds as an effective pre-screening tool for COVID-19 alongside the current reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. It can be considered as an early, rapid, easily distributed, time-efficient, and almost no-cost diagnosis technique complying with social distancing restrictions during COVID-19 pandemic.",

According to the world heath organization (WHO) April 2021 report [2] , there have been nearly 150 million confirmed cases and over 3 million deaths since the pandemic broke out in 2019. Additionally, the United States (US) have reported the highest number of cumulative cases and deaths with over 32.5 million and 500,000, respectively. These huge numbers have caused many healthcare services to be severely burdened especially with the ability of the virus to develop more genomic variants and spread more readily among people. India, which is one of the world's biggest suppliers of vaccines, is now severely suffering from the pandemic after the explosion of cases due to a new variant of COVID-19. It has reached more than 17.5 million confirmed cases, setting it behind the US as the second worst hit country [2, 3] .",

In most reported cases, the virus remains incubation for a period of 1 to 14 days before the symptoms of an infection start arising [4] . Patients carrying COVID-19 have exhibited common signs and symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, and other acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS) [5, 6] . Most infected people suffer from mild to moderate viral symptoms, however, they end up by being recovered. On the other hand, patients who develop severe symptoms such as severe pneumonia are mostly people over 60 years of age with conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), hypertension, and cancer [4, 5] . On most cases, the early diagnosis of COVID-19 helps in preventing its spreading and development to severe infection stages. This is usually done by following steps of early patient isolation and contact tracing. Furthermore, timely medication and efficient treatment reduces symptoms and results in lowering the mortality rate of this pandemic [7] .",

The integration of computed tomography (CT) screening (X-ray radiations) is another effective diagnostic tool (sensitivity \ufffd90%) that often provides supplemental information about the severity and progression of COVID-19 in lungs [11, 12] . CT imaging is not recommended for patients at the early stages of the infection, i.e., showing asymptomatic to mild symptoms.

            "text": "Most recently, several studies have utilized the new emerging algorithms in artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and classify COVID-19 in CT and X-ray images [14] . Machine and deep learning algorithms were implemented in several studies (taking CT images as inputs) with a discrimination accuracy reaching over 95% between healthy and infected subjects [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The major contribution of these studies is the ability of trained models including support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) in detecting COVID-19 in CT images with minimal pre-processing steps. Moreover, several studies have utilized deep learning with extra feature fusion techniques and entropy-controlled optimization [21] , rank-based average pooling [22] , pseudo-Zernike moment (PZM) [23] , and internet-of-things [24] to detect COVID-19 in CT images. In addition, there has been extensive research carried out for COVID-19 assessment using X-ray images and machine learning [25] [26] [27] . Majority of the current state-of-art approaches rely on two-dimensional (2D) X-ray images of the lungs to train neural networks on extracting features and thus identifying subjects carrying the viral infection. Despite of the high levels of accuracy achieved in most of the studies, CT and X-ray imaging use ionizing radiations that make them not feasible for frequent testing. In addition, these imaging modalities may not be available in all public healthcare services, especially for countries who are swamped with the pandemic, due to their costs and additional maintenance requirements. Most recently, researchers have utilized a safer and simpler imaging approach based on ultrasound to screen lungs for COVID-19 [28] and achieved high levels of performance (accuracy > 89%). Therefore, finding promising alternatives that are simple, fast, and cost-effective is an ultimate goal to researchers when it comes to integrating these techniques with machine learning.",

Respiratory auscultation is considered as a safe and non-invasive technique to diagnose the respiratory system and its associated organs. This technique is usually done by clinicians using an electronic stethoscope to hear and record the air sound moving inside and outside lungs while breathing or coughing. Thus, an indication of any pulmonary anomalies could be detected and identified [30] [31] [32] . Due to the simplicity in recording respiratory signals, lung sounds could carry useful information about the viral infection, and thus, could set an early alert to the patient before moving on with further and extensive medication procedures. In addition, combining the simple respiratory signals with AI algorithms could be a key to enhance the sensitivity of detection for positive cases due to its ability to generalize over a wide set of data with less computational complexity [33] .",

In addition, a telemedicine approach was also explored to observe evidences on the sequential changes in respiratory sounds as a result of COVID-19 infection [38] . Most recently, AI was utilized in one study to recognize COVID-19 in cough signals [39] and in another to evaluate the severity of patients' illness, sleep quality, fatigue, and anxiety through speech recordings [40] . Despite of the high levels of performance achieved in the aforementioned AI-based studies, further investigations on the capability of respiratory sounds in carrying useful information about COVID-19 are still required, especially when embedded within the framework of sophisticated AI-based algorithms. Furthermore, due to the explosion in the number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases all over the world, it is essential to ensure providing a system capable of recognizing the disease in signals recording through portable devices, such as computers or smartphones, instead of regular clinic-based electronic stethoscopes.",

Although the current gold standard, RT-PCR, provides high success rates in detecting the viral infection, it has various limitations including the high expenses involved with equipment and chemical agents, requirement of expert nurses and doctors for diagnosis, violation of social distancing, and the long testing time required to obtain results (2-3 days). Thus, the development of a deep learning model overcomes most of these limitations and allows for a better revival in the healthcare and economic sectors in several countries.",

The project is a worldwide respiratory data collection effort that was first initiated in August, 7th 2020. Ever since, it has collected data from more than 1,600 participants (Male: 1185, Female: 415) from allover the world (mostly Indian population). The database was approved by the Indian institute of science (IISc), human ethics committee, Bangalore, India, and conforms to the ethical principles outlined in the declaration of Helsinki. No personally identifiable information about participants was collected and the participants' data was fully anonymized during storage in the database. A graphical abstract of the complete procedure followed in this study. The input data includes breathing sounds collected from an open-access database for respiratory sounds (Coswara [41] ) recorded via smartphone microphone. The data includes a total of 240 participants, out of which 120 subjects were suffering from COVID-19, while the remaining 120 were healthy (control group). A deep learning framework was then utilized based on handcrafted features extracted by feature engineering techniques, as well as deep-activated features extracted by a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural network. The performance was then evaluated and further discussed on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) as a successful pre-screening tool for COVID-19. The database includes breath, cough, and voice sounds acquired via crowdsourcing using an interactive website application that was built for smartphone devices [43] . The average interaction time with the application was 5-7 minutes. All sounds were recorded using the microphone of a smartphone and sampled with a sampling frequency of 48 kHz. The participants had the freedom to select any device for recording their respiratory sounds, which reduces device-specific bias in the data. The audio samples (stored in. WAV format) for all participants were manually curated through a web interface that allows multiple annotators to go through each audio file and verify the quality as well as the correctness of labeling. All participants were requested to keep a 10 cm distance between the face and the device before starting the recording.",

The advantage of following such process is that it can extract internal and hidden information within input data, i.e., sounds, and represent it as single or multiple values [47] . Thus, additional knowledge about the input data can be obtained and used for further analysis and evaluation. Hand-crafted features were initially extracted from the original breathing recordings, then, they were also extracted from the MFCC transformation of the signals. The features included in this study are, Kurtosis and skewness: In statistics, kurtosis is a quantification measure for the degree of extremity included within the tails of a distribution relative to the tails of a normal distribution. The more the distribution is outlier-prone, the higher the kurtosis values, and vice-versa. A kurtosis of 3 indicates that the values follow a normal distribution. On the other hand, skewness is a measure for the asymmetry of the data that deviates it from the mean of the normal distribution. If the skewness is negative, then the data are more spread towards the left side of the mean, while a positive skewness indicates data spreading towards the right side of the mean [48] . A skewness of zero indicates that the values follow a normal distribution. Kurtosis (k) and skewness (s) can be calculated as,",

Furthermore, the number of filters increases as the network becomes deeper, that is 16, 32, and 64, respectively. Each convolutional layer was followed by a max-pooling layer to reduce the dimensionality as well as the complexity in the model. The max-pooling kernel size decreases as the network gets deeper with a [8, 1] , [4, 1] , and [2, 1] kernels for the three max-pooling layers, respectively. It is worth noting that each max-pooling layer was followed by a batch normalization (BN) layer to normalize all filters as well as by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) layer to set all values less than zero in the feature map to zero. The complete structure is illustrated in Fig 4. The network continues with additional extraction of temporal features through bi-directional LSTM units. In recurrent neural networks, LSTM units allows for the detection of long short-term dependencies between time sequence data points.

This could be related to the hidden characteristics of COVID-19 contaminated within lungs and exhibited during lung inhale and exhale [35, 38, 76] . Additionally, the MFCC transformation of COVID-19 and healthy subjects' recordings returned similar observations. By quantitatively evaluating these coefficients when combined, COVID-19 subjects had a unique distribution (positively skewed) that can be easily distinguished from the one of healthy subjects. This gives an indication about the importance of further extracting the internal attributes carried not only by the recordings themselves, but rather by the additional MFC transformation of such recordings. Additionally, the asymptomatic subjects had a distribution of values that was close in shape to the distribution of healthy subjects, however, it was skewed towards the right side of the zero mean. This may be considered as a strong attribute when analyzing COVID-19 patients who do not exhibit any symptoms and thus, discriminating them easily from healthy subjects.",

Deep learning not only provides high levels of performance, it also reduces the dependency on experts, i.e., clinicians and nurses, who are now suffering in handling the pandemic due to the huge and rapidly increasing number of infected patients [77] [78] [79] . Recently, the detection of COVID-19 using deep learning has reached high levels of accuracy through two-dimensional (2D) lung CT images [80] [81] [82] . Despite of such performance in discriminating and detecting COVID-19 subjects, CT imaging is considered high in cost and requires extra time to acquire testing data and results. Furthermore, it utilizes excessive amount of ionizing radiations (X-ray) that are usually harmful to the human body, especially for severely affected lungs. Therefore, the integration of biological sounds, as in breathing recordings, within a deep learning framework overcomes the aforementioned limitations, while at the same time provides acceptable levels of performance.",

The high sensitivity and specificity measures (94.21% and 94.96%, respectively) obtained in this study prove the efficiency of deep learning in distinguishing COVID-19 subjects (AUROC: 0.90). Additionally, it supports the field of deep learning research on the use of respiratory signals for COVID-19 diagnostics [39, 83] . Alongside the high performance levels, it was interesting to observe a 100.00% accuracy in predicting asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects.

However, it was interesting to observe that muscle pain was significant, which matches with the previous WHO reports that states a percentage of 14.8% among COVID-19 subjects studied in China [87] .
