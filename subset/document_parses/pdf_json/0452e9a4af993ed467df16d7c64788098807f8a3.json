            "text": "One of the main problems in scientometrics is to explore the factors that affect the growth of citations in publications to identify best practices of research policy to increase the diffusion of scientific research and knowledge in science and society. The principal purpose of this study is to analyze how research funding affects the citation-based performance of scientific output in vital research fields of life science, which is a critical province (area of knowledge) in science to improve the wellbeing of people. This study uses data from the Scopus database in 2015 (to assess the impact on citations in 2021, after more than 5 years) concerning different disciplines of life science, given by \"agricultural and biological sciences\", \"biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology\", \"Immunology and microbiology\", \"neuroscience\" and \"pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics\". Results demonstrate that although journals publish un-funded articles more than funded publications in all disciplines of life science, the fraction of total citations in funded papers is higher than the share in the total number of publications. In short, funded documents receive more citations than un-funded papers in all research fields of life science under study. Findings also support that citations of total (funded + un-funded), funded, and un-funded published papers have a power-law distribution in all five research fields of life science. Original results here reveal a general property in scientific development: funded research has a higher scaling potential than un-funded publications. Critical implications of research policy, systematized in a decision-making matrix, suggest that R&D investments in \"Neuroscience\" can generate a positive impact of scientific results in science and society-in terms of citations-higher than other research fields in medicine. Overall, then, results here can explain some characteristics driving scientific change and help policymakers and scholars to allocate resources towards research fields that facilitate the development and diffusion of scientific research and knowledge in life science for positive societal impact.",

            "text": "Several studies in scientometrics have investigated the role of different factors in scientific change, such as public research labs, publications, emerging research fields, nations' research performance, etc. (Coccia, 2005a (Coccia, , 2005b (Coccia, , 2009 (Coccia, , 2019a Coccia et al., 2015; Pagliaro & Coccia, 2021; Radicchi et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018) . A central question in social studies of science is how to enhance the diffusion of scientific research in vital research fields, such as medicine, to increase societal impact. In scientometrics, the scientific performance of papers has been investigated by many scholars, such as Li et al. (2013) that focus on the role of authorship network's impact on publication performance. Scholars also analyze the effects of institutions' collaboration on citation performance, including ranking of academic affiliation (Petersen, 2014) or the scaling relationship between journals' impact and scientific performance (Larivi\u00e8re, 2010; Thelwall & Wilson, 2014) . Other studies investigate the impact of multiple funding on citation performance (MacLean, 1998) , the impact factor of journals (Campanario et al., 2011) , the relationship between public/private funding and scientific production in nanotechnology (Beaudry, 2012) , the role of research sponsorship on research performance in nanoscience (Wang & Shapira, 2011) , etc. Reed et al. (2007) show that the quality of published research is associated with their funding status in medical education. G\u00f6k et al. (2015) suggest that citation impact is associated positively with funding diversification and negatively with funding intensity. Checchi (2019) introduces a performance-based research funding system and analyzes its effect on the quantity and quality of different nations' publications. Yan et al. (2018) maintain that funded rather than un-funded publications receive more citations. Quinlan et al. (2008) point out that funded publications attract more citations than un-funded documents. Scholars also argue that funding mainly affects the citations, and funded papers can attract more usage, though a variation exists between research fields (Morillo, 2020; Pao, 1991) . Zhao et al. (2018) suggest that research funding is an essential resource in science's reward system. Another study shows that participating in a competition to get the grant regardless of the result can help scientists to accelerate their citations because of their efforts to prepare the proposal, communicate with other authors to get the grant, etc. (Ayoubi et al., 2019) . Heyard et al. (2021) analyze the relationship between funding and authors' altered metrics scores and show that funded studies got more public attention than other studies.",

In fact, life science currently plays a central role in supporting policy responses and drug discovery processes to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic crisis (Coccia, , 2021b (Coccia, , 2021c (Coccia, , 2021d . Stimulated by these fundamental problems and gaps in the literature for a vital scientific domain, this study aims to analyze the relationship between the citation-based performance of articles and their funding status in disciplines of life science that play a vital role in improving people's wellbeing. The assumption behind this study is that we just considered the funded publications by agencies in journals which are recorded in global dataset, showing status concerning funding of papers. This study focuses on the investigation of the relationship between funding and publication performance (measured with citations) in life science to find out, as far as possible, general characteristics of the scientific change that can explain science dynamics and support research policies directed to improve the effectiveness of funding allocation for knowledge creation and diffusion in science and society. This study applies an approach of computational scientometrics (the application of bibliometric and scientometrics methods to large-scale datasets) to analyze these topics and suggest implications of research funding policy. The paper here is part of a large body of research that endeavors to successfully identify the driving factors of the evolution of science and technology to support best practices of research and innovation policy in society (cf., Coccia & Wang, 2016) .",

            "text": "In order to examine the relationship between funding and citation impact, some studies are reported here to review the current state-of-the-art in these topics. Several studies have investigated different aspects of scientific performance, including the number of citations, publications, word occurrences across documents, collaborations, emerging disciplines, etc. (Peterson, 2010 . Aksnes et al. (2019) argue that citations are increasingly used as performance indicators within the research system, and scientists with high reputation and many citations will attract more scientific opportunities (e.g., grants, international collaborations, etc.), leading to better scientific performance and further recognition. de Solla-Price (1976) claims that the citation performance of a paper depends on its previous citations. In addition, the highest cited articles appear prior to others in the search engine results, increasing popularity and citations (Aksnes et al., 2019) . Scholars show that a scaling relationship can exist between the number of publications and citations (cf., Barab\u00e1si & Albert, 1999; Ferraro et al., 2009; Merton, 1988; Tahamtan et al., 2016; Gl\u00e4nzel, 2007) . Ronda-Pupo and Katz (2018) show the existence of a scaling relationship among scientific resource performance features. Van Raan (2008) analyzes the scaling relationship between citations and field citation density to demonstrate that top performance universities tend to publish more papers in journals with high impact than lower performance universities. Results also suggest that top performance universities have more opportunities to collaborate with other universities, receive more funds, and get popularity among scholars, encouraging the journals to be more likely to publish their scientific results (Coccia & Bozeman, 2016; Hicks & Katz, 2011) . Laudel (2006) maintains that researchers rewarded with funding are more likely to receive funds for their future studies. Other studies show that authors who have received grants and a higher level of funding can receive more citations than non-funded papers (Amara et al., 2015) . Especially, scientists identify similar patterns in many bibliometric data that lead to the Matthew effect, given by: \"the accruing of greater increments of recognition for particular scientific contributions to scientists of considerable repute and the withholding of such recognition from scientists who have not yet made their mark\" (Gillespie, 2015; Merton, 1968 Merton, , 1988 Ye & Rousseau, 2008) . In this regard, Roshani et al. (2021) find that combined, funded, and unfunded research citations follow a power-law distribution in computer science, medicine, and economics. Roshani et al. (2021) also show a stronger scaling relationship in funded documents than un-funded papers in the previously mentioned research fields. In short, funded documents received more citations than un-funded papers in computer science, medicine, and economics, and consequently, the Matthew effect is greater for funded articles compared to un-funded documents. Furthermore, papers receiving industry funding can have more citations if their scientific results are pro-industry (Farshad et al., 2013; Kulkarni et al., 2007) . Instead, some studies show a low association between citations and grants (Boyack & B\u00f6rner 2003) .",

Xmin is the number of publications when the power-law scaling starts from this level (Clauset et al., 2009) . To measure the Xmin value, we used the formula by Clauset et al. (2009): Throughout this study, we apply the maximum probability method to calculate the parameter \u03b1. We calculated the fitting goodness of power-law through the data afterwards. We used the bootstrap function of the Monte-Carlo simulation method with a disturbance rate of 2500 to identify whether the power-law distribution can be a plausible pattern for data in life science. Finally, we calculated the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics to measure the fitness of the power-law model for each sample individually. We calculate, in this step, the p-value of the model. In power-law distribution, the p-value is consistent whenever it is higher than 0.1, indicating an adequate distribution for the data.",

Surprisingly, \"pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics\" is the only field in which the Xmin parameter of funded papers is lower than unfunded documents; however, the number of un-funded publications, in general, is more. Therefore, financial resources can generate an efficient impact in this field of research. In particular, the funded category needs a lower initial number of citations to start its positive scaling growth. Table 3 shows the comparative analysis between distributions. The p-value shows the significance level, and the log-likelihood ratio test (LR) is the main factor in comparing alternative distributions. Table 4 shows that the power-law correlation between the number of published papers and their citation-based performance in Total (funded + un-funded), funded, and unfunded categories in all research fields under study are statistically significant with a p-value < 0.001. The results reveal that the Matthew effect is greater in funded documents than un-funded ones in all three status sets of five research fields in life science. Agricultural and Biological Sciences show that the number of funded papers grows, scaling the research citation performance. In Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular, the Matthew effect of funded category is greater than un-funded one, such that funding has a considerable impact on scientific research expansion. Though a positive Matthew effect in un-funded papers in journals of Immunology and Microbiology, the scaling level is lower than other categories under study. In Neuroscience, the Matthew effect is more significant in funded articles than un-funded ones. In fact, we can expect a higher level of citation growth in this research field by increasing the number of funded documents rather than un-funded research papers. In Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics, the Matthew effect of the funded category is more remarkable than other categories. Hence, it can be concluded that a funding strategy can support the research impacts through a strong scaling growth of citation-based performance of papers in life science. Table 4 also shows that coefficients of R 2 of the funded articles in all five disciplines of life science are higher than R 2 of the power-law model for un-funded papers, suggesting a better goodness of fit.",

The information of funding for high/medium Matthew effect is from Table 5 Excessive zone: funding in this area does not positively impact on citation-based performance, and R&D investment policy for these disciplines may be decreased to have more efficient budgeting Futile zone: funding research policy to support citation performances is unnecessary for research fields in this area. Hence, funding is not an effective strategy in these disciplines to improve scientific performance regarding citations and diffusion of science in society Figure 2 suggests that a funding policy in \"Neuroscience\" is critical strategy to improving the scientific impact in life science. Therefore, this field should be supported financially because investing in Neuroscience can greatly improve scientific performance and consequential knowledge diffusion in life science. Furthermore, \"Agricultural and Biological Sciences\", \"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics\", and \"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology\" are fields in which funding research policy is an essential strategy for improving the scientific performance of papers and diffusion of scientific research in society. Finally, funding in \"Immunology and Microbiology\" seems to be an irrelevant research policy that cannot significantly play a role of accelerator for improving citations of papers; here, it is important to consider other relevant factors to make decisions for R&D investments. In short, Fig. 2 can support a research policy of funding in different fields to efficiently increase the citation-based performance of publications in life science for widespread scientific research in science and society.",

The methods focus on scientific output of published papers because: (a) scientific output is recorded in on-line databases that are easily accessible, and (b) funding status of papers can be detected and in general is provided by agencies after an external revision and assessment that should be and indicator of quality and support a scientific research and output having a high potential impact in science and society (and consequently a high scientific performance). In this context, the study here analyzes the publications recorded in citation database by Scopus (2021) concerning critical disciplines of life science, given by \"agricultural and biological sciences\", \"biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology\", \"Immunology and microbiology\", \"neuroscience\" and \"pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics\". This study does not consider scientific research not published because it is not recorded in datasets, and it is difficult to detect and investigate its funding status due to heterogeneity of content not including all information needed for reliable comparative analyses, such that a scientometric analysis including this research not published may lead to misleading results. In addition, many papers and studies can be funded indirectly by the universities, such as by salary and other benefits that professors and scholars receive from universities and that are not specific resources for doing research, but scholars produce scientific papers for curiosity and other natural characteristics of researchers. Hence, indirect fundings in scientific research are also main aspects but difficult to detect and estimate and including this variable factor can create possible distortions in comparative analyses for assessing the scientific impact, in terms of citation performance, of papers in science and society.",

Findings also support that Total (funded + un-funded), funded, and un-funded papers have citations following a power-law distribution in all research fields of life science under study. Our findings confirm previous studies by showing that funding of agencies is a driver to scale the scientific performance of publications, especially citation impact in different disciplines, such as economics, computer science, etc. . This main result has been extended here in life science to improve allocation of resources and consequently wellbeing of people and to cope with pandemic crises, such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 , that create socioeconomic problems in society (Coccia, , 2021b (Coccia, , 2021c (Coccia, , 2021d . This study is connected to many studies of scientometrics in these topics as described in the section of introduction and theoretical framework (Checchi, 2019; G\u00f6k et al., 2015; Reed et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2018) . In fact, some studies investigate the relationship between funding and citation impact with different methodologies showing similar results to analyses discussed here. Yan et al. (2018) analyze the relationship between scientific financing and citation impact in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) area using a regression model with Heckman bias adjustment and show that financing has a significant relationship with a paper's citations in STEMM fields. According to another study by Wagner and Jonkers (2017) , public R&D investment is only tangentially correlated with the citation impact of a nation's publications as evaluated by the field-weighted citation index. Leydesdorff et al. (2019) and Benavente et al. (2012) also point out modest coefficients between public funding and citation impact, using a negative binomial regression analysis. Our study here, by employing a different methodology, shows not only a positive relationship between funding and citations of papers in life science but also a cumulative effect of citations over time. Moreover, in this context, a preliminary analysis (to be further developed in future) considers individual data of leading scholars (awarded with Nobel Prize) to assess how funding can affect citations of their papers. In particular, we consider publications and citations of scholars having Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Medicine over 2019-2020 period (Table 7) . Results suggest that in Chemistry funded papers have a higher average citation than unfunded papers, vice versa in Medicine.",

Third, this study's computational and statistical analyses focus on data in a specific period and research fields of life science and studies that found the opportunity to be published in journals. Numerous funded and un-funded papers have not been published in journals and deserve to be investigated in future studies with appropriate methods that detect this latent area in science.
