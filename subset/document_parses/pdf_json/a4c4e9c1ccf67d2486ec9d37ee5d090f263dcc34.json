Public health experts also argued that the new IHR were urgently needed to help protect ''the global village from pandemic influenza'' in light of concerns about the potential for avian influenza outbreaks in Asia to become epidemics fuelled by human-to-human transmission. 3 Some sense of the larger importance attributed to adoption of the new IHR can be found in the UN Secretary-General's identification of the revision of the IHR as a global priority in his vision for achieving ''larger freedom'' for the peoples of the world. 4 Whether the new IHR live up to expectations remains, of course, to be seen. What is clear is that the new IHR constitute one of the most radical and far-reaching changes in international law on public health since the beginning of international health co-operation in the mid-nineteenth century.",

The new IHR engage State and non-State actors, address numerous public health threats and draw together objectives found in multiple international legal regimes-specifically those concerning infectious disease control, human rights, trade, environmental protection and security-and configure them in a way that has no precedent in international law on public health. The manner in which the new IHR involve a range of actors, apply to diverse health threats and incorporate public health, economic, human rights, environmental and security concerns reveals an approach to global governance that echoes constitutional law perhaps more than international law. 8 These echoes reinforce the argument that the new IHR exhibit features that make their adoption by the WHA a historic moment for public health and international law.",

I have elsewhere called the international legal framework developed from the first international sanitary conference in 1851 until WHO's adoption of the International Sanitary Regulations in 1951 the ''classical regime''. 14 This regime contained two basic parts: obligations on States Parties to (1) notify each other about outbreaks of specified infectious diseases in their territories; and (2) limit disease-prevention measures that restricted international trade and travel to those based on scientific evidence and public health principles. The connection between the IHR and the historical origins of international law on infectious diseases is more than a faint trace, of interest only to historians. From the earliest international sanitary conventions adopted in the 1890s to the IHR in force in 2005, the classical regime has changed little in its substantive objectives or the framework States used to achieve those objectives.",

The ISR followed the substantive legal approach to international infectious disease control developed since 1851. The innovations made with the ISR were procedural rather than substantive in nature. The ISR continued the substantive approach of the classical regime but packaged this regime in a manner that differed from the way in which States previously handled the regime. The result of continuing the classical regime's substantive approach but modifying its application was the global consolidation of the classical regime in one set of rules overseen by one international health organization.",

In terms of emergence, an international approach to infectious diseases began in the mid-nineteenth century as European countries struggled to cope with successive waves of epidemic cholera. 21 These outbreaks caused not only serious morbidity and mortality across Europe but also increasing burdens on flows of international trade. Prior to the start of international co-operation on the spread of infectious diseases, each country more or less fended for itself and quarantine of ships and travellers was a virtually universal national policy response to the threat of imported disease. Merchants and traders confronted, thus, a fragmented, non-harmonized patchwork of national quarantine regulations that imposed delays and costs on trade and commerce.",

The nature of the problemdiseases spreading across borders through international trade and travel-demanded international co-operation. More specifically, the nature of the problem forced States to engage in certain kinds of co-operation, which formed the classical regime's architecture. This architecture's purpose was to protect States against the international spread of infectious diseases in a way that minimized interference with international trade and travel. The International Sanitary Convention of 1893 expressed this purpose well in the preamble's statement that the States Parties had ''decided to establish common measures for protecting public health during cholera epidemics without uselessly obstructing commercial transactions and passenger traffic''. 22 The classical regime pursued protection against the international spread of infectious diseases through international legal obligations requiring that (1) States notify other countries about outbreaks of specified diseases; and (2) maintain adequate public health capabilities at points of disease entry and exit (e.g. sea ports and, later, airports). The classical regime sought to minimize public health interference with international trade and travel by requiring that disease-prevention measures restrictive of international trade and travel be based on scientific evidence and public health principles. This objective produced provisions in international sanitary conventions that stated that the measures provided for responding to the possible importation of infectious diseases were the maximum measures governments could apply. 23 States designed the classical regime's obligations to make information about disease outbreaks in countries more available and transparent in order to facilitate other countries' application of appropriate public health measures to means of international transportation and to travellers. In other words, the classical regime established an international surveillance system for certain infectious diseases and attempted to harmonize national quarantine policies and regulations. The goal was to structure State responses to infectious disease outbreaks in other countries so that States could protect themselves from disease importation and spread in ways that were scientifically effective and the least restrictive of trade and travel possible.",

The classical regime only applied to a small number of infectious diseases, called the ''quarantinable diseases'' in the ISR, 25 which were closely associated with international trade and travel. The classical regime's ''big three'' infectious diseases were cholera, plague and yellow feverthe diseases addressed at the first international sanitary conference in 1851 and included on the list of diseases subject to the ISR in 1951. In the first half of the twentieth century, other diseases were added to the classical regime's list, including smallpox and typhus. 26 Six diseases were initially subject to the ISR: cholera, plague, yellow fever, smallpox, typhus and relapsing fever. 27 The other major variation in the classical regime involved integrating an international health organization into the workings of the international legal rules on infectious disease control. Not long into international co-operation on infectious diseases, experts realized that such co-operation would work more efficiently if a central body or organization played a significant role, especially with respect to the flow of surveillance information among States Parties to the international sanitary conventions. 28 In the first decade of the twentieth century, States created permanent international health organizations at the regional level (the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (1902)) 29 and international level (Office International d'Hygi\u00e8ne Publique (1907)). 30 27 ISR, above n.18, Art.1 (defining ''quarantinable diseases'' as meaning ''plague, cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, typhus and relapsing fever''). 28 Fidler, above n.20, 47 -8 (discussing early proposals at international sanitary conferences for the creation of a permanent international health organization).",

The very first International Sanitary Convention, adopted in 1892, focused on reforming the quarantine system applied to navigation through the Suez Canal and modifying the regulations governing the Maritime, Sanitary and Quarantine Board of Egypt. 32 Concerns that infectious diseases from Asia and the Middle East would spread through international trade and travel kept the classical regime focused on problems perceived to emanate from these regions, such as the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. The main International Sanitary Conventions of 1903, 1912 and 1926 contain many provisions that address the threat of infectious diseases spreading from non-European regions. 33 The ISR continued this pattern because it has two annexes containing 41 articles in all, addressing the annual pilgrimages to Mecca. 34 The limited list of infectious diseases subject to the classical regime is connected to the focus on the potential of disease spreading from Asia and the Middle East northwards and westwards. As scholars of international health diplomacy have noted, a driving motivation behind international health co-operation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was to protect Europe and North America from the importation and spread of ''Asiatic diseases''. 35 The classical regime's ''big three'' infectious diseases-cholera, plague and yellow fever-were all diseases not considered indigenous to Europe and North America and that spread from southern, non-European regions northwards. No infectious diseases historically common in Europe were added to the main International Sanitary Convention until 1926, when typhus and smallpox were included. 36 In essence, the classical 31 The Pan American Sanitary Bureau played a central role in the functioning of the Pan American Sanitary Code, adopted in 1924. See, e.g. Pan American Sanitary Code, above n.24, Arts 54 -60 (describing functions and duties of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau). The Office International d'Hygi\u00e8ne Publique became a centerpiece of the operation and revision of the main International Sanitary Convention, originally adopted in 1903 but subsequently amended in 1912, 1926, 1938 and 1944 . See, e.g. International Sanitary Convention of 1926, above n.23, Arts 1, 3-7 and 9 (involving the Office International in the international surveillance system for plague, cholera and yellow fever). regime's fundamental concern was lessening the burden on European and North American trade created by national responses in those regions to the threat of the importation of ''Asiatic diseases''. However parochial or imperialistic, this concern proved fertile, as illustrated by the many international sanitary conventions negotiated, adopted and revised in the period from 1890 to 1945. 37 The proliferation of treaties on infectious disease control involved not only traditional issues of maritime trade, travel and quarantine but also the extension of the classical regime into aerial navigation as this transportation technology emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. 38 In fact, the proliferation of the classical regime in a number of treaties in this time period produced an unsatisfactory situation by the end of World War II. In 1947, the US Department of State lamented the patchwork of treaties on infectious disease control and argued that ''[t]here are states, including some which occupy key positions in the stream of international maritime and aerial commerce, bound only by the obsolete conventions of 1912, 1926 and 1933, or by no sanitary conventions at all''. 39 The proliferation of treaties on infectious disease control revealed not only patchwork coverage but also procedural problems with the classical regime's development. The process of formulating rules by ad hoc treaty negotiations proved cumbersome, slow and resistant to amendments needed to account for changes in scientific knowledge and the speed, scope, volume and patterns of international trade. 40 A different process of adopting and amending international law on infectious disease control was needed; and the WHO Constitution, which came into force in 1948, provided the new process. Under the Constitution, the WHA was given the authority to adopt regulations concerning ''sanitary and quarantine requirements and other procedures designed to prevent the international spread of disease'', 41 and any such regulations would become binding on WHO Member States unless they rejected them. 42 These two changes marked significant departures from how States developed the classical regime prior to the WHO's creation. Although involved at various levels with the main international sanitary conventions, the Office International d'Hygi\u00e8ne Publique never had authority to adopt regulations in the manner provided by the WHO Constitution. Further, the classical regime was a creature of the traditional ''opt in'' nature of treaty law-a rule of international law is not binding on any State unless the State gave its express consent to be bound. 43 The procedural changes effected by the WHO Constitution created the possibility for WHO to adopt one set of international legal rules to replace the patchwork of international sanitary conventions and to revise and amend such rules efficiently in response to changes in scientific or other factors. In addition, the WHO Constitution's ''opt out'' technique would help ensure that the single set of rules would be widely applicable in the international system. In short, the governance innovations found in the WHO Constitution set the stage for the consolidation of the classical regime in the form of the ISR.",

            "text": "Rules addressing a handful of infectious diseases of concern to developed countries in a way designed to protect trade between States as opposed to promoting health within them sit uneasily with the ''new world order'' for health proclaimed in the WHO Constitution's preamble. Actual policy developments at WHO reinforce this tension because, from early in its existence, WHO showed more interest in attacking infectious diseases at their local sources and concentrating such attacks on developing countries. 49 This strategy was consistent with viewing health in ways not driven by protecting the trade interests of the great powers. Rather than revise the classical regime, WHO developed radically different approaches to international health cooperation, perhaps best exemplified by disease eradication efforts 50 and promoting universal primary health care through the Health for All campaign launched in 1978. 51 The second factor contributing to the classical regime's marginalization and stagnation after 1951 involved a dramatic decrease in the political importance of international infectious disease control. The great powers and other developed countries made significant strides in reducing the threat that infectious diseases posed to their populations and economies. 52 Although such progress began during the decades in which the classical regime proliferated, 53 48 WHO Const., preamble. it accelerated after World War II. Improvements made against infectious diseases by countries owed little, if anything, to the classical regime because the improvements involved changes within States, such as strides made in providing clean water and sanitation services, and widespread application of new medical technologies, such as vaccines. In short, the political interest developed countries had in the classical regime prior to World War II dissipated. The political engine that had driven the classical regime stopped running and neither WHO nor developing countries had the interest or incentives to replace or overhaul the engine because they were increasingly engaged in international health co-operation that did not resonate with the classical regime's objectives. In fact, WHO and developing countries pursued strategies that abandoned the classical regime's infectious disease-trade focus for arguments linking the developing world's demand for a New International Economic Order with WHO's push for Health for All. 54 The third factor in the classical regime's demise after 1951 involves technology. The development of antibiotics and vaccines for many infectious diseases in the post-World War II period created resources not present when the classical regime emerged and proliferated. 55 The availability of such technological assets produced the motivation and the need to use and disseminate such technologies globally. The classical regime was not designed to support such an effort 56 and was, thus, not directly relevant to endeavours designed to apply these new technologies directly against infectious disease problems all over the world.",

First, the ISR and the IHR were, legally speaking, failures. The IHR continued the classical regime's fundamental purpose ''to ensure the maximum security against the international spread of diseases with a minimum interference with world traffic''. 57 Continuity in the objective did not, however, produce continuity of compliance. As early as the late 1960s, WHO officials and other commentators expressed frustration about the lack of IHR compliance by States Parties. 58 One expert asked, ''[I]s there much sense in the maintenance of rules if they are not observed-if they are disregarded or more or less systematically broken-without any consequences for those who deviate?'' 59 IHR States Parties routinely violated their obligations to notify WHO of outbreaks of 54 Declaration of Alma Ata, above n.51, paras 3, 10 (connecting the Health for All policy to the New International Economic Order). diseases subject to the Regulations 60 and to refrain from applying unwarranted measures to the trade and travel coming from countries suffering such outbreaks. 61 Secondly, public health experts raised questions about the substantive nature of the classical regime, indicating that the law no longer responded to public health reality. In 1969, for example, one expert noted that the IHR did not apply to many infectious diseases that posed similar risks of international spread as the diseases subject to the Regulations. 62 Similarly, another expert argued in 1974 that the diseases subject to the IHR ''are the pestilential diseases of the past'', 63 implying that the IHR were backward-looking rather than geared to the infectious diseases the world faced in the present and future. These criticisms illustrated the extent to which WHO did not revise, update and modernize the classical regime through its innovative constitutional provisions.",

            "text": "In terms of international trade law, the development of a multilateral framework for trade in goods-the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 67 -in 1947 precipitated a shift of interest from the classical regime to GATT in connection with the balancing trade and public health. GATT included a general exception that allowed contracting parties to violate a GATT obligation if such violation was necessary to protect human life or health. 68 Although balancing trade and health is attempted in both GATT and the classical regime, GATT's trade liberalization requirements, such as the most-favoured-nation and national treatment principles, 69 embed this balancing effort in a context that was more pro-trade than the classical regime, which contained no affirmative trade liberalization obligations. Countries whose main interest in infectious diseases had essentially become traderelated had more incentive to emphasize GATT than appeal to the ISR or IHR. Further, GATT's rules applied to trade-restricting health measures adopted to address threats from infectious and non-communicable diseases, making GATT's public health scope broader than the ISR or IHR. 70 Finally, the emergence of interest in international environmental protection in the 1960s and 1970s, best exemplified by the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, 71 helped generate new international law relevant to the protection of human health. In the 1960s and 1970s, States negotiated treaties on marine pollution 72 and long-range transboundary air pollution 73 that attempted to reduce the threats such forms of pollution posed for human health and the environment. These treaties do not represent the first time States used international law to address non-communicable diseases threatened through environmental degradation because such treaties appeared during the period the classical regime dominated international law on public health. 74 In the 1970s, however, international environmental law eclipsed the classical regime in terms of the attention it garnered and the potential it developed with respect to threats to human health. This development parallels the public health shift taking place in developed countries away from concern about infectious diseases toward worries about non-communicable diseases. 75 The policy, political, technological and legal factors analysed above help explain the fall of the classical regime in the 30 years after the ISR's adoption in 1951. In 1981, the WHA amended the IHR to remove smallpox from the list of diseases subject to the Regulations, in acknowledgement of the global eradication of smallpox in the late 1970s. 76 This amendment to the IHR represents, 69 Ibid., Arts I (most-favoured-nation principle) and III (national treatment principle). The fall of the classical regime in the 30 years following the ISR's adoption in 1951 proved not to be the regime's nadir because the subsequent 20 years witnessed its death. The two decades following smallpox's removal from the IHR's list of infectious diseases became a 20 years' crisis for international infectious disease control specifically and public health generally. In this period, HIV/AIDS developed into one of history's worst pandemics, 77 globalization fuelled the emergence and re-emergence of other infectious diseases around the world, 78 and the proliferation of biological weapons became a high-profile national security and public health issue. 79 These depressing developments crushed complacency about the threat from infectious diseases that prevailed in the developed world for decades and confronted all countries with threats they were unprepared to handle. The emergence of new infectious diseases (e.g. HIV/AIDS) and the re-emergence of old pathogenic threats (e.g. tuberculosis and malaria) 80 forced experts to decipher the reasons why microbes had returned with a vengeance. The factors were many and complex-globalization, urbanization, migration, breakdown of public health systems, declining effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies, environmental degradation, poverty and more. 81 The proliferation of biological weapons, especially the prospect of such proliferation through the efforts of terrorists, exacerbated the dismal situation concerning infectious disease threats. 82 An international legal framework applicable only to three diseases was no match for what transpired after 1981. The 20 years' crisis effectively terminated whatever relevance the classical regime retained after its marginalization and stagnation in the previous 30 years. If a single cause of death for the classical regime could be identified, it would be its limited, disease-specific approach to international infectious disease threats. The IHR had little, if any, applicability to the crisis of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases because most of the diseases emerging and re-emerging were not subject to the IHR. 83 Any new pathogen, or resurging old ones, not listed as a ''disease subject to the Regulations'' fell outside the IHR's surveillance system, so one half of the classical regime's architecture was irrelevant to surveillance efforts for many emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. WHO argued that aspects of the second half of the classical regime's architecture, which regulated the traffic-restricting health measures WHO Member States could apply, governed Member State responses to infectious diseases beyond cholera, plague and yellow fever. 84 Yet, these arguments were unpersuasive from an international legal perspective and were, at any rate, ignored by a number of WHO Member States.",

            "text": "HIV/AIDS provides a good example through which to illustrate these two points. First, WHO Member States were under no international legal obligation to report cases of HIV or AIDS to WHO for purposes of international surveillance because HIV/AIDS was not a disease subject to the IHR. Whether the IHR should be revised to include HIV/AIDS as a notifiable disease was considered but rejected for three reasons: (1) adding more diseases to the IHR's list was generally not considered sufficiently robust to address the HIV/ AIDS problem; 85 (2) WHO Member States did not comply with the notification and other obligations they currently had under the IHR, making an expansion of the list of notifiable diseases questionable as a strategy; 86 and (3) public health officials adopted an alternative international legal strategy that involved application of international human rights law in addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic. 87 Secondly, WHO arguments that IHR provisions regulating measures States Parties could apply to trade and travel covered more than measures to address cholera, plague and yellow fever failed to carry the day legally or politically. WHO responded to requirements for AIDS-free certificates imposed by some WHO Member States with the argument that such requirements were illegal under the IHR because the IHR contained no provision allowing Member States to demand such certificates. 88 WHO's position was that the IHR only allowed Member States to require the documentation permitted under the IHR. This interpretation was unpersuasive legally and from a public health perspective. WHO's position essentially meant that any health document requirement imposed by a WHO Member State for a new disease, even if the requirement was scientifically justified, was not allowed under the IHR because the IHR did not permit the requirement. The interpretation reveals the strain the IHR created on WHO's efforts to deal with serious infectious diseases not subject formally to the IHR. Even if the WHO was correct in its interpretation of the IHR, the story does not end well because IHR States Parties generally ignored WHO's legal position. 89 The inapplicability of the IHR to most emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases also indicated that the techniques created in the WHO Constitution to allow WHO to revise and update the IHR quickly proved to be more innovative in theory than practice. First, WHO Member States made little use of these powers to keep the IHR relevant to international infectious disease threats. The most prominent change was removing diseases from the list not expanding the IHR's scope. Secondly, events suggested that public health experts did not think highly of utilizing WHO's constitutional powers merely to add more diseases to the IHR list. 90 These powers did not address the lack of compliance WHO Member States generally demonstrated with respect to the IHR. 91 Further, with respect to HIV/AIDS, efforts turned not to the IHR or its revision through the relevant constitutional provisions but to international human rights law to provide an international legal strategy with which to fight the pandemic. 92 The classical regime's death in the 20-year period following 1981 involved international legal regimes besides international human rights law. Most prominently, the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 and the implementation of old 93 agreements under the WTO intensified the relationship between public health and international trade law. Controversies about the impact of the WTO agreements and dispute-settlement process on public health and health care abounded in the late 1990s and early 2000s. 95 Some of these controversies, such as the effect intellectual property protections in TRIPS had on access to antiretroviral drugs, 96 witnessed tension between international human rights and international trade law. 97 Even though WHO started the process of revising the IHR in 1995, the debates about international trade law and the WTO rarely, if ever, referred to the IHR, which illustrates the obscurity into which the classical regime had fallen. 98 The accelerating development of international environmental law also contributed to the sense that the classical regime's day in the sun had passed. States adopted many international treaties on environmental problems of direct concern to public health in the 1980s and 1990s, 99 giving international environmental law public health scope never achieved by the classical regime. The adoption of these treaties demonstrated that cross-border threats to public health existed outside the infectious disease context, which acted as another reminder of the IHR's limited ambition and applicability.",

These concerns began to affect policy in the early 1990s, particularly after revelations about the biological weapons programmes of the former Soviet Union and Iraq, 100 but the anxieties accelerated after the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995 because Aum Shinriyko had committed chemical terrorism and had tried to perpetrate biological attacks. 101 97 Fidler, above n.14, 288 -9 (noting clash between international trade and international human rights in the debate about access to antiretrovirals). the heels of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, established that the threat of bioterrorism was more than science fiction. Treaties prohibited the use of biological weapons in armed conflict 102 and the development, stockpiling and possession of biological weapons, 103 and efforts got under way in the mid-1990s to strengthen the prohibitions in the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and On Their Destruction through a mechanism designed to verify compliance. 104 These treaties did not, however, address challenges that the perpetration of bioterrorism would present. These consequence-management challenges turned policy attention toward public health infrastructure and capabilities because the first line of defense in the event of a bioterrorist attack would be public health and health care systems. 105 The spectre of bioterrorism made the quality of national and international public health capacities, such as surveillance, a security concern. As embodied in the IHR, the classical regime had nothing to offer the security need for better and more robust international surveillance of infectious disease outbreaks. The bioterrorist threat did, however, shine new light on the deficiencies of the IHR and brought to the debate about how to move beyond the classical regime a powerful perspective backed by those concerned about national and international security.",

The crisis of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, fuelled by ever-accelerating processes of globalization and the threat of biological terrorism, required robust and sustained public health responses from the local to the global level. Given the classical regime's death, new international policy and legal frameworks were required to address the mounting threats from pathogenic microbes. WHO formally recognized the need to revise the IHR in 1995, when the WHA instructed the WHO Director-General to begin the process of updating the IHR to address the infectious disease challenges the world currently faced. 106 Importantly, WHO understood that the revision of the IHR required fundamental changes to the substantive nature of the international legal strategy to infectious disease control. The IHR revision would have to dismantle the classical regime, the substance of which had essentially been unchanged from the latter half of the nineteenth century. Merely adding diseases to, or removing them from, the IHR's list of diseases was no longer an option. WHO was not at a proverbial crossroads with the IHR because continuation of the status quo, with only slight modifications, was not realistic.

Secondly, the new IHR contain a vision of integrated governance for global public health because the proposals connect public health objectives with principles and norms found in international law on trade, human rights, environmental protection and security. In short, WHO turned international legal developments in other areas of international relations, which helped eclipse the classical regime, into allies in the pursuit of global health security.

More concretely, WHO begins to pursue global health security through global health governance well before the IHR revision process was completed. The most dramatic example of this phenomenon is the effective global response orchestrated by WHO to the outbreak of SARS in 2003. 108 The SARS outbreak also proved to be the ''tipping point'' for the IHR revision process because the process, which had made slow progress since 1995, accelerated following the containment of this global health crisis.",

            "text": "In May 1995, the WHA requested the WHO Director-General to prepare a revision of the IHR. 109 This resolution reflected the conclusion of WHO and its Member States that the existing IHR provided an inadequate framework through which to address the growing threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. In response to this mandate, WHO convened an informal consultation on revising the IHR in December 1995. 110 The consultation's report provides an early glimpse of ideas that would later become central to IHR revision proposals made by WHO. 111 As described earlier, the classical regime's purpose was, in the words of the old IHR, ''to ensure the maximum security against the international spread of disease with a minimum interference with world traffic''. 112 The 1995 informal consultation recommended that ''ensuring maximum security against the international spread of diseases, involving minimum interference with world traffic and trade, should remain the basic principle of the revised IHR''. 113 The informal consultation recognized that this purpose originated at the first international sanitary conference in 1851 but still remained valid in the late twentieth century. 114 The first draft of a proposed new set of IHR, issued by WHO in January 1998 (Provisional 1998 IHR Draft), adopted the informal consultation's recommendation. 115 How this objective of maximum protection and minimum interference would be achieved became the focal point of the IHR revision process. As described earlier, major problems with the IHR concerned: (1) the limited number of infectious diseases subject to the IHR; (2) the failure of States Parties to notify WHO of outbreaks of notifiable diseases; and (3) the failure of States Parties to abide by the maximum measures they could apply to the trade and travel coming from countries suffering from outbreaks of diseases subject 109 to the IHR. The early IHR revision efforts began to flesh out new ways of organizing the IHR that differed significantly from the classical regime. With respect to basing the IHR on a limited number of specific infectious diseases, WHO wanted to abandon this approach for one that would catch a wider array of known and unknown infectious disease threats. The initial new approach was to require reporting to WHO of specific disease syndromes considered of urgent international public health importance. 116 The Provisional 1998 IHR Draft replaced the IHR's ''diseases subject to the Regulations'' with ''syndromes subject to the Regulations'', and defined such syndromes as those ''of urgent international public health importance: acute haemorrhagic fever, acute respiratory syndrome, acute diarrhoeal syndrome, acute jaundice syndrome, acute neurological syndrome and other notifiable syndromes''. 117 A broader scope for the revised IHR would not improve the performance of the international legal rules if States Parties continued to ignore their obligations to report, as they had done with the existing IHR. The surveillance system established by the classical regime was limited not only in terms of the small number of diseases covered but also by the exclusive reliance on information provided by governments of the Member States. Under the IHR, WHO could not act on surveillance information it received about outbreaks in a WHO Member State unless that information came from the WHO Member State in question. 118 Only once in WHO's history did the Organization publish information on an outbreak of a reportable disease that it did not receive from the WHO Member State affected. 119 The routine failure of WHO Member States to report outbreaks of notifiable diseases not only crippled the surveillance system but also handicapped what WHO could do to respond to outbreaks.",

Pursuing this strategy revealed WHO attempting to harness new information technologies, such as the Internet and electronic mail, and their use by non-State actors for global public health purposes. The revolution in information technologies changed the context for State calculations about whether to report or try to cover up an outbreak. As the WHO informal consultation put it, ''in this age of wide media coverage, nothing can be hidden''. 122 In addition, NGOs were pioneering ways to use the information technology revolution to develop a global early-warning system for emerging infectious disease threats. 123 The early revision efforts also tried to address the problem under the existing IHR of States Parties applying trade-and travel-restricting measures not permitted by the Regulations. The move to syndrome reporting meant that all the detailed provisions in the IHR about the maximum measures that could be applied to address cholera, plague and yellow fever would not form part of the revised IHR. The expansion in the IHR's scope created more possibilities that action taken to address the syndromes would adversely affect trade and travel. Yet, the expanded scope meant that WHO could not write into the new Regulations ''maximum measures'' for all the syndromes. In place of the detailed IHR rules, the Provisional 1998 IHR Draft provided that ''measures to interrupt transmission shall be based on principles of scientific risk assessment and public health. Whenever possible these measures should reflect expert consensus opinion''. 124 This approach did not eliminate the concern that States Parties would continue to apply unwarranted measures against the trade and travel of countries suffering from infectious disease outbreaks. To respond to this historically serious problem more directly, the Provisional 1998 IHR Draft included a new dispute-settlement mechanism, called the Committee of Arbitration, that would be empowered to settle disputes between WHO Member States concerning the interpretation or application of the IHR. 125 This mechanism provided a State Party subjected to trade-or travel-restricting measures not based on scientific and public health principles with a way to challenge such measures and obtain a binding ruling from the Committee of Arbitration. 126 130 The emergence of GOARN represented a dramatic break with the approach to infectious disease surveillance found in the IHR and the classical regime.",

To begin, WHO viewed GOARN as a central asset in its new strategy of pursuing ''global health security''. The classical regime sought ''international health security''. The US Department of State used ''international health security'' as a concept in 1947 in analysing the patchwork of international sanitary conventions that existed after World War II, 131 and the IHR stated that part of its purpose was ''maximum security against the international spread of disease''. 132 As analysis of the classical regime makes clear, the concept of international health security was very limited because the security sought related only to a small number of infectious diseases, the international transmission of which was closely associated with international trade and travel. In addition, only States participated in the classical regime's pursuit of international health security because the regime only functioned on the basis of surveillance information provided by governments. This restriction handicapped the role WHO and non-State actors could play in addressing international infectious disease problems. The strategy of global health security discarded the traditional approach found in the IHR in two fundamental respects. First, WHO applied GOARN to a wide range of infectious diseases that went well beyond cholera, plague and yellow fever. Critical to the global health security strategy was containing known infectious disease risks and responding effectively to unexpected or unknown infectious disease events. 133 GOARN's security outlook focused foremost on the infectious disease threat, not, as in the classical regime, primarily on connections between a disease and international commerce. Another important feature of the global health security concept is that it applies to not only naturally occurring infectious diseases but also intentionally caused outbreaks. 134 Global health security and GOARN incorporated the perceived growing threat of biological weapons proliferation and bioterrorism.",

            "text": "Secondly, through GOARN, WHO actively sought surveillance information from all possible sources and did not, as had the classical regime, restrict the approach to information provided only by governments. New information technologies and their global dissemination transformed not only the technological context but also the political and economic realities of infectious disease reporting. The new technologies empowered non-State actors in the collection, analysis and dissemination of information relevant to public health. This transformation strengthened WHO's role vis-\u00e0-vis its Member States because GOARN allowed WHO to collect surveillance information from a wide variety of sources on a large number of infectious diseases. The global health security strategy eliminated handicaps the existing IHR's State-centric framework imposed on WHO.",

In 2003, WHO reported that between January 1998 and March 2002, WHO employed GOARN to identify and investigate 538 outbreaks of international concern in 132 countries. 135 GOARN-induced investigations involved infectious diseases not subject to the IHR, including meningitis, haemorrhagic fevers, viral encephalitis and anthrax. 136 The volume of the surveillance information gathered, the speed with which such information was collected and assessed, and the disease coverage of the GOARN effort surpassed anything ever accomplished under the IHR specifically or the classical regime generally. 134 Report by the Secretariat, above n.129, para.3 (''Another concern is the increasingly possible intentional use of infectious agents''). The gathering momentum of the global health security strategy contrasted with the slow pace of the formal IHR revision process. WHO intended that the revised IHR would be the international legal framework for the global health security strategy and WHO emphasized that revising the IHR was critical for global health security. 137 Conceptually, this position made sense. The rapid and effective emergence of GOARN occurred in this 1998 -2003 period, however, without an international legal framework to support it. 138 The absence of an international legal framework was not, apparently, seriously restraining WHO's development and implementation of the global health security approach.",

Their revision will be another important step in strengthening the world's collective defences against the infectious disease threat''). 144 Delays began to affect the pilot studies of the feasibility of syndrome notification. 145 The first indication that the proposed syndrome notification approach was not faring well came in January 2000, when WHO reported that ''[s]nydrome reporting has been proposed, but the current direction is that all international public health events should be notified''. 146 In February 2001, WHO stated that, after its interim review of the pilot study, ''it was concluded . . . that syndromic reporting . . . was not appropriate for use in the context of a regulatory framework, mainly because of difficulties in reporting syndromes in the field test and because syndromes could not be linked to preset rules for control of spread''. 147 WHO dropped syndrome notification but did not return to the classical regime's diseasespecific approach. Instead, WHO proposed something even bolder than the move from disease-specific to syndrome reporting-revising the IHR to require notification to WHO of all public health risks of urgent international concern. 148 The idea of ''public health risks of urgent international concern'' formed part of the reasoning behind the syndrome reporting proposal because WHO had proposed obligations to notify syndromes ''of urgent international public health importance''. 149 The Provisional 1998 IHR Draft included five criteria to guide WHO Member States in determining whether an event was of ''urgent international public health importance'': (1) rapid transmission in the community; (2) unexpectedly high case fatality rate; (3) newly recognized syndrome; (4) high political or media profile; and (5) trade and travel restrictions. 150 After dropping syndrome reporting, WHO focused on requiring notification of public health risks of urgent international importance. WHO began to develop what it called a ''decision tree'' to guide its Member States in determining whether a public health risk was of urgent international concern. 151 144 January 1998 IHR Revision Progress Report, above n.140, 18. From the failure of the syndrome-reporting proposal came, however, something even more radical and far-reaching. What was bold about this shift was that WHO widened the risks the revised IHR would cover to include more than infectious diseases. The first indication of this move comes in February 2001, when WHO discussed in its IHR revision progress report how GOARN could be designed to ''provide information on noncommunicable diseases and environmental, chemical or nuclear risks''. 152 The classical regime had never applied to anything but infectious diseases. States had addressed non-communicable disease risks from chemicals and radiological materials generally through international environmental law negotiated and adopted outside WHO's auspices. 153 WHO's interest in including non-communicable public health risks of urgent international importance in the revised IHR was unprecedented in the history of international law on public health. Not only had WHO proposed to expand the revised IHR to include infectious disease events related to use of biological weapons, but it also was proposing to expand the revised IHR so that it would cover certain non-communicable public health risks, which could include uses of chemical or nuclear/radiological weapons. The scope of the revised IHR was expanding to include public health risks formerly addressed in separate international legal regimes outside WHO. WHO's concept of ''global health security'' likewise expanded from an infectious disease-only perspective to one that incorporated any serious risk to public health with international implications. 154 A second factor that contributed to the repeated delay in the completion of the revised IHR involved the potential relationship between the revised IHR and international trade law. The IHR and all previous incarnations of the classical regime had directly been involved with international trade because the prime motivation behind the regime had been to minimize the impact of national health measures, such as quarantine, on trade and commerce. The limited number of infectious diseases covered by the classical regime in all its manifestations meant that the overlap between the regime and international trade law was minimal. Trade-restricting health measures addressing infectious diseases not subject to the IHR or non-communicable disease threats (e.g. toxic chemicals in products) fell outside the IHR and were handled, generally, as matters of international trade law. 155 Expanding the scope of the revised IHR to include a large number of infectious diseases, known and unknown, and public health risks involving non-communicable diseases would increase significantly the potential overlap between the revised IHR and international trade law. This reality explains why WHO spent considerable time in the 1998-2003 period analysing the potential relationship between proposals for the IHR revision and international trade agreements within the WTO, especially the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). WHO's July 1998 progress report on the IHR revision first flagged the need to ensure that the revised IHR was compatible with the SPS Agreement. 156 WHO mentions the IHR -WTO relationship in all but one of its subsequent progress reports on the IHR revision process. 157 A major theme of WHO's work on this relationship was the extent to which the intended purpose of the revised IHR-maximum security against the international spread of disease with minimum interference with world trade and travel-was compatible the approach taken in the SPS Agreement, namely trade-restricting health measures are justified if they are based on scientific principles and risk assessment. 158 A third factor contributing to the slow pace of the IHR revision process was revising the approach to the long-standing problem of WHO Member States applying unwarranted trade-and travel-restricting measures in response to infectious disease outbreaks. The compulsory arbitration proposal in the Provisional 1998 IHR Draft quickly died. 159 The rejection of a disease-specific framework meant that WHO could not draft into the revised IHR specific maximum measures Member States could apply, which had always been the approach in the classical regime. With WHO proposals increasingly expanding the potential scope of the revised IHR, the question of what trade-and travel-restricting measures WHO Member States could apply became more, not less, important because the revised IHR's purpose still included minimizing interference with world trade and travel.",

This proposal was not particularly radical or novel because WHO has authority in the WHO Constitution to issue recommendations to its Member States 161 and WHO had previously issued recommendations related to the IHR to Member States, advising them that, for example, trade embargoes were an inappropriate way to address the threat of the cross-border spread of cholera. 162 WHO had also engaged in recommendations to Member States in many areas under its jurisdiction, 163 including the relationship between public health and human rights. 164 WHO's longstanding practice of issuing recommendations to its Member States made the proposal in the IHR revision process to authorize recommendations specifically in the new IHR less radical, but, as will be noted later, less radical does not imply that the recommendatory authority would be an insignificant part of the new regime. WHO power to issue recommendations to its Member States connected with another radical proposal WHO began to include in its thinking about the revised IHR. Global health security ultimately depends on the quality of national public health systems. The classical regime imposed limited obligations relating to public health capacities of States and these addressed capacities at points of disease entry and exit (e.g. maintaining sanitary airports). 165 These types of limited, site-specific obligations would not suffice to support WHO's desire to require Member States to report all risks of urgent international public health importance and to intervene effectively to contain their spread and impact. Therefore, as WHO stated in its May 2002 IHR revision progress report, ''it is proposed that the revised IHR define the capacities that a national disease surveillance system will require in order for such emergencies to be detected, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner''. 166 This proposal indicates WHO's interest in pushing its Member States harder and farther on their domestic public health capabilities than the classical regime ever attempted.",

As indicated above, By 2003, the IHR revision process had proceeded, however slowly, to the point at which the major features of a radically new international legal regime for public health were taking shape. First, the scope of the revised IHR would far exceed anything attempted with the classical regime because WHO was proposing to make the new IHR applicable to any risk, infectious or non-communicable, naturally occurring or intentionally caused, which constituted an urgent international public health concern. This step would make the revised IHR's relationship with international trade law potentially more intense. The expanded scope also meant the revised IHR projected public health governance at the international level into areas previously distinct and unconnected with the classical regime, namely international law on environmental protection and on weapons of mass destruction.",

            "text": "One of the difficult issues that extended the negotiations on the revised IHR involved a proposed provision that would require States Parties to provide to WHO all relevant public health information, materials and samples for verification and response purposes if States Parties had evidence of an intentional release of a biological, chemical or radiological agent within their territories. 182 Such a requirement connected the IHR revision process with the sensitive and controversial politics concerning weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Some countries, most notably the United States, wanted the revised IHR to include such a requirement. Other States, such as Brazil and Iran, argued to have the requirement removed from the revised IHR. 183 Part of the concern with involving WHO and the revised IHR in matters involving potential intentional uses of WMD focused on fears that such matters would jeopardize WHO's core public health mission by forcing it to become entangled in WMD politics. The report of the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, issued in December 2004, fuelled this controversy more by recommending that the WHO Director-General keep the UN Security Council informed during any suspicious or overwhelming outbreak of infectious disease and that the Security Council mandate State co-operation with WHO in addressing such outbreaks. 184 As Pearson argued, the High-Level Panel's recommendation was ''treading on dangerous ground . . . [because] the effectiveness of the World Health Organization rests on its political neutrality and the widespread recognition that its purpose is to provide assistance to its Member States when they are faced with outbreaks of disease''. 185 Similarly, the difficult problems the negotiations experienced between China and Taiwan were not resolved until the final session. Taiwan has long been seeking to participate formally at WHO; 187 but its attempts to forge such a relationship have been blocked by China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The SARS outbreak in Taiwan in 2003, during which WHO provided assistance to the Taiwanese, 188 provided Taiwan with new ammunition in arguing that it should be in direct contact with WHO and be formally covered by the revised IHR. Nicaragua proposed amendments at the November 2004 negotiations that would have allowed the revised IHR to apply to Taiwan. 189 Although these amendments failed to be included in the Chair's January 2005 IHR Draft, the Taiwan -China controversy did not fade away during the February and May negotiations. The eventual handling of this issue is also discussed below in Part IV.B.v.",

Approaching governance through the idea of public health risks and public health emergencies of international concern not only catches threats already identified but also new, unexpected or unforeseen threats. The new IHR's scope of disease application is, thus, dynamic, flexible and forward-looking, which is more appropriate and legitimate from a public health perspective. The second component of the new IHR's disease scope concerns the application of the concept of public health emergencies of international concern to communicable and noncommunicable diseases. As mentioned earlier, no iteration of the classical regime applied to non-communicable disease threats, which States addressed, if at all, through international legal regimes on trade, 201 human rights, 202 security 203 and environmental protection. 204 Under the new IHR, global health security is a more comprehensive governance strategy that applies to significant international threats to public health emanating from biological, chemical or radiological sources. 205 The third component of the new IHR's scope of disease application is the incorporation of all possible sources of public health threats: naturally occurring, accidental and intentionally caused. The classical regime's focus on infectious diseases remained limited to naturally occurring diseases; and the history of the classical regime's development before and after WHO's creation never crosses paths with the international law on WMD. 206 Similarly, international environmental law's concern with maritime, industrial or radiological accidents emerged outside of WHO 207 and never had any relationship with the infectious-diseasefocused IHR. In bringing all possible sources of public health emergencies of international concern under the revised IHR, WHO further underscored its effort to develop a comprehensive governance strategy for global health security.",

In preparing the September 2004 IHR Draft, WHO commissioned an international legal analysis of potential or actual conflicts between the revised IHR (as then embodied in the January 2004 IHR Draft) and other international legal regimes. 210 Importantly, the conflicts analysis concluded that the proposed IHR revisions did not produce a significant number of conflicts with other treaty regimes. 211 In the small number of cases where actual or potential conflicts existed, WHO revised provisions of the negotiating draft to eliminate or minimize actual or potential conflicts. 212 In addition, WHO added provisions in the September 2004 IHR Draft to facilitate co-operation and co-ordination between WHO and other international organizations that may also have responsibilities in the event of a chemical or radiological public health emergency of international concern. 213 These co-operation and co-ordination provisions now form part of the new IHR. 214 WHO Member States, thus, accepted WHO's position that adding chemical and radiological threats to the scope of the IHR's disease application was justified on public health grounds. 215 WHO's commitment to this scope expansion reflects its determination to 213 215 Review and Approval of Proposed IHR Amendments, above n.175, para.3 (''The extension beyond the range of the existing Regulations is justified on the grounds that the release of chemical or radionuclear agents often manifests itself at the outset through symptoms or signs, sometimes even before their cause is known. The ability of the international community, in particular through WHO's coordination, to obtain a reliable assessment of and to respond to, potentially grave health threats would be impaired if the scope of the Regulations were limited to diseases that were already identified as being caused by infectious agents only'') and para.4 (arguing that ''in both the chemical and radionuclear fields, the existing instruments are not necessarily comprehensive and do not always adequately address the health dimension of accidental or other forms of release'').",

            "text": "As described earlier, one of the most difficult issues experienced in negotiating the revision of the IHR involved whether the new IHR's scope would include public health risks connected to suspected intentional releases of biological, chemical or radiological agents. The IHR revision process clearly attempted to include such releases within the scope of the revised Regulations. In addition to the broadening of the scope of the IHR's disease application, the main negotiating texts all contained a specific provision that required States Parties to share information with WHO if they had evidence of an intentional release of a biological, chemical or radiological agent in their territories. 216 The new IHR apply to public health risks connected to the intentional release of WMD agents but lack any specific provision on this issue. The new IHR reflect, thus, the difficult negotiations that transpired on this issue. To begin, the new IHR do not contain the proposed article that directly addressed sharing information with WHO in the event of suspected intentional release of a WMD agent. In fact, any mention of intentional releases of biological, chemical or radiological agents has been purged from the text of the revised Regulations. What remains of the approach found in the main negotiating texts now appears as Article 7 of the new IHR, which provides: ''If a State Party has evidence of an unexpected or unusual public health event in its territory, irrespective of origin or source, which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern, it shall provide WHO with all relevant public health information. In such a case, the provisions of Article 6 [on notification] shall apply in full. '' 217 How Article 7's obligation to notify unexpected or unusual public health events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern differs from the notification duties in Article 6 (as implemented by the decision instrument in Annex 2) is not clear. After all, the decision instrument specifically asks whether the event being assessed is unusual or unexpected in nature. 218 source'' in Article 7 merely replicates the use of the same phrase in the new IHR's definition of ''disease''. 219 However awkward, Article 7, combined with the broad scope of the new IHR's disease application, means that the new IHR apply to suspected intentional releases of WMD agents. Thus, the United States' understanding, issued the day the new IHR were adopted, that the revised Regulations apply to all ''health threats-chemical, biological and radiological-and all causes and modes of events-regardless whether they are naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate'' 220 accurately states the substance of the new IHR.",

The new IHR achieved this delicate task by restricting WHO to engaging only in public health tasks raised by suspected intentional releases of WMD agents.

The new IHR also define ''health measure'' to exclude law enforcement or security measures. 222 The new IHR do not prevent and could not have prevented 223 the UN Security Council from involving itself or WHO more deeply in the international security implications of a suspected deliberate release of a WMD weapon. The possibility that the Security Council could involve itself and WHO in situations involving suspected intentional releases or even naturally occurring disease events remains, thus, real. Certainly, any suspected release of a WMD agent would fall within the Security Council's mandate to maintain international 219 Balancing public health and human rights. Another area in which the new IHR expand the scope of the IHR's obligations involves the revised Regulations' incorporation of human rights principles. The new IHR require that the Regulations shall be implemented ''with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons''. 227 Neither the old IHR nor any manifestation of the classical regime embedded in their texts contains obligations based on international human rights norms. Numerous provisions in the new IHR support the general principle of implementing the revised Regulations in ways that respect dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms (see Table 2 ).

First, the new IHR only require States Parties to apply the least intrusive and invasive measure in connection with medical examinations but not to vaccination, prophylaxis, isolation or quarantine. 233 Secondly, the revised Regulations do not contain requirements that States Parties accord those subject to compulsory measures due process protections, such as the right to challenge such measures in court.",

First, if the disease event involves a case of smallpox, poliomyelitis due to wildtype polio virus, human influenza caused by a new virus subtype, or SARS, it shall be notified to WHO. 236 The new IHR essentially deem any case of these diseases to be an event that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. This pathway is diseasespecific like the notification approach in the old IHR, but the infectious diseases on the disease-specific list do not include cholera, plague or yellow fever. Secondly, if the disease event involves cholera, pneumonic plague, yellow fever, viral haemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Lassa, Marburg), West Nile fever or other diseases that are of special national or regional concern (e.g. dengue fever, Rift Valley fever and meningococcal disease), then States Parties must always use the decision instrument to assess whether the event may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. The diseases under this second pathway are singled out because ''they have demonstrated the ability to cause serious public health impact and to spread rapidly internationally''. 237 Application of the decision instrument does not necessarily mean that any particular case of these diseases must be reported because the obligation to report will depend on the outcome of the decision instrument's utilization. 238 The third pathway requires that States Parties apply the decision instrument to any disease event not falling under the other two pathways. 239 This pathway is particularly important because it requires application of the decision instrument to disease events of unknown causes or sources.

The ICESCR's right to health is, however, to be progressively realized in accordance with a State Party's available resources. 257 In other words, the obligation to respect the right to health is relative to the availability of economic resources in a State Party.",

The new IHR build this strategy into the revised Regulations. First, WHO ''may take into account reports from sources other than notifications or consultations'' from or with States Parties. 259 Secondly, WHO has to try to obtain verification of such information from the States Parties concerned before taking action and States Parties must participate in the verification effort. 260 Expanding WHO's access to surveillance information increases the scope of participation in the global health security strategy. The new IHR incorporate non-governmental sources of information into the surveillance process, thus making non-State actors formally part of the governance mechanism of the revised Regulations. Increasing the scope of participation in this way highlights how the process of achieving global health security differs from the Statecentric approach of international health security found in the classical regime.

First, as analysed above, the new IHR grant WHO the power to use non-governmental sources of information, something not allowed by the old IHR. This authority changes the surveillance dynamic between WHO and Member States in ways that favour global health security over national sovereignty. Secondly, permitting WHO to collect surveillance data from non-governmental sources imposes duties on WHO to engage in such collection efficiently and effectively. In creating and refining GOARN, WHO has moved to shoulder this responsibility, but the responsibility has taken on a governance importance of great magnitude. Thirdly, in allowing WHO to act on non-governmental sources of surveillance information, the new IHR create responsibilities for WHO to verify such information to ensure that its actions are based on accurate information. Although verification of data about public health risks is not novel for WHO, the new IHR significantly heighten the burden WHO bears for the validity of information that forms the basis for actions it takes. Part of this heightened burden also comes from WHO's authority to take action on information it receives from sources other than governments. Confidentiality of information. Under the new IHR, WHO has obligations to keep certain kinds of information confidential, except in specified circumstances. First, WHO has to maintain the confidentiality of information it receives from States Parties, unless WHO (1) declares that an event is a public health emergency of international concern; (2) confirms information evidencing the international spread of the infection or contamination; (3) has evidence that (a) control measures against international spread are unlikely to succeed, or (b) the State Party in question lacks the capacity to carry out the measures necessary to prevent further disease spread; or (4) determines that only immediate application of control measures will effectively address the infection or contamination. 268 When justified by the magnitude of a public health risk, WHO may also share information it receives with other States Parties if a State Party in whose territory the risk exists does not agree to collaborate with WHO. 269 These provisions more appropriately balance the States Parties' desire for confidentiality of disease-related information with the public health need for dissemination of such information than the rules contained in the old IHR.",

Under the new IHR, States Parties are required to notify WHO of events that may constitute public health emergencies of international concern, 274 but the power to declare that an event actually constitutes such an emergency rests with the WHO Director-General. 275 The determination that a public health emergency of international concern exists triggers the Director-General's obligation to issue temporary recommendations to States Parties on the appropriate responses and health measures to implement. 276 WHO has to consult with affected States Parties in exercising its powers to declare an event as a public health emergency of international concern 277 and to issue temporary recommendations, 278 but it can exercise the declaration and temporary recommendation authorities without obtaining the permission of States Parties potentially harmed by such actions.

This feature of the classical regime was reduced to one provision in the old IHR. 319 The January 2004 IHR Draft contained basically the same provision as the old IHR and this provision stated that ''[m]igrants, nomads, seasonal workers or persons taking part in periodic mass congregations may be subjected to additional health measures conforming with the laws and regulations of each State concerned and with any agreement concluded between any such States''. 320 The September 2004 IHR Draft eliminated this provision. WHO explained that the provision ''was deleted in light of comments received and new articles in the draft revision, such as Article 39, which provide the necessary flexibility required by Member States wanting to tackle the issues previously dealt with in this provision''. 321 Thus, the September 2004 IHR Draft had one provision on additional measures-Article 39-that applies universally rather than rules on specific categories of places, events or persons. Any such additional measures must be based on scientific principles and evidence, a risk assessment and must not be more restrictive of international traffic or human rights than reasonably available alternative measures that would achieve the appropriate level of health protection sought. 322 These proposals would have brought to an end the tradition of having special rules for particular regions, events or people in the international legal framework for disease control.",

Under the old IHR, the WHA had to accept all reservations to ensure that reservations did not substantially detract from the character and purpose of the IHR. 328 The new IHR permit reservations that are not incompatible with the object and purpose of the revised Regulations. 329 The new IHR establish a process for determining whether a reservation is compatible with the object and purpose of the Regulations. The first step involves review of the reservation by WHO Member States (if the new IHR are not yet in force) or States Parties (if the IHR have entered into force). 330 If less than one-third of the relevant States objects to the reservation, the reservation is deemed to be accepted (and thus compatible with the object and purpose of the new IHR); and the new IHR can enter into force for the reserving State subject to the accepted reservation. 331 If one-third or more of the relevant States objects to the reservation and the reserving State does not withdraw the reservation, then the reservation is submitted to the WHA for consideration. 332 If the WHA, by majority vote, objects to the reservation on the ground that it is not compatible with the object and purpose of the new IHR, the reservation shall not be accepted. 333 The new IHR do not enter into force for the State making the reservation unless it withdraws the reservation. 334 The procedure on reservations provides guidance in two areas that have been unsettled in customary international law on treaties. First, the new IHR provide a means of determining whether a reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of a treaty. Secondly, the revised Regulations establish what the legal effect is for a State that has formulated a reservation that is incompatible with the object and purpose of the new IHR (i.e. the State does not become a State Party until it withdraws its reservation). 335",

The classical regime reflected the traditional use of international law by States to address discreet, specific problems affecting the relations between States. The integration of multiple actors, threats and policy objectives in the new IHR projects qualities more often associated with constitutional than international law. Constitutional frameworks engage multiple public and private actors in the simultaneous pursuit of numerous political, economic and social ends in hopefully balanced and sustainable ways. In constitutional systems, governments have a primary responsibility to protect and promote the public's health, 340 but the pursuit of public health is embedded in a larger governance context that requires equilibrium among various objectives. The classical regime contained a limited connection between public health and international trade and travel, but it did not relate in any way to broader health, security, environmental or human rights objectives. The new IHR reflect both the broad governance responsibility of public health and the complex nature of fulfilling that responsibility in harmony with other governance objectives. The new IHR are not ''global constitutional law'', but the synthesized governance they promote represents an approach never seen before in the use of international law for public health purposes.",

Policy developments and actions rather than draft legal texts dominated the next phase of the IHR revision process. As WHO worked on and circulated the Provisional 1998 IHR Draft, the Organization continued to build and use a new platform for global infectious disease surveillance and response. At the heart of this strategy was the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), which WHO utilized to strengthen global surveillance of infectious disease events. Critical to the functioning of GOARN was WHO's access to sources of information beyond that received from governments. Well before the IHR's government-only information framework of the IHR had been changed, WHO started harnessing the revolution in information technologies for global public health purposes. 128 WHO first informally established its global outbreak alert and response network in 1997 and then formalized the network in the form of GOARN in 2000. 129 High-level policy backing for WHO's new approach to global infectious disease surveillance came from the WHA in May 2001, when the Assembly expressed its support for ''collaboration between WHO and all potential technical partners in the area of epidemic alert and response, including relevant public sectors, intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations and the private sector''.",
