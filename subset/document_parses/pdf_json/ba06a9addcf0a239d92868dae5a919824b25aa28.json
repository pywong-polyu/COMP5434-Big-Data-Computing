Nowadays, chronic diseases have become the top risk factors for health, accounting for more than 80% of the 10.3 million annual deaths and 68.6% of the overall economic burden in China [2] . In this context, several factors have seriously threatened people's health, thus affecting social harmony and the credibility of the Chinese governments, specifically including low awareness rates, long latency, high incidence rates, long clinical courses, high mortality rates, and low control rates [2, 3] . These issues demonstrate the need for increased attention on chronic disease, particularly to reduce the risk of illness while improving the overall quality of life.",

Interventions on the prevention and control of chronic diseases (PCCDs) are known to aid in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment initiatives while reducing related economic burdens [4] . Meanwhile, regulatory policies (RPs) can improve the rate of service coverage by promoting the implementation of prevention measures [5] , thereby constituting a major source of control for PCCDs. Extensive research has also shown that the soundness of RP has a significant impact on PCCDs [6] . For example, Huang Jianming et al. [7] found that strong community RPs can be used to improve several problematic issues among patients, including hypertension, while Locke et al. [8] demonstrated that RPs had positive effects on the management of diabetic patients in Canada, and Francisco et al. [9] proposed the implementation of multifunctional services designed to monitor and manage COPD patients based on the effectiveness of a chronic disease management model.",

According to the Donabedian's model, which contains structure, process, outcome, and the relationship among them (structure-process-outcome) [19] , RPs (structure) influence the effects of PCCDs (outcome) through implementation at the process level. CSIs and CHCs, as the 'gatekeepers' of community members and 'vanguards' of disease prevention and control, provide social support and prevention services, which can effectively control the spread and deterioration of chronic diseases (process) [20] . The two can work together to implement the chronic disease control. We, therefore, assumed that the relationship between RPs and PCCDs could be explained based on both the coverage of CSIs and CHCs. Many studies have adopted mediation analysis. For instance, Vedanthan et al. found that community health workers mediated hypertension care policy and the control of blood pressure [21] . Chen et al. reported that social capital has an effect on physical activity and nutrition [22] . However, no available study in the context of the relationship between RPs and PCCDs and the pathways has adopted mediation analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to fill this gap by exploring the association between RPs and PCCDs, with a focus on whether CSIs and CHCs mediated this relationship.",

The authority of the mechanism requires issuance of documents by authorities (legislature, government, health commission, etc.) to reflect the importance of RPs. Furthermore, the mechanism requires supervision by external restraint mechanisms for the implementation of the policies [25] . Therefore, four quantitative indicators were adopted. These were named regulatory element coverage rate (RECR), departmental responsibilities clarity rate (DPCR), regulatory mechanism authority rate (RMAR), and accountability mechanism clarity rate (AMCR), and their definitions are detailed in Table 1 [23] . Additionally, SORM was measured based on the sum of the weights of the four quantitative indicators [26] . The study assumed that the higher the SORM (range from 0 to 100 percent), the better the soundness of RPs [26] .

The mediation method required the following conditions: (1) SORM was significantly associated with NCD (total effect; c coefficient), (2) SORM was significantly associated with CRCSI (CRCHC) (a coefficient), (3) when controlling for SORM, CRCSI (CRCHC) was significantly associated with NCD (b coefficient), (4) the relationship between SORM and NCD was reduced (direct effect, c' coefficient) when controlling for CRCSI (CRCHC) (indirect effect, a*b). The proportions mediated were determined by dividing the indirect effect (a*b) by the total effect (c coefficient). Table 2 shows the SORM of China and variables at the provincial level in 2015, as used in this study. The SORM was 9.70%, thus indicating substantial room for improvement in regard to the RPs aimed at chronic disease. DPCR was 4.92%, thus indicating that responsibilities should be more clearly defined. The median value of AMCR was 0.55%, thus indicating the lack of an external accountability mechanism in each department, which restricted the effectiveness of PCCDs. The mean of CRCSI (58.46%) was higher than the mean of CRCHC (6.72%). 1 The indicator was expressed as the median (IQR). Abbreviations: SORM, soundness of the regulatory mechanism; RECR, regulatory element coverage rate; DPCR, departmental responsibilities clarity rate; RMAR, regulatory mechanism authority rate; AMCR, accountability mechanism clarity rate; CRCHC, coverage rate of the community health centres; CRCSI, coverage rate of the community service institutions; SD, standard deviation; IQR, interquartile range. Table 3 shows baseline characteristics of the study variables. The mean participant age was 61 years, and there was a slightly higher proportion of females (51.85% vs. 48.15% males). A total of 27.36% of participants did not suffer from chronic disease. However, more than 70% had at least one chronic disease, with some suffering from multiple chronic diseases. Table 4 summarises the relationships between variables using Spearman's correlation analysis. SORM was positively correlated with both CRCHC (r = 0.331, p < 0.01) and CRCSI (r = 0.473, p < 0.01). Conversely, NCD exhibited significant negative correlations with SORM (r = \u22120.029, p < 0.01), CRCHC (r = \u22120.049, p < 0.01), and CRCSI (r = \u22120.059, p < 0.01). Table 5 summarises the relationship between SORM and NCDs. SORM exhibited a significant negative correlation with NCD (\u03b2 = \u22120.014, p < 0.01). When controlling for variables at the provincial level, we found that SORM was still significantly associated with NCD (\u03b2 = \u22120.010, p < 0.01). In this case, SORM had a positive effect on the NCD. Table 6 shows the mediating effects of CRCHC and CRCSI. There was a negative correlation between SORM and NCD (path: total effect, \u03b2 = \u22120.014; 95% CI: \u22120.022, \u22120.006). Next, both CRCHC (path: indirect effect, \u03b2 = \u22120.002; 95% CI: \u22120.003, \u22120.001) and CRCSI (path: indirect effect, \u03b2 = \u22120.006; 95% CI: \u22120.008, \u22120.005) mediated the relationship between SORM and NCD. However, the bootstrap analysis showed that each played different mediating roles. CRCHC had a partial mediating effect (11.31% of the total), with the 95% CI of the direct effects in model B including the value of zero, while CRCSI had a major mediating effect (45.42% of the total).

Both policy content and mediation analysis were conducted, demonstrating that RPs had positive impacts on PCCDs, while both the coverage of CSIs and CHCs mediated the relationship between RPs and PCCDs. Further, better SORM was associated with less NCD per capita, which showed that RPs and PCCDs were more effective in regions with those qualities. This supports the rele-vant literature. For example, previous research has shown that the soundness of RPs can effectively improve unhealthy lifestyles among patients with hypertension [7] . Similarly, the soundness of RPs has also been found to promote maternal and child health [25] . In this context, regions with better RPs have more effective PCCDs, particularly when RPs are more comprehensive and cover a range of aspects, such as diet management and the living environment. Meanwhile, the accountability mechanism is implementable when relevant departments have clear responsibilities. For example, the government may raise taxes on alcohol and tobacco while reducing the available subsidies for unhealthy foods. Environmental protection standards should also be strictly implemented by environmental protection departments. In other areas, the Landscaping bureau is responsible for the construction of urban green spaces, while the Food and Drug Administration must supervise the food processing industry to reduce the use of salt and trans-fatty acids [37] . Especially when combined, these efforts can further prevent and control chronic disease. It is therefore necessary to establish a long-term working mechanism for managing general health and chronic disease. Efforts must be directed at improving the contents and processes of management services, clarifying departmental responsibilities, strengthening the departmental accountability mechanism, and establishing a management model targeted at the integrated prevention, treatment, and management of chronic disease [38] .",

Previous studies have shown that communities provide better social environments, which facilitate access to elements such as health education, early detection, early treatment, comprehensive management [40] , and rehabilitation exercises [41] , all of which can further aid in the control of chronic disease. CHCs play important roles due to important aspects of social mobilisation and policy support [42] , as they work as the 'gatekeeper' of residents and 'vanguard' of prevention and control [20] . Community health personnel also maintain closer relationships with residents, thus providing the health management [43] needed to ensure positive health outcomes. In this regard, China should establish and improve RPs specifically aimed at PCCDs, with a strong focus on the incentive mechanism, thus allowing community health personnel to achieve a balance between income and expenditures on capitation fees. In addition, the government should allocate special chronic disease management funds within the per capita public health funds in order to implement a pay-for-performance provision for community health personnel [44] . This will enhance enthusiasm among community health personnel while continuously strengthening the effects of PCCDs in various regions of China.",

The mediation analysis specifically demonstrated that the coverage of CSIs had a more significant mediating effect than that derived from the coverage of CHCs. This may be due to the widespread nature of social factors that affect chronic disease, thus indicating that PCCDs should focus on cooperating with other fields at all levels. As effective carriers for PCCDs, CSIs often undertake multiple responsibilities in addition to those related to health services [10] , such as providing social support at community service centres [44] , promoting physical exercise for the elderly in designated activity rooms [45] , employing community healthcare workers [46] , providing medical care through community pension service centres [47] , and offering health self-education through reading rooms or at community schools [48] . As a specific example, studies have shown that physical exercise, social interaction, access to care, and community service have positive effects on health of older patients with diabetes [49] . Along with the advantages provided through community-based joint prevention and control, these factors play important roles in the context of PCCDs. Based on the idea that health should be included in all policies, we should consider that effective PCCDs may require coordinated participation from multiple stakeholders [50] . In addition to improving CHCs, we should also pay more attention to how multiple departments work as a joint force in the prevention and reduction of chronic disease.",

There are no relevant laws for PCCDs, owing to which the government is unable to ensure adherence. There is also a great deal of room to develop completeness among regulatory elements, including the policymaking process, service provisions, the division of responsibility, and information monitoring and evaluation [24] . In addition, the implementation of PCCDs is restricted by factors such as the lack of organisations or professionals and effective multi-department coordination mechanisms [6] . Further, the responsibilities of relevant departments are not sufficiently clear, thereby resulting in the non-assessment of business objectives and the failure to play a positive role in guiding relevant work. Departments also lack an external supervisory mechanism that could effectively restrict their actions. In this context, the government should work to improve laws and regulations related to the control of chronic disease, enhance the contents of chronic disease management, clarify departmental responsibilities, and improve the regulatory and accountability mechanisms. In sum, these efforts will help prevent and reduce the occurrence of chronic disease.",
