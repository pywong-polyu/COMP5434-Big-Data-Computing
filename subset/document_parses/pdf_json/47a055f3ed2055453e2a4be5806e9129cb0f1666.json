So far, clinical applications have focused on diagnosis and on prediction of outcomes. It is less clear in what way AI can or should support complex clinical decisions that crucially depend on patient preferences. In this paper, we focus on the ethical questions arising from the design, development and deployment of AI systems to support decisionmaking around cardio-pulmonary resuscitation leading to the determination of a patient's Do Not Attempt to Resuscitate (DNAR) status (also known as code status). The COVID-19 pandemic has made us keenly aware of the difficulties physicians encounter when they have to act quickly in stressful situations without knowing what their patient would have wanted. We discuss the results of an interview study conducted with healthcare professionals in a university hospital aimed at understanding the status quo of resuscitation decision processes while exploring a potential role for AI systems in decision-making around code status. Our data suggest that 1) current practices are fraught with challenges such as insufficient knowledge regarding patient preferences, time pressure and personal bias guiding care considerations and 2) there is considerable openness among clinicians to consider the use of AI-based decision support. We suggest a model for how AI can contribute to improve decision-making around resuscitation and propose a set of ethically relevant preconditions -conceptual, methodological and procedural -that need to be considered in further development and implementation efforts.",

At the core of modern AI lies machine learning, which \"transforms the inputs of an algorithm into outputs using statistical, data-driven rules that are automatically derived from a large set of examples, rather than being explicitly specified by humans\" [1]. Deep learning is a form of machine learning that allows to automatically learn multiple layers of data representations, with minimal data preprocessing by humans [2] . Thanks to the increase in available data and computational power, machine and deep learning models can be trained on massive datasets to deliver high performance in tasks from multiple domains, including healthcare.",

For example, AI systems using deep learning have been successful in multiple medical imaging use cases [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] ; they have proven to predict reliably the risk of imminent suicide attempts [9], and they have been used to assess the probability of patients developing serious conditions or being transferred to palliative care [10] .",

In some medical domains, the use of AI systems will replace a considerable part of the work of human experts [12] . However, performance comparisons between AI systems and human experts suffer from the difficulty in reproducing and comparing results due to the lack of a unified approach [11, 13, 14 ]. Yet, it is reasonable to assume that AI systems will increasingly gain in epistemic authority, even though the assistive role of AI is frequently emphasized [15] .

The current pandemic, with its high number of people falling severely ill very quickly, has once more made us keenly aware of the difficulties physicians encounter when they have to act without having a chance to know what the patient would have wanted. Humans making such decisions must integrate multiple sources of information and calibrate them with personal, social and ethical standards. With AI-based systems becoming mature for clinical decision support, such information processing and decision-making can be assisted computationally. Algorithmic suggestions can be consistent with patient preferences and likely outcomes without getting compromised by stress, time pressure, personal bias, conflicts of interest and fear of legal consequences that may influence provider perspectives and the end-of-life conversations with their patients.",

Physicians seem to be making these decisions for a good part relying on their own judgment, based on medical parameters, experience and personal values [18] . Often no advance directive and no surrogate decision-maker are available, so physicians or a legal representative unfamiliar with the patient need to step in [19] . Patients often have insufficient access to professional advance care planning and a limited understanding of a life-threatening resuscitation situation, so it is difficult for them to assess the situation and define their resuscitation status ahead of time (e.g. in an advance directive).

Others may base their decision on inaccurate assumptions. For instance, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation is not as successful as it is often perceived [20] , so patients may overestimate its benefits and disregard its potential harms when taking their decision. Also, it has been shown that relatives acting as surrogate decision makers on life-sustaining treatment frequently feel overburdened [21] and make choices that often do not resonate with the patient's preferences [21, 22] .",

Decision sciences are currently focusing on a variety of value clarification methods [24] , and algorithmic support would be a novel approach helping people understand how others with whom they share certain features and values have decided in a similar situation [25] . In this sense, AI would act as a DNAR status decision support for (potential) patients (cf. the patient-centric application in Graph 1). AI-based decision support might also be helpful for legal representatives having to decide on behalf of incapacitated patients, It might also support healthcare professionals (HCPs) who need to make resuscitation decisions without the possibility to consult an advance directive or legal representatives, by helping clarify which option most likely corresponds to what the patient would have chosen (cf. the proxy/provider-centric application in Graph 1). Given the limitations of algorithmic decision-making (with a view to the risk of bias and to the dependency on suitable training data), the highly personal nature of the decision and its far-reaching consequences, the AI system would be conceived to play a consultative rather than a prescriptive role, it would not replace but support human decision-making.",

The decision to opt for or against CPR in the case of cardiac arrest can be assumed to depend on a number of factors, among them a patient's health status, life expectancy, current quality of life, perceived social obligations towards others, religious beliefs or deeply held secular values. Good training data will include such factors, which need to be encoded in health records, through discussions with the patient, relatives or other means. The algorithm will then be designed to predict the DNAR status based on these features, for example by applying a similarity metric to determine what \"similar patients\" would decide in the same circumstances [35] .

Compatibility with the hospital information system and access management are relevant design features. User training is key: It has to cover the technical aspects of the AI system, and provide a view on how to integrate its predictions into clinical decision-making and into the communication with patients, relatives and staff in accordance with best practice principles of shared decision-making [42, 43] . It should also aim at improving communication skills of the AI system users and raise awareness on the risks and limitations of AI support in decision-making [44] . This should allow countering any tendencies to avoid difficult conversations with patients or family members about DNAR status by resorting to algorithmic predictions, as well as minimizing the likelihood to outsource a core clinical task -establishing a patient's DNAR status -and its potential implications for the patient-providerrelationship to an AI system. We sketch examples for potential use cases in Box 3. The examples given in Box 3 hints at the many questions that the implementation of such a system would raise: What information can or should the system reveal about how it calculated the preferences (transparency, explainability)? How do we know an AI system is good enough for use in clinical routine?",

These questions include issues of bias and fairness as well as of autonomy and accountability [45] [46] [47] . The exploration of an example for a specific decision support system provides an opportunity to discuss and address ethical and policy concerns in a very concrete, hands-on way [41] . A carefully reflected, well-designed AI-based system can have an immediate, significant and practical impact to personalized healthcare by contributing to better outcomes of critical healthcare decisions. However, it is of prime importance that framework conditions are defined such that they justify citizens' and health professionals' trust in the AI system. Evaluation standards for the performance of AI-based decision-support systems will be urgently needed to make sure systems can be discarded if unsuitable or improved.",
