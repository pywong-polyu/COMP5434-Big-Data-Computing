Using supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in Japan, this study examines how governments can mitigate these economic losses when they are obliged to implement lockdowns. Through tests of all combinations of two-region lockdowns, we find that coordinated, i.e., simultaneous, lockdowns yield smaller GDP losses than uncoordinated lockdowns. Furthermore, we test practical scenarios in which Japan's 47 regions impose lockdowns over three months and find that GDP losses are lower if nationwide lockdowns are coordinated than if they are uncoordinated.",

As of January, 2021, while some countries and regions have lifted lockdown, others continue or have resumed lockdown because of the second and third waves of the epidemic. These lockdowns obviously decline the economic activity of locked-down regions. In addition, the negative economic effect of lockdown diffuses through supply chains, i.e., supplier-client relationships of firms, to other regions that are not necessarily locked down. When a firm shrinks its production due to lockdown, its client firms suffer from production reduction because of lack of supply of intermediate goods and services. Its suppliers also reduce production because of demand shortages.",

The importance of this aspect can be easily recognised from the experience of Sweden. Sweden, unlike other European countries, did not impose a strict lockdown in 2020 to minimise the economic effect. However, it experienced a 7.4% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter of 2020 compared with in the previous year. This reduction for Sweden is comparable to those in neighbouring countries that imposed lockdown (-6.2% for Finland and -4.6% for Norway, Eurostat), possibly because of propagation of negative effects from locked-down countries to Sweden through economic networks [15] . This anecdote may indicate that, provided lockdowns in neighbour countries, the Swedish government should have followed them and imposed lockdown to minimise the human loss while maintaining the economic loss similar to that from the no-lockdown strategy.",

Agent-based models that incorporate the interactions of agents through networks have been widely used in social science recently [18, 19, 20] . Then, utilising parameter values calibrated from the actual experiences of past lockdowns in Japan in April and May, 2020, we perform many virtual simulations addressing the economic effect of combinations of lockdowns in different regions. In particular, we examine (1) how a lockdown in one prefecture affects production in other prefectures, (2) how the effect of a simultaneous lockdown in two prefectures differ from the effects of asynchronous lockdowns in the same prefectures, and (3) how nationwide coordination of lockdowns affects production.",

In the model, each firm utilises inputs delivered from its supplier firms to produce an output and delivers it to client firms and final consumers. Firms in the same industry are assumed to produce the same output. Supply chains are fixed over time (in two senses): First, each firm uses a firmspecific set of input varieties and does not change the input set over time. Second, each firm is linked with fixed suppliers and clients and cannot be linked with any new firms over time, even after a supply chain disruption. Because supply chains are flexibly changed in the long run, our analysis is focusing on shortterm changes in production. Furthermore, we assume that each firm keeps inventories of each input at a level randomly determined from a Poisson distribution. Following Inoue and Todo [5] , parameter values are calibrated based on the case of the Great East Japan earthquake. (see Supplementary Information B.1 for details).",

The effect of this production reduction is propagated to both upstream and downstream firms. On the one hand, the demand of the restricted firm for intermediates from its suppliers immediately declines, and thus, the suppliers have to shrink their own production. Since the demand of suppliers' suppliers also declines, the effect of the restriction propagates upstream. On the other hand, the supply of products from the restricted firm to its client firms declines. Then, as the first reaction, client firms use their inventories of inputs to maintain the current level of production. In addition, client firms can procure inputs from other suppliers with additional production capacity in the same industry as the firms with declining supply. However, as explained, the supply chains is fixed, and the connection with the alternate supplier must already be in place before the restriction is imposed. If the inventories and inputs from substitute suppliers are insufficient, clients have to reduce their production because of an input shortage. Accordingly, the effect of the restriction propagates downstream through supply chains. Compared with upstream propagation, downstream propagation is likely to be slower because of the presence of inventory and substitution of suppliers.",

Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate some benchmark reduction level.

For example, in lifeline/essential sectors such as the utilities, health, and transport sectors, the rate of reduction is assumed to be zero; in other words, production capacity in these sectors does not change on lockdown. In sectors in which it is assumed that exposure to the virus is low (50%) and 47.5% of workers can work at home, such as the wholesale and retail sectors, the rate of reduction is 26.25% (= 0.5 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 0.475)). Sectors with ordinary exposure (100%) and a lower share of workers working at home (26.8%), such as the iron and other metal product sectors, reduce production capacity by 26.8% (= 1.0 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 0.268)).

Regrading the asynchronous case, on the other hand, in practice, it is probably not plausible to consider the 47 prefectures imposing restrictions without no time ovelap. Therefore, as the simulation to contrast with the concurrent simulation, we randomly set the starts of the four-week restrictions in the 47 prefectures across the period of three months covering the winter season. In the random selection of the duration for each prefecture, at least one prefecture imposes its restriction from the beginning (the first day). We call this simulation the asynchronous case.

(See Figure ) First, in terms of GRP loss, we can observe from colored dots in these figures, that there is not much difference between the one-and four-week simulations. This result is somewhat unexpected simply because if a restriction lasts longer, the damage should presumably be larger. Indeed, simulations for Tokyo in another study show that a four-week lockdown results in a larger losses than a one-week lockdown [12] . One interpretation of this difference relates to substitutability. The general implications of lockdown involve a very strong capacity loss. On the other hand, the restrictions considered in this study are milder than a full lockdown. As explained in Section 3.1, substitution can be considered to affect intermediate goods. If supply disruption is too strong to be compensated by other suppliers, the downward pressure on production in the supplied firm could be large. On the other hand, if the disruption is small, it can be remedied by substitution from other suppliers. Therefore, we presume that capacity reduction and GDP losses have a nonliner relationship. In other words, there is a tipping point at which the supply chain can absorb the negative shock through substitution.",

If this occurs under an asynchronous restriction, the direct loss is propagated to other firms. However, suppose that there is another restriction to another prefecture Y, and let us consider client B in prefecture X of supplier A. Since client B also reduces its production, its demand and supply decline. The supply from A to B corresponds to the demand from B to A. Therefore, both declines occur in both directions. Simply put, they overlap. However, if the restriction is imposed on only one prefecture, this overlap does not occur.

First, if the two prefectures do not have connections between them, the mitigation of overlaps is not likely to happen. In fact, there are several combinations of two prefectures without connections (They are not included in combinations of a prefecture and Tokyo. Tokyo are connected with all the other prefectures). Even in such cases, we observe concurrent cases have smaller effect. We presume that this effect comes from simultaneousness on indirect connections. The example of simultaneousness in the last paragraph indicates a direct connection in two prefectures. However, even if two prefectures do not have direct connections, two prefectures are connected indirectly through firms in the third prefecture. Since this indirect simultaneousness would be smaller than the direct one, this simulation shows us that even in such cases, there is the advantage of the concurrent case. In addition, as indicated in Section 4.1, because of substitutability, if the negative shock is small, it may be absorbed by other supply chain partners. In other words, the size of the negative shock may be superlinearly associated with the GDP loss. Therefore, the result shown in Figure 2 , i.e., that asynchronous restrictions mostly result in larger GDP losses than concurrent ones, is not obvious, and we uncover it only through the simulation. Indeed, the combinations of the Toyama and Saga prefectures and the Wakayama and Kumamato prefectures show an inverse relationship; i.e., the concurrent restrictions imposes larger GDP losses than the asynchronous restrictions, although the gap is very small and is not statistically significant in the Wilcoxon rank sum test. As a final analysis, in this restriction setting, the costs of concurrent restrictions are generally smaller than those of asynchronous restrictions.",

A sum of two GDP losses is the result of the simulations of two asynchronous prefecture restrictions. Therefore, the rank order of the GDP losses is the same as the rank order of the simulation results in the asynchronous cases. For example, in the combinations of the different prefectures with Tokyo, the largest loss in the asynchronous case corresponds to Osaka, and the second largest to Aichi. This order is the same as the rank of the outcomes under the one-prefecture restriction. On the other hand, the order of the concurrent simulation results does not completely mirror the order of the one-prefecture restriction simulation results. For example, in Figure 2 , the order of the concurrent simulation outcomes displays anomalies for Hokkaido and Saitama. The isolated loss of Saitama is larger than that of Hokkaido. However, the concurrent losses have the opposite order. This anomaly can again be explained by the cancelling-out effect described above. Saitama is located next to Tokyo. Therefore, they have strong supply chain connections. Hence, it seems that the cancelling-out effect is more pronounced in Saitama than in Hokkaido. Since there are many examples of such anomalies, we can find a mechanism behind this phenomenon, but we leave this issue as the future work.",

Therefore, in principle, restrictions should be imposed simultaneously where possible. Figure 3 shows the temporal development of the simulations. The concurrent restrictions naturally cause intense GDP losses. The asynchronous restrictions show dome-like shapes and two-level stages, with daily GDP losses low in one stage, but high in the other stage and no intermediate stages. The cause of this result is the dominant effect of Tokyo. Figure C. 7 in the Supplementary Information shows 5 out of 100 samples for the asynchronous case.

To obtain the production capacity of each firm, we assume that the rate of reduction in production capacity for each sector is given by the degree of the aggregated reduction because of exposure to the virus [8] multiplied by the share of workers who cannot work at home [9] . Both of the cited studies deal with the global situation in April and May in 2020. The rate of reduction because of exposure to the virus is determined by how many workers in the sector reduced their activities to avoid contact with others to prevent infections. Because [9] defines the rate of reduction uniformly worldwide, we modify the rate for some sectors that clearly differ in the case of Japan. Table B .1 shows the reduction rate for each sector assumed in [9] .",

            "text": "Although it is assumed that the reduction rate is applicable to any country, there must be a difference between the real rate of the country and the assumed reduction rate. Inoue et al. [17] estimate this difference for Japan. First, they estimate the GDP loss by using a real economic loss estimated by the Indices of All Industry Activities (IAA) for April and May of 2020. The estimated loss is 7.52 trillion yen (71.2 billion U.S. dollars at 107 yen / dollar.) or 2.5% of yearly GDP. On the other hand, if we use the reduction rate derived as explained above, the estimated GDP loss is 35.0 trillion yen (327 billion U.S. dollars). It can be presumed that the actual reduction rate is smaller than the worldwide reduction rate. Therefore, the rate is adjusted by multiplying the worldwide reduction rate by the same weight so that the simulation estimation fits the IAIA estimation. The weight of 32.3% provides the closest fit to the IAIA estimation. In this study, we use this weight and the worldwide reduction rate as the adjusted reduction rate shown in Table B .1. 3 show the effects of the one-prefecture restrictions for one and four weeks, respectively. Although we test two-and three-week durations as well, there are few differences from the results based on one-and four-week durations, and thus we omit them. The sector levels are (1) the accommodation and leisure sectors, (2) the restaurant sector plus (1), (3) the retail sector plus (2) , and (4) all sectors. The restriction is applied to all sectors for four weeks. The horizontal axis is the GRP of the restricted prefecture. The vertical axis is the GDP loss caused by the restriction. Some labels overlap but for small GRP, this is unavoidable, and they are not particularly important in this figure. ",
