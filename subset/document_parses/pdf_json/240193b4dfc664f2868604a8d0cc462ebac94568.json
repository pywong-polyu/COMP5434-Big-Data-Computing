A vaccine is yet to be found, and physical distancing through lockdowns seems to be the only way to slow the spread. However, the lockdowns are also pushing the world economy to the brink [2] . Millions, in countries across the world are facing the bleak reality of job losses, business closure and economic hardship. Hence, it has become imperative to find ways to allow a section of the society -those who have either recovered or are unexposed to the disease, carry on with their day to day business operations to kickstart the economy. What is desired is a system, that will enable easing of the lockdowns, allowing countries to continue with their economic activities, perhaps, in a reduced capacity, while still strictly maintaining appropriate physical distancing norms for such relaxations. Consequently, strategies have to be put in place that will assist people in practising the distancing norms in public places. Modern communication technologies and the ubiquity of smartphones use can be leveraged to devise such mechanisms. Many countries have developed mobile applications to combat the spread of the virus by adopting technologies such as bluetooth and GPS data for contact tracing, which is a mechanism for tracing people who had come in close contact with some one who is infected with the virus [3] . Such mobile applications collect information about persons who have been in close proximity with an individual from their smart phones. If the individual is ever diagnosed with the virus, every person who had possibly been near that infected individual, during the period in which he was contagious, can be traced and directed to take measures such as self-quarantine and or testing [4] . However, such applications facilitate identification of only those people who have already been exposed to an infected individual. While there is no doubt that contact tracing can contribute immensely in containing the virus, we have certainly reached a stage where economic activities also have to be allowed in a disciplined manner. Therefore, it is highly desirable that systems be put in place that can aid in prevention of exposing an individual from infection while s/he is engaged in her/his day to day business activities. Applications should be devised in such a way that it's users can be given prior intimation about the Covid status of people in their vicinity or of people that they plan to meet. There should be provisions in the application that alerts users before they are entering a zone or an area that is certified to be a covid hotspot zone. In such a scenario, the person receiving such alerts can then take preventive measures. Since the success of such applications depend largely on people participation, user privacy concerns should be taken into account and there should be inbuilt mechanisms to provide incentives to people for their participation. The data accumulated through such a public initiative should be available to general public for scrutiny and use, so that they can reap it's benefit in their individual businesses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 307, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1434, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1820, "end": 1823, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this paper, we propose a framework that can be used by people to protect themselves from infections while they are involved in their activities.

China [6] , Singapore [7] , South Korea, Israel [8] and Australia [9] have taken the lead in asking their citizens to install surveillance apps to facilitate contact tracing. India has developed Aarogya Setu app for the same purpose [10]. These government initiatives have little or no privacy protections built into their systems which have raised concerns of the applications being used for surveillance beyond their stated purpose. For example, the South Korean app uses GPS location data and citizens are required to provide their real names and their government issued identity numbers [11] . This means that privacy is non-existent in the contact tracing mechanism and citizens using the app can be tracked anytime and anywhere. Singapore's TraceTogether app stores anonymised IDs of nearby phones exchanged through bluetooth, in encrypted form . The IDs are generated by encrypting with a private key held by the Ministry of Health and hence can be decrypted by only this government agency. This does not reveal the users identity to other parties but is known to the government. Hence, users have no privacy from government surveillance. India's Aarogya Setu seeks the users bluetooth connectivity and location data at the time of installation, which is sent to government servers effectively allowing government agencies to know the users whereabouts. Hamagen ( Hebrew for the shield ) app, endorsed by Israel's Ministry of Health, periodically (typically one hour) downloads anonymous GPS location data of patients diagnosed as covid positive from the MoH cloud service. It then compares this list with location data Hamagen has stored of the user in the phone. This cross-referencing can then determine if the user has been in presence of anyone who has been tested as positive. User location is not sent to the government servers and the comparing of location data is done on-device of the user. Location history and WIFI networks that the user came within range, is stored on device for two-weeks. Future versions would keep track of bluetooth connections and data over sound.

Their framework consists of four subsystems -Infection Verifier Subsystem (IVS), P2P Mobile App, Blockchain Platform and Mass Surveillance System. The IVS is the part of the system that records covid positive persons in the blockchain by using\"infection patterns\" which are regular expressions. The patterns derived from this regular expression, the \"infection instances\" are used to digitally represent people or places who have been infected by this patient. These are also recorded in the blockchain. A finite automaton can verify if a regular expression instance conforms to the infected pattern which will indicate a high probability of contagion. By representing people as regular expressions, the system does anonymise the users. These instances are also used in their proposed P2P mobile application. In their scheme, the authors use the blockchain for storing the infected pattern and all confirmed cases (infected instances) based on the pattern. The P2P application serves to notify the populace that they might have been in contact with an infected person or been to a place visited by an infected person. The Mass Surveillance System component is responsible for contact tracing and for identifying the public places the infected person may have visited in the last few days, which is sent to the blockchain to be stored as infected patterns and infected instances. However, it is unclear what underlying communication technology is employed to implement this mass surveillance scheme. It is also unclear who the block miners are in this system and what incentives they have. In Table 2 , a summary of important features of the various schemes discussed in this section is presented. Blockchain as a concept was first coined in the white paper of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 [18] . It is a mechanism for the storage of decentralized, time stamped and immutable data. As it is decentralized and distributed in nature, it is not owned by a single authority and is kept as a distributed ledger. As shown in Figure 1 , some intriguing features of blockchain that motivated us in adapting this technology in our proposal, are described as follows: [19] Autonomous. Transactions in a blockchain can be carried out without the involvement or control of a central authority or a single authority governing the network. This architecture provides the benefits of a decentralized system with reduced operational costs and avoiding performance bottlenecks at the central location.

It's popularity is due to the fact that it provides safety from various attacks. PoW is used to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain by solving a complex computational problem. Miners race against each other to solve the problem and create the blocks. The first miner to solve the problem gets to add the new block into the blockchain and claim a reward. The reward is an incentive mechanism that ensures the participation of miners in the blockchain. PoW has some limitations like it is computationally intensive and vulnerable to attack from 51% of the nodes in the network. To overcome the limitations of PoW method, Proof of Stake (PoS) method was introduced that determines the block creator based on a combination of node's wealth, the staking age and random selection. Selection purely on the basis of the node's wealth would result in the node with the most wealth having a constant advantage in block creation. Hence a combination of various strategies have been adopted. The staking age ensures that nodes that hold the stake longer have a better chance to forge blocks which decreases the chances of malicious attacks.
