            "text": "Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a rare, life-threatening disease, typically affecting patients with end-stage renal disease. It is characterized by widespread vascular calcification, endothelial fibrosis and end-organ ischemia. The mortality rate is high with infection and sepsis being the most common causes of death. Common therapies include restoration of calcium and phosphorous homeostasis, wound care and pain control. Although soft tissue calcification is a known complication in children with advanced renal disease, the incidence of CUA in pediatrics remains unknown. Additionally, current literature regarding its management in pediatric patients is lacking. We report the case of a 17-year-old African-American male patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to Wegener's granulomatosis who developed CUA after 3 years on peritoneal dialysis. Treatment with sodium thiosulfate (STS) and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy alone was ineffective, forcing the patient to undergo bilateral below the-knee-amputation (BKA) 5 months after presentation. It was not until peritoneal dialysis had been changed to daily hemodialysis, while continuing STS and HBO therapy, that the patient demonstrated complete resolution of CUA on repeat bone scan. Based on these findings, and the extremely high mortality rate associated with this disease, CUA management requires early and aggressive intervention with multi-faceted therapy, including prompt conversion from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis, STS infusions and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.",

It is a rapidly progressive condition, resulting in painful necrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. These areas can become ulcerated and infected, which often necessitate limb amputation [1, 2] . Once considered a very rare condition, CUA now has reported prevalence rates as high as 4.1% in adults with end-stage-renal disease (ESRD). Increased awareness, along with the extensive use of calcium-containing phosphate binders and vitamin D analogues, is likely responsible for the increased prevalence of this disease [3] . Treatment of CUA remains controversial, with many experimental approaches currently in practice, including sodium thiosulfate (STS) and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) [1, 2] . Unfortunately, the prognosis of CUA remains poor, and mortality rates are highgreater than 80%. Death usually ensues after infection or sepsis, often within 6 months of presentation [2] .",

Evidence of poor perfusion to the patient's hands also became apparent, as demonstrated by blue discoloration of the distal fingertips and delayed capillary refill.

Common supportive care measures include aggressive pain control and wound care. Other experimental therapies, including parathyroidectomy (of most benefit to those individuals with extremely elevated parathyroid hormone levels), cinacalcet, bisphosphonates, low doses of plasminogen activator, STS and hyperbaric oxygen, have all shown some success in a variety of small studies or case reports [3, 5] .",

Although CUA most frequently occurs in parallel to secondary hyperparathyroidism, 7 other cases of CUA in patients with relatively low parathyroid hormone (PTH) values and low-turnover bone disease have been described [14] . While patients with adynamic bone have similar intestinal calcium absorption to those with hyperparathyroidism, the ability of bone to buffer calcium is diminished [15] .

Our patient developed intermittent nausea and vomiting, both during and after STS infusions. This improved significantly with granisetron pre-medication. He also developed metabolic acidosis, which resolved with oral administration of sodium bicarbonate. Of note, the patient had one episode of ventricular tachycardia (five beats in total) with the first STS infusion, at which his time serum bicarbonate level was 13 mmol/L. This particular adverse side effect has not been reported previously. It is unclear whether this arrhythmia was due to the STS itself or to the STSinduced metabolic acidosis. It did not recur after correction of the metabolic acidosis. Hypocalcemia was not noted in our patient. STS therapy for our patient resulted in a rapid and dramatic reduction in pain, but it did not prevent further progression of the disease. Thus, after 1 month of STS infusions, HBO therapy was initiated. HBO is often instituted after medical and/or surgical management has failed. It has been shown to be beneficial for adult dialysis patients with CUA [16] [17] [18] [19] . This procedure enhances wound healing by improving oxygen delivery to the diseased hypoxic tissue, thereby stimulating fibroblast function, collagen formation and angiogenesis [20] . The process itself consists of the patient breathing 100% oxygen in a sealed chamber with an increased pressure, typically between 2 atm and 2.5 atm, for 60-90 minutes per session. Twenty-five to 40 consecutive sessions have been used in the treatment of CUA.",
