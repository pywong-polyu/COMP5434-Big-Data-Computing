In particular, the information shared on Twitter during disease outbreaks is a goldmine for the field of epidemiology. Research studies show that Twitter provides timely access to health-related data about chronic disease, outbreaks, and epidemics [4] . In this paper, we present GeoCoV19, a large-scale Twitter dataset about the COVID-19 pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is an infectious disease that was first identified in December 2019 and has spread globally since then. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of May 6, 2020, more than 263K fatalities have been recorded, and more than 3.8 million people have been infected globally. Twitter has seen a massive surge in the daily traffic amid COVID-19. People try to connect with their family and friends, look for the latest information about the pandemic, report their symptoms, and ask questions. Moreover, many conspiracies, rumors, and misinformation began to surface on social media, e.g., drinking bleach can cure it, Bill Gates is behind it, etc. Furthermore, both benefits and unanticipated consequences of lockdowns and closure of businesses around the globe and social distancing are among the top topics on social media.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 421, "end": 424, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this dataset collection, we aimed at covering several different perspectives related to the COVID-19 pandemic ranging from social distancing to food scarcity and symptoms to treatments and shortage of supplies and masks. The dataset contains more than 524 million multilingual tweets collected over a period of 90 days starting from February 1, 2020 till May 1, 2020, using hundreds of multilingual hashtags and keywords. Various public health and disease surveillance applications that use social media rely on broad coverage of location information. However, only a limited number of tweets contain geolocation information (i.e., 1-3%). To increase the geographical coverage of the dataset, we employ a gazetteer-based approach that leverages various metadata information from Twitter messages to infer their geolocation. The dataset contains around 378K geotagged tweets with GPS coordinates and 5.4 million tweets with place information. However, with the help of the proposed geolocation inference approach, we extracted additional geolocation information for 297 million tweets using the location information from the user profile and for 452 million tweets using toponyms in tweet content. Consequently, our dataset contains around 491 million tweets with at least one type of geolocation information, which constitutes 94% of the entire dataset. Overall, there are 43 million unique users in the dataset, which includes around 209K users who have verified Twitter accounts. In terms of its multilingualism, the dataset covers 62 international languages.

This place tag associates a tweet with a location referring to a city, an area, or a famous point-of-interest such as a building or a restaurant. Twitter provides the place field data in a JSON dictionary that contains several types of information including city or country name, and a bounding box representing the specified location.

However, due to either unsatisfactory results (e.g., most of them need proper capitalization to detect location names) or not enough computational speed to deal with our large dataset, we were unable to employ these tools in our study. Instead, we have adopted a gazetteer-based approach and used Nominatim, which is a search engine for OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. 3 Specifically, we used the Nominatim tool to perform two operations: (i) geocoding-the process of obtaining geo-coordinates from a location name, and (ii) reverse geocoding-the process of obtaining a location name from geo-coordinates. The official online Nominatim service does not permit more than 60 calls/minute, and hence, is not suitable for our purpose to make millions of calls in a reasonable time period.

The dataset has been collected over a period of 90 days from February 1 to May 1, 2020 and consists of more than 524 million multilingual tweets. As the geolocation information is essential for many tasks such as disease tracking and surveillance, we employed a gazetteer-based approach to extract toponyms from user location and tweet content to derive their geolocation information using the Nominatim (Open Street Maps) data at different geolocation granularity levels. In terms of geographical coverage, the dataset spans over 218 countries and 47K cities in the world. The tweets in the dataset are from more than 43 million Twitter users, including around 209K verified accounts. These users posted tweets in 62 different languages. We posit that GeoCoV19 affords the ability to develop computational models to have a better understanding of how societies are collectively coping with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the dataset can inform the development of AI-based systems to forecast disease outbreaks as well as provide surveillance for authorities to act timely, learn about knowledge gaps and urgent needs of the general public, identify unanticipated issues, and tackle misinformation and fake news, among others.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}]}
