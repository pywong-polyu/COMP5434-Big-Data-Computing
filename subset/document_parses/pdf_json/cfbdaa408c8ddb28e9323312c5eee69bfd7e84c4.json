Epitomising one of the major therapeutic success stories of the last 50 years, 5-year overall survival for childhood ALL is now around 90% in high-income settings. 1 As a result, the global prevalence of survivors is increasing year on year, and will continue to do so as treatments improve, populations age, costs fall and new clinical collaborations between high-income and lowincome countries are forged. 2 Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba With minimal selection bias and loss to follow-up, findings from this national study are based on linked hospital data, not self-report. \u25ba Ensuring homogeneity of treatment, diagnostic dates are contemporaneous with the Medical Research Council's national randomised controlled trial of ALL treatment (UKALL XI), within which 90.5% of those who survived were enrolled. \u25ba The individually sex-matched and age-matched general population controls had a similar deprivation distribution to cases, enabling robust baseline effect measures to be calculated across the 25-year follow-up period. \u25ba Analyses are constrained by the fact that hospital episode statistics are primarily collected for administrative and clinical purposes, and not for research.",

            "text": "In contrast to many other childhood cancers, ALL treatment is prolonged, with current protocols typically administering chemotherapy in phases extending over a 2-year to 3-year period. 3 That children who survive ALL tend to have higher mortality and morbidity in later life, including subsequent cancers and a wide range of other therapy-related conditions (table 1) , is established. [4] [5] [6] [7] With respect to the latter, however, much of the information on late effects among survivors has come either from analyses of hospitalisations or from questionnaires completed by consenting individuals. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] As is evident from the studies summarised in table 1 (which includes those that examined all leukaemias combined and those that also included young adults), less attention has been paid to chronic conditions that do not require hospital admission, 7 18-20 and to morbidity patterns that change over time. 7 12 21 The longitudinal data examined in this report contain information on hospital outpatient attendances, as well as inpatient episodes, cancer registrations and deaths. Adding significantly to the existing knowledge base, a large cohort of children (<15 years) diagnosed with ALL in England during 1992-1996 and their individually sexmatched and age-matched population controls have been tracked for up to 25 years through their teenage and young adult (TYA) years. Increasing the power to detect effects should they exist, this diagnostic time period coincides with the UKALL XI randomised controlled trial (RCT) 22 ; the last very intensive UK RCT prior to the era of clinical investigations enabling reduction in therapy for patients with rapid early response to treatment. 23 ",

[25] [26] [27] Briefly, the study population comprised all children (0-14 years) registered for primary care with the National Health Service (NHS) 1992-1996 (England and Wales) and 1991-1995 (Scotland). All children newly diagnosed with cancer (cases) were ascertained via proactive notification systems established in all treatment centres across England, Scotland and Wales; and each child whose parents agreed to be interviewed (87%; all cancers combined) was individually matched on sex, date of birth and region of residence to up to 10 randomly selected controls. The general practitioners (GPs) of the first two controls identified ('first-choice controls') were approached and, with their permission, the parents of the children were contacted and asked to participate in the study. Overall, 72% of firstchoice control families participated; but if the GP refused permission to contact the parents, or the parents themselves declined, the next control on the list was selected, and so on until two control families agreed. [25] [26] [27] For methodological purposes, 26 27 details of all non-participating cases and controls were retained in the UKCCS registration database.",

First, since childhood ALL survivors are routinely monitored via outpatient visits to paediatrics, haematology and/or oncology in the UK, HES attendances to these clinical specialties were separated from those to 'other specialties' at the outset (figure 2). All subsequent specialtyspecific analyses presented in this report were restricted to the 'other specialties'. As in previous reports, 28 29 a single inpatient admission and/or two or more face-toface outpatient attendances were used to indicate potential health issues. Exact time-to-event methods were used to plot estimates of the hospital visit hazard rates before Open access calculating cumulative incidence (considering death as a competing risk), and risks (rate ratios and attributable risks) associated with specific clinical specialties. Hospital visit hazard rates (all visits) are estimated as the number of visits per person year while incidence rates of ever visiting specific clinical specialties are calculated per 1000 person years; for the latter, follow-up time was truncated at the first hospital visit to the specialty. All specialties were analysed, and findings for the 15 specialties with the highest cumulative incidences among the cases are presented.",

Ensuring homogeneity of treatment, the original study's diagnostic dates were contemporaneous with the national UKALL XI RCT, within which 90.5% of UKCCS 5-year survivors were enrolled. 22 30 This comparatively high-intensity RCT was the last UK childhood ALL trial prior to the stratification of patient treatment based on early bone marrow response to induction treatment (measured by percentage of leukaemia cells in the marrow). 23 31 Information on UKALL XI's scheduling of drugs is provided in the report by Hann et al, 22 several of which have been implicated, either singly or combined, in therapy-related effects (table 1) . It is, however, important to note that several of the UKALL XI drugs are no longer used (eg, etoposide, 6-thioguanine) or are used more sparingly (eg, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids), and that cranial irradiation is no longer routinely administered, being reserved for infrequent particular indications. 32 Hence, the nature of Figure 4 Cumulative incidence (%), incidence rates (per 1000 person years), attributable risks and incidence rate ratios for the top 15 inpatient specialties (excluding paediatrics, haematology and oncology) with one or more admissions in the 5-25 years following diagnosis (cases diagnosed aged <15 years, 1992-1996) and their matched population controls.

Other major strengths include its national coverage, completeness of case ascertainment, and large in-built sex-matched and age-matched general population comparator that is similarly distributed with respect to region and area-based deprivation (IMD) [25] [26] [27] ; the latter obviating the need to rely on published national rates, as has mostly been the case in the UK thus far. 10 15 33-35 With regard to weaknesses, the lack of data from other parts of the NHS, including primary care and adolescent psychosocial services, is an obvious deficiency that currently affects all UK record-linkage studies of the type described here. The relative paucity of information on psychological morbidities is particularly relevant to childhood cancer survivors, who are known to be at increased risk of a number of such disorders. 4 36 37 Missing information within the HES datasets is also an issue; diagnostic data, for example, are largely absent from outpatient HES. Furthermore, although steps to mitigate surveillance bias were taken by requiring at least two face-toface outpatient visits to a given specialty, we cannot rule out the possibility that childhood cancer survivors were more likely to be referred to secondary care than their peers. With virtually complete linkage to existing national databases established, our future research will, however, continue to monitor the health of cancer survivors across their lifespan. As the cohort matures and the number of events increase, this will include more detailed examination of second malignancies, as well as factors potentially associated with ALL survival and/or outcome, such as socioeconomic status and treatment information (eg, risk strata, and relapse and/or transplant therapy).",

Future work to specifically address longer term health in relation to intensities and modifications of treatment including: central nervous system radiation (and dose), numbers of intensification blocks, particular drugs (eg, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, anthracyclines, etoposide, thioguanine) as well as early relapse and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning is planned. Thus far, adding to a large excess risk for death and cancer, we found that survivors experienced excess outpatient and inpatient activity across their TYA years, which was not related to routine follow-up monitoring. Involving most clinical specialties, the observed associations are striking; showing no signs of diminishing over the first 25 years of follow-up, the main exception is the comparatively low midwifery contact seen among female ALL survivors. All survivors of ALL are at increased risk of late effects from treatment, and our findings underscore the need to take prior ALL diagnosis into account when interpreting seemingly unrelated symptoms in later life, which currently might not be recognised by specialties outside haemato-oncology. As importantly, there is also a need for provision of information to survivors themselves to encourage them to declare previous treatment for ALL as a child when they access healthcare.",
