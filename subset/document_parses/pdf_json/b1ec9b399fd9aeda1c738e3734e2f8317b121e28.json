The mitigation strategy aims to reduce transmission such that healthcare systems are not overwhelmed, while aiming to maintain the chain of transmission in order to achieve herd immunity. In contrast, the suppression strategy is aimed at virus elimination. In hindsight, countries that acted early to suppress the disease have excelled at minimizing both the public health and economic impact of the epidemic [9] [10] [11] . While early suppression measures appear to outperform the mitigation strategy both in terms of public health goals and economic costs, such policies would not necessarily be successful in countries where citizens are more averse to government-enforced control and surveillance measures [12] . Moreover, suppression measures would only be successful if implemented in the early stages of the epidemic and sufficiently strictly as to curtail transmission effectively. In a number of settings, however, suppression has been implemented in a piece-meal manner, leading to periods of drastic interventions including lockdowns punctuated by relaxation of social distancing measures and subsequent uptick in transmission [13, 14] . This prompted us to examine the optimal mitigation strategy, which aims to manage or mitigate the healthcare impacts of the epidemic while population approaches herd immunity.",

It is unfeasible to review comprehensively this body of work, so we confine ourselves to a number of the key studies. Rowthorn and Maciejowski [15] investigated the optimal uniform lockdown in a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model assuming a variety of parameterizations [15] . Their objective function assigned monetary values to costs arising from infection, lockdown, and value of life. Their main finding was that in the medium term, a policy that maintains effective reproduction number value close to 1 provides the best path. Bethune and Korinek [16] contrasted the decisions made by rational, individual agents with the choices made by a social planner who is able to coordinate the choices of individuals [16] . They found that rational agents generate large externalities because they fail to internalize the effects of their economic and social activities on others' risk of infection. Alvarez et al. formalized the social planner's dynamic control using an SIR epidemiological model and a linear economy [17] . The best strategy starts with a severe lockdown two weeks after the epidemic, covers 60% of the population after a month, and progressively decreases to 20% of the population after three months. More recently, a number of studies have broadened this exploration to identify age-specific optimal control strategies [18, 19] .",

Reductions in transmission may result from lower contacts (due to isolationin-place ordinances, movement restrictions or lockdown policies), or the adoption of personal protective measures that serve to curtail transmission upon contact (such as the use of face masks and personal protective equipment, PPE), with varying societal impact. The fitness function is expressed such that a strategy is rewarded for allowing the epidemic to remove individuals from the susceptible pool without overwhelming the healthcare capacity. The proposed neuroevolution strategy begins by initializing a population of random policy functions. The generated policy functions are then used to simulate the trajectory of the epidemic. The fitness of each function is then evaluated based on the specified reward function. The most elite policy functions are then perturbed (mutated) to generate the next generation (offspring). The new population is then evaluated and this process is repeated for a pre-defined number of iterations. We also derived the optimal control solution via Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) [23] and compared the results with the optimal neuroevolution policy.",

The neuroevolution strategy aims to find the optimal policy function, P G Mostelite , with highest fitness score. Fitness score of policy function j in generation i, f i j , is equal to the sum of rewards, J (equation (8)) and is obtained by running the SEIRH model with the corresponding policy function. First, M policy functions (P 1 j ) are randomly initialized. For each policy function, a trajectory is rolled out and fitness score is calculated at the end of simulation, as shown in Fig. 2 . The L policy functions with the highest fitness scores are mutated to generate the next generation of policy functions. Mutation is implemented by adding a random Gaussian noise, scaled by the mutation rate, r, to h parameters of elite policy functions. The new offspring policy functions served as the parents of next generation. This process continues to find a policy function with a sufficiently high fitness score, P G Mostelite . We used a fullyconnected feed-forward network with three 16-unit hidden layers and one tanh output layer to model the policy function.

In simpler problems where an analytic solution can be obtained for the optimality system, the PMP method can provide more insights about the optimal control solution and the dynamics of the system. Otherwise, a neuroevolutionary approach is computationally advantageous since the resulting policy function provides an optimal strategy for a broad range of initial conditions at a substantially smaller computations cost. That is, the PMP optimal intervention for a given initial condition is obtained by solving the boundary-value problem formulated in equations (1)-(5) and equations (10)- (16) .

Thus, we examined the effects of variation in these parameters on the resulting optimal policy (see Supplementary Fig. S3 ). We constrained a 1 to be 1 and changed the values of a 2 and a 3 over a logarithmic grid. For each parameter set, we trained the neuroevolution algorithm for 2000 generations with a population size of 256. The resulting policy functions (purple lines) and corresponding ICU occupancy trajectories of the 10 best-performing agents for each parameter set are depicted in Supplementary  Fig. S3 . We found the reward function to be consistently robust to variation in the values of a 2 . That is, the tested range of a 2 values makes the cost of ICU overflow sufficiently prohibitive, leading to high-fitness strategies ensuring ICU maximum capacity is not exceeded (note that the ICU overflow reward is equal to 0 while the ICU occupancy is below the maximum capacity and negative otherwise). Evidently, making a 2 smaller would eventually deprioritize the goal of maintaining the ICU occupancy below the limit. Without loss of generality, we will use a 2 \u00bc 1e9 in the remainder of this paper. In contrast, we found the reward function to be highly sensitive to variation in a 3 . For a 3 > 10 \u00c04 , the relative cost (negative reward) of imposing control becomes prohibitive and leads to one of the extreme intervention strategies: Suppression policy to end the endogenous transmission at the earliest possible time and avoid imposing lengthy control measures; or a no-intervention policy that plainly leads to the minimum relative control cost. In practice, the inclination for a specific intervention strategy depends on the policy maker's priorities. We observed pronounced variation in the optimal policies and resulting ICU occupancy trajectories for smaller values of a 3 (compare the first and third columns, Supplementary Fig. S3 ). In Supplementary Fig. S4 , we demonstrate this variation for each parameter set and across the values of a 3 . As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4A , values of a 3 smaller than 10 \u00c04 result in greater 'Cumulative herd immunity reward'. Thus, when the relative cost of control is modest, the optimal policy function will tend to maximize the reward by increasing the number of individuals removed from the susceptible pool, which in turn leads to greater 'Cumulative control reward' (Supplementary Fig. S4B ) and longer epidemic duration ( Supplementary Fig. S4C) . Therefore, among the tested values, a 3 \u00bc 1e \u00c0 4 represents the middle ground between prolonged intervention and suppression policies, and is the value that we have used in the rest of this paper.",

            "text": "No-intervention policy, uniform intervention policy and optimal policy Figure 3 presents a comparison between the optimal intervention policy identified via our neuroevolution algorithm, a uniform intervention policy and no-intervention policy. The uniform intervention policy is implemented by imposing a constant reduction in transmission throughout the epidemic, c\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc c u . The value of control strength, c u , is estimated such that the peak ICU occupancy tangents the maximum capacity. Figure 3A depicts the ICU occupancy trajectories of these three policies. As expected, the no-intervention policy leads to ICU burdens well beyond the threshold capacity for more than two months (67 days). The other notable observation is the difference between the optimal and uniform policies in managing the ICU burden: the optimal policy maintains the ICU occupancy near the maximum capacity throughout the epidemic, but not beyond it. Figure 3B depicts the implemented control strength in time for optimal and uniform policies. Except for a period of time less than 10 weeks at the onset of the epidemic, the control strength of the optimal policy is below the uniform intervention policy. The difference in the imposed control between two policies is better illustrated by Fig. 3C , where a widening gap between the cumulative imposed control of the two policies emerges after day 200. In Fig. 3D , we present the recovered individuals for each policy. Unlike the optimal policy, the final fraction of recovered individuals in the uniform intervention policy case is well below the theoretical herd immunity threshold. This suggests that any reduction in the control strength could lead to another epidemic wave given the large fraction of susceptible individuals.",

Each scenario corresponds to a particular start date for the roll out of the optimal intervention policy. Figure 4A depicts the scenario in which optimal intervention policy starts on 1 March, which coincides with a surge in cases in the UK. The optimal intervention policy starts with c\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 0:33 (a 33% reduction in transmission rates) and is gradually increased to c\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 0:54 by mid-May. The control strength tapers off to 0 by June 2021. This scenario leads to two peaks in ICU occupancy, in November 2020 and June 2021. Figure 4B -E depict the optimal intervention policy starting at intermediate stages of the epidemic. As mentioned above, we estimated the initial conditions for each scenario by fitting our SIER model to fatality data using particle filtering, a Monte Carlo likelihood estimation algorithm for hidden statespace dynamical systems [39] . Comparing the optimal intervention policy curves in different scenarios depicts how implementing transmission reduction measures at earlier stages of the epidemic will eventually shorten the epidemic: The termination of optimal intervention policy is delayed from June 2021 (in Fig. 4A ) to February 2022 (in Fig. 4D ). The only exception is Fig. 4E , in which the optimal intervention policy terminates slightly sooner than in Fig. 4D . This is most likely due to the emergence of new variants with higher transmissibility [40] , which gave rise to a faster depletion of the susceptible pool than accounted for in our model.",

            "text": "To better illustrate the importance of implementing early control measures, we have demonstrated the 'Total duration of intervention policy implementation' and 'Cumulative imposed control' for different scenarios in Fig. 5 . The 'Total duration of intervention policy implementation' represents the time period between 1 March 2020 and the termination date of intervention policy for each scenario. The 'Cumulative imposed control' is obtained by summing the daily implemented control strength (c(t)), divided by total number of days with c(t) > 0 for each scenario. As shown in Fig. 5A , the 'Total duration of intervention policy implementation' increases from 442 days in the first columns to 700 days in the last one. Figure 5B also confirms the fact that implementing the optimal intervention policy from earlier stages of epidemic would reduce the overall required control measures. Note that depicted 'Cumulative imposed control' values do not include the actual imposed control strength (c(t)) before the start of optimal intervention policy and adding those values would only widen their differences. Also, the 'Cumulative imposed control' is a linear measure of overall imposed control; however, the actual economic cost would not necessarily change linearly with duration and strength of imposed intervention policy. For each scenario, the number of susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered individuals is estimated from a SEIRH model fitted to the UK fatality data and used as initial condition to derive the optimal intervention policy Finding the balance Figure 6 paints an overall picture of how the optimal policy fine tunes the transmission rates to sustain endogenous transmission in the population without overburdening the ICU capacity. Figure 6A demonstrates the variation of effective reproductive ratio (R eff ) throughout the epidemic (black line), the control strength is also shown (blue dashed line). At the onset of the epidemic, R eff is instantly reduced to 1.52 from 2.3 by imposing a 0.33 reduction in contact rates c\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 0:33 and further decreased to R eff % 1 by mid-May (point i) to stall the epidemic growth. From point i to point ii, The R eff is maintained close to 1 to maintain the ICU occupancy close to the maximum capacity. At this point, c(t) is slightly increased that leads to a sharp decrease of R eff to 0.89 in point iii. This is followed by a steep decrease in c(t) to bring the R eff above 1 to sustain the transmission. To summarize, the optimal mitigation policy is achieved by finding the balance between two extreme scenarios: Suppression policy which aims to stall the endogenous transmission in the population, and 'No-intervention' which leads to exponential epidemic growth and the overburdening of healthcare capacity.",

However, such strategies work best when employed early in the epidemic, when number of cases is relatively small. Moreover, in countries where government-imposed restrictions are not well received by the public, implementation of such policies will be challenging. Looking back at the early stages of the epidemic, our work provides a dynamic mitigation strategy that sustains the community transmission without overwhelming the healthcare capacity. March 2020 and termination date of intervention policy for each scenario. The Cumulative imposed control is obtained by adding up the implemented control strength (c(t)) in each day, divided by total number of days with c(t) > 0 for each scenario A number of previous studies on optimal nonpharmaceutical interventions have used quadratic cost expressions for the control term in the cost function [19, 41, 42] . This is mainly because when the cost function is quadratic with respect to the control, the differential equations arising from the necessary conditions for an optimal control have a known solution. Other functional forms frequently provide difficult-to-solve systems of differential equations. To circumvent this, we employed a neuroevolution algorithm which enabled us also to explore non-quadratic functions. The neuroevolution algorithm was used to train a policy function that takes the epidemiological state of population (the numbers of susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered individuals) on each time day and provides the corresponding control strength. We defined a multi-objective reward function to account for three conflicting goals: Sustain the transmission to achieve herd immunity when suppression is not feasible, maintaining the ICU occupancy below the maximum capacity and imposing minimum possible control measures to reduce the contact rates. A relative weighting parameter was assigned to corresponding terms of each of these objectives in the reward function. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the resulting policy function is highly sensitive relative weighting of the control term and found a optimal range of values for it. We chose United Kingdom as our target population and fitted an SEIRH model to fatality data to estimate the initial conditions at different stages of the epidemic.",

The control strength (c(t)) is sharply increased at early stages of epidemic to stall the epidemic growth and keep healthcare capacity from being overwhelmed. The R eff is maintained close to 1 by gradually reducing the c(t) as the size of susceptible pool shrinks.

Interestingly, the forward-backward sweep technique that we used to obtain the optimal solution via PMP closely resembles the backpropagation, the algorithm used to train the gradientbased reinforcement learning methods [43] . Ultimately, we found the neuroevolution algorithm to be computationally advantageous to the PMP method as the former algorithm provides the optimal intervention policy for a broad range of initial values after initial training (as shown in Fig. 4) , while the numerical solution to obtain the optimal control via PMP must be repeated for a new initial condition.",

Besides assuming complete epidemiological information, our approach also assumed that the optimal intervention policy is implemented in deterministically; that is, the output action is perfectly implemented at each time instant and the resulting new state given the corresponding action is always the samesomething that is not practical. An important next step in this area would be to extend our novel framework to identify the optimal intervention strategies with hidden states in a stochastic setting.
