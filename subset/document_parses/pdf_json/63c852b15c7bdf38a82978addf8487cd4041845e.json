Not only is the earth more heavily-populated with human beings settling across many more regions of the planet, but there are also larger concentrations of human inhabitants dependent on other resources for sustenance. Dependency on others for complicated food supply chains, refrigeration, fuel and power sources and public health hygiene (sewage handling), makes human populations more vulnerable than ever before and less self-sufficient. In addition, these large, vulnerable population centers are often concentrated in high-risk locales such as metropolitan cities where very frequent and multiple person-to-person contacts occur. Often they are along disaster prone areas, be they in coastline or sub-sea level reclaimed lands.",

Although the Christmas 2004 tsunami disaster occurred in Southern Asia, it affected many other countries worldwide because those nation's citizens and many international businesses were involved. Mass air travel, economic strategic initiatives and evolving technology have all changed the face of`local' disasters. With the rapid growth of air travel and relatively affluent worldwide economies, travel and sightseeing have morphed from an occasional pastime of the very privileged and the eclectic adventurer into a prevailing norm of worldwide mass tourism. Likewise, industries have also become global, often seeking heavily-populated sites where labor may be more economical and local workforces readily available to work for lower wages. A large number of the victims of the Indian Ocean tsunamis were foreign nationals operating businesses and many, many tourists, including celebrities, were caught up in this Asian calamity as well. Thus, in many ways, disasters throughout the world have now become multinational in nature, having global impact, an impact amplified by mass media coverage and internet streaming of the events.",

Both before, and especially after, the strike of Hurricane Katrina in late August of 2005, many tens of thousands of evacuees had to settle in Dallas and Houston affecting resources in those cities and taxing the local medical system. For example, one Dallas shelter (750 kilometers from New Orleans) treated twice the number of medical problems and emergencies (among the evacuees) than it would on a day-to-day basis in the city's main trauma center. This sudden surge in medical problems required the establishment of a`field' medical facility for more than two weeks after the storm had dissolved. Not only did those patients have their day-to-day medical, dental and psychological needs, but they were now at greater risk in terms of compromised immune systems (nutrition/sleep deprived and psychologically-stressed), but also because of crowded conditions.

Again, with more people on the planet who have the potential to become an infected vector and with more global concentrations of highly-mobile populations moving around in jet aircraft (and thus more opportunities for exposure), the risk for pandemics has clearly become greater than ever before. Although the overt threats of cold war nuclear holocaust have seemingly dissipated, the underlying devices of mass destruction still exist, particularly in a world where terrorists are further spurred on by another form of technology, the mass media and internet.

Secondary and back-up generators should be protected in a similar fashion. All hospitals, particularly those in recognized earthquake zones, should have`earthquake-proof' designs with applicable structural integrity. When a hospital is a potential terrorist target such as any main receiving facility, trauma center, burn center, or children's hospital, security measures will dictate the need for barricades to bombs and specialized ventilation systems that detect and can control the spread of aerosolized poisons or biologicals. These hospitals should have a disproportionate number of negative pressure rooms and well-established decontamination zones around the potential entrance and receiving personnel (e.g., trained triage nurses and security personnel will be staged further out into the periphery and prepared with universal precautions and easy access to decon (decontamination) suits, including high level personal protective equipment (PPE). Within the next ten years, spurred on by additional major terrorist events and further recognition of the vulnerability of the medical safety net, governmental resources will likely begin to make these changes and architects for new facilities will incorporate them into future design.

In this case, to overcome the concepts of lack of familiarity with equipment and resources, credentialing, liability and medical skills utilization, a mitigating solution would be to dedicate a reserve team of medical personnel in the way a government entity deploys a fire service or army as a dedicated standing force. Currently, a hybrid for this type of concept is accomplished through the mobile medical teams and tent hospitals designed by the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), an element of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the United States Department of Homeland Security. Although this does not employ a round-the-clock standing team, it does utilize a`stand-by' team of medical and allied health volunteers who are trained and routinely exercised to operate mobile hospitals. Currently, these teams would likely be inadequate for a mass casualty scenario with tens of thousands of victims, but still they are somewhat helpful in areas where the standing facilities have been destroyed, impaired or are inaccessible.

Such agreements will also include specialized storage facilities for antidotes and antibiotics, perhaps in a separate, undisclosed and protected storage facility, but close enough for easy access. The regional hospitals should band together and purchase these items in bulk to leverage economies of scale (cheaper prices), but they should also coordinate receipt so that expiration dates on the drugs will be staggered and not all expiring at once.

Such coordination of efforts would be a massive under-taking, but well-prepared communities will want to cooperate in such approaches. Also, since many disasters are multinational and often occur in under-resourced countries with relatively poor infrastructures, the creation of dozens of international disaster teams by the United Nations or other organizations worldwide could be considered.

After 2001, the American Medical Association (AMA), working with several major academic centers, began to help development of a family of standardized, interoperable, multi-disciplinary, all-hazards courses to deal with the medical aspects of disaster medicine and counter-terrorism [1\u00b13] . Working in close conjunction with university-based trauma center teams as well as multiple federal and military agencies and, more recently, other professional societies such as the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), the AMA courses are beginning to lay the groundwork for standardized training and improved personnel preparations for disasters [1\u00b13, 11] . During Hurricane Katrina, the Louisiana State Department of Health attributed many of the medical evacuations that were accomplished quite successfully, to the use (and previous training in) ADLS as well the use of a table top disaster scenario called \u00aaHurricane Pam\u00ba. Like Advanced Cardiac Life Support and Advanced Trauma Life Support, the Advanced Disaster Life Support course provides hands-on, multi-disciplinary scenarios in which participants learn to provide antidotes and other resuscitative skills in simulated austere, hazardous conditions requiring the donning and use of high-level PPE in insecure environments [1] . In addition to the Advanced Disaster Life Support course, a prerequisite Basic Disaster Life Support course [2] provides intensive exposure to the didactic elements of disaster preparation, be it chemical, biological, radiological, or traumatic in nature [2, 4] . Within the next ten years, it is predicted that the Basic Disaster Life Support course will be required for every medical student, paramedic student, nursing and other applicable allied health personnel in the USA [2] . The Advanced Disaster Life Support course will also be provided to applicable trainees and nursing staff in critical care areas including advanced life support ambulances, emergency departments, and critical care areas. It is also predicted that specialized in-hospital spin-off courses (e.g., Hospital Disaster Life Support) will address elements of decontamination tactics by custodians, engineers and others. The SCCM has already laid much of the groundwork for such training with some of their course developments [11] .

Prospective rules about who can be denied or provided vaccination or antibiotics and how one receives protection from liability should be addressed ahead of time in the most prepared systems. In addition to healthcare workers, certain societal infrastructure personnel (e.g., elected officials, water, power, communications, media personnel) may be prioritized as well. Also, anticipating a major event, facilities should develop a cadre of antidotes, antivirals and antibiotics for biological threats. More importantly, they will need to ratchet up ICU equipment, ventilators and respiratory care equipment as well as PPE and decontamination equipment. Ambulances and emergency departments and hospitals at large should be fortified by new computerized technology that enhances detection and discrimination of abnormal gases, chemicals, aerosolized biologicals and other threats in ventilation systems and ambient air, just as a carbon monoxide detector or Geiger counter would provide sentinel detection of carbon monoxide or radioactivity in one's home. Medical records will be electronically stored and also duplicated and stored at distant sites in case of medical facility destruction and population displacements. New ventilators will need to be impervious to chemical and biological agents and provide protected ventilation in such environments. In addition, artificial hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers that can be stored in ambulances or in far-forward military conditions should be researched and eventually placed in massive storage places as well and ready to use for mass casualties [12] . Some products now in early test stages can be stored without refrigeration for several years and are likely to be standard equipment in all critical care settings, be it prehospital, emergency center or ICU settings [12] .",

Today, such events will likely be multinational in nature, even when localized to a particular venue and this require international cooperation in terms of prevention, mitigation and relief. The best approach to preparing for disasters is to expand, modify and enhance current local Catastrophic Anachronisms: The Past, Present and Future of Disaster Medicine infrastructures and capabilities for managing the multiple types of disaster scenarios and create a number of inter-facility cooperative agreements in advance. Aside from safer internal locations for ICUs and surgical theaters, certain structural changes will need to be installed such as modified ventilation systems, protected water supplies, decontamination mechanisms and security renovations. A key strategy will be to proliferate interoperable, multi-disciplinary, all-hazards training initiatives such as the AMA National Disaster Life Support courses. Purchases of cadres of antidotes, antibiotics and hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers should be coordinated regionally, stored in secure locations and made readily-available for the applicable disaster scenario.",
