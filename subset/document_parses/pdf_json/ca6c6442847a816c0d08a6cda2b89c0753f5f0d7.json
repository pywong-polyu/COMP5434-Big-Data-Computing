The PHT at 700, 800, and 900\u00b0C was conducted to modify the microstructure and mechanical properties of the composite. The results showed that the as-deposited composite had a weak flexural strength and plasticity due to the brittle nature of the eutectic phase. The eutectic phase consisted of M 7 C 3 , M 2 C, and a small amount of the c phase. However, after PHT at a certain temperature (e.g., 700 or 800\u00b0C), the eutectic phase gradually disappeared, and carbides, such as M 7 C 3 and M 2 C, tended to be distributed uniformly in the c matrix, which improved the flexural strength of the composite. Nevertheless, after the PHT at 900\u00b0C, the flexural strength of the composite displayed a downward trend, which was mainly because of the severe softening of the c phase. In addition, the plasticity of this composite continuously improved as the eutectic phase disappeared and the c phase softened. Based on the above results, we proposed a PHT at 800\u00b0C for 1 h as an optimal process for this WxC + Ni-based composite.",

It is known that the eutectic phase is a common phase in Ni-based alloys. In Inconel 718 superalloys, the eutectic phase is a mixture of the c phase and Laves phase ( Ref 16, 17) . In NiCrBSi alloys, the eutectic phase is a mixture of the c phase, carbides, and borides (Ref [18] [19] [20] [21] . The brittle nature of the Laves phase, carbides, and borides causes the brittle nature of the eutectic phase in Ni-based alloys. These investigations (Ref [22] [23] [24] showed that the eutectic phase is an essential factor for cracking formation.

(Ref 25, 26) observed the phase transformation of the Al 9 (Mn, Ni) 2 eutectic phase in an Al-4Ni-2Mn alloy during heat treatment. The results showed that the Al-Ni-Mn j-phase preferred to nucleate at the interface between the Al matrix and the Al 9 (Mn, Ni) 2 eutectic phase and then grew into the parent phase, which resulted in the breakup of the eutectic fibers at the nucleation sites. Guo et al. (Ref 27) found that the eutectic phase (c-phase + Laves) in an Inconel 718 alloy was eliminated by the holding process after deformation. The fraction of the eutectic phase decreased from 5.35 to 2.53 vol.% after 2 min of holding at 1170\u00b0C. Therefore, a PHT might be an effective way to modify the eutectic phase.",

During the PHT, the samples were placed in a quartz tube filled with Ar gas. After the PHT, the samples were cooled in air. The cross sections of the composites were ground and finally polished using oxide polishing suspensions. Then, the cross sections were etched using aqua regia. The microstructure and fractured surface of the WxC + Ni-based composite were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN MIRA, FEI NovaNano450). The element distribution of the WxC + Ni-based composite was analyzed using EPMA. The composition of the WxC + Ni-based composite was analyzed using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford). The phases of the WxC + Ni-based composite were analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Smartlab 9 kW, copper target, 48 kV/100 mA). Samples with dimensions of 5 mm 9 5 mm 9 1 mm were machined from the composites for XRD analysis. The surface with dimensions of 5 mm 9 5 mm was finally ground using 2000-grit sandpaper. The samples were scanned from 20\u00b0to 80\u00b0. The scanning speed was 2\u00b0/min. The phase transformation diagram was calculated using JMatPro software (Version 6.0). The ''Nickel Based Superalloy'' database was chosen. A temperature range from 600 to 1500\u00b0C was set. The chemical compositions of three regions in the Ni-based matrix in the composite were measured using EPMA. The results are shown in Table 2 . This result indicated that the average composition of C reached the maximum value in the original Ni-based composite alloy. Therefore, considering the error associated with EPMA results, the chemical composition was revised based on the original Nibased alloy powder. The chemical composition for the phase diagram calculation is shown in Table 2 . The three-point bending test was conducted with the help of a fixture, as shown in Fig. 1 (c). The samples were tested with a loading rate of 0.1 mm/min at room temperature and under normal humidity conditions. The flexural strength was calculated according to Eq 1 (Ref 28). The hardness was measured using a microhardness tester (FM-ARS900) with a load of 200 g.",

Therefore, the strengthening effect provided by dislocations was also roughly stable during PHT. During the PHT process, the grains should grow. High temperatures contributed to rapid grain growth.

However, the highest hardness of the as-deposited composite did not contribute the highest flexural strength in this investigation. This was attributed to the continuous eutectic phase. The eutectic phase, which has a high fraction of brittle M 7 C 3 and M 2 C, contributed to crack initiation and propagation during the bending test. After PHT at 700 and 800\u00b0C, the continuous The ultimate displacement depended on the plastic deformation ability of the composite. Regarding the as-deposited composite, the cracking of the eutectic phase limited the plastic deformation. After PHT, the eutectic phase gradually disappeared. The ultimate displacement improved. Moreover, the softening of the c phase also contributed to the plastic deformation ability of the composite after PHT. The gradually enhanced plastic deformation ability of the c phase contributed to the transformation from the formation of tear edges to dimples on the fracture surfaces. liquid at 1395\u00b0C. The primary c phase started precipitating at 1269\u00b0C. When the temperature declined to 1246\u00b0C, the primary c phase completely precipitated from the liquid with a volume fraction of 41%. The residual liquid rapidly transformed into the eutectic phase. The primary M 2 C in the eutectic phase was retained at room temperature at a high cooling speed. 2. After the PHT process, the eutectic phase gradually disappeared. M 7 C 3 and M 2 C were gradually uniformly distributed in the Ni-based matrix. After PHT at 900\u00b0C, a small amount of MC was generated. The reduction in the number of solid solution atoms in the c phase was increased progressively as the PHT temperature increased. 3. The hardness of the Ni-based matrix gradually declined as the PHT temperature increased. This trend was due to coarsening of the grains and a reduction in the number of solid solution atoms in the c phase. 4. The flexural strength of the samples heat-treated at 700 and 800\u00b0C continuously increased as the eutectic phase disappeared. The decline in the flexural strength of the sample that underwent PHT at 900\u00b0C was attributed to the substantial softening of the Ni-based matrix. 5. The bending displacement of the samples continuously increased as the PHT temperature increased. The disappearance of the eutectic phase and softening of the c phase contributed to the improvement in the plastic deformation ability of the Ni-based matrix together.",
