Mechanical Turk participants (N = 1050) completed measures on reported face mask wearing behavior, general beliefs in science, belief in face mask effectiveness in reducing transmission of COVID-19, and sociodemographic information. We found evidence that greater belief in science predicted greater belief in the effectiveness of face masks reducing the transmission of COVID-19, which in turn predicted more reported face mask wearing behavior in public, controlling for sociodemographic factors. We urge researchers to engage in more open science practices and science education to increase the public's belief in science and the effectiveness of masks in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 in order to increase the frequency of face mask wearing in public.",

Scientists and public health experts have established that masks are effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19 (Chughtai et al., 2020; Lyu & Wehby, 2020) , and several state governments have enacted mandates requiring individuals to wear masks in public (Markowitz, 2021) . Still, the physical discomfort, inconvenience, and potential of masks to negatively impact face-to-face interactions have deterred countless US residents from wearing them in public. For people to engage in a preventive behavior like mask wearing despite the potential adverse experience of it, we propose that (1) people must trust and believe in science broadly; which would lead them to (2) more readily acquire knowledge about the importance of changing their behavior and risks if they do not; which would ultimately, (3) lead them to partake in more preventive behaviors.",

In this way, BIS appears to be an important individual difference that predicts preventive behavior engagement during COVID-19; however, research has not yet applied the validated BISS to face mask wearing behavior.

Our data met all the necessary assumptions for this analysis. An ordinal logistic regression provided support for H1; individuals who reported greater BIS were more likely to report more frequent mask wearing in public. The odds of mask wearing increased by an average of 25% for each unit increase in BIS such that individuals who scored a 6 on the BIS scale were 125% more likely to report more mask wearing than were individuals who scored a 1 [OR: 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.39; Wald (1) = 17.58, p < .001]. H2, examining whether greater beliefs in science predicted greater beliefs in face mask effectiveness, was tested with a general linear regression. BIS was a significant positive predictor of the belief in face mask effectiveness such that for every one unit increase in BIS, belief in face mask effectiveness increased by 0.24 [b = 0.24, t(1029) = 5.97, p < .001]. Finally, we performed an ordinal logistic regression to test H3, that the relationship between BIS and mask wearing behavior would be explained by belief in masks as effective in preventing the transmission of COVID-19. Our mediating variable of belief in face mask effectiveness was associated with an increased odds of reporting greater face mask wearing behavior such that each unit increase in the belief that face masks are effective was associated with an 82% increase in the reported frequency of face mask wearing in public on average [OR: 1.82; 95% CI, 1.68 to 2.00; Wald (1) = 179.09, p < .001]. Additionally, the effect of BIS on mask wearing behavior decreased when controlling for belief in face mask effectiveness, such that the odds of mask wearing only increased by an average of 13% for each unit increase in BIS (OR: 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.26; Wald (1) = 4.54, p = .033). This decrease in odds was quantified by an indirect effect of BIS on reported face mask wearing behavior through belief in face mask effectiveness, b = 0.09 (95% CI, 0.06 to 0.12). Therefore, we find evidence that belief in face mask effectiveness is one process through which belief in science influences face mask wearing behavior (Fig. 1 ).",

Our findings suggest that beyond increasing the public's awareness of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing the transmission of COVID-19, we need to increase the public's belief in science in order to make information about wearing masks more effective. Without increasing the public's belief in science, public health messaging about masks may not be effective in changing behavior. These results highlight the importance of science education in shaping compliance to preventive behaviors and ultimately resilience (e. g., economically, socially, and health-wise) during health pandemics. To increase the public's belief in science, researchers should participate in open science which allows for a more transparent process and greater accessibility to research findings, report quality data only or discuss the quality of the data including limitations and generalizability, and not overstate findings. Researchers also need to build and sustain infrastructure for rapid response to public health crises and educate the public on the process and interpretation of findings including establishing ways citizen scientists can become involved (Boele-Woelki et al., 2018). Beyond the scientific community, political figures, business leaders, and celebrities significantly influence individual's belief and trust in science, and should be encouraged to speak more openly and honestly about the importance and impact of scientific findings. By taking steps to achieve these higher societal standards, we will be more able to combat infectious diseases like COVID-19 and become better equipped to collectively fight future health crises.
