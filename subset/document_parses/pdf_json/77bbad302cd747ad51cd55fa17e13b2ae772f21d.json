Computed tomography (CT) is the prime imaging modality for diagnosis of lung infections in COVID-19 patients. Data-driven and Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions for automatic processing of CT images predominantly rely on large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. Owing to privacy and data availability issues, open-access and publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets are difficult to obtain, thus limiting the development of AI-enabled automatic diagnostic solutions. To tackle this problem, large CT image datasets encompassing diverse patterns of lung infections are in high demand.",

All scans were performed with the patient in the supine position during end-inspiration. The scanning range was from the apex to lung base. CT exams were performed with a NeuViz 16-slices CT scanner machine (Neusoft medical systems) without intravenous contrast under \"Helical\" mode. All images are in DICOM format and consist of 16-bit grayscale images composed of 512 \u00d7 512 pixels. Slice thickness values were determined by the operator in accordance with clinical examination requirements: 1.5 or 3 mm.
