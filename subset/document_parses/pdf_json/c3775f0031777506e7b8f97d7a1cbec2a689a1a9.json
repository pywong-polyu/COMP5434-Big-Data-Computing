Notwithstanding its distinctive role, through the years this area has witnessed a high increase of unnecessary visits that should instead be dealt with by other appropriate primary care services, ideally available and easily reachable in our communities. This unsteady balance between unnecessary primary care consultations wrongly addressed in the ED and available resources reveals an overcrowding condition into emergency rooms, which negatively affects both the patients (through a collateral increase in waiting time, lack of confidentiality, and efficiency) and hospital staff (the higher risk of burnout, lower motivation, and professional satisfaction, increase in violence episodes toward health care professionals for long waits) (1, 2) . This condition is widespread in several countries around the world and it affects both the pediatric and general ED. International studies have been conducted to analyze the inappropriate use of the ED (3, 4) . In December 2003, Italian central and regional governments agreed on \"Mattoni SSN\" project with the aim of evaluating the appropriateness of every emergency room visit by its triage code assigned, the diagnostic resources adopted, and consultation outcomes (5) .",

Disease severity was considered by the initial triage code assigned according to the Emergency Severity Index version 4 (ESI v.4) (6). Appropriateness was rated according to the Mattoni method, a nationwide system of classification for appropriate encounters to ED expressed as a ratio of non-urgent patients discharged from the ED for whom no diagnostic test was required over the total of ED consultations (5) . All data were extracted with our ED software. Coupled with this, a prospective and dedicated survey was carried out on a sample of parents during the first 10 days of January 2020. This period was fully homogeneous with the previous winter month and previous winter seasons with respect to the number and severity of encounters for children. This specific survey was conducted by means of a structured questionnaire proposed to parents in the waiting room. This survey was approved by the Medical Administration as part of an internal audit, alongside the retrospective branch of our study. The proposed questionnaire (Supplementary Material 1) involved several sections such as (1) the anonymized demographics of child and parents, (2) data on children's primary care pediatricians/general practitioners, (3) the reasons for going to the ED, (4) waiting times and parental satisfaction, and (5) an assessment of appropriateness by the pediatrician who performed the visit.

            "text": "Our retrospective study refers to a pre-Covid 2019 timeframe, but inappropriate and low-resource-intensity pediatric visits to ED have also been registered during this latter pandemic albeit with lower numbers (15, 16) . In the light of our demographics, younger age (below 5 years) represented a constant feature of the majority of consultations, with neonates and toddlers below 12 months accounting for 20% overall, likely due to the feeling of frailty associated with this age group. Analysis of the time frame for ED pediatric encounters showed a higher number of cases during evenings and nights, but also in the days prior to bank holidays and during bank holidays; in our setting, this is most likely attributable to the lack of availability of primarycare pediatricians who are not on call on these days. It is worth noting that the pediatric health care system in Italy is part of the National Health System and comprises three main levels of intervention: first access/primary care, secondary care/hospital care, and tertiary care based on specialty hospital care (17) . So far, in Italy every child aged 0-6 must be registered with a primary care pediatrician from the national health system, while for those aged 6-14, parents are allowed to choose between registration with a primary care pediatrician or with a general practitioner. Roughly 8,000 primary care pediatricians currently work nationwide, with each of them representing the primary health care provider for up to 1,000 children. Every primary care pediatrician is available at his/her office either in the morning or the afternoon for at least 3 hours per day and is reachable over the phone for at least 2 extra hours per day; primary care pediatricians are also on call on Saturday morning from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. However, until the medical houses begin operating, pediatric primary care during night hours and weekends is not available, thus forcing families with children to seek help from the adult primary care continuity service (which usually sends them to ED) or directly from the ED. Our study endorses the need for a reorganization of the current system and also highlights the necessity of improving the parents' lack of education of children's health. In fact, albeit limited to a small group of parents, our prospective survey results also allowed us to briefly glimpse into parental motivations and decision-making for taking their children to the ED.",

            "text": "Our study highlighted that in our province a non-negligible percentage of parents coming to our ED had not achieved a high school degree and some even had attended primary school only. In order to reduce unnecessary visits to the pediatric emergency room, a look at parental motivations might be useful. As seen also in our series, the perception of the need for immediate care can possibly be attributed to a higher degree of anxiety and a distorted idea of emergency, as well as social factors or distrust of previous medical advice (12, (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . Other topics pertaining to the predilection for ED include the belief or hope of receiving the best quality of care because of the professionals and the diagnostic equipment at hospitals; the effortlessness of the consultation; the continuity; the rapidity in getting a diagnosis without the need of an appointment; and lack of fees (8, 12, 20, 22, 26) . This preference for ED encounters by families is also sustained by the pitfalls of primary care services, such as the above-mentioned limited opening hours of general pediatricians and unavailability to carry out diagnostic tests (8, 12, 13, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27) . According to our work, the reasons mentioned above are largely confirmed. In addition, despite the fact that some parents are aware of the non-urgency or minor urgency of their children's visit to the ED, the discrepancy in perceived urgency between parents and the doctor on call has still been notable. A suitable solution to contrast this phenomenon could be campaigns to improve parents' literacy regarding when it is wise and necessary to go promptly to the ED (24) (25) (26) (28) (29) (30) .",

However, only 17% of them felt they wanted more information about this issue, while the majority (50%) simply proposed increasing the number of staff in the ED since \"it is the best place to treat their child and get a prompt/effective diagnosis and therapy.\" This preference for the ED has also been attested to by a very recent report from Turkey that attributed this aspect to both the lack of cost and the trust in the ED staff, especially among younger and less educated parents (31) . Otherwise, the second most suggested solution has been \"to increase the availability of our family pediatricians and to improve availability of primary care.\" In this regard, a UK study has demonstrated that increasing primary care accessibility might lessen the burden of ED visits from children (32); a similar effect can also be obtained by relocating unwarranted consultations to dedicated outpatient settings, thus relieving the overload of ED, as witnessed in a study from France (33) .",

First, we are aware that our database does not include final diagnoses for several clinical issues that have been first evaluated in the ED and further addressed for inpatients after admission or by other specialty outpatient clinics. Moreover, we could not report the use of point-of-care testing in our retrospective cohort due to the impossibility of data extrapolation. A prospective research design would have eventually allowed us to fill these information gaps. Secondly, by a prospective questionnaire we attempted to portray the motivations that pushed some parents to take their children to the ED, although this group might not have been fully representative of the target population due to minor temporal lag, and this mixed method approach certainly restricts the generalizability of our findings. In addition, such a single center study design may suggest that our study cohort lacks generalizability on a national level; although this is methodologically plausible, to the best of our knowledge the Italian scenario for primary and hospital care for children is somewhat homogeneous.",
