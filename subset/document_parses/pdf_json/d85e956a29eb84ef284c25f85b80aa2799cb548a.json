The postpartum period can be a time of significant transition, both positive and negative, for parents as they navigate new relationships with their babies and shifts in family dynamics. Physical distancing requirements mandated by public health orders during the COVID-19 pandemic had the potential to create even more stress for parents with a newborn. Examining personal experiences would provide health care professionals with information to help guide support during significant isolation. Feminist poststructuralism guided the qualitative research process. Sixty-eight new mothers completed an open-ended on-line survey. Responses were analyzed using discourse analysis to examine the beliefs, values, and practices of the participants relating to their family experiences during the pandemic period. It was found that pandemic isolation was a time of complexity with both 'blessings and curses'. Participants reported that it was a time for family bonding and enjoyment of being a new parent without the usual expectations. It was also a time of missed opportunities as they were not able to share milestones and memories with extended family. Caring for a newborn during the COVID-19 pandemic where complex contradictions were constructed by competing social discourses created difficult dichotomies for families. In acknowledging the complex experiences of mothers during COVID-19 isolation, nurses and midwives can come to understand and help new parents to focus on the blessings of this time while acknowledging the curses.",

Postpartum is well acknowledged as an opportunity for family-forming [1] . Social, health, and nursing discourses of mother-child bonding are dominant during this period and positions such bonding as critical for the development of healthy relationships, positive mental health and confident parents [2, 3] .",

The concept of agency guided our analysis to consider how all individuals have power and therefore the potential to control their lives and make change [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Feminist poststructuralist methodology is based on the belief that participants are the primary experts of their experiences, and therefore are credible sources of data who are self-reflexive, conscious of their own locations (social, historical, gendered, cultural, racial, sexual), able to question, challenge, and possibly change their own circumstances.

Data was collected from May to June 2020, which represented the emergence of the recovery period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nova Scotia, Canada. The peak COVID-19 or first wave of the COV-19 pandemic period was March and April 2020. During this time, the provincial public health measures were implemented within the province. The public health order was for households to stay physically distanced from one another. This requirement was from March to May, at which point the bubble family was introduced (early May), followed by small groups of less than 10 outdoors. Self-isolation (or isolation/quarantine) was much more restrictive and for certain persons/families, such as those that travelled outside the province. Following the public health orders, travel was restricted, and many workplaces were either closed or employees were instructed to work from home, if possible. Many retail stores and resources for new mothers, such as daycares, family resource centres, and public libraries, were also closed, although grocery stores remained open. Hospital services were restricted, and many consultations were done virtually (via phone or through the use of other technologies) rather than in person [34] . All of these factors led to periods of isolation experienced by the parents/families in this study and the inability to access their usual support networks.",

For this process, we paid close attention to language, meaning and relationships between participants, others and the health care system. All researchers independently reviewed the participants' responses and noted the beliefs, values, and practices of the participants relating to their family experiences during the pandemic period, the language of the participants, as well as any tensions expressed.

Previous research has shown that pressures to do the right things, and to be a \"super mommy\" can add a lot of pressure and stress to the experiences of new motherhood [8, 9] . Many of the participants in our study expressed similar experiences of feeling less pressure to have to do it all.

It was a time to let go of the many worries of being a new mother that stem from social and cultural discourses of new motherhood, such as breastfeeding discourses. Social breastfeeding discourse often positions public displays of breastfeeding to be inappropriate and can create feelings of discomfort for the general public as well as mothers who are breastfeeding [37] .

Being out in public can interfere with the way parents interact with their newborn. Often within public spaces, certain types of bonding and touching are positioned as too intimate and inappropriate for others. This can create experiences of tension for some mothers as they try to bond with their babies in publicly appropriate ways [39] . For example, as previously described, it has been noted that some mothers experience feelings of embarrassment while breastfeeding in public places [37] . Parents continue to struggle with these competing discourses when making decisions about how to interact and bond with their babies and figure out what is right for themselves and their babies. Participants, however, found that during COVID-19 they were able to better navigate these competing discourses to experience intimate bonding with their babies. As highlighted, in the previous quote, the mother's focus on the joy of snuggling is not just a simple act; her emotional connection and her desire to bond in the best way for her baby was evident in her experience. This demonstrated the participant's value of shared, dedicated, and intimate time with her baby, physical connection and bonding, and respect for the sacred space that is shared between parent and baby. In their bonding, participants challenged public norms of distancing, as well as mainstream judgements and 'distractions'. Such participants enacted their own agency and chose to enjoy their family space during COVID-19 for important snuggling.",

Did she believe that she should be the main caretaker of her baby with the co-parent/father not so close? This can be viewed as a socially constructed discourse informed by heteronormative stereotypes of the roles of mothers and fathers [40] . Such discourse, also rooted in hegemonic gender binaries, often position women in the primary role of nurturer and the parent to bond with newborns. However, it is also possible that this mother valued time alone because it allowed her to more fully, holistically connect with her baby in a way that was unique to her and honoured her identity as a new mother. Following public health orders of staying at home brought out unique feelings about bonding and spending special time with one's baby. In contrast, other mothers spoke about the importance of their partners being able to spend time with their babies. Time that otherwise may not have happened without the isolation measures put in place as a result of the pandemic.",

While I continue to be on my maternity leave, balancing his work at home has been a little bit of an adjustment\". Experiences with partners were often viewed by many participants as both blessings and curses. This was reflected in the words of one participant, \"my husband is home constantly which is positive and negative\". The blessing of partners included more support and help with the daily activities of their homes, including cooking and cleaning, as well as baby duties, such as changing diapers and holding. As another participant clarified this sentiment, saying, \"he is available to help with diaper changes and to hold the baby when I need a quick break, but it isn't what I pictured for my maternity leave\". The curse side of having partners home often took the form of more chores and mess relating to them being constantly at home. As another participant discussed, \"my husband has been more supportive as he's home more but there is also more to do since there are more meals to cook and more messes to clean and more activities to plan\". More chores, more messes, and more planning of activities were created for many participants as a result of their partners always being home during the pandemic. It was noted by several participants that the constant nearness of partners sometimes created certain tensions in their relationship. For example, one participant noted that \"although having my husband home allowed him to spend more time with the kids, it increased stress between us we argued more\". This quote emphasized the experiences of participants who believed that the pandemic heightened stress and created strains within their personal relationships. Social and medical discourses often position family togetherness as critical during this time [6] .",

            "text": "According to Foucault [41] , language, discourse, and knowledge are concepts that are interconnected to (re)produce social meanings and practices. Feminist poststructuralism positions language as structuring the way things are thought, and the way people act on the basis of those thoughts. Language is, however, set within historical contexts and as a result, is not stable nor does language represent a truth or one meaning. Language has multiple meanings that change depending on the social and political circumstances in which people live [32, 41, 42] . Discourse, however, moves beyond language to represent the interrelated systems of social meanings and practices \"that systematically form the objects of which they speak\" ( [41] , p. 49). Discourses are constantly being re-created as people collectively think and talk in different ways about the world. Language and discourses, therefore, (re)create knowledge and knowledge (re)creates the way people speak, come to know themselves, and shapes their values, beliefs, and practices. In other words, the subject. We can never fully understand all the influences that affect our subjectivity [42] . The subject is \"written and overwritten through multiple and contradictory discourses\" ( [43] , p. 275). The subject can be thought of as a palimpsest, a manuscript on which the writing has been partially erased to make room for other writings but with traces of the original remaining [43] . This metaphor illustrates how a subject is constantly in process and being shaped; written through multiple discourses layered upon and affecting each other. The subject is not ever blank. There is no pre-discursive self as one is never outside the influence of discourses [43] .",

Discourses of productivity for new mothers, discourses of bonding and connections during the postpartum period, discourse of touching, snuggling, and breastfeeding, discourses of normalcy, as well as heteronormative discourses of gender were all revealed through the analysis of participants' responses. These discourses (re)shaped the experiences of the mothers reported in this study. The mothers' experiences were seen as either positive blessings, negative curses, or, more often, seen as a complex interplay of blessings and curses, as highlighted in the results. Discourses of productivity, for example, created experiences for some mothers of freedom from the pressures associated with being a productive new mom, or as some participants said a supermom. This allowed them time to get to know their baby and time to enjoy living in the moment with them, a blessing of freedom. Discourses also created experiences that were negative or curses. For example, discourses of normalcy allow mothers to know and understand what is \"normal\" for their babies. Since the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in isolation many mothers felt that they were not able to connect with others to understand what is normal for babies. Participants also described the importance of special moments with babies, partners, and extended family. It is known that sharing and celebrating joys, moments, and successes together is vital not only to the health and wellbeing of families, but to the formation of collective and individual identities within the family [44] .",

In another study, it was found that mothers often expressed differences between their expectations of postpartum experiences, such as bonding, and their actual experiences [46] . It has also been previously reported parents often feel they need more support during postpartum under normal circumstances [45] . This research creates knowledge about the experiences of a group of new mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We can see that isolation created by public health mandates affected all participants in the study. While there were many similarities, there were also differences in how the limits and constraints of isolation affected each participant. This alerts us to the need to listen carefully to the unique relational experiences of mothers and families. Although the participants of this study were similar in many ways, consisting of birth mothers who were predominantly heterosexual, partnered white women within Nova Scotia, Canada, the findings can move beyond the local context and inform nursing practice holistically. Future studies could further explore the impact of COVID-19 isolation on the health of mothers and other family members through focus groups or observations. The postpartum time is a time of redefining family relationships, bonding, and changes in mood or mental health under the best circumstances, but our study suggests that these are heightened by mandatory public health measures of self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, and informed by discursive considerations of postpartum.",

By exploring both the positive and negative experiences, the blessings and the curses, of the participants, we can create an understanding that can inform nursing practice.
