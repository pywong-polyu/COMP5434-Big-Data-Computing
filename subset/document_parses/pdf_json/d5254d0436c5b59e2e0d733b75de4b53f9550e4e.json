We calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) via the next-generation matrix method, and we estimate the per day infection, death and recovery rates. We calibrate the parameters of the SEIARD model to the reported data by minimizing the sum of squared errors and attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak until June 2020. Our results estimate that the peak of the epidemic in Mexico will be around May 2, 2020. Our model incorporates the importance of considering the aysmptomatic infected individuals, because they represent the majority of the infected population (with symptoms or not) and they could play a huge role in spreading the virus without any knowledge.",

The behavior of the asymptomatic population is important because they have the capacity to spread the virus without developing any symptoms, and public health interventions should focus on these individuals. By this date, Mexico is located in phase 2 (community transmission) and has declared a national emergency and asked the citizenship to stay in their houses. By declaring self-quarantine to all individuals, we could separate the healthy population from the asymptomatic population and prevent the spread of the virus more rapidly. This action will only gain time in the number of infections and help avoiding the saturation of hospitals. If we control the population of infected individuals, we will prevent the death of many individuals, and the hospitals will have sufficient supplies to mitigate the severity of symptoms in patients with any type of chronic degenerative disease. It is of great importance to explain some of the parameters estimated in the optimization section. \u03c4 \u03b2 = 27.86 represents the number of contacts per person per time. Even though at this time this value is high, by declaring social distancing measures the Mexican government intends to decrease the value of this parameter. We will view this decrease once we reach the peak of infection. \u03c4 \u03b3 gives us information of the average recovery rate between the first day of the appearance of symptoms and death, which is \u03c4 \u03b3 = 11.28. This means that some infected individuals can develop more complicated symptoms, eventually they will take much more time to recover than others. As well, it represents the average time of supplies a patient will cost if they develop chronic symptoms like pneumonia or other pulmonary complications.",
