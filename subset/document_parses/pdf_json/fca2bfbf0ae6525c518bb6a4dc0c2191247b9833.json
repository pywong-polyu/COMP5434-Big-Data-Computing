The number of emergency surgical procedures was also strongly affected by COVID-19 and decreased from 90.14 to 67.86 per week. Our data strongly support the conclusion that COVID-19 significantly influenced people's surgical care-seeking behavior. These facts were also corroborated by studies performed in other countries [3, 5] . Although this was not analyzed further, there are three likely possible reasons. First, the decreased number of surgeries might be attributed to the strict measures conducted by China. The strict measures include staying home and avoiding unnecessary outdoor activity and only traveling for work and to secure necessary health care. Reduced outdoor activity and travel may contribute to the decrease in the incidence of surgical emergencies. Second, children's parents were apprehensive about viral transmission and chose to postpone seeking surgery. Third, during this period, we canceled such Fig. 1 Children who underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the corresponding period 1 year earlier. The number of operations performed by the emergency surgery, outpatient surgery, oncology surgery, plastic surgery, orthopedics department, hepatobiliary surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, urology department, neurosurgery department, cardio-thoracic department, otorhinolaryngology, ophthalmology department, and department of stomatology was significantly smaller during the pandemic period than during the corresponding period 1 year earlier. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 elective surgeries as cleft lip, pectus excavatum, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism during the pandemic to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission in our hospital.",
