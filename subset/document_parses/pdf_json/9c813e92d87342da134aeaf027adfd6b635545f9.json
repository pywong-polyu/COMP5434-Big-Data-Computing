Design: A descriptive cohort study was performed. Methods: Retrospective data were collected for 63 patients aged >18 years with COVID-19-or non-COVID19-related debility between January 2015 and September 2020. Results: Patients admitted with COVID-19-related debility had a mean length of stay of 20.35 days. 15.4% were transferred back to acute service, 92.3% required respiratory interventions, and 88.5% were discharged to the same residence. Patients with COVID-19-related debility were significantly older, required more respiratory interventions, and had a longer length of stay than the non-COVID-19 group. No significant differences were found in functional outcomes. Conclusions: Functional outcomes improved, allowing most patients to return to their same residence.",

Shortly after on January 5, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the first disease outbreak news to the scientific community, health community, and media, which included a risk assessment and public health advice regarding the outbreak. By January 30, an emergency committee convened by the Director General of the WHO determined that the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern. At that time, cases of the coronavirus were being reported worldwide, with most being in China and 98 cases reported in 18 countries outside China. Four countries including the United States reported human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus. On February 11, the coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). By March 11, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic based on the alarming spread and severity of the disease (WHO, 2021) .",

COVID-19 can affect the respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and neurological system and has been found to increase the risk of coagulation and the development of venous thromboembolic complications (Perico et al., 2021) . In the acute phase of the illness, persons hospitalized in the intensive care unit may require mechanical ventilation and an extended length of stay for recovery. Critical illness and associated immobility can contribute to weakness (Zorowitz, 2016) , deconditioning, muscle shortening, contractures, and postural instability (Simpson & Robinson, 2020) . In addition to the physical effects after critical illness, many patients experience cognitive impairment and psychiatric illnesses, now referred to as postintensive care syndrome (Rawal et al., 2017) .",

Changes in the structure of programs include whether IRFs can accommodate patients post-COVID-19 infection, use of different units to separate patients with and without COVID-19 infection, or limiting the unit census to provide adequate staffing of units (Camica et al., 2021) . Other changes include use of personal protective equipment to reduce the likelihood of spreading the virus, treating patients in spaces separate from non-COVID-19-positive patients, and implementing strategies to manage fatigue and decreased endurance for patients to tolerate therapy. Although not all persons with post-COVID-19-related illness require inpatient rehabilitation services, those who have experienced a loss in function, decreased endurance, deconditioning, or debility can benefit from inpatient rehabilitation (Hatch, 2021) . In addition, many patients present to IRFs with comorbidities (Sheehy, 2020) making the course of recovery more complex.",

There were no exclusion criteria. During this time frame, the data collection instrument to measure outcomes was changed by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).
