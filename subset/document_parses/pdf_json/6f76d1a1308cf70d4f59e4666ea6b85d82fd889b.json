Importantly, AH(56-71) mediated inward budding of GUVs without cholesterol 241 could be rescued by inclusion of another conical lipid, DOPE (20 mol%) (Figure S3D). 242This finding indicates that IFITM3-induced negative membrane curvature is facilitated 243 by cone shaped lipids. 244We next tested the effect of a conical lipid, LPC, on GUV budding mediated by IFITM3. 245 LPC was first titrated by adding to preformed GUVs containing POPC and cholesterol.246 As expected based upon positive curvature induced by this lipid (Fuller & Rand, 2001), 247 we observed outward budding of the GUV membrane in an LPC dose-dependent 248 manner (Figure S3E). A moderate concentration of LPC (10 \uf06dM) was then added 249 together with the AH(56-71) peptide to preformed GUVs containing POPC and 250 cholesterol.

We used glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as a model to study the effect 352 of IFITM3 on SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion (Figure 6A). INS-1E cells secrete 353 insulin upon stimulation with high glucose (Merglen et al., 2004). To increase the 354 sensitivity of detection of secreted insulin, INS-1E cells were transduced with a vector 355 expressing a proinsulin-luciferase fusion protein (Burns et al., 2015), which can be 356 detected by luciferase activity following exposure to a high glucose solution (Figure 357",

            "text": "6B). When cells were pretreated with AH(59-68), which effectively bound to the 358 plasma membrane (Figure S5A), high glucose stimulation resulted in significantly 359 reduced insulin secretion. In contrast, the AH(59-68) F63Q peptide had no effect on 360 insulin secretion, even when added in a higher concentration than the wild-type peptide 361 (Figure 6B,Figure S5B). To test whether inhibition of secretion was related to the 362 IFITM3 AH-mediated negative membrane curvature, we pretreated cells with LPC, 363 which induces positive curvature. LPC promoted insulin secretion, in agreement with 364 the previous study (Amatore et al., 2006) (Figure 6C). Importantly, LPC added with 365 IFITM3 AH counteracted the suppression of insulin secretion by this peptide. Taken 366 together, these results imply that IFITM3 AH is sufficient to inhibit membrane fusion 367 and that this inhibition is dependent on its ability to induce negative membrane 368 curvature.369 370 To further investigate the link between membrane curvature and antiviral activity of 371 IFITM3, we asked whether the IFITM3 AH can be replaced with unrelated amphipathic 372 helixes of other proteins, such as M2 of IAV (M2 AH). The M2 AH has been reported 373 to induce negative curvature and increase lipid order during IAV budding from the 374 plasma membrane (Martyna et al., 2017; Rossman, Jing, Leser, & Lamb, 2010). We 375 thus replaced the IFITM3 AH with M2 AH in the context of an mTFP1 tagged protein 376 overexpressed in HEK 293/17 cells, wild-type IFITM3 significantly inhibited the 379 infection of the mCherry-expressing IAV (Figure 7B, C). As expected, the scrambled 380 IFITM3 AH mutant exhibited a markedly attenuated antiviral activity against IAV. 381 Importantly, IFITM3 chimera with the M2 AH showed strong antiviral activity, without 382 significantly affecting cell viability (Figure S5C). The demonstration that IFITM3 AH 383 can be replaced by other negative curvature-inducing and lipid-ordering AHs further 384 confirms that IFITM3 inhibits viral fusion by modulating the proprieties of endosomal 385 membrane through its amphipathic helix. 386 387 Discussion 388 A remarkably broad-spectrum of enveloped viruses that are restricted by IFITM 389 proteins suggests a universal mechanism for their antiviral activity. This mechanism 390 may involve modifying the properties of the host cell membranes to disfavor fusion 391 pore formation and thus trap viral fusion at a \"dead-end\" hemifusion stage (Desai et al., 392 2014; Suddala et al., 2019). Here, we provided direct evidence for this mechanism by 393 showing that lipid bilayer-reconstituted recombinant IFITM3 induces unfavorable 394 negative curvature and increases the lipid order and membrane stiffness. Importantly, 395 we found that these effects on lipid bilayers in vitro are linked to the IFITM3's ability 396 to inhibit membrane fusion in cells. Specifically, we showed that the incorporation of 397 IFITM3 AH into the external leaflet of the plasma membrane inhibits exocytosis 398 (Figure 6B). Although exocytic fusion is the topological opposite of viral fusion, it 399 provides a convenient model system for assessing the effects of exogenously added 400 amphipathic peptides and lipids (Amatore et al., 2006; Burns et al., 2015). 401 According to the stalk-pore hypothesis (Chernomordik, Melikyan, & Chizmadzhev, 402 1987; Kozlov, Leikin, Chernomordik, Markin, & Chizmadzhev, 1989), membrane 403 fusion proceeds through a series of highly curved intermediates -stalk, hemifusion and 404 fusion pore -that are characterized by different net curvatures and thus respond 405 differently to changes in lipid shape/composition. The formation of a lipid stalk 406 negative curvature structure, whereas the fusion pore possesses a net positive curvature 409 (Figure 7D) (Chernomordik & Kozlov, 2003). Thus, the presence of lipids that induce 410 positive curvature, such as LPC, in the contacting leaflets blocks the stalk formation, 411 whereas their incorporation into the distal leaflet of a target membrane, promotes 412 rupture of the hemifusion diaphragm and fusion pore formation (Amatore et al., 2006; 413 Chernomordik, Frolov, Leikina, Bronk, & Zimmerberg, 1998; Chernomordik et al., 414 1987; Stiasny & Heinz, 2004). In contrast, fusion pore formation is impaired by lipids 415 inducing negative curvature, such as oleic acid (OA) (Chernomordik, Leikina, Frolov, 416 Bronk, & Zimmerberg, 1997). Thus, spontaneous curvature of lipids is an essential 417 determinant of membrane hemifusion and fusion mediated by cellular and viral proteins 418 (Chernomordik & Kozlov, 2003). 419 Our experiments demonstrate that, similar to OA, IFITM3 AH induces negative 420 curvature of GUVs manifested in inward budding and ILV formation. Thus, in the 421 context of IFITM3 expressed in cells, AH inserted into the cytoplasmic leaflet of an 422 endosomal membrane is expected to stabilize the hemifusion diaphragm formed by 423 incoming viruses and thus prevent the fusion pore formation (Figure 7D). In addition, 424 the increased membrane order and stiffness induced by IFITM3 are expected to further 425 disfavor membrane fusion (Chesarino et al., 2017; John et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Lin 426 et al., 2013). 427 Our finding that IFITM3 induces negative curvature and inward budding in GUVs is 428 consistent with the observation that its overexpression in cells robustly induced the 429 formation of large multivesicular bodies that are full of IFITM3-containing 430 intralumenal vesicles (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013). These results also support the 431 \"fusion decoy\" model, according to which excess of intralumenal vesicles in IFITM3-432 expressing cells favors non-productive viral fusion with intralumenal vesicles, instead 433 of fusion with the limiting membrane of endosomes (Desai et al., 2014). The above 434 considerations suggest that a potent inhibition of diverse enveloped viruses by IFITM3 435 may involve a combination of modulation of membrane properties and generation of 436 an excess of decoy vesicles in endosomes. 437In addition, the rigid nature of lipid raft domains is expected to disfavor membrane 442 fusion. Interestingly, it has been reported that the boundaries between ordered and 443 disordered lipid domains, which are characterized by high line tension (energy per unit 444 length), are the predominant sites of HIV-1 fusion(Yang et al., 2017). However, such 445 apparent preference for domain boundaries is not universal, since IAV lipid mixing 446 occurs efficiently with Ld-phased GUVs lacking lipid rafts or phase boundaries (Figure 447",

It is 454 therefore very likely that the AH region is key to the antiviral activity of all three human 455 restriction factors. Clearly, this novel proximity-based antiviral mechanism is 456 dependent on proper trafficking of IFITMs to ensure their concentration at the sites of 457 virus entry (Li et al., 2013; Suddala et al., 2019). Accordingly, incorporation of IFTIMs 458 into virions ensures their presence at the site of fusion and effectively inhibits infection 459 of nearly all viruses, including those that are otherwise resistant to IFITM restriction 460 when expressed in target cells (Appourchaux et al., 2019; Suddala et al., 2019; Tartour 461 et al., 2017) 462 Our findings reveal a universal defense mechanism employed by cells to effectively 463 ward off invading enveloped viruses through modification of the cytoplasmic leaflet of 464 cellular membranes.

Triton X-100 was then removed by adding 549BioBeads SM-2 absorbent beads (BioRad) at a Bio-Beads/Triton X-100 ratio of 10 550(wt/wt) in five portions during the course of hour, and incubating overnight after the 551 final addition of beads. Insoluble protein aggregates were pelleted by centrifugation of 552 samples in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (10 min, 16,000\u00d7g). 553 554 Liposome co-floatation assay 555 Peptide binding to LUVs was measured by mixing 204 \u03bcl proteoliposomes with 600 \u03bcl 556 of a 67% sucrose solution, bringing the final sucrose concentration to 50%. The mixture 557 was transferred to a clear polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with two 558 layers consisting of 10.2 ml of 25% sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose. After 559 centrifugation at 30,000 rpm (4 \u00b0C for 3 h) in the SW45Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments), 560 eight 1.5-ml fractions were collected from the top of a gradient. 30 \u03bcl aliquots from 561 glycerol, 1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 12.5 mM EDTA, 0.02 % bromophenol blue) was 569 added to stop the reaction. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with 570 Coomassie blue. 571 572 Liposome co-sedimentation assay 573 Peptides were sonicated in water bath for 30 min and possible aggregates were removed 574 by spinning down at 20,000 \u00d7g for 5 min. Two mM of LUVs made of 99.0 mol % 575 POPC, 0.5 mol % cholesterol, 0.5 mol % Liss-Rho-PE in PBS were incubated at room 576 temperature with 20 \u03bcM IFITM3(1-108)-iEGFP protein or 40 \u03bcM of Cy5-labeled 577 peptides for 10 min in a 100 \u03bcl reaction volume. The mixture was then diluted with 578 PBS and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 20 \u00b0C. Fluorescence of supernatant 579 was measured on a SpectraMax i3x microplate reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). 580 The binding efficiency of proteins/peptides was decided by reduction of EGFP or Cy5 581 fluorescence in supernatant and normalized by comparing with the fluorescence of 582 input samples. 583 584 Giant Unilamellar Vesicles 585 GUVs were prepared from a 5 mM solution of lipids in chloroform (99 mol % POPC, 586 0.5 mol % cholesterol and 0.5 mol % of Liss-Rho-PE). Fifty \u03bcl of the lipid solution was 587 spread onto a 10 cm 2 area of the conductive side of each of two indium-tin oxide (ITO) 588 coated slides (70-100 \u03a9, Delta Technologies, Stillwater, MN), allowed to evaporate 589",

Twenty \u03bcl GUVs were diluted in 30 \u03bcl of a hypertonic buffer 606 containing160 mM sucrose, 1 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 to slightly deflate GUVs. Next, 2 \u03bcl 607 of peptide diluted with 98 \u03bcl Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (Corning, NY, USA) was 608 added to and mixed with GUVs, yielding the final concentration of peptide of 10 \u03bcM. 609 The mixture of GUVs and peptide was immediately added to an 8-well chambered 610 coverslip pretreated with a BSA solution (2 mg/ml) for 30 min to attach GUVs to the 611 bottom of the chamber. GUVs were allowed to sediment for 10 min before imaging on 612 a Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning confocal microscopes, using a 63x/1.4NA oil-613 immersion objective. Purified wild-type and mutant transmembrane-truncated IFITM3 614 proteins were imaged the same way except that the final concentration of proteins was 615 20 \u03bcM. Quantification of inward budding of GUVs was performed by counting all 616 GUVs with diameter above 2 \u03bcm, regardless of whether they encompassed intraluminal 617 vesicles containing aqueous dye (fluorescein or EGFP). Images of at least 2 randomly 618 selected fields of view were acquired using Z-stacks separated by 1 \uf06dm. For each 619 condition, at least two independent experiments were performed. Statistical analysis 620 was done using the Student's t-test. 621 GUVs containing IFITM3 protein were prepared through dehydration of IFITM3-622 containing LUVs, as previously described (Girard et al., 2004). Briefly, IFITM3-623 containing LUVs were prepared, as above, added dropwise onto indium-tin oxide 624 glucose in 1x PBS) at 37 \u00b0C.

To label the virus membrane, 1.5 \u00b5l of DiD dye 642 (Invitrogen, 10 mM stock solution in DMSO) was quickly injected into a mixture 643 during mild vortexing to final concentration of 100 \u00b5M. The tube was closed, wrapped 644 with aluminum foil and agitated at the lowest speed setting of a vortex for 1 hour at 645 room temperature. The labeled viruses were purified from excess dyes on a Nap-5 gel 646 filtration column (GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 647 145 mM NaCl at room temperature. The fractions containing labeled viruses were 648 passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter to remove any large lipid and/or virus aggregates. To 649 test the labeling efficiency, 10 \u00b5l of the purified viruses were diluted to 1000 \u00b5l in PBS, 650 lysed with 0.5% TX-100 (final concentration) and the extent of DiD dequenching was 651 measured in a plate reader. A more than 20-fold increase in the DiD signal upon lysis 652 has been found to give good results in lipid mixing experiments. The labeled virus was 653 aliquoted into tubes, flash-frozen, and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. The virus lipid mixing 654 assay was performed by mixing 20 \u00b5l of the labeled virus with 30 \u00b5l GUVs, followed 655Membrane bending rigidity measurement 669GUVs were grown on a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film as described previously 670(Weinberger et al., 2013). Briefly, 50 \u00b5l of 5% w/v (145000 g/mol) PVA (Merck) 671 solution in water was spread on a cleaned (rinsed in ethanol and double distilled water) 672 glass slide to form a thin film. The PVA film was dried kept in the oven at 50\u00b0C for 30 673 minutes. Five \u00b5l of 2 mM lipid solution (80 mol % POPC, 20 mol % cholesterol) in 674 chloroform was spread on the PVA film and the solvent was evaporated in vacuum for 675 1 hour. An observation chamber with a volume of about 700 \u00b5l was assembled using a 676 Teflon spacer sandwiched between two glasses with the lipid film facing inward, and 677 the lipid films were hydrated in solution of 100 mM sucrose (Sigma), 1 mM HEPES 678 (Sigma) at pH 7.4. After swelling for 30 minutes, GUVs were harvested and used right 679 away. An aliquot of 0.1 \u03bcl DMSO solution with or without the peptide was carefully 680 pipetted into 100 \u03bcl GUV suspension and slowly agitated to ensure mixing. 681 Subsequently, 30 \u03bcl of the final solution was placed on a BSA coated glass coverslip. 682 A few percent of the solution was left to evaporate for three to five minutes to ambient 683 air and then closed in an observation chamber. Bending rigidity analysis was performed 684 either on vesicles with added DMSO only (control) or DMSO with IFITM3 at final 685 concentration of the peptide of 3 nM. Membrane bending rigidity was measured by 686 fluctuation analysis of the thermally induced motion of the membrane, as described 687 was performed using a low noise liquid-cooled digital camera pco.edge 5.expressing pseudoviruses were produced by transfecting HEK293T/17 cells 695 using JetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplus-transfection, SA, NY), as described 696 previously (Francis, Marin, Shi, Aiken, & Melikyan, 2016). Briefly, HEK293T/17 cells 697 grown in a 100-mm dish were transfected with 2.5 \u03bcg of pCAGGS plasmid expressing 698 H1N1 HA and NA proteins, 4 \u03bcg NL4-3R -E -Luc, and 1 \u03bcg pcRev. The transfection 699 medium was replaced with fresh DMEM/10% FBS after 12 h, and cells were cultured 700 for additional 36 h, after which time, the virus-containing culture medium was collected, 701 passed through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter, and concentrated 10x using Lenti-X Concentrator 702 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Following an overnight concentration with Lenti-X, 703 virus was precipitated by centrifuging at 1439xg for 45 min at 4 C, resuspended in 704 DMEM without phenol red or FBS, and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Infection assays were 705 performed using HEK 293T/17 cells transfected with indicated IFITM3 constructs in 706 pcDNA3.1(+) vector using JetPRIME transfection reagent. At 24 h post-transfection, 707 pseudoviruses (0.1 ng of p24) were spinoculated onto cells at 1,500\u00d7g, 4\u00b0C for 30 min, 708 and cells were cultured for 24 h. Luciferase activity was determined by adding Bright-709 Glo Luciferase substrate (Promega, WI, USA) and reading with a TopCount NXT 710 Luminescence counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA,USA). 711 For infection of mCherry-expressing IAV PR8 virus, HEK 293T/17 cells were seeded 712 on 8-well chambered coverslip 24 h before transfection with indicated IFITM3 713 constructs in pQCXIP. At 12 h post-transfection, mCherry-expressing IAV PR8 virus 714 (2.5x10 4 PFU/ml) was spinoculated onto cells at 1,500\u00d7g, 4\u00b0C for 30 min, and cells 715 were cultured for 12 h and imaged on a Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning confocal 716 microscope, using a 20x objective. 717 718 Insulin secretion assay 719 with some modifications. Briefly, A lentivirus vector expressing luciferase fusion 721 protein was produced using a second-generation viral packaging system. 4 \u03bcg of 722 pLX304 vector containing the fusion construct Proinsulin-NanoLuc, 2 \u03bcg of psPAX2 723 packaging plasmid, 2 \u03bcg of pMD2.G envelope plasmid were used to transfect a 10 cm 724 dish of HEK 293T/17cells using JetPRIME transfection reagent. Virus was harvested 725 at 48 hours post-transfection and passed through 0.45 \u03bcm cellulose acetate filters prior 726 to use. Viruses were spun onto INS-1E cells at 800 xg for 1 hour at 30 \u00b0C. After 24 727 hours at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 in the presence of virus, the medium was placed in fresh 728 growth media with 5 \u03bcg/mL blasticidin (Invitrogen) for 3 days to select for infected 729 cells. For insulin secretion assays, INS-1E cells were plated in 96-well plates and 730 cultured overnight at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. Cells were washed once with PBS and incubated 731 for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C in sterile, 0.45 \u03bcm-filtered Krebs Ringer Buffer (KRB) containing HEPES and 5 g/L BSA (Sigma), supplemented with 2.8 mM glucose. The cells were 734 then incubated with 2 \uf06dM of indicated IFITM3 peptides in KRB for 5 min and then 735 stimulated for 20 mins in 100 \u03bcl of fresh KRB with 20 mM glucose. For the time course 736 study, after incubating the cells for one hour in 2.8 mM glucose KRB, the buffer was 737 changed every 5 minutes to fresh, prewarmed to 37 \u00b0C KRB containing either 2.8 mM 738 glucose (for the first time point) or 20 mM glucose (for all subsequent time points). 739 The luciferase signal in samples was determined by adding the coelenterazine substrate 740 (NanoLight, Pinetop, AZ) to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10 \uf06dM and 741 reading on a TopCount NXT Luminescence counter. 742 743 Acknowledgments 744 We gratefully acknowledge lab members, Drs.
