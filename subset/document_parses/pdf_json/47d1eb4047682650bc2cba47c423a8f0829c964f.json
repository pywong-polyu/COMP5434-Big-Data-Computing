Worldwide, young people (15-24 years) remain more likely to experience substance misuse compared to the general population [1, 2] . Young adulthood is a peak time for experimentation with substances, and the college environment is inherently risky for substance use behaviors [3] . Among college students, the prevalence for ATOD use ranged between 41.3-69.8% [4] [5] [6] . A study of young adult past-month cigarette smokers revealed that 53% also reported past month cannabis use [7] , and 47.9% of polysubstance-using students reported consuming tobacco during their last cannabis use [8] .",

An examination of the association between mental health problems/difficulties and ATOD use among university students found that higher cigarette and drug use were significantly associated with higher scores of a screening scale for severe mental illness [14] . Likewise, among students, stress was indirectly related to both alcohol and marijuana [15] . Similarly, initiation of ATOD (including cigarette) use at early age predicted ATOD misuse [16] . Furthermore, 15.4% of students had financial problems as a negative consequence of substance misuse [6] ; and research found that student loans have negative effects on young people in terms of smoking, and heavy drinking [17] . As students involve in risky lifestyles (smoking, alcohol, and substance misuse), such actions bear negatively on their health and also on their education and academic achievement [18, 19] .",

The study is fully described elsewhere [20] . Two weekdays after the initial email invitation of students, a follow up reminder email was sent again to all undergraduates. In addition, three posters about the study were exhibited at the students' cafeteria at the University, and a reminder was announced on the University intraweb. Participation was voluntary and anonymous, and students were informed that by completing the online survey, they consent to participate in the study. As students completed the online survey and 'submitted' their completed questionnaires, their responses were saved and directed to the Student Management Office at the University. This Office gathered the online responses, and data were electronically entered into an excel sheet ensuring high quality assurance. After completion of this phase, the data was sent to the research team who electronically imported the data (no identifiers) into SPSS for analysis. Data were confidential and protected at all times. The number of students invited was 4387; 1177 completed questionnaires were received. Average respondent age was 22.96 \u00b1 5.21 years; females comprised 70.4%. Response rate was\u224827%.

Less than half the undergraduates reported no ATOD risk factor, while the remaining respondents registered 1, 2 or 3 ATOD risk factors (31.4%, 16.3%, and 6.7% respectively). The gender differences across these variables are depicted in the table. Illicit drugs reported by the sample included cannabis, marijuana, LSD, amphetamines (MDMA), dextromethorphan (DXM), gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), various opioids, psilocybin, hallucinogenic mushrooms, codeine, ecstasy, cocaine, LSD, ketamine, subutex, nitros, ephedrine, benzodiazepine, poppers, modified drugs, design drugs, and psychedelics. Table 2 depicts the correlates of each of the three ATOD use variables. For daily/ occasional smoking, the only significant predictors were having mostly/always sufficient monthly income, agreement with a no smoking policy on university premises, high fre-quency drinking, and ever IDU. In addition, not living with parents during university semesters displayed borderline significance (p = 0.052) for daily/occasional smoking. In terms of high frequency drinking the only significant predictors were agreement with total alcohol ban policy on university premises policy, daily/occasional smoking and ever illicit drug use. In addition, higher health awareness displayed borderline significance (p = 0.054) for high frequency drinking. As for ever IDU, the only significant predictors were being male, single, not living with parents during university semester times, reporting positive self-rated general health, high depressive symptoms, agreeing with a total smoking ban policy on university premises, and being a daily/occasional smoker or a high frequency drinker. Table 3 shows the correlates of multiple ATOD use. Single students were significantly less likely to report multiple ATOD behaviors, while those not living with parents during university semesters were significantly more likely to report multiple ATOD behaviors. In addition, respondents in agreement with total smoking or alcohol ban policy on university premises were significantly less likely to exhibit multiple ATOD behaviors. All the remaining variables were not associated with multiple ATOD behaviors. Table 4 depicts the correlates of increasing ATOD use. Three variables were significantly associated with all three levels of ATOD use. For instance, students in agreement with total smoking or alcohol ban policy on university premises were significantly less likely to be engaged in all three levels of ATOD behaviors. Conversely, not living with parents during university semesters was significantly and positively associated with all the three levels of ATOD behaviors, reaching a striking level of 8.5 times in the case of 3 ATOD behaviors. Low importance of religion in one's life was significantly positively associated with two or three ATOD behaviors. In addition, two variables (gender and marital status) were significantly associated with reporting two ATOD behaviors, where males were more likely and singles were less likely to display two ATOD behaviors.

Multi-substance use carries added risks compared to single-substance use, e.g., higher likelihood of use disorders, increased psychosocial problems, and inferior cessation outcomes [37] . Despite this, virtually no data exists on the co-occurrence of multiple ATOD behaviors among Finn undergraduates. The present study is the first to bridge this knowledge gap to assess the prevalence and correlates of individual, multiple and increasing ATOD risk factors among this important young adult population. Although that the etiology of substance use is quite comparable across different substances, appraising the variables that predict uniquely across different substances assists to recognize prominent and promising foci for potential interventions [38] .",

However, while we found that agreement with alcohol ban policy on campus was significantly less likely to be associated with all levels of increasing ATOD use, other research [11] reported that agreement with alcohol ban policy was significantly negatively associated with only one level of increasing ATOD use.

For instance, males had significantly higher odds of increasing levels of ATOD use, agreeing with research where male undergraduates were more likely to smoke, use illicit drug/s, and report high frequency drinking [11] . Likewise, being single was protective to ever IDU, negatively associated with multiple ATOD use, and protective to some (but not all) levels of increasing ATOD use, supporting that not being married was protective against substance use [47] . Similarly, in the current sample, students not living with their parents during the semesters were significantly more likely to report ever IDU, and multiple and increasing levels of ATOD behaviors (Adj OR range: 1.761 to 8.536). These findings support research among universities in the UK, where undergraduates living with parents displayed significantly lower odds across several alcohol consumption indicators [24] . We also observed that importance of religion was not associated with individual ATOD use, was of border significance for multiple ATOD use, but was significantly inversely associated with increasing (2 or 3) ATOD behaviors, where students with lower religiosity were more likely to be associated with increasing (2 or 3) ATOD behaviors. In support, others found that rituals (most notably, prayer), along with exposure to religious environments and institutions in the real world influence self-control on the scale of weeks, months, and years [48] ; and likewise, a recent review concluded that faith is a positive factor in addiction prevention and that the value of faith-oriented approaches to substance abuse prevention and recovery is indisputable [49] .",

Such general lack of associations agrees with others where despite 74.5% of university students reporting different degrees of depression, substance use as dysfunctional coping strategy had low scores on the Brief COPE questionnaire [53] . In agreement, given that among young adults, males cope with negative affects by using external avoidance-based coping, e.g., substances use, while females use e.g., rumination and isolation [54] , hence, the 70% female composition of our sample and their significantly lower depressive score compared to males, might have collectively contributed to the observed general lack of detectable associations between depressive symptoms and any ATOD use in the current sample. Similarly, our observed lack of associations between stress and individual, multiple or increasing ATOD use concurs with research that employed the same tools as the current study, to report that stress was generally not associated with individual, multiple, or increasing ATOD use [11] . Nevertheless, studies found relationships between ATOD use on the one hand, and depressive symptoms and/or stress on the other. For instance, depressed mood was one of the best predictors of drug misuse among Puerto Rican students [55] ; having higher depressive symptoms score was associated with ever IDU use among college students [56] ; and undergraduates reported stress as a reason for psychoactive substance use [57] .

Data was self-reported; underreporting of ATOD cannot be ruled out. College populations are not essentially representative of young people in the country, so the generalizations should be cautious. The questionnaire did not ask about the time of initial use of illicit drugs which could have been useful to provide an overview of the time span during which respondent used such drugs. Our 27% response rate was based on the number of returned questionnaires in relation to the total number of students enrolled at the university. In agreement with others [45] , it is not easy to calculate a precise response rate, as the research team did not have access to the exact numbers of students, who were reached by the mailing lists of the university (enrolled students who are not actively studying anymore, spamfilters, many students not using faculty mail services at all, etc.). Hence, our calculated response rate could be a cautious estimate, and the actual response rate may be higher. We allocated all three ATOD behaviors equal weighting; it might be argued that IDU could be assigned more weighting than tobacco smoking. Surveys among other student populations have been subject to similar limitations. Future research would benefit from addressing such limitations. Despite these limitations, the study has important strengths as to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to appraise in detail, the prevalence and correlates of individual, multiple, and increasing ATOD use employing a wide range of socio-demographic, academic, and health and lifestyle characteristics across Finnish university students attending many different faculties.",

Individual ATOD use was significantly and considerably positively associated with the use of the other two substances. Multiple ATOD use was significantly negatively associated with being single or agreeing with total smoking or alcohol ban policy on campus; but significantly positively associated with not living with parents. Increasing ATOD use was significantly less likely among those in agreement with total smoking or alcohol ban policy on campus. Specific risk groups included single males not living with parents during semesters (and to a much lesser extent, good self-rated health, income sufficiency, depressive symptoms and religiosity) were associated to either individual, multiple or increasing ATOD behaviors. Thus, the findings of current study suggest that demographic variables seem more pertinent than lifestyle features in terms of ATOD use. Education and prevention efforts need to reduce risk, reinforce abstinence, and highlight the harmful outcomes. Health promotion interventions could be directed to explore students' beliefs and expectations and target risk groups highlighted above. University strategies should be part of the wider country-wide successful ATOD control policies.
