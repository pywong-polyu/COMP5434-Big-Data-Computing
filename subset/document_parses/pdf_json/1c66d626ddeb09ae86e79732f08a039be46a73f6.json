The aims of our study were to evaluate disease perceptions, levels of stress, emotional distress, and coping strategies among medical staff (COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 departments) in a tertiary pulmonology teaching hospital in the first month after the outbreak of COVID-19. One hundred and fifteen health care workers completed four validated questionnaires (the brief illness perception questionnaire, perceived stress scale, the profile of emotional distress emotional, and the cognitive coping evaluation questionnaire) that were afterwards interpreted by one psychologist. There was a high level of stress and psychological distress among health care workers in the first month after the pandemic outbreak. Interestingly, there were no differences between persons that worked in COVID-19 departments versus those working in non-COVID-19 departments. Disease perceptions and coping mechanisms were similar in the two groups. As coping mechanisms, refocusing on planning and positive reappraisal were used more than in the general population. There is no difference in disease perceptions, levels of stress, emotional distress, and coping strategies in medical staff handling COVID-19 patients versus those staff who were not handling COVID-19 patients in the first month after the pandemic outbreak.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), caused by a new coronavirus known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was discovered for the first time in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and spread rapidly in almost all regions of the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared in March the COVID-19 pandemic a global public health emergency [1] . The history of humanity has been marked by many fearsome epidemics of infectious diseases (Ebola, Zika, and Spanish Flu). In the last few years, the international community has experienced a similarly frightening public health emergency on a global scale, with the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2] . Because of globalization, an infectious disease can travel from one continent to another in a matter of hours and can increase the importance of the international coordination of efforts to respond to new outbreaks of infectious disease [1, 2] . The novel coronavirus disease is called COVID-19 [3] . Given the contagious nature and the prolonged incubation period of COVID-19 infection (2 up to 14 days, with an average of 5 to 6 days), many health care workers may have feared that they could infect their family members, friends and colleagues [3, 4] . Wu and colleagues showed, in 2009, during the SARS epidemic, the necessity of understanding the possible psychosocial impacts of an outbreak with an easily transmitted, rapidly spreading infectious disease among health care professionals [5] . In the previous pandemic, it was emphasized that health care professionals were under intense stress from fear of becoming ill, spreading the infection to their families, and the heavy workload [2, [6] [7] [8] . During outbreaks, health care providers must balance the fundamental \"duty to treat\" with their parallel duties to family and loved ones. Health caretakers were forced to deal with the loss of life while processing their survival in the setting of significantly decreased social support [7] . Studies of the last SARS outbreak found the enormous emotional burden for those health care workers who were on the first lines of the battle against the disease [2, 4] . In addition to physical stress, medical staff also face huge mental burdens [9] . Even people with no comorbidities can contract the disease and become critically ill. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals are confronted with specific stressors and risks for physical and mental health [10] . During the influenza pandemic in 2009-2010, it was seen that risk perceptions influence individual protective behaviors. The risk perceptions are not necessarily correlated with the actual risk and perceived exaggeration was associated with a reduced probability to implement the recommended practices [11] . In the current COVID-19 pandemic, health workers from all professions are facing significant challenges in coping with the crisis [10] . Coping with the crisis is a real challenge, especially because people coping strategies will also change in this kind of situation. Coping represents the thoughts and actions that individuals use to deal with stressful events. There are two general coping strategies: problem-focused coping, where the purpose is to solve the problem or change the situation, and emotion-focused coping, which aims to reduce the emotional distress associated with stressful situations [9, 10] . Different emotions led to various coping strategies. For instance, in persons who report anger and fear, active-oriented coping strategies such as searching for information and asking questions, are frequently used. The who are sad are more likely to use non-active coping strategies such as avoiding or accepting problems. Nevertheless, coping strategies are essential, successful use of coping strategies will help individuals manage stressful events and reduce negative emotions [10] . The mental health care for health professionals directly affected by the COVID-19 epidemic has been under-addressed. The present study aims are to evaluate disease perceptions, level of stress, emotional distress, and coping strategies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers from pulmonology teaching hospital from Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in the first month after the outbreak started. COVID-19 staff worked in the high-risk areas of the hospital where they were continuously exposed to patients with COVID-19, and the answers were compared with the team that worked in the same pulmonology hospital, in the non-COVID-19 department. We hypothesized that those working in the COVID-19 department would be more stressed and more emotionally distressed than the non-COVID-19 department staff. A subgroup analysis was made in the COVID-19 group: intensive care unit staff versus pulmonology ward staff, as the intensive care unit contains more severely ill patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 384, "end": 387, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 706, "end": 709, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 949, "end": 952, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 953, "end": 955, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1010, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1262, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1265, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1509, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1706, "end": 1709, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1713, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1717, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1721, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2011, "end": 2014, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2182, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2183, "end": 2185, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2264, "end": 2267, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2491, "end": 2495, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2800, "end": 2804, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2937, "end": 2941, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3412, "end": 3415, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3416, "end": 3419, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3904, "end": 3908, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A cross-sectional study consists of a survey of the employees working in a pulmonology hospital dealing with COVID-19 patients.

Although we would have expected a difference between the two groups, with a higher level of perceived stress and emotional distress among participants working in the COVID-19 department as they were facing a highly contagious, unknown disease, the difference between the two groups was not statistically different. One possible explanation for this might be that the staff in the COVID-19 department volunteered to be there, as the other responders refused to work there. Even in a subgroup analysis comparing intensive care unit staff with pulmonology wards, the difference remains insignificant. COVID-19, a highly infectious disease with a long incubation period and an unknown outcome that is lethal in some cases and without a specific treatment, is a stress source with significant influence, for both individuals and public social groups. It is only reasonable that it has a high impact on the public's mental health [9] . In China, approximately 1700 healthcare personnel have been reported as infected with the COVID-19 disease (14.8% severely or critically ill, and 5% associated with deaths) [17] . Considering previous experience, we could assume that the COVID-19 outbreak will generate psychological reactions, which will lead to psychological disorders such as acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and, in some cases, unfortunately, even suicide [4, [6] [7] [8] [9] . Different individuals may experience different levels of psychological reactions. SARS-CoV-2 viruses can be transmitted rapidly through respiratory droplets, contact, and aerosols, even by asymptomatic patients [9] . In China, for example, COVID-19 infection escalated quickly and without warning, with little time for emergency procedures or other mitigation efforts [17] . As they spend more time with patients, sometimes healthcare workers see them dying and the pain and even the fear seems to be greater among nurses than among doctors. This combined with stressful work, sleep deprivation, low freedom, heavy responsibility, and a high degree of cooperation, leads to a higher susceptibility towards the disease. In our study, nurses had a much higher score of illness perception (total IPQ) compared to doctors, but a lower score than junior doctors (31.5 vs. 27.3 vs. 43.5; p = 0.039) [9] . As a coping mechanism, they prefer positive reappraisal (CERQ 6). In 2004, one study reported that about 20% of the population suffered from emotional depression during SARS, and the incidence for nurses was as high as 45% in Toronto [18] . Folkman reported precious data focusing on psychological wellbeing and the coping processes in a crisis, as a complement to the traditional focus in both the medical and behavioral sciences on psychiatric symptoms [19] . Health care workers are on the front line of any given epidemic and risk their lives for their duty [8] . Health professionals have the responsibility of care to the infected patients, close contacts with patients families, and face the prospect of a public inquiry (3) . In a recent study, Styra showed that caring for only one patient with SARS is significantly more stressful than caring for none or caring for two or more patients with SARS [20] . Liu H and colleagues showed that anxiety, fear, and anger are positively related to problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping, meaning that there may be a phenomenon relating to \"the more coping, the more panic\" or \"the more panic, the more coping\", or a \"coping-panic cycle\" [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1203, "end": 1206, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1386, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1673, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1677, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1681, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1685, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1689, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1903, "end": 1906, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2060, "end": 2064, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2585, "end": 2588, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2825, "end": 2829, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3046, "end": 3050, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3153, "end": 3156, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3319, "end": 3322, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3498, "end": 3502, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3789, "end": 3792, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We cope with success when we are exposed to a stressful situation if required to assess our self-efficacy, which entails self-appraisal of our ability to deal with the stressful event [20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 184, "end": 188, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Most of the research on the psychological responses to infectious disease outbreaks have been conducted on either affected individuals, such as in the case of HIV/AIDS, or on health care workers working to combat an illness such as SARS [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 241, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "An analysis of the direction of the relationship between emotion and coping found that problem-focused coping has a significant predictive effect on anxiety and sadness.
