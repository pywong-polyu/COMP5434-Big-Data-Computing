            "text": "Three betacoronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and established human-to-human transmission causing significant morbidity and mortality in the past 20 years. The most current and widespread of these is SARS-CoV-2. The identification of CoVs with zoonotic potential in animal reservoirs suggests that additional outbreaks could occur. Monoclonal antibodies targeting conserved neutralizing epitopes on diverse CoVs can form the basis for prophylaxis and therapeutic treatments and enable the design of vaccines aimed at providing pan-CoV protection. We previously identified a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, CV3-25 that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant comparably to the ancestral Wuhan Hu-1 strain, cross neutralizes SARS-CoV-1 and binds to recombinant proteins derived from the spike-ectodomains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. Here, we show that the neutralizing activity of CV3-25 is maintained against the Alpha, Delta, Gamma and Omicron variants of concern as well as a SARS-CoV-like bat coronavirus with zoonotic potential by binding to a conserved linear peptide in the stem-helix region. Negative stain electron microscopy and a 1.74 \u00c5 crystal structure of a CV3-25/peptide complex demonstrates that CV3-25 binds to the base of the stem helix at the HR2 boundary to an epitope that is distinct from other stem-helix directed neutralizing mAbs.",

            "text": "CoV infection is mediated by the viral spike protein (S) which is a membrane anchored class I fusion protein expressed on the virion surface and is an important target of host immune responses elicited by infection or vaccination. S is comprised of two distinct functional subunits; a N-terminal, membrane distal subunit designated S1 and a C-terminal, membrane proximal subunit designated S2. The S2 domain houses the fusion machinery that undergoes large structural rearrangements to mediate fusion of the host and viral membranes. The S1 domain serves to stabilize the S2 subunit in the pre-fusion state and facilitates the attachment to ligands on host cells through the receptor binding domain (RBD) 4 . In general, CoV-cell fusion requires conformational changes induced by receptor binding, as well as further proteolytic cleavage of the S2 subunit to liberate the fusion peptide and trigger conformational changes, which can occur at the cell membrane or following viral endocytosis 5 . The SARS-CoV-2 spike is translated as a single polypeptide that is proteolytically cleaved at a furin site between the S1 and S2 subunits in the virus-producer cell 6, 7 . Following binding to the ACE2 receptor on the target cell, cleavage at the S2' site by TMPRSS at the cell surface or cathepsin L, following endocytosis is required to liberate the fusion peptide [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Rearrangements of S2 embed the fusion peptide into the host membrane and then refolding results in the formation of a fusion pore 12, 13 .",

Due to the diversity in receptor usage and variability of spike sequences across CoVs, RBD and NTD directed mAbs are often virus specific. Even within the same CoV, mutant variants can evade neutralization by mAbs and polyclonal sera. Indeed, mutations found in the RBD and NTD of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are responsible for increased resistance to serum and mAbs. It has been speculated such variants could erode vaccine efficacy over time. The RBD and NTD of other CoVs appear to be subject to and evade immune pressure as well 44, 45 . In contrast, S2 is more functionally and structurally conserved among CoVs 4, 48 . However, it is sub-dominant with respect to neutralizing antibody responses as the majority of S2binding mAbs isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected donors are non-neutralizing 32, 33, [49] [50] [51] .",

The neutralizing potency of CV3-25 is unaffected by mutations found in the Beta (B.1.351) SARS-CoV-2 variant and can neutralize SARS-CoV-1. CV3-25 also displays cross-reactivity with recombinant spike proteins derived from the betaCoVs, OC43 and HKU1. Here, we demonstrate that the neutralizing activity of CV3-25 is unaffected by mutations found in the Alpha 52 , Delta 53 , Gamma 54 , and Omicron 55 variants and show that it can neutralize a sarbecovirus from bats, WIV1 56 . We identified a linear epitope overlapping the stem-helix/HR2 region containing the epitope of CV3-25. A crystal structure of CV3-25 with a 19mer peptide revealed that CV3-25 binds to a solvent-exposed linear epitope that partially unwinds the stem-helix. The CV3-25 epitope is distinct from other mAbs targeting the stem helix region 57-59 , thus defining a site of conserved vulnerability that will enable pan-CoV vaccine design.",

We previously reported that CV3-25 neutralizes the Wuhan-Hu-1 and Beta (B.1.351) variants of SARS-CoV-2 with comparable potency in a pseudovirus neutralization assay 50 . Here we evaluated the ability of CV3-25 to neutralize additional SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), Gamma (P.1), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) and a more distantly related sarbecovirus from bats, WIV1, which uses ACE2 as an entry receptor and can infect human cell lines 52, 54, 56, 60 . Therefore, WIV1 represents a bat CoV with pandemic potential. CV3-25 neutralized all variants and WIV1 with comparable potency (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1 ). In contrast, the RBD-directed CV30 mAb showed reduced potency against the Beta, and Gamma variants of concern both of which harbor mutations in the RBD at position 417 that makes direct contact with CV30 54,60,61 (Fig. 1b and  Supplementary Table 1 ). CV30 was unable to neutralize the Omicron variant which harbors mutations at 477 and 493 in the RBD that are contact residues for CV30 61 . WIV1 was completely resistant to CV30-mediated neutralization. None of the pseudoviruses were neutralized by the anti-EBV mAb AMMO1 (Fig. 1c) 62 . Combined with the observation that CV3-25 also neutralizes SARS-CoV-1, these data indicate that it binds to an epitope on S2 that is unaffected by mutations found in these sarbecovirus variants.",

To test whether CV3-25 binds to a similar epitope, CV3-25 binding to overlapping 15mer linear peptides spanning the stem helix region (1143-1162) from SARS-CoV-2 was measured by ELISA (Fig. 2f) . CV3-25 bound to two peptides encompassing amino acids 1149-1163 and 1153-1167, with stronger binding to the latter (Fig. 2g ). CV3-25 did not bind to any of the other SARS-CoV-2 peptides or to a control peptide from HIV-1 Env. CV3-25 binding was specific, as CV2-10, an S2 directed mAb that does not compete with CV3-25 binding 50 , did not bind either peptide (Fig. 2h) . To confirm binding to this peptide region, we synthesized a peptide spanning 1145-1167 and verified that CV3-25 bound to the peptide with~5 nM affinity using biolayer interferometry (BLI) (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 2 ). The measured affinity of CV3-25 for the peptide is lower than it is for a recombinant stabilized spike protein (~0.6 nM) Table 2 ). We note that the association rate of binding to the peptide does not fit well to a 1:1 binding model ( Fig. 2i ) which may reflect several conformations sampled by the immobilized peptide (a heterogenous ligand) and affect the accuracy of the CV3-25 peptide binding measurement. Alternatively, the difference in affinity might be attributed to additional contacts made between CV3-25 and the spike protein outside of the linear peptide tested here.",

To gain insight into the nature of the CV3-25 peptide interaction, the antigen binding fragment (Fab) of CV3-25 was complexed with a synthesized peptide of the C-terminal end of the stem helix (residues 1149-1167). A crystal structure of the Fab-peptide complex was obtained to a resolution of 1.74 \u00c5 ( Table 1 ). The structure showed that binding to this peptide is almost entirely heavy chain dependent (Fig. 3a, b) . The N-terminal end of the peptide forms an \u03b1-helix that is engaged by the CDRH1 and CDRH2. The CDRH3 extends under the base of the \u03b1-helix directing the extended C-terminal portion of the peptide up into the CDRH1 before turning downward to interact with the light chain. The Fab binds the peptide with a total buried surface area (BSA) of~594 \u00c5 2 , of which~516 \u00c5 2 is from the heavy chain and 78 \u00c5 2 from the light chain (Fig. 3c) . Alanine scanning of a stem helix peptide was conducted to assess the relative contributions of the interactions observed in the crystal structure ( Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). This analysis revealed that mutating Lys 1157 , any of the residues in 1160 TSPDV 1164 , or Leu 1166 inhibited or greatly reduced binding (Fig. 3d) . This data agrees well with the structural data.",

The stem helix residues that are shared in the structures adopt almost identical conformations (Fig. 4a) . B6 binds to the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helix that is predicted to be on the interior of the stem helix bundle of the pre-fusion trimer 57 . In contrast, CV3-25 binds to the solvent-exposed hydrophilic face of the helix. An alignment of the CV3-25 stem helix to a cryoEM structure of the native prefusion spike with the stem helix structure resolved (PDBID: 6XR8) 13 indicates that the CV3-25-bound stem helix The region that corresponds to the stem helix in the prefusion wild-type spike protein (based on the 6XR8) is shown in bold. g CV3-25 was tested for binding to the peptides in (e), and to a 15mer peptide derived from an HIV-1 Env protein. h CV2-10, which also binds to S2, but does not compete with CV3-25 was tested for binding to the peptides in (f). Each data point represents a technical replicate conducted in duplicate in (g) and (h). CV3-25 Fab binding was measured to the SARS-CoV-2 stem helix peptide: 1145-LDSFKEELDKYFKNHTSPDVDLG-1167 (i) or a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by BLI (j). unwinds a full turn, with the helix terminating Pro 1162 moving 13 \u00c5 into the interior of the helix bundle (Fig. 4b) . The unwinding and repositioning of the stem-helix by CV3-25 would create a clash between residues 1162 PDVDL 1166 and the CDRH1 and CDRH3 of B6. There are additional potential clashes between the CDRH3 on CV3-25 and CDRH2 on B6. Collectively these provide a structural basis for the observed competition between B6 and CV3-25 binding to SARS-CoV-2 S2P, which was confirmed using a linear SARS-CoV-2 peptide ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). CV3-25 binding to the stem helix peptide also prevented subsequent binding of the CC40.8 mAb ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). CryoET analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike on the surface of intact virions shows an extended stalk region downstream of the stem helix 68, 69 . However, all presently available cryoEM structures of the stabilized or membrane solubilized native spikes show poor resolution of the stem helix region and density for the downstream region including HR2 is missing 7, 13, 14 . A model of the full length spike ectodomain, including HR2 was determined using homology modelling and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation 70 . Aligning the CV3-25stem helix structure to this model shows good agreement (Fig. 4c) . In both the modeled and CV3-25-peptide structures, the stem helix ends at the glycosylated Asn 1158 , and the extended C-terminal end of the CV3-25 bound peptide adopts a similar conformation to the MD model.",

The overall RMSD between the CV3-25 bound peptide and this region in the post-fusion spike is 9.8 \u00c5 2 over 15 C\u03b1 atoms and is therefore unlikely to be compatible with CV3-25 binding.

Although the binding to the peptide from SARS-CoV-1/2 and WIV1 was comparable and strong, the binding was severely reduced to MERS and OC43, and to a lesser extent to HKU1.

As such, we can only speculate as to why CV3-25 binds well to recombinant spike ectodomains and linear peptides from the MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 beta-CoVs, but fails to bind full-length cell-surface expressed spikes or neutralize the corresponding viruses/pseudoviruses. CryoEM structures of stabilized NL63, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins only resolve the N-terminus of the stem-helix region 7,14,73-77 . Moreover, complexes of mAbs B6, S26P, IgG22 and CC40.8 with stabilized spikes from MERS, SARS-CoV-2 and HKU1 are also poorly resolved by EM suggesting that this region undergoes significant conformational heterogeneity on recombinant proteins 57, 58, 65, 66 . Subtomogram averaging of virion-anchored SARS-CoV-2 spikes show evidence of flexible hinges in the stalk region 68, 69 . The stalk has been likened to a leg with a hip, knee and ankle joint where the stem helix region corresponds to the upper leg 68 . CV3-25 would bind to the dynamic \"knee\" region and may only recognize one of many conformations adopted by the SARS-CoV-2 spike. If so, it's possible that a similar conformation is not sampled by membrane-anchored MERS, HKU1 or OC43 spikes. Alternatively, the CV3-25 epitope could be less exposed in the context of the MERS, OC43 and HKU1 membrane-anchored spikes as compared to their corresponding stabilized ectodomains or the membrane-anchored sarbecovirus spikes. We note however, that the smaller size Fab domain of CV3-25 was unable to neutralize the OC43 virus.",

The fact that CV3-25 binds a linear epitope indicates that it may be possible to design small scaffold based, or subunit vaccines that present the CV3-25 epitope while avoiding eliciting an immunodominant response to non-neutralizing epitopes on S2 and elsewhere on the spike. The observation that CV3-25 competes for binding with B6 and CC40.8 despite binding to discrete linear epitopes, indicates that multiple scaffold design strategies may need to be employed to target these two conserved sites of CoV vulnerability in the stem-helix region in order to provide broad neutralizing coverage against diverse CoV. Similarly, a therapeutic combination of non-competing stemhelix mAbs may provide broad neutralizing coverage against emergent pathogenic CoVs since CV3-25 neutralizes diverse sarbecoviruses, and B6 neutralizes multiple merbecoviruses and OC43, a member of the embecovirus subgenus 57 .",

Serially diluted serum or mAb was mixed with virus in serum-free RPMI and incubated for 1 h at 33\u00b0C on a shaker at 150 rpm. Then the, virus:antibody mixture was transferred onto HCT-8 cells and the plate was incubated at 33\u00b0C in a CO 2 incubator. At day 5, cells were fixed with \u221220\u00b0C-cold, 70% MeOH for 15 min. Plate was rinsed with PBS (Gibco) and blocked with PBS containing 2.5% Blotting grade blocker (Bio-Rad) and 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. After washing one time with PBS-T (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20), plate was incubated with rabbit antinucleocapsid antibody (Sino Biological, Cat# 40643-T62) for 1 h at room temperature on a plate shaker at 800 rpm. After that, plate was washed three times with PBS-T and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat# 111-035-144) for 1 h at room temperature on a plate shaker at 800 rpm. After washing three times with PBS-T, the assay was developed by addition of 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA solution (Thermo Scientific Cat# 34028) and reaction was stopped with 2 N sulfuric acid (Fisher Scientific). Optical density at 450 and 620 nm was captured with SpectraMax M2 (Molecular Devices). Neutralization was defined as the antibody concertation that reduced OD relative to virus control wells (cells + virus only) after subtraction of background OD in cells-only control wells.",

To generate a plasmid encoding the MERS-CoV-2 spike (pHDM-MERS-CoV-Spike) codon-optimized cDNA corresponding to the MERS-CoV S protein (Riyadh_14_2013, GenBank: AHI48572.1) flanked on the 5\u2032 end by 30 nt of homology upstream of and including the EcoRI site and flanked on the 3\u2032 end by 30 nt of homology downstream of and including the HindIII site on the pHDM-SARS-CoV-2 Spike Wuhan-Hu-1 plasmid was synthesized by Twist Biosciences. The synthesized DNA was cloned into the pHDM-SARS-CoV-2 Spike Wuhan-Hu-1 plasmid that was cut with EcoRI and HindIII and gel purified to remove the SARS-CoV-2 Spike cDNA using InFusion HD cloning Plus. The sequences of the cDNA of all the spike expression constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing (Genewiz Inc.). Peptides. Peptides were synthesized by Genscript or A&A Labs with, or without a biotin molecule conjugated to the amino-terminus via aminohexanoic acid. Pseudovirus neutralization assay. HIV-1 derived viral particles were pseudotyped with full length wildtype S from Wuhan Hu1, B.1.351, B.1.1.7, P.1, WIV1, or MERS-CoV using a previously described reporter system 81 . Briefly, plasmids expressing the HIV-1 Gag and pol (pHDM540 Hgpm2, BEI Resources Cat# NR-52517), HIV-1Rev (pRC-CMV-rev1b, BEI Resources Cat# NR-52519), HIV-1 Tat (pHDM-tat1b, BEI resources NR-52518), SARS-CoV-2 spike (pHDM-SARS-CoV-2 Spike Wuhan-Hu-1, pHDM-SARS-CoV-2 Spike-B.1.1.7, SARS-CoV-2 Spike-P.1, pHDM-SARS-CoV-2 Spike-B.1.351 30 , pCMV3-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-B.1.617.2, pTWist-WIV1-CoV (a gift from Alejandro Balazs (Addgene plasmid # 164438; http://n2t.net/addgene:164438; RRID:Addgene_164438), or pHDM-MERS-CoV",

Each dot represents a technical replicate measured in duplicate in (a-d). Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 (e), SARS-CoV-1 Urbani (f), WIV1 (g), HCoV-HKU1 (h) and HCoV-OC43 (i) and MERS-CoV (j) spike proteins were expressed on the surface of 293 cells, and then stained with the indicated fluorescently labeled mAbs and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells that stained positive with the mAbs is indicated on the y axis. One representative example of two independent experiments with three technical replicates is shown.

Among these mAbs, four S2P6, CC40.8, IgG22 and B6 have previously been structurally characterized. All form a hydrophobic groove that cradles the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic SARS-CoV-2 stem helix (residues AA 1147-1156 for B6, residues 1142-1159 for CC40.8, 1147-1156 for IgG22, and residues 1146-1159 for S2P6). Alanine scanning of a stem helix peptide from MERS S suggests that the 1.6C7 and 28D9 mAbs which were isolated from humanized mice immunized sequentially with recombinant S from OC43, SARS and MERS, bind to a similar epitope region",
