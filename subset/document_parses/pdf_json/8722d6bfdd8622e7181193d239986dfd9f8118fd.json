As of Feb 2020, there are 2494 laboratory-confirmed human cases reported from 27 countries across the globe. About 858 were passed away. The majority of the infection and fatalities were reported in the Arabian Peninsula [1] . MERS-CoV is belonging to the lineage C of betacoronaviruses. It is a positive sense single stranded RNA virus. The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. The virus replication cycle occurs in several steps starting with the adsorption of the virus to the cell surface. This step requires the presence of some specific viral receptors on the target cells. The DPP-4 was reported to be one of the main viral receptors utilized by the virus to facilitate the virus entry to the target cells in addition to the sialic acid in transgenic mice model [2] . Some studies proved the upregulation of the DPP4 in heavy smokers in the context of MERS-CoV infection which contributed to severe lung complications and finally death of the affected patients [3] . Interestingly, glycosylation of the DPP-4 protein resulted in marked inhibition of MERS-CoV replication in mouse model [4] . Some recent studies reported the correlation between the expression of DPP-4 and the success of MERS-CoV infection both in vitro in Illama and pigs [5] . In similar manner, experimental infection of dromedary camels resulted in extensive ciliary loss of the respiratory tract as well as severe loss of the DPP-4 in the respiratory tract of the infected camels [6] . However, few studies were conducted to explore the roles of DPP-4 in the context of natural MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels.

The DPP4 receptor signals was detected in the all examined tissues (nasal turbinate, trachea, lung, and kidneys) with moderate to strong signals ( Table 1 ). The evaluation of the signals depended on both the distribution as well as the strength of the reaction in the examined tissues. Most of the reactions were obviously detected in both the apical epithelial layers and submucosal glands of the turbinate bones, trachea and bronchi. In the lungs, the reaction of DPP4 receptors and was detected in the alveolar walls (Fig. 2) . Viral replication and tropism is mainly governed by many factors including the availability of specific viral receptors and transcription factors. It is believed that MERS-CoV utilizes the DPP-4 as main receptors and sialic acid as accessory receptors [7] . MERS-CoV infection usually starts with the attachment of the virus by its spike glycoproteins to the target cell DPP4 ligands [7] . One study have found that DPP4 was detected on cells in the cortical apical proximal tubular epithelium and arteriolar smooth muscle of kidney of camel [8] . Our study considered natural infected animals and others studies done under experimental conditions using different animals (rhesus macaques, common marmosets, and dromedary camels) are confirming the importance of the 14 amino acids within the DPP4 which binds to the RBD of the MERS-CoV in the successful viral infections [9, 10] . Extensive ciliary loss in the respiratory organs of the dromedary camels was recently shown under experimental infection using the recombinant MERS-CoV/Vaccinia virus-Ankara (MVA-S) [6] . Our results showed high level of DPP4 expression levels in nasal turbinate and kidney. This may explains the multi-organs failure in some MERS-CoV patients particularly lung and kidneys [11] . Our results is very much consistent with the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection in human as well as the experimental infection of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels and other members of family Camelade [12] .
