These pulmonary illnesses impose strenuous social and economic burdens, as seen with the recent lung-damaging COVID-19 outbreak (Atkeson, 2020) . The acute and progressive pathological inflammation and bronchoconstriction of the lung obstruct and restrict airflow and oxygenation, inducing altered mechanical properties (Suki and Bates, 2011; Eskandari et al., 2016) . This mechanical remodeling is multiscale, spanning the destruction of alveolar sac elasticity in emphysema (Suki et al., 2003) , the over stiffening of the parenchymal tissue in pulmonary fibrosis (Faffe and Zin, 2009) , and the constriction and collapse of airways in asthma (Bai and Knight, 2005; Maghsoudi-Ganjeh et al., 2021) .

            "text": "Despite the growing body of literature on pulmonary mechanics, the multiscale and multiphysics link between the global pressure-volume behavior of the lung and the local-level tissue deformation remains largely unexplored. There has been notable progress to characterize the lung at the organ scale through classical pressure-volume curves and at the tissue level using indentation and uniaxial tensile tests (Lai-Fook et al., 1976; Zeng et al., 1987; Fung, 1988; Eskandari et al., 2018) ; however these investigations remain siloed at disconnected scales. Amalgamating these multiphysics and multiscale behaviors is central to understanding lung disease mechanisms, predicting disease progression, and mitigating ventilator-induced-lung-injuries (VILI) to eliminate tissue over stretching (volutrauma) and stressing (barotrauma) (Dreyfuss and Saumon, 1998; Vlahakis et al., 1999; Arora et al., 2017; Arora et al., 2021) . Unless an atlas for pulmonary kinetics and kinematics can be established, current ventilation protocols will continue to be subject to trial and error approaches and hindered from advancements despite exigent demands instilled by a worldwide pandemic (The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network, 2000; Amato et al., 2015) .",

DIC is a common full-field, non-contact deformation characterization technique originally applied on inert structures (Chu et al., 1985) , and has now been enhanced to study the behavior of intricate biological tissues, such as the cornea (Boyce et al., 2008) , arteries (Sutton et al., 2008) , knees (Mallett and Arruda, 2017) , and most recently, the lung . In this method, sequential images of a specimen's speckled surface undergoing loading are used to obtain the topological displacement field (Chu et al., 1985) . While DIC describes the kinematics, inverse finite element analysis (IFEA) can be employed to divulge the kinetics. IFEA yields specimen mechanical properties by minimizing the error between the displacements predicted by the Finite Element (FE) model and those measured via experiment .",

The inverse FE model leveraged several known parameters: the surface geometry of the lung from the uninflated stage obtained after three preconditioning inflation-deflation cycles, the experimentally measured pressure-time graph, and the DIC displacement field of the lung surface. However, the type of constitutive model and corresponding material parameters were unknown; these model attributes were left to be determined by the optimization algorithms.

The obtained geometry was tessellated with 3-D triangular elements averaging 1 mm in size. The DIC system could only detect and analyze the visible portion of the lung lobes ( Figure 1 ). The raw data from the original DIC geometry was not suitable for the FE simulation as it contained some elements with poor isoperimetric quality and sharp surface discontinuities. To improve the mesh quality, MeshLab (ISTI-CNR, Italy) was used to smoothen the surface while preserving the original surface features (Cignoni et al., 2008) . Two fine and coarse meshed models, with \u223c5,000 and 457 elements respectively, were exported as STL files which were then converted to Abaqus input files using the built-in script plugin (Dassault Systems, Providence, RI, United States). The fine and coarse meshes were used to study the cases corresponding to homogeneous and heterogeneous material models, respectively. This approach reduced the number of unknown material parameters in the heterogeneous case and was necessary to substantially decrease the IFEA computational cost. After confirming the mesh resolution was sufficient, both meshed models were discretized using 3-D membrane elements (M3D3). The recorded DIC experimental displacement values of the nodes sitting on the perimeter of the surface geometry were applied as displacement boundary conditions to the FE models; as such, while the geometry of the model represented the visible portions of the lung lobes, the role of the adjacent tissue was represented through the application of these periphery nodal displacements (as opposed to traditional boundary conditions). The thickness of membrane elements were set to 1.0 mm. One-to-one experimental to FE model nodal correspondence was created for error calculations by probing the displacement from \u223c7,000 evenly distributed points across the surface. During the multiple inflation stages, where the displacement error between the FE model and DIC nodes were to be calculated, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between FE model nodes and DIC probe points. Therefore, interpolation must be used to find FE model nodes corresponding to the DIC probe points so that the error could be computed. An interpolation technique was used, utilizing the DIC displacements and coordinates of the probe points to train the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm (Altman, 1992) . The performance of the interpolation model was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation, confirming the accuracy was above 0.95. The number of nearest neighbors k was set to be five. The interpolation technique was implemented using two Python scripts: one to access nodal coordinates from Abaqus, and one to perform interpolation.",

Therefore, two broad classes of gradient-based and gradientfree optimization algorithms were implemented to improve global optimum acquisition. In the gradient-based approach, the trust-region-reflective (TRR) algorithm (Steihaug, 1983) , available in Matlab lsqnonlin function (The MathWorks Inc., MA, United States), was used for the two homo/iso/hyper and homo/aniso/hyper cases; and the sequential-quadraticprogramming (SQP) algorithm (Boggs and Tolle, 1995) , available in Matlab fmincon function, was used for the hetero/ iso/linear-elastic case. As for the gradient-free approach, we implemented our own version of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995) in a Matlab script. This provided more flexibility to impose custom constraints on our problem, such as bounds on the position and velocity of particles, which may not be done so freely in the built-in Matlab PSO algorithm. The IFEA processes in both approaches were fully automated by conjoining Matlab, Abaqus, and Python. To help avoid local optima, the TRR and SQP algorithms were run from several randomly selected initial estimate points within the search space as given in Table 1 and Table 2 . As a verification step, we applied the IFEA framework to a test case model with a simpler geometry and known deformation field and material parameters. We confirmed that the optimization pipeline was indeed successful in recovering the pre-known material parameters.",

Another consequence of C01 being very small is that the stress-strain curve would start to look less nonlinear.",

The anisotropic hyperelastic formulation in Abaqus ignores the compressibility coefficient and therefore, the objective function was simply insensitive to this parameter and D remained unchanged (Abaqus: Theory Manual, 2011). Conversely, k 2 , which was a dimensionless parameter exponentially controlling the contribution of the fibers in the overall strain energy function, did not yield a specific value because \u03ba always converged to 0.33 and effectively zeroed out the anisotropic part of the strain energy density function. Therefore, k 2 , contributing to the anisotropic term, did not converge to a meaningful value because it played no role in the strain density function. Despite accounting for anisotropic lung behavior, the inverse optimization framework found no anisotropic advantage over the isotropic model. Given this observation, the homo/aniso/ hyper case was not pursued further, and the considered models were limited to the homo/iso/hyper and hetero/iso/linearelastic cases.",

Our shear modulus values, representing the combined parenchyma, airway, and pleura layer materials, are greater than those of isolated lung parenchyma (0.17-0.27 kPa) and the alveolar wall (1.74 kPa), comparatively estimated by converting the previously reported elastic modulus with an assumed Poisson ratio of 0.43 (Lai-Fook et al., 1976; Cavalcante et al., 2005) . Similarly converting the reported 10-70 kPa elastic moduli of isolated airway specimens (Eskandari et al., 2019) yields airway shear modulus range of 3.5-25 kPa, also less than our combined shear modulus results. Conversely, the encapsulating visceral pleura layer is approximated to have a shear modulus of \u223c200 kPa at low stretch ratios (Humphrey et al., 1986) , similar to our values. The ratio between the bulk and shear modulus (often used to gage material compressibility) was nearly 5.5 for the homo/iso/ hyper case, and 0.5 for the hetero/iso/linear-elastic case. This is significantly less than incompressible materials (with a ratio greater than 1,000) and justifies the use of the compressible material model, as previously suggested . Our model suggests that lung elasticity is not distributed evenly across the regions, but that the shear moduli is smallest in the anterior region (Figure 4) , corresponding to the location of maximum deformation. While literature substantiating this tissue heterogeneity across the organ is not yet available, regionally extracted tissue subjected to tensile or indentation tests can enable future comparisons.",

While this finding is bound to the model limitation and calls for further experimental works to validate, it still can be substantiated given the isotropic material behavior of the parenchyma (Fung, 1988) where collagen and elastin fibers are randomly oriented (Toshima et al., 2004) . However, the major strains were found to predominantly align with the medial-lateral direction while the minor strains were preferentially aligned with the anteriorposterior direction ( Figure 3) ; this indicates that the spatial patterns and strain orientations were possibly a result of the geometry and loading of the lung more so than the anisotropic nature of the tissue material itself. An alternative hypothesis is the embedded monopodial main bronchial airway, which delivers oxygen from the anterior to posterior region and is twice as compliant circumferentially than axially, enables greater stretch in the mediallateral direction . Therefore, it is plausible that larger collagen-enriched airways may contribute to the anisotropic strain distribution in the lung to a great extent. Including a model mapping of the major airway pathways may help further differentiate the tissue matrix versus the effect of the structural reinforcement. This hypothesis will be explored further in upcoming mice and human lung experiments with differing bronchial branching patterns and collateral ventilation compared to the pig.",

Current pulmonary biomechanical models of the lung can be categorized into two classes: 1) models primarily based on in-vivo kinematics data obtained from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images (Al-Mayah et al., 2010; Eom et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013; Ilegbusi et al., 2016; Ladjal et al., 2021) , and 2) classic models idealizing the lung as single/multi resistive compartments calibrated with pressure-volume data (Bates, 2009) . While these methods have been quite insightful, their shortcomings have motivated the novel approach put forward in this study. For instance, CT-and MR-based models (class 1) utilize convoluted and tedious deformable image registration (DIR), further challenged by the lack of a universal ground truth of lung nodules which necessitates expert-determined anatomical landmark detection and hinders model validation (Sotiras et al., 2013; Sarrut et al., 2017) . Additionally, compartmentalized models (class 2) describe global bulk elastance and resistance behaviors and neglect the intricate multiscale architecture of the lung, omitting the local heterogeneities and strain risers responsible for inflammation and damage (Vlahakis et al., 1999; Gattinoni et al., 2003) . The absence of controllable testing parameters and continuous measures in-vivo limits basic lung kinetic and kinematic investigations, such as exploring the role of ventilation volume and rate, and contrasting physiological negative-versus artificial positive-pressure ventilation . Our ex-vivo informed in-silico approach can readily establish the mechanical science of breathing by merging detailed data acquisition with computational predictions.",

Extending this framework to include diseased lungs categories, such as fibrosis or asthma, will enable regional tissue remodeling detection studies to discover load-and deformation-based pathological deviations to guide therapies, as inspired by similar FE-based models of the lung being used to better aerosol deposition in asthmatic patients (Wall et al., 2010; Soni and Aliabadi, 2013) and optimal radiation therapy (Werner et al., 2009; Ilegbusi et al., 2016) . Furthermore, this model has potential applications for the design of ventilators: many didactic (Anderson et al., 2009) or clinical ventilators (Zuckerberg et al., 2020) contain a lung-replicating rubber bladder or elastic balloon component with mechanical properties that are not physiologically representative. Our FE lung membrane-like model and optimized material properties can enhance the design resemblance of these ventilator systems to improve patient care.",

Firstly, one animal was used to demonstrate this IFEA framework and therefore, statistically conclusive results regarding the material property values are not warranted. Second, while the optimization algorithms minimized the error, the final error was still not completely vanished; this indicates lung-specific constitutive models are needed to better replicate the DIC measurements, as concluded by earlier works (Eskandari et al., 2019) . Third, while DIC allows continuous and evolutionary behaviors of the lung to be examined whereas digital volume correlation techniques are at discrete snapshots (Arora et al., 2021) , DIC can only access the lung surface and the internal structure of the lung and the volumetric strain distributions are not represented; a potential enhancement to this technique could be the use of mirrors and prisms to collect multi-angled views. Fourth, the framework is built on ex-vivo setting, hence the predicted material properties are likely to be influenced by the deformation Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org",

Fifth, the anisotropic formulation implemented in the FE-package used in this study does not take into account the compressibility aspect of plane-stress elements, such as membrane elements in our model and assumes constant volume instead while still allowing for reduction in the element thickness due to in-plane deformations. Thus, the compressibility coefficient (parameter D in the HGO model) is not optimized by the IFEA framework. New implementation of the HGO formulation that do indeed account for the compressibility are needed to further investigate the effects of this limitation and provide insight into the compressibility of the anisotropic model. Lastly, for simplicity and computational time considerations, the heterogeneous model was a linear model whereas a nonlinear model might result in a better calibrated model.",

This is achieved by developing a novel lung application IFEA framework informed and verified by ex-vivo continuous DIC measurements from a porcine lung controlled via a custom-designed respiration apparatus. The resulting FE model introduces a model constructed solely from the geometry and deformation of its external surface as a result of the applied inflation load. This insilico reduced-order pulmonary surrogate consolidates complex lung tissues (i.e., the visceral pleura, bulk parenchymal tissue, and the airway tree) into a simplified 3-D surface model, yielding compound material properties of a membrane representative of pressure-deformation features of the lung. Furthermore, the heterogeneous lung elasticity map presented in this study empowers new avenues to improve characterization of diseased states by enabling region-specific assessments of mechanical remodeling, such as variations in tissue elasticity, thus far critically absent in the field.",
