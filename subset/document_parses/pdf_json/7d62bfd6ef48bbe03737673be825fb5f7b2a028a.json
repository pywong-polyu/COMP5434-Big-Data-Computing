            "text": "COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has become a major issue in the U.S. as vaccine supply has outstripped demand and vaccination rates slow down. At least one recent global survey has sought to study the covariates of vaccine acceptance, but an inferential model that makes simultaneous use of several socio-demographic variables has been lacking. In this article, we present such a model using US-based survey data collected by Gallup. Our study agrees with the global survey results in some respects, but is also found to exhibit significant differences. For example, women and people aged between 25-54 were found to be more vaccine hesitant. Our conditional inference tree model suggests that trust in government, age and ethnicity are the most important covariates for predicting vaccine hesitancy, and can interact in ways that make them useful for communication-based outreach, especially if conjoined with census data. In particular, we found that the most vaccine hesitant individuals were those who identified as Black Republicans with a high school (or lower) education and lower income levels, who were involuntarily unemployed and trusted in the Trump administration.",

            "text": "COVID-19 vaccines were approved in late 2020 and early 2021 for public use in countries across the world. In May, President Biden announced his goal as getting at least 70% of Americans partially vaccinated against COVID-19 by early July at the latest. Current statistics indicate that this goal has not been achieved, not due to supply constraints, but rather, due to vaccine hesitancy among certain segments of the population. As shown in the latest news 1, 2 , 31% Americans are still hesitant about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. In order to speed up vaccination and reduce hesitancy, the use of material incentives and communication-based outreach are being explored. While laudable, for maximal effectiveness, we argue that such efforts need to carefully identify vaccine-hesitant subgroups in the U.S. and investigate the most important predictors of vaccine hesitancy. For such identification to be accurate and fine-grained, while still preserving privacy, it is important to understand the interaction and conditional effects between relevant socio-demographic correlates that are known to be important predictors 3 . An example of a conditional effect is captured in a (illustrative-only) statement such as 'People between 18-25 tend to be vaccine hesitant, but the hesitancy disappears if the education exceeds college level. ' Several studies have highlighted key factors associated with vaccine hesitancy in different countries, and considerable heterogeneity has been observed. Lazarus et al. 4 provided a global survey of COVID-vaccine acceptance, with the study suggesting that men were less likely to get vaccinated than women. People with higher incomes and education were also more vaccine accepting. However, research into vaccine hesitancy in the UK 5 suggested higher vaccine hesitancy among women, younger age groups and those with lower education levels. Minority groups, including Black individuals, were also found to be more hesitant. Similar results were shown for Portugal 6 , including individuals who had lost income during the pandemic and had lower confidence in the vaccine. In Arabic countries, researchers 7 reported that male respondents with higher educational levels, and those with histories of chronic disease, were more COVID-vaccine accepting.",

Some researchers have also focused on special groups of people, such as medical students 11 and healthcare workers 12 . Differences in ethnicity have been frequently mentioned in vaccine hesitancy research 9, 13 . In work resembling this study, multiple regression analyses have been used 9 to caution the government into paying more attention to vaccine hesitant groups, who (in the US, at least) are often minority groups who have had negative experiences with the healthcare system in the past, including African-Americans and Hispanics. Individuals with conservative political affiliations (including Republicans in the US), and those with children at home, have also been found to be vaccine hesitant.",

CITs embed tree-structured regression models into a well-defined theory of conditional inference procedures. This technique is suitable for non-parametric data (e.g., nominal and binary), including nominal variables with many levels (as are often observed with ethnicity and employment status variables in survey-based studies such as this one). The classification tree algorithm uses a unified unbiased splitting technique (called permutation-based significance tests 15 ) based on p-values for variable selection and pruning, making it more statistically robust than classification and regression trees (CARTs). Compared to logistic regression models, CITs provide us more interpretability and flexibility, while still maintaining high prediction accuracy.

These sentiments may have shifted since the new administration was elected, which a follow-up study could aim to quantify.",

The CIT, a non-parametric, unbiased recursive partitioning method, is an effective way to overcome the limitations of conventional regression methods, such as logistic regression. Our tree model achieved high classification accuracy ( 75.5%), and is parsimonious, as shown in Fig 1. As illustrated therein, the trust in the Trump administration, age, and ethnicity are the most important predictors. Only 34.9% participants had confidence that the Trump administration could successfully handle the pandemic. Again, consistent with OR shown in Table 1 , those that trust in the Trump administration are less likely to be vaccinated, and the younger female Trump supporters are the least likely to be vaccinated. However, older supporters with higher education or income responded more positively to the vaccine question.",

Men are predicted to be more accepting of the vaccine than women. A similar conclusion is also obtained for other ethnicities, but party, rather than gender, is a stronger predictor. Democratic participants were significantly different from others, since more than 85% stated that they would agree to be vaccinated. Independents and Republicans were less positive, and again, compared to the older age-group, younger Independents and Republicans were less likely to say 'yes' to the vaccine question. We also experimented with some subjective well-being variables in the CIT model, but they were not found to play significant roles in predicting vaccine acceptability.",

Similar to Asian nations' high vaccination acceptance shown in other work 4 , Asians in the U.S. are also the ethnic group most open to COVID-19 vaccination. There is also a relatively high tendency to accept among people with higher education and income. This is also consistent with global survey results 4 , but with one significant difference: people in the 25-64 age group are observed to be more vaccine accepting (compared to those aged 18-24), the vaccine acceptance of those aged 25-64 in our sample is smaller compared to younger people. Gender-specific differences are also observed: women tend to give positive responses to the vaccine question than men in the global study, while in our study, women responded less positively compared to men.",

To be specific, the value of the anchor choice in each survey question is set to 1 (for example 'White' in Race/Ethnicity and 'full-time' in Employment Status); values of all other choices for a given survey question are represented by their odds ratios when regressed against the corresponding anchor choice (for example, 0.74 for 'Hispanic' in Race/Ethnicity; see Table 1 ). The sum of these odds ratios for a given individual suggests that the higher the score, the higher the odds of the individual accepting COVID-19 vaccination. Based on this methodology and our data, we can compose profiles of those most, and least, willing to be vaccinated. The former profile (i.e., who have the highest sum of odds ratios) turns out to be a male Democrat, more than 65 years old, who has a postgraduate degree, holds a full-time job or is not in the labor force (e.g., retired), has over $240,000 annual household income, and did not trust in the Trump government.

We also find the top 3 profiles who are the least likely to be vaccinated (i.e., those who have the lowest sum of odds ratios). The profile with the least sum-of-odds-ratios is: a Black female Republican in the 25-54 age group, who has a part-time job with gross household income less than $60,000, and with less than a high school education. The next profile is the same as above, but the individual is White instead of Black. The third profile is the same as the first profile, except that the individual has a full-time job and is engaged in a technical, trade, vocational or business school or program after high school.",

Therefore, while not perfect, the odds-ratios score, in conjunction with the CIT, might be a useful tool for predicting how likely a respondent is to be vaccinated, and may help local, state and federal governments devise more effective communication and incentive strategies for meeting federal vaccination goals, which are currently falling short (at least, as of July).",
