The aforementioned considerations applied to outpatients who needed a diagnostic or interventional procedure in a hospitalbased facility (ie, only location available, specific equipment or expertise). In the early phase of the pandemic, there was an option to reschedule elective procedures, which transformed shortly, thereafter, into a mandate to eliminate these. Automated phone and electronic messaging was implemented indicating the need for rescheduling based on the COVID-19 circumstance. 3. Outpatient facilities. Personnel stationed at the main entrance of every outpatient facility interacted with patients, screening them for relevant symptoms. If the patient screen was negative, they were checked in and proceeded for their examination. When 1 or more questions were answered positively, patients were instructed to return home and contact the institutional call center or to proceed to the emergency department if they were experiencing more severe symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, chest pain). Later, during the pandemic, temperature checks were performed in all patients and personnel before entering any of our facilities.",

At the time of this writing, a substantial reduction in outpatient imaging visits was achieved (~60% in aggregate) and proved to be most challenging for oncology patients. \u2022 Prioritization of new imaging requests: As some outpatient clinics and telemedicine services continued to see patients during the pandemic, new imaging requests were anticipated. For requests placed by computerized provider order entry, a question was added that required the ordering provider to indicate medical necessity to prioritize scheduling of the imaging appointment within a shorter timeframe. Otherwise, studies were scheduled after a specified date, approximately 90 days after the onset of the pandemic in our region.",
