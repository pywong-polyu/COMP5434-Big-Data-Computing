A healthcare system may have access to many tests, but unless these are used and distributed as part of a coherent testing strategy, their value is limited.

However, using standard testing approaches, the time from swab to clinically actionable result could be well over 24 hours, especially in Hospitals without their own laboratory facilities (4) . Therefore it is unlikely that any molecular result would be available whilst the patient is in the Emergency Department (ED), a setting where this information could be of greatest value.

Additionally, radiographic imaging appears to be of value in reaching a diagnosis; in a study assessing over 1000 cases, CT scanning had a diagnostic sensitivity of 97% with a positive predictive value of 65% (6) . The role of the clinician is to consider the available variables and, alongside generating a differential diagnosis, determine the probability that a given patient has COVID-19.

In this scenario rapid molecular confirmation, negative or positive, adds little. There is a high pre-test probability and therefore a strong rationale for cohorting this patient alongside patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, even if a rapid molecular result were available and returned negative, the a priori odds are such that the post-test probability would still indicate a likely COVID diagnosis (Figure 1 ). Given a pre-test probability of 0.95, assuming a relatively conservative assay sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 98%, positive and negative results would alter the post-test probabilities to 0.99 and 0.85, respectively. Both outcomes are still indicative of a likely COVID-19 diagnosis, therefore a rapid molecular result in this context has limited clinical value.",

In a clinical scenario where there is equipoise, the pre-test probability is 0.5. In this situation there is an inherent difficulty in knowing how best to cohort the patient. If a POCT were available this could be of considerable benefit. Either outcome, positive or negative, notably alters the post-test probability in one direction or the other, allowing the clinician to make a more informed decision regarding cohorting and management (Figure 1 ). Assuming the same assay sensitivity and specificity as above, positive and negative results in this scenario adjusts the post-test probabilities to 0.97 and 0.23 respectively. This divergence in post-test probabilities may empower clinicians to accordingly adjust their management strategies indicating that, in this context, a rapid assay represents a clinically more useful test.",

For indeterminate cases, where there is greatest value from a molecular result, a rapid POCT could be deployed.
