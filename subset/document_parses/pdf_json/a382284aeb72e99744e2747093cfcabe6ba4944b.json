However, there are challenges to analyzing multicenter EHR data including privacy protection, large-scale computation, heterogeneity across sites, and correlated observations. In this paper, we propose a federated algorithm for generalized linear mixed models (Fed-GLMM), which can flexibly model multicenter longitudinal or correlated data while accounting for site-level heterogeneity. Fed-GLMM can be applied to both federated and centralized research networks to enable privacy-preserving data integration and improve computational efficiency. By communicating only a limited amount of summary statistics, Fed-GLMM can achieve nearly identical results as the gold-standard method where the GLMM is directly fitted on the pooled dataset. We demonstrate the performance of Fed-GLMM in both numerical experiments and an application to longitudinal EHR data from multiple healthcare facilities.",

With the increasing availability of EHR data among healthcare facilities [2] , integrating these data from multiple institutions has great potential for improving statistical power and generalizability of results [3] . Such integration is also particularly valuable -and often necessary -for studying rare conditions and underrepresented subpopulations [4] . As a consequence, an increasing number of large clinical research networks have been built domestically and internationally to facilitate multicenter EHR-based studies. For example, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute has launched PCORnet to support a national research collaborative that empowers large-scale comparative effectiveness research [5] . More recently, large collaborative consortia dedicated to investigating clinical and epidemiological questions about COVID-19 have also been formed [6, 7] , as timely observational studies based on large integrated EHR data have been increasingly critical for clinical and health policy decision-making in various areas such as treatment evaluation, diagnostic support and healthcare resource prioritization [8] [9] [10] .",

To overcome data sharing constraints due to privacy regulations and computational constraints, several data-sharing models are commonly used among multicenter research networks. Depending on whether the individual-level data are shared, a research network can be categorized them into either a federated or centralized network. A federated network keeps patient-level data within each institution, and only allows summary-level statistics to be shared across institutions. Some federated research networks allow automated queries, analysis and sharing summary statistics through application programming interfaces and cloud computing, which saves human labor from cross-institutional communication but may require additional safeguard of data breaches [12, 13] . Other federated networks rely on manually transferring summary statistics, which has less requirement on the infrastructure, and is considered more reliable for privacy protection. Thus, this practice is widely adopted among international research networks [6, 14, 15] . In federated networks, federated algorithms are needed to conduct joint analyses across multiple datasets without sharing patient-level data. In contrast, centralized networks managed to directly pool deidentified patient-level data across intuitions and store them in centralized data warehouses [16, 17] . When all data are pooled together, fitting a model to a pooled dataset (referred to as the pooled analysis hereafter) is feasible but may be subject to challenges from computational complexity and memory bottlenecks due to the large size of the pooled dataset. Therefore, in a centralized network, distributed algorithms are also needed to overcome computational challenges [18, 19] .",

However, EHR data are longitudinal and correlated in nature, where multiple medical encounters may be associated with the same patient, physician or facility. Therefore, in EHR-based analyses, methods to account for such multi-level longitudinal and correlated observations are necessary. Among many existing methods to address the multi-level correlated data structure, the generalized mixed model (GLMM) is one of the most widely applied methods with great flexibility [27, 28] . To fit GLMM federatively, one straightforward way is to fit separated models locally across sites and aggregate the local estimates through a meta-analysis [29] . Although meta-analysis is straightforward to implement in practice, it has been shown that its accuracy may be suboptimal, especially when rare conditions are included in the model [23] . More recently, a few methods have been developed which consider using site-level random effects to account for heterogeneity across sites. For example, Luo et al. proposed a lossless algorithm for the linear mixed model [30] , and a few methods have been proposed for GLMM [31] [32] [33] . However, these approaches only consider site-level random effects, which cannot handle repeated and correlated measures within each site. Methods are needed that allow flexible specification of random effects to account for longitudinal or correlated observations at lower levels.",

Our method can be implemented in both federated and centralized networks with different data-sharing constraints. Specifically, in a federated setting where the pooled analysis is not feasible, our method provides a privacy-preserving solution that only requires a small amount of aggregated data to be shared across sites. Our method requires limited numbers of communications across sites and thus can be applied to both the automated and manual federated settings. In a centralized setting where the pooled analysis is allowed, our method can greatly reduce the computation time and memory cost. In all settings, our method can achieve nearly identical results as the gold-standard pooled analysis estimator, allows flexible specification of random and fixed effects in models, and can account for heterogeneity in the distribution of data across sites. We demonstrate the utility of Fed-GLMM through a real-world EHR data analysis that assesses characteristics associated with virtual versus in-person care utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic, using data from 8 healthcare facilities in the New England area. While the development of Fed-GLMM is motivated by EHR data analysis, the method can be used to address correlated structure in many types of real-world datasets, including administrative claims, genetic and clinical trial datasets, thus helping inform a wide range of clinical and scientific questions. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint ",

Since our model has both common parameters across sites and site-specific parameters, each site is required to fit its own GLMM in the initialization step. The initial values for the site-specific parameters are set to their local estimates (denoted by\u03b4 k for the k-th site), while initial values for the common parameters are updated by a meta-analysis (denoted by\u03b2). With more accurate initial values, we can achieve the same level of estimation accuracy with fewer communications across sites. In step 2, each site calculates and broadcasts summary statistics s k and H k involving less than p 2 numbers (p is the number of parameters in the local model).

Different from the simulation study where we had only the patient-level random effects, physician-level random effects were also included, which added difficulties in terms of dividing data into subsets. If patients were nested within physicians, we could simply split the records by physicians. However, since multiple visits of the same patient can be associated with different physicians, a random division based on physicians is not the optimal splitting strategy as observations of the same patient would be split into different subsets. We proposed a clustering-based splitting method that splits physicians based on how many shared patients they have. Two physicians are more likely to be assigned to the same subsets if they share more patients. In this way, we can best preserve the correlation structure of the data, and therefore achieve better accuracy.

Our analysis was performed with R 4.0.2 on a Linux cluster with up to 512GB RAM per node at 1600MHz.",

Our method also enables fitting GLMM with much less computation time and memory cost in both federated and centralized networks, and thus can also be applied to EHR from a single site. Our simulation study has demonstrated that Fed-GLMM achieves nearly identical results to the pooled analysis with reduced computation time over a broad spectrum of settings. Our real-world data analysis demonstrated the feasibility of applying Fed-GLMM to single-site and multicenter EHR-based studies to fit a model with millions of observations. Compared to existing work, the most important contribution of Fed-GLMM is that it allows the modeling of longitudinal and correlated data within each institution and can accommodate all GLMM specifications, including crossed or nested random effects. However, when performing Fed-GLMM to improve computational efficiency through splitting large-scale data, one needs to be mindful of the data splitting strategy to generate accurate results for models with crossed or nested random effects. For nested random effects, splitting the data by the highest-level factors will allow Fed-GLMM estimates to converge to the gold-standard pooled analysis results. For crossed random effects, one should split the data such that the correlated observations are allocated to the same subsets as much as possible as shown in Supplementary Figure 2 . This makes the Fed-GLMM estimates close (though not identical) to the pooled analysis estimates.",

In most cases, only one round of parameter updating provides negligible bias. Thus, in federated research networks that rely on manual data transferring, our method with one round of iteration is preferred to reduce the communication cost. However, when multiple rounds of communication are feasible, with an increasing number of iterations, our method will eventually converge to the pooled analysis. When studying rare conditions, extra iterations help correct the bias, so a balance needs to be reached between the communication cost and estimation accuracy. In addition, the sharing of first-and second-order derivatives is common among federated algorithms but may still entail a risk of identifiability for small datasets with rare events. Nevertheless, this risk is limited in that the transmission of summary-level statistics is typically regulated and protected by the data-sharing protocols of collaborative research networks. Methods such as differential privacy and data encryption techniques can be combined with Fed-GLMM to improve privacy protection. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

These results are in contrast to a previous study investigating the same health system [34], which used a generalized linear model without accounting for the patient-and physician-level correlations. The different findings may be explained by distinct study periods and different levels of virtual care adoption over time, or may be explained by the different methodological approach we employed here. By including random effects, our analysis was better able to address correlations among visits within patients and physicians. While we have demonstrated Fed-GLMM for analyzing EHR data to assess virtual care utilization, the algorithm can be used in other types of datasets with correlated observations to investigate a variety of biomedical and epidemiological research questions.",
