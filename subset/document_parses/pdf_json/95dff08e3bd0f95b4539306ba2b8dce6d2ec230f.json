Methods This study analysed patient admitted with hip fractures with COVID positive swabs, between March and May'2020 in three large hospitals covering a population of nearly two million. Data was collected on demographic profile, peri-operative variables, post-operative complications and mortality. The specific aim was to identify any variables, which could predict high 30-day mortality. Results Overall, 12% of hip fractures were COVID positive with the mortality rate of 41.2%. The higher age (p = 0.036) and male gender (p = 0.025) was significantly associated with mortality and most of the deaths were between American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade 3 and 4 patients. The patients having intramedullary (IM) nailing were more likely to die (p = 0.02). There was no difference in laboratory parameters but there was significant difference in findings on chest radiographs (p < 0.001), post-operative oxygen requirements (p = 0.006) and early respiratory complications (p = 0.006). Conclusion This study suggests that the mortality following surgery for a hip fracture in COVID-positive patients is strikingly high and is associated with higher age and male gender. Higher mortality has been observed for extracapsular fracture operated with intramedullary nailing. In the immediate post-operative period, rapid deterioration of chest imaging, higher oxygen requirement and early pulmonary complications can serve as warning signs and predicting factors for higher mortality.",

To assess preoperative comorbid factors, we documented Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS) and Frailty score for all the hip fractures on admission. Patients were considered to be COVID-positive based on their quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 swab results as per standardized protocol using nasal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs. This study involved symptomatic patients only and local guidelines for targeted testing of symptomatic patients. However, due to variability of existing classification systems and wide inter-observer and intra-observer variations, symptomatic patients were not further classified into different grades. Patients were considered to stay in high infection risk zone (Red ward) and planned to be operated in designated 'COVID Theatre' based on either clinical or radiological findings initially if definitive test results were not available by that time. Clinical diagnosis consistent with COVID-19 infection was made by senior physicians and was based on clinical presentation of symptoms highly indicative of COVID-19 infection, including cough, fever, and myalgia [13] . Radiological diagnosis was based on thorax CT, in keeping with locally implemented protocols. However, all patients suspected with clinical or radiological criteria, subsequently had laboratory testing for COVID-19 infection immediately after admission and it was attempted that test results to be available before surgery. Although the patients were tested pre-operatively, their results were not consistently available before surgery. Initially due to lack of testing capacity, patient without any suspected clinical or radiological symptoms were not tested. However, patient with negative test results and with consistent suggestive clinical symptoms were retested up to third sample to clarify the laboratory diagnosis.",

Before the pandemic, as per the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD), the 30-day mortality after hip fracture surgery was recorded as 7.5% between 2011-2017 and 6.1% in 2018 [9] . The case-mixed-adjusted 30-day mortality for patients aged between 80-89 years as per NHFD annual report-2019 was under 10% [9] . In the same age distribution, we found that the COVID-positive patients with hip fractures were almost eight times more likely to die than their COVID-negative counterparts. The recorded mortality for COVID-positive hip fracture patients was 52.9% in New York city [10] and 30.4% in Spain [12] , but both these studies had limited number of patients.",

Although, these variables were higher in the patients who did not survive, none of these were statistically significant. It is quite possible that this is due to Type 2 error.

The exact reason for this remains unknown. We could have hypothesised that this might be related to the intramedullary procedure in the femoral canal causing a 'second hit' in patients who are already physiologically compromised. However, this is a multifactorial issue and type of implant is just one of the multiple factors. Management of every hip fracture in this situation were discussed in multidisciplinary meeting involving hip surgeons and decisions were taken considering local guidelines, logistics and expertise available. This study was mostly oriented on overall management of hip fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic to figure out any key factors in the practice which could have contributed to the outcome. The mortality rate following hip hemiarthroplasty in our study (28.6%) was comparable to 28% and 22% reported values by the New York COVID Hip Fracture Research Group [10] and LeBrun et al.

A multicentre Spanish study involving 136 hip fractures with 23 COVID-positive patients also reports similar finding (p = 0.666). It is possible that biochemical and metabolic insult from a hip fracture has acted as a confounder in this regard. Similarly, some studies have reported that deranged liver function tests might be predictor of higher mortality [18] for COVID-19 positive patients. Our study has also demonstrated higher values for key LFT parameters for the mortality group although this was not statistically significant. The evidence from pre-COVID-19 period has suggested that mean post-operative haemoglobin drop of 31.5 g/L for hip fractures might be detrimental [19] . However, we observed mean 14.9 g/L (SD 17.0) drop in post-operative haemoglobin level in the mortality group, which was statistically not significant (p = 0.337).",

            "text": "In conclusion, the mortality following surgery for a hip fracture in COVID-positive patients is strikingly high. This study observed higher mortality for extracapsular fractures operated with intramedullary nail. In the immediate postoperative period, rapid deterioration of chest imaging, higher oxygen requirement and early pulmonary complications can serve as warning signs and predicting factors for higher mortality.",
