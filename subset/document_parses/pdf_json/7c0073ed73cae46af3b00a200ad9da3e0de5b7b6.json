Our setting is a multi-period one, where the aim is to make a plan for allocating all of wealth among the n assets within a time horizon of m periods. In addition, the investor can rebalance the portfolio at the beginning of each period. We develop a model in Markowitz context, based on a fused lasso approach. According to it, both wealth and its variation across periods are penalized using the l 1 norm, so to produce sparse portfolios, with limited number of transactions. The model leads to a non-smooth constrained optimization problem, where the inequality constraints are aimed to guarantee at least a minimum level of expected wealth at each date. We solve it by using split Bregman method, that has proved to be efficient in the solution of this type of problems. Due to the additive structure of the objective function, the alternating split Bregman at each iteration yields to easier subproblems to be solved, which either admit closed form solutions or can be solved very quickly. Numerical results on data sets generated using real-world price values show the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

The l 1 penalty in (1) promotes sparse solutions, and the term L w 1 is included to produce smooth solutions. Problems described by fused lasso models arise, e.g., in image processing [2] , classification [3] , finance [4] . The nonsmoothness of the l 1 -type regularization terms precludes the use of standard descent methods for smooth objective functions. Problems of this kind can be solved either by smoothing the l 1 terms, e.g., [5, 6] , and applying optimization solvers for differentiable problems such as gradient methods [7] [8] [9] or by using directly optimization solvers for nondifferentiable problems, such as Bregman, proximal and ADMM methods [2, [10] [11] [12] . Due to the additive structure in (1) , splitting methods have became popular because they yield algorithms which consist at each iteration of subproblems that are easier to solve [13, 14] . These subproblems often either admit closed form solutions or can be solved very quickly with specialized methods. In this context, methods based on Split Bregman iteration have proved to be efficient in different fields [2, [15] [16] [17] . At each iteration of the Bregman method an l 1 regularized unconstrained optimization subproblem is solved. Auxiliary variables allow to separate the two l 1 regularization terms making the use of splitting methods an easy task. In the field of portfolio optimization, both in the static and the dynamic case, Bregman iteration has been used to solve efficiently l 1 regularized models in Markowitz's framework. The use of l 1 penalty terms in portfolio modelling has become popular for several reasons. Transaction costs are well described by the l 1 norm of the portfolio, especially in moderate size trades. The properties of this norm allow one to obtain sparse solutions, that is, small portfolios. Small portfolios are often considered preferable to large ones. They are feasible to small investors, for the reduced holding cost. Moreover, it seems that the estimation errors for variances and covariances are reduced in this case [18, 19] . Finally, it has been observed that the application of l 1 regularization has the effect of penalizing short positions [20, 21] , forbidden in several markets. The structure of Bregman iteration has been exploited both in the static and the dynamic case, to develop procedures which adaptively fix the value of the regularization parameter; this value is chosen as one that provides solutions with certain financial properties, while preserving fidelity to data [21, 22] .",

This seems to be very promising, since the fusion term is a penalty on portfolio turnover, which produces strategies with low transaction cost by preserving the pattern of active position over time. The fused lasso model is also considered in this paper. The novelty is the focus on strategies in which the investor can exit before the end without incurring severe loss; this is particularly significant to protect investment from financial market crisis. At this purpose, control at intermediate periods on wealth is introduced in the model. According to the multi-period approach, the so called rebalancing dates are defined to divide the investment period into subperiods; at these dates, the investment strategy is revised according to evolving information. We fix a minimum level of expected wealth at intermediate dates. From the mathematical point of view, this leads to a nonsmooth optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints. We reformulate the problem as one with equality constraints only and apply the alternating Split Bregman method for its solution. The resulting algorithm requires, at each iteration, the solution of unconstrained subproblems which are easily solved exactly.",

Moreover, we have observed that it penalizes negative components, thus resulting in a penalty on shorting [21, 22] . This turns out to be useful when short positions are not allowed, since one can obtain positive weights by properly tuning \u03c4 1 . The fusion term, that is the l 1 norm applied to the time variation w , has a smoothing effect on solution, preserving patterns of non-zero values across time. Its financial interpretation is a penalty on the portfolio turnover; it has then the effect of reducing transaction cost [4] . This term is weighted by \u03c4 2 > 0.

Figs. 1 and 2 show the values of wealth at rebalanging dates on datasets FTSE 100 and Dow Jones, but similar results are observed also for the other datasets. The first row of figures refers to dataset FTSE 100, compared with the naive strategy. The second row of the figure refers to dataset DowJones, compared with the index return. In Fig. 1 parameter \u03c4 2 has been set to 10 \u22123 while \u03c4 1 values range in the set { 10 \u22124 , 10 \u22123 , 10 \u22122 } from left to right. According to the analysis in [4] for both the datasets we have that increasing \u03c4 1 results in a reduction of the number of short positions, from 102 to 0 for FTSE 100 and from 30 to 0 for Dow Jones, and the number of transactions, from 15% to 9% for FTSE 100 and from the 23% to the 16% for Dow Jones. This is due to the reduced size of the portfolio, as result of the sparsification effect of regularization on portfolio wealth. Focusing on wealth, Fig. 1 shows that the excess return is penalized as \u03c4 1 increases. Indeed, our model outperforms the benchmark, showing an expected wealth higher than the one of the index, in almost all cases, but the difference is higher for smaller values of \u03c4 1 , while the gain in terms of cost reduction is valuable. All experiments exhibit a breakdown in the benchmark at the fourth year of the simulation period. This is probably due to the fact that t = 4 corresponds to year 2008, so the lower return can be ascribed to the Crisis. Thus, at this date the excess return of the optimal portfolio is higher, as effect of (18) .",

As already pointed out, financial targets of the investment and market conditions drive the choice of the regularization parameters. In the following tests \u03c4 1 is chosen as the smallest number that guarantees the minimum number of short positions. This is an important issue as in some cases stock market regulators can impose bans on short-selling like in the two European countries hardest hit by the Covid-19 in March 2020, Italy and Spain.
