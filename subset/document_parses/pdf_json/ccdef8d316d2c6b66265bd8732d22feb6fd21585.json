            "text": "Background. In the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, our center reported a mortality rate of 34% in a cohort of 32 lung transplant recipients with COVID-19 between March and May 2020. Since then, there has been evolving knowledge in prevention and treatments of COVID-19. To evaluate the impact of these changes, we describe the clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of a more recent cohort of lung transplant recipients during the second surge and provide a comparison with our first cohort. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included all consecutive lung transplant recipients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between November 2020 and February 28, 2021. We compared baseline demographics and major outcomes between the first-and second-surge cohorts. Results. We identified 47 lung transplant recipients (median age, 60; 51% female) who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between November 2020 and February 28, 2021. The current cohort had a higher proportion of patients with mild disease (34% versus 16%) and fewer patients with a history of obesity (4% versus 25%). Sixty-six percent (n = 31) required hospitalization and were treated with remdesivir (90%) and dexamethasone (84%). Among those hospitalized, 77% (n = 24) required supplemental oxygen, and 22% (n = 7) required invasive mechanical ventilation. The overall 90-d mortality decreased from 34% to 17% from the first cohort to the second (adjusted odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.85; P = 0.026). Conclusions. Although COVID-19-associated mortality rate in lung transplant recipients at our center has decreased over time, COVID-19 continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality.",

Coinciding with the larger national surge in the fall of 2020, our center once again began to identify new cases among lung transplant recipients in November of 2020.",

We then identified 47 consecutive lung transplant recipients with positive SARS-CoV-2 between November 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021, and described their clinical presentations, management, and outcomes in this report. It is worthwhile noting that our study period preceded the rise of Delta strain (B.1.617.2), which is currently the predominant variant in the United States and is associated with higher rates of transmission and severe disease. 1 In this second-surge cohort, we report an overall 90-d mortality rate of 17% in lung transplant recipients with COVID-19. As demonstrated in prior studies, severe COVID-19 with hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen, particularly among those requiring mechanical ventilation, was associated with increased mortality. 13, 14, 18 On the contrary, the subset of patients who did not develop hypoxemia had favorable outcomes with no mortality observed. As for the patients initially requiring low-level supplemental oxygen support, overall mortality was still quite low with no inpatient mortality and 1 patient who died after discharge. Our findings suggest that the development of hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygenation is an important prognostic marker of poor outcomes in lung transplant recipients.",

Over the course of the pandemic, COVID-19 demographics of our center evolved to include more patients with milder disease and fewer patients with severe disease. To attenuate the potential bias toward improved outcome from the higher number of mild COVID-19 patients in this cohort, we performed a logistic regression on only moderate-tosevere COVID-19 patients from both cohorts. The trend toward improved mortality in the second-surge cohort with higher severity of illness persisted. We suspect that earlier and improved access to healthcare resources and updated COVID-19 treatments may have contributed to improved mortality in this population. To our knowledge, we provide the first report on prolonged SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in lung transplant recipients. Similar findings were described in kidney transplant recipients with 1 study reporting a kidney transplant recipient with a persistently positive nasal SARS-CoV-2 PCR at >66 d from symptom onset despite clinical recovery, 32 and another reported 25% of its kidney transplant recipient cohort with persistently positive respiratory PCR at day 30 after symptom onset. 33 Whether prolonged respiratory viral shedding also signifies a prolonged viral transmission window in lung transplant recipients with COVID-19 remains unknown. Furthermore, the clinical correlation of a prolonged positive respiratory tract viral PCR to quantitative viral load, cycle threshold, and viral cell culture in this immunocompromised population remains to be studied.",
