            "text": "The lack of medication to suppress coronavirus infections is a main reason for the dramatic course of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to identify suitable coronavirus drug targets and corresponding lead molecules. Here we describe the discovery of a class of coronavirus inhibitors acting on nsp15, a hexameric protein component of the viral replication-transcription complexes, endowed with immune evasion-associated endoribonuclease activity. SAR exploration of these 1,2,3-triazolo fused betulonic acid derivatives yielded lead molecule 5h as a strong inhibitor (antiviral EC 50: 0.6 \u00b5M) of human coronavirus 229E replication. An nsp15 endoribonuclease active site mutant virus was markedly less sensitive to 5h, and selected resistance to the compound mapped to mutations in the N-terminal part of nsp15, at an interface between two nsp15 monomers. The biological findings were substantiated by the nsp15 binding mode for 5h, predicted by docking. Hence, besides delivering a distinct class of inhibitors, our study revealed a druggable pocket in the nsp15 hexamer with relevance for anti-coronavirus drug development.",

Within a period of ~20 years, SARS-CoV-2 is the third zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) to enter the human species, coming after SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). 1 Besides, four human CoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, -HKU1, -NL63, and -OC43) are endemic in the population and account each year for 15 to 30% of common colds. 2 These can evolve into life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections in elderly, children and persons at risk. 3, 4 Finally, the Coronaviridae family contains several species causing serious disease in pets and livestock. 5 Most young persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience no or only mild symptoms of respiratory illness. 6 In contrast, in persons with comorbidities or higher age, the viral replication phase is typically followed by a second phase that is characterized by hyperinflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. 7 Hence, management of COVID-19 most likely requires antiviral drugs to suppress initial virus replication, plus anti-inflammatory medication, like corticosteroids, to treat severe cases. 8 Several CoV proteins may be suitable drug targets, 9, 10 but, at the moment, only two drug classes are far advanced in clinical testing, i.e. antispike antibodies 11 and the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, which inhibits the CoV polymerase. The concept to inhibit nsp15 is thus unique, since it combines a direct antiviral effect with the potential to revert viral evasion from host cell immunity.",

Betulonic acid bears a pentacyclic triterpenoid core, present in a wide variety of agents with potential pharmacological use, [26] [27] [28] like the HIV maturation inhibitor bevirimat. 29, 30 We decided to fuse betulonic acid with a 1,2,3-triazole moiety, which has the unique property to both accept and donate hydrogen bonds. [31] [32] [33] [34] These derivatives were synthesized by our recently developed and convenient \"triazolization\" method to prepare 1,2,3-triazoles from primary amines and ketones. [35] [36] [37] [38] First, Jones oxidation was performed to convert betulin 1 into betulonic acid 2 (Scheme 1). 39 Betulin 1, a natural compound isolated from the bark of Betula species, is commercially available. [40] [41] [42] Next, the triazolization method was applied to betulonic acid 2 as the ketone source, using primary amines 3 and 4nitrophenyl azide 4, and the previously reported reaction conditions. 13 This yielded a series of sixteen 1,2,3-triazolo fused betulonic acids 5, most of which were isolated at high yield (~80%; Table 1 ). Diverse primary amines 3 were attached to the 1,2,3-triazole ring to introduce a variety of aromatic or aliphatic moieties. We next evaluated the compounds in cell-based assays with diverse DNA-and RNA-viruses, and observed strong activity in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast cells infected with HCoV-229E.",

The MTS assay was also used to quantify compound cytotoxicity (expressed as the CC50 value) in mock-infected cells. Whereas the starting compounds betulin 1 and betulonic acid 2 were virtually inactive, all 1,2,3-triazolo fused betulonic acid derivatives proved to be highly effective CoV inhibitors ( Table 1) . The one exception was 5i (EC50 value: 13 \u00b5M), which bears a non-aromatic cyclohexanemethyl substituent. Apparently, introducing this bulky group caused a considerable reduction in antiviral activity and selectivity. Several compounds in the series had EC50 values below 1 \u00b5M, which makes them superior to two known CoV inhibitors which we used as reference compounds, i.e. K22 43 and GS-441524, the nucleoside form of remdesivir. 14 Three analogues stood out for having superior selectivity, i.e. 5n, 5g and 5h, having a selectivity index (ratio of CC50 to EC50) of 27, 31 and 76, respectively. The capacity of 5h to fully suppress HCoV-229E replication at non-toxic concentrations is evident from the microscopic images in Fig. 1A and the dose-response curves in Fig. 1B . Also, 5h fully prevented the formation of dsRNA intermediates of CoV RNA synthesis, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining of dsRNA in HCoV-229E-infected human bronchial epithelial 16HBE cells (Fig. 1C) . To conduct a SAR exploration around lead compound 5h (Scheme 2 and Table 2 ), we first investigated the contribution of the \u03b1-methyl-phenylene moiety. Compound 5q, in which this entire moiety is missing, had ~6-fold lower antiviral activity than 5h. When only the \u03b1-methyl was missing (5r), the activity was not affected. Compound 5s, which is the epimer at the 1,2,3-triazole substituent, displayed almost the same EC50 value as 5h, indicating that isomerism does not alter the activity. Cytotoxicity was however slightly decreased, resulting in an even better selectivity index (\u2265 90) than that of 5h. In order to elucidate the role of the isopropenyl side chain, we reduced 10 this moiety by hydrogenation, yielding compound 5t which was 10-to 20-fold less active.",

By using a pocket-detection protocol implemented on the Site Analysis of the nsp15 sequence similarity between HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2 showed that a few residues in the pocket are not conserved. This explains why docking 5h into the SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 hexamer was unable to identify a similar pose within the top solutions. The largest influence seems attributed to the residue at position 244/245, since substituting Thr245 (present in HCoV-229E) by Gln244 (the corresponding residue in SARS-CoV-2) abrogates a hydrogenbond interaction with the 1,2,3-triazole group of 5h (Fig. 5) . Additionally, the loop between Val/Ile63 and Leu/Pro65 has a slightly different orientation in these two CoV nsp15 proteins. Both factors may explain why 5h is active against HCoV-229E, but not SARS-CoV-2. Still, most of the pocket residues are conserved, underscoring the relevance of this nsp15 interface pocket for drug design. The role of this protein region in forming inter-monomer interactions is evident from reports that nsp15 exists as a monomer when key interactions in this region (i.e. Arg61-Glu266 in SARS-CoV nsp15 and Tyr58-Glu263 in MERS-CoV nsp15) are eliminated by mutation. 19, 47 When nsp15 is unable to hexamerize, the EndoU catalytic site undergoes important structural changes that abolish RNA binding and enzymatic activity. 48 To conclude, the nsp15 binding mode of 5h, predicted by docking, nicely accords with the biological findings. Namely, the binding model rationalizes the requirement of the 1,2,3-triazolo function and carboxylate substituent; 5h resistance of the nsp15-K60R, -T66I and -H250A mutant viruses; and lack of activity against SARS-CoV-2.",

This provides an excellent basis to modify the substituents or betulonic acid scaffold, and expand the activity spectrum beyond HCoV-229E.

            "text": "expanded.A time-of-addition experiment indicated that 5h acts post-entry at an early stage in viral RNA synthesis, since the molecule started to have reduced activity when added at 6 h p.i.(Fig. 2). For comparison, the action point of the entry inhibitor bafilomycin, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification, was situated before 2 h p.i. K22 was still effective when added as late as 8 h p.i. ThisCoV inhibitor targets nsp6-dependent anchorage of the viral replication-transcription complexes 12 (RTCs) to host cell-derived double-membrane vesicles. 5h acts post-entry at an early stage in viral RNA synthesis. Compound addition was delayed until different time points after infecting HEL cells with HCoV-229E, and viral RNA was quantified at 16 h p.i.Compound concentrations: bafilomycin 6.3 nM; 5h and K22: 15 \u00b5M. The Y-axis shows the viral RNA copy number relative to the virus control (mean \u00b1 SEM of two independent experiments).Next, we performed two independent virus passaging experiments to select 5h-resistant viruses and identify the viral target. After three cell culture passages under increasing concentrations (up to 40 \u00b5M) of 5h, HCoV-229E acquired resistance. Whole virus genome sequencing revealed that this was attributed to two substitutions in nsp15, K60R (first selection) and T66I (second selection), located in the N-terminal part of this protein. For both mutants, 5h exhibited an antiviral EC99 value (= concentration producing 100-fold reduction in virus yield) of >40 \u00b5M, which is at least 14-fold higher than the EC99 value of 2.9 \u00b5M measured for wild-type virus(Fig. 3A). Both mutant viruses remained fully sensitive to GS-441524. The conclusion that 5h targets nsp15 was corroborated by determining its activity against a reverse-engineered EndoU-deficient H250A-mutant HCoV-229E, which lacks the catalytic His250 residue in the EndoU active site. 22 5h proved dramatically less active against this mutant(Fig. 3B), producing a maximal reduction in virus yield of 23-fold compared to 1479-fold for wild-type (WT) virus. Again, GS-441524 proved equally active against 13 nsp15-mutant and wild-type virus. To conclude, we established 5h as an inhibitor of nsp15, and showed that its activity is linked to residues Lys60 and Thr66 in the N-terminal part, plus His250 in the EndoU catalytic site of nsp15. This inhibition of nsp15 accords with the time-of-addition profile of 5h (see above), showing that the compound interferes with an early stage in viral RNA synthesis.",

Next, ligand 5h was placed inside the pocket and docked by using both MOE and GOLD softwares and the common top scoring binding mode was further analyzed.20 This docked result indicates that the carboxylic acid of 5h forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone of residues Cys294 and Thr295(Fig. 4B). The importance of this interaction is supported by the observation that 5u, the 5h analogue bearing a methyl instead of carboxylic acid group, lacks antiviral activity. Furthermore, the 1,2,3-triazole group of 5h engages in hydrogenbonding interactions with Thr245, explaining why the parent compounds 1 and 2 are not active against HCoV-229E. At the other side of the pocket, the aromatic ring of 5h makes hydrophobic contacts with Val63 and Leu65. This may explain why nearby mutations K60R and T66I yield resistance to the compound, since these substitutions may negatively affect the interactions of Val63 and Leu65, or disturb the conformation of the loop flanked by both residues.",
