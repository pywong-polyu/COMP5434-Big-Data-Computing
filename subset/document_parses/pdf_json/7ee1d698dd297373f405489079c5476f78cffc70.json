On March 19, 2020, hydroxychloroquine was publicly endorsed as a treatment for COVID-19 during a US Presidential press briefing. 1 This recommendation was based only on limited pre-clinical studies, media reports, and a small non-randomized study without clinical or safety outcomes. 2, 3 Hydroxychloroquine is currently indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Given that hydroxychloroquine is not currently approved or licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of COVID-19, it is unknown whether the Administration's endorsement of this medication affected prescribing practice.",

The US Presidential press conference endorsing hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 occurred on March 19, 2020. 1 We investigated the number of outpatient prescriptions per week in the period of 9 weeks prior to and 4 weeks after the announcement. To control for possible seasonal trends, we analyzed the same time period in 2019. We used a difference in differences (DID) approach, estimated using a Poisson generalized linear model, to estimate multiplicative changes in the mean weekly number of prescriptions before and after March 19 in 2019 and 2020, as well as the multiplicative difference in the pre-to post-March 19 change, comparing the 2 years. This \"difference in differences\" represents the excess increase observed after the Presidential announcement in 2020 after accounting for seasonal trends based on the change observed in 2019. Analyses were conducted using R, version 3.6.3. The Institutional Review Board of both the University of Pennsylvania and Yale determined that this study did not constitute human subjects research as it uses only de-identified, aggregate data, and therefore did not require review.",

Given growing public interest in identifying safe and effective therapies for COVID-19, 4 the US Administration's response to emerging data and its impact on drug prescribing patterns is important. Preliminary studies to date featuring hydroxychloroquine in combination with adjunctive agents for severe COVID-19 report it does not appear effective and may even be harmful. 5 Indeed, off-label hydroxychloroquine prescribing is expected to contribute to supply chain shortages for approved chronic use during the pandemic. 2 Furthermore, the issuance of the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization for hydroxychloroquine, which permits distribution of the drug from the national stockpile for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was widely misinterpreted as an FDA approval for this indication. 4 This study suggests that Presidential endorsements can influence prescription practices, even in the absence of high-quality evidence or US FDA approval for the given indication. Limitations include the indication for hydroxychloroquine treatment (COVID-19, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis) or other clinical information on patients receiving treatment was not ascertained; and other factors, including the release of positive results from a preprinted study on March 16, 2020, 3 as well as more patients being diagnosed with COVID-19 during this period, may have contributed to the observed trends. Strengths of this study include the use of the difference in differences design to account for temporal trends in prescribing, which were uncontrolled for in a prior report published in the lay press. 6 Further studies will be needed to determine the effect of increased hydroxychloroquine use on patient outcomes.
