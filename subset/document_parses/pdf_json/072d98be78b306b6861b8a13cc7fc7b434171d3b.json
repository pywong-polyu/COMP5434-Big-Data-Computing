            "text": "The statistical methods used to analyze medical data are becoming increasingly complex. Novel statistical methods increasingly rely on simulation studies to assess their validity. Such assessments typically appear in statistical or computational journals, and the methodology is later introduced to the medical community through tutorials. This can be problematic if applied researchers use the methodologies in settings that have not been evaluated. In this paper, we explore a case study of one such method that has become popular in the analysis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data. The integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), as implemented in the R-INLA package, approximates the marginal posterior distributions of target parameters that would have been obtained from a fully Bayesian analysis. We seek to answer an important question: Does existing research on the accuracy of INLA's approximations support how researchers are currently using it to analyze COVID-19 data? We identify three limitations to work assessing INLA's accuracy: 1) inconsistent definitions of accuracy, 2) a lack of studies validating how researchers are actually using INLA, and 3) a lack of research into * Corresponding author: kkhan@iastate.edu 1 arXiv:2111.01285v1 [stat.AP] 1 Nov 2021 the reproducibility of INLA's output. We explore the practical impact of each limitation with simulation studies based on models and data used in COVID-19 research. Our results suggest existing methods of assessing the accuracy of the INLA technique may not support how COVID-19 researchers are using it. Guided in part by our results, we offer a proposed set of minimum guidelines for researchers using statistical methodologies primarily validated through simulation studies.",

As new variants of the virus emerge, it is important that changes in the results of statistical analyses are due to changes in the virus. In medical and epidemiological research, COVID-19 data are often analyzed with disease mapping models. Historically, a fully Bayesian approach has been one of the most popular methods of analysis for such models, particularly when the data has spatio-temporal features 1;2;3;4 . However, employing a Bayesian analysis in this context can be a computationally expensive and timeintensive effort 5;6 .

Analyses conducted with the R-INLA package are often referred to as Bayesian approaches in the epidemiological and medical literature. Technically, however, the INLA method is an approximation of a Bayesian approach. More specifically, for a class of latent Gaussian models, INLA is designed to approximate the marginal posterior distributions that would have been obtained from a Bayesian analysis employing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods 17 . R-INLA's explosion in popularity predates the pandemic (for a non-exhaustive list of its use in a variety of applications, see pages 396-397 in Rue et al. 18 ). Anyone who has used both MCMC and R-INLA to analyze data can understand the appeal of R-INLA: It is very fast. Until recently, research using the R-INLA primarily appeared in journals focusing on computing or new statistical methodologies. Such work, while very valuable, is typically a step away from directly shaping policy decisions. The growing popularity of the R-INLA package in COVID-19 research is a shift to a setting where the results can directly shape the medical communities policy decisions. As new variants of the virus are emerging, a natural question emerges: Are the analyses conducted with R-INLA providing us with accurate and reproducible results?",

The most common method of comparing the output of INLA to the output of MCMC is the use of plots. In particular, a histogram of the sample obtained from a parameter's marginal posterior distribution from the MCMC method is overlaid with a density plot of the corresponding marginal posterior distribution obtained from the INLA method 6;17 . Another common method is to compute how close the marginal posterior means and variances from INLA are to the corresponding estimates from MCMC. In the second category, accuracy is related to whether the estimates from INLA or MCMC are closer to the \"truth\" (the value used to generate data in a simulation study) 28;17;29 .

The first limitation stems from the inconsistent measures of accuracy. To our knowledge, no one has simultaneously compared the output from INLA to the output from MCMC and to the generating value in a simulation study. In other words, we do not know whether the cases in which INLA failed to approximate the results from MCMC well are the same cases in which INLA failed to approximate the generating value well. The ambiguity in these definitions could mean that the same output from INLA could lead to inconsistent conclusions regarding accuracy.

Many of the summaries of INLA's accuracy, in particular the ones that depend on the plots, will give little indication of how well INLA approximates the characteristics of such tail behavior. More broadly, researchers typically do not rely on marginal posterior distributions alone for inference. For example, researchers commonly use functions of parameters (requiring the summary of a transformation of the marginal posterior distributions) or various model selection criteria. With a few exceptions, such as Held et al. 27 , INLA's ability to calculate these transformations or criteria are often not assessed in peer-reviewed literature.",

Carroll et al. 28 had previously noted that the default settings in INLA resulted in poor inference for \u03c4 in a similar simulation study, as well. Our results shed some light onto the potential factors driving this poor performance. The boxplots we have previously displayed are not meaningful given the extreme outliers. Instead, Table 1 summarizes the first three quantiles and the maximum values of estimates for \u03c4 (represented by E(\u03c4 |y) for each method) from INLA and MCMC. INLA would occasionally estimate it well but had very extreme outliers for some datasets; whereas MCMC appeared to consistently overestimate \u03c4 . The MCMC performance suggests that the default priors in INLA are driving some of the poor performance. However, we note that for 41 of the 96 (43%) datasets, |PE(\u03c4 )| > 30, and for most of these datasets, INLA provided better estimates of \u03c4 than MCMC did. Therefore, it seems that something beyond the choice of priors was influencing INLA's performance. We were not able to identify any characteristics of the data that could help explain the more extreme values for P E or the P C's calculated, or when INLA/MCMC would yield estimates closer to the generating value. Our exploration was hindered, in part, by the fact that INLA has no diagnostics about how well (or poorly) the model fit (in a computational sense). This limitation seems to have been acknowledged in Fong et al. 24 , but has not been subsequently addressed to our knowledge. As an aside, in our explorations, we discovered that INLA would give estimates about the marginal posterior distributions for \u03b2 x , \u03c3, and \u03c4 even if the marginal posterior distributions were not proper. For example, we fit a BYM model with an intercept and did not enforce a sum-to-zero constraint. The MCMC analysis resulted in trace plots that diverged, indicating nonconvergence. The INLA output simply gave us estimates in line with those obtained in the rest of our simulation study results.",

For the BYM model, unlike the Poisson regression model, both the version of INLA and the operating system could lead to drastically different results. For example, the same code for a BYM model including an intercept and a sum-to-zero constraint in INLA resulted in estimates of the intercept coefficient that differed by over 10 3 .

The number of datasets INLA failed to fit did not vary widely (INLA failed to fit a maximum of 6 datasets). For the most part, estimates of \u03b2 x were somewhat stable. However, the estimates related to \u03c3 and \u03c4 could be radically different. For example, on different operating systems, analyses run on the same version of INLA could result in estimates of E(\u03c4 |y) that differed by over 10 5 .

In Fig. 6 , we considered the distributions of this quantity based on whether an incorrect or correct selection was made by each method. Recall that in Section 3.1, INLA seemed to approximate the output from MCMC quite well for the Poisson regression model. However, in Section 3.2, we found that INLA was not as reliable in approximating the output from MCMC for the BYM model. Surprisingly, here, we found a reverse of this pattern for the calculation of the WAIC. INLA did not do a particularly good job at approximating the WAIC that was obtained by MCMC for the Poisson regression model. Instead, the WAIC calculated by INLA was systematically inflated compared to the WAIC calculated from the MCMC method. However, for the BYM model, which was misspecified for these datasets, the WAIC from INLA tended to match the WAIC from MCMC. We again considered the difference in WAIC calculated, i.e., WAIC IN LA \u2212 WAIC M CM C based on the model selection made by each method. In Fig. 7 , we note that, compared to the WAIC computed by MCMC, INLA systematically inflated the WAIC for Poisson models for all 4 scenarios. Unlike in Fig. 6 , however, the WAIC from INLA did not match the WAIC from MCMC for the BYM model. Instead, it too tended to be inflated.

Instead, INLA's approximations have largely been evaluated with illustrative examples and case studies. The measures of accuracy used in these settings have not been consistent. Furthermore, many applied researchers use INLA in ways which are not supported by existing methods of assessing the accuracy of INLA's approximations. Finally, despite the fact that INLA is primarily validated by using the R-INLA package to analyze case studies, there do not appear to have been previous attempts to assess the reproducibility of analyses conducted with INLA. We explored each of these limitations with simulation studies and an attempt to reproduce the results of peer-reviewed article.

Because the estimates for \u03c4 included such large outliers, we restrict our attention to \u03b2 x and \u03c3 for a more meaningful discussion. Recall, there are currently two categories of accuracy measures in papers assessing INLA: comparison of INLA results to MCMC results (PE(\u00b7) for us) and comparisons of MCMC/INLA to a generating value (PC IN LA (\u00b7) and PC M CM C (\u00b7) for us). For each parameter, we begin by restricting our attention to datasets for which INLA did not well approximate the results from MCMC.For datasets for which |PE(\u03b2 x )| > 30,Fig. 5(a) plotted the PC MCMC (\u03b2 x ) against the PC INLA (\u03b2 x ). Similarly, for datasets for which |PE(\u03c3)| > 30,Fig. 5(b) plotted the PC MCMC (\u03c3) against the PC INLA (\u03c3). If the two categories of accuracy yielded consistent results, then we would expect to see all the points on these plots well away from the origin. However, for both \u03c3 and \u03b2 x , there were a couple of points near the origin. Interestingly, for the majority of the datasets for which INLA and MCMC had very different estimates, INLA tended to produce results closer to the generating value. Thus, with respect to Question 1, we found that comparisons of MCMC output to INLA output and comparisons of INLA/MCMC output to the generating value can lead to very different conclusions at times.",

Spatial Data INLA successfully fit the Poisson model for all 100 of the spatial datasets, and it successfully fit the BYM model for 96 datasets. Thus, all comparisons between INLA and MCMC involved only 96 datasets. For the 96 datasets it successfully fit, INLA selected the correct model for 40 (42%) of them. For the 100 datasets successfully fit with MCMC, MCMC selected the correct model for 40 (40%) of them. As before, we compared the WAIC obtained from the Poisson model and the BYM for the 96 datasets. INLA selected the same model as MCMC for 51 (53%) of the datasets. However, of these 51 datasets, the selection was correct only 16 times.
