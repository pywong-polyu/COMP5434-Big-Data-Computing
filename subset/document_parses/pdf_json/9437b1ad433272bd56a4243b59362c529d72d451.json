The relevant debates, however, use a great diversity of concepts to describe the extent of international economic integration: terms like 'trade openness', 'economic integration', 'trade liberalization' and 'globalization' are widely used when the general increase in economic openness during the last decades is addressed. The same observation holds true for the financial dimension, where terms like 'financial openness', 'financial integration' and 'financial globalization' are used regularly and often interchangeably (e.g., Kose et al. 2009; De Nicolo and Juvenal 2014; Saadma and Steiner 2016) .",

            "text": "In analogy to this variety of terms and concepts, a large variety of measures of economic openness have been developed. These measures typically emphasize different aspects of economic integration. As a consequence, not only the definition, but also the measurement of openness has varied considerably over the past three decades and a corresponding lack of consensus on how to best measure economic openness has been widely acknowledged (e.g. Yanikkaya 2003; Squalli and Wilson 2011; Busse and Koeniger 2012; Huchet-Bourdon et al. 2017; Egger et al. 2019) . At the same time, many econometric studies discount the underlying debate on the measurement of economic openness by simply employing the most popular measures without any in-depth explanations or justifications for doing so. Against this backdrop, this paper contributes to the literature by providing a systematic collection, categorization and evaluation of the most prominent openness indicators used in the relevant literature. The main purpose of our work is threefold: first, we provide applied researchers with relevant information to make an informed choice on the use of different openness indicators, which eventually depends on the specific questions and methods employed in their empirical work. Second, we highlight the practical implications of choosing some openness indicator by showing how empirical outcomes change when different openness indicators are used. Third, we compile a data set on openness indicators to be used in further research, where the data are based on 216 countries over the time period 1960-2019, although coverage for individual openness variables varies widely in the country and time dimension. Researcher can access this data set via an openly available R package through which we are able to provide regular updates of the data discussed in this paper, including references to all the primary sources for the relevant indicators. 1 .",

Second, we restrict ourselves to direct measures of economic openness. As a consequence, we exclude instrumental variables that are sometimes developed to deal with endogeneity problems and to estimate causal effects of openness indicators on outcome measures such as economic growth, 2 as well as indicators based on extensive models of domestic economies (e.g. Waugh and Ravikumar 2016) .

Thus, a general assessment of such instruments seems difficult to undertake. Second, direct openness measures as discussed below are not only a prerequisite for instrument design, but also predominant in most of the applied literature (e.g. Dreher et al. 2010; Martens et al. 2015; Potrafke 2015) .",

            "text": "De facto measures are outcome-oriented indicators, reflecting a country's actual degree of integration into the world economy. De-jure measures, on the other hand, are based upon an evaluation of a country's legal framework: they reflect a country's willingness to be open as expressed by the prevailing regulatory environment. Typically, de-jure measures on trade are based on tariff rates (such as duties and surcharges), information on non-tariff trade barriers (such as licensing rules and quotas) or tax revenues emerging from trade activities relative to GDP. Financial dejure measures indicate the extent to which a country imposes legal restrictions on its cross-border capital transactions. As de-jure indicators evaluate a country's regulatory environment, it is important to keep in mind that this environment is influenced not only by national policies; they are also shaped by the impact of supranational institutions like the European Union or the World Trade Organization. The above construction and interpretation of the two main types of indicators, de-facto and de-jure, reveals that these types do indeed measure different facets of openness, which need not be consistent for a given country. For instance, a country could have a defensive legal stance in terms of openness, but still play an important role in the world trading system e.g. due to its special position as a trade hub (e.g. China) or as a financial hub (e.g. Malta). At the same time, a country may be open to trade in terms of institutions and policy, but nonetheless lag behind in terms of its real integration in international trade due its geographic remoteness (e.g. Canada) or technological inferiority (e.g. Uganda). 3 Hence, implications drawn from de-jure indicators can differ strongly from those derived from de-facto indicators as the former are mostly based on a single, yet prominent, factor in shaping actual economic integration-a country's regulatory environment, while de-facto indicators are focused on overall outcomes. Thus, they capture the total impact of a series of different factors, such as the level of technology, geographical location, the existence of natural resources, legal regulations and tax policies, political and historical relationships, multi-and bilateral agreements or the quality of institutions. Therefore, de-facto measures can be seen as capturing the overall impact of all relevant factors without any ambition to delineate their relative contribution to the chosen outcome dimension. It is for these reasons that any \"combined measure\" (Table 1) has to be received with great care as it lumps together two qualitatively different approaches towards economic openness and can, hence, lead to ambiguous results with unclear interpretations (Martens et al. 2015) .",

As a consequence, strong domestic economies, which also happen to be major players in international trade (like the U.S., Japan, Germany or China), find themselves at the lower end of any country-ranking composed out of Trade/ GDP. Second, it is not entirely clear what Trade/GDP is actually measuring. Various alternatives to the label 'trade openness', such as trade dependency ratio, trade openness index, trade share or trade ratio, have been suggested. More recently, Fuji (2019) has discussed this question in greater detail. By comparing values for Trade/ GDP for international and intra-Japanese trade data on the prefecture-level, he finds that Trade/GDP measures most of all the extent of spatial economic remoteness and the idiosyncrasy in sectoral production distributions. He also finds that on the international level, much of the variation of the measure goes back to variation in GDP, rather than the trade flows. And indeed, because of the normalization by GDP the Trade/GDP measure also captures cyclical swings of economies. 4 For instance, the financial crisis in 2008/09 made several countries look 'more open' in terms of Trade/GDP, simply because of the disproportionate effect of the crisis on GDP.",

Additional strategies for addressing this size-bias include the incorporation of an inversed Herfindahl-Index of the relative shares of all trading partners (to account for the diversity of exchange relations) or regression-based strategies where Trade/GDP is first regressed on a series of demographical and geographical variables and only the residuals of these regressions are interpreted as a measure for 'net openness' conditional on some country characteristics (Lockwood 2004 , Vujakovic 2010 . Whether such corrective measures are appropriate eventually depends on one's research question and empirical setup. Alternatively, the size-bias of Trade/GDP can be addressed by substituting the Trade/GDP variable with one of the alternatives listed above or by adding additional regressors aiming to control for country size. But it is also evident that every alternative normalization strategy comes with its own problems, which is why the 'best' de-facto measure of trade openness depends on the particular question at hand. In this context, Trade/Population could also be an alternative to Trade/GDP that aims to correct only for country size, but not for average income. However, this final alternative has hardly been employed in the applied economics literature so far.",

Thus, our indicator is easy to replicate and available for 159 countries over the period 1988 to 2018. We calculate the index as 100 minus the average of (1) the effectively applied tariff rates and (2) the weighted average of the most-favored nation tariff rates. The resulting index is strongly correlated with the measure of Jaumotte (with a Pearson coefficient of 0.78 for the joint data points) and, thus, preserves the methodological advantages of the original indicator, while at the same time providing a remedy for its drawbacks in terms of coverage and replicability.",

It is now typically referred to as the \"financial openness index\" and defined as the volume of a country's foreign assets and liabilities relative to GDP (Baltagi et al. 2009 ). The Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (henceforth LMF) database is publicly available 5 and currently contains data for 203 countries for the period 1970-2015. The LMF database is considered the most comprehensive source of information in terms of financial capital stocks. In addition to the financial openness index, this dataset also contains three more specific indicators focusing on FDI and equity markets that have been widely applied in empirical analyses. A comparable set of indicators on FDI can also be obtained from UNCTAD 6 (see Table 5 ). It is worth mentioning that these indicators are often normalized by GDP and are, therefore, subject to the same criticisms as the de-facto trade openness measures discussed in Sect. 2.1 (see also Gygli et al. 2019) . They are, however, also available in absolute dollar amounts. Saadma and Steiner (2016) build on the data provided by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti to create an index for private financial openness (OPEN_pv), which can be seen as further development of the financial openness index. It distinguishes between private and state-led financial openness by subtracting development aid (DA) from foreign liabilities (FL) and international reserves (IR) from foreign assets (FA). The motivation of Saadma and Steiner (2016) is to show that correlations between growth and financial openness lead to less ambiguous results when the factors underlying actual capital flows are accounted for in the data.",

Table-based indicators provide comprised data and come with the advantage that they are relatively easy to replicate.

The index is based on information about the restrictions on cross-border financial transactions, as provided in the summary tables of the IMF AREAER report Ito 2006, 2008) . To compose the index, Chinn and Ito (2008) codify binary variables for the four major categories reported in the AREAR, i.e., (1) the presence of multiple exchange rates, (2) restrictions on current account transactions, (3) restrictions on capital account transactions and (4) the requirement of the surrender of export proceeds. Eventually the KAOPEN index (short for capital account openness index) is constructed by conducting a principal component analysis on these four variables. 9",

Among those globalization indicators that could serve as a starting point for assessing the economic dimension of globalization-such as the DHL Connectedness index (Ghemawat and Altman 2016) , the New Globalization index (Vujakovic 2010) , or the Maastricht Globalization index )-the KOF Globalization index (Dreher 2006; Gygli et al. 2019 ) occupies an exceptional position in terms of coverage, conceptual clarity and transparency. The index is supplied by the Swiss Economic Institute (KOF) and is by far the most widely applied index of economic openness in the economics literature (Potrafke 2015) . Most recently, the KOF introduced a series of methodological improvements as well as additional variables to revise and extend the basic methodology for constructing the KOF globalization index (Gygli et al. 2019) . In doing so, the KOF also introduced a series of novel sub-indices based on a modular structure, which allows for inspecting different dimensions of economic openness in a disaggregated form. In the type column \"Co\" corresponds to \"continuous\", \"Int\" corresponds to \"interval\", and \"Ra\" corresponds to \"Ratio\". Name Tang (2011) ",

It starts from the empirical observation that most developed and technologically advanced countries export a great diversity of products and argues that rare products within these diversified export baskets are associated with a high degree of complexity. In contrast, less technologically developed countries typically show a much smaller degree of diversification in their export basket-as a consequence, their revealed comparative advantage often lies in low labor costs or specific natural resources, which come with a low degree of technological complexity. For a detailed description of the methodology see Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009). findings according to which countries with high economic complexity tend to benefit more from trade (e.g. Carlin et al. 2001; Hausmann et al. 2007; Huchet-Bourdon et al. 2017) . Indeed, we observe some substantial differences in de-facto trade openness when considering technological capabilities. Specifically, we find that the tradeto-GDP ratio of high complexity countries started to decouple from the moderate and low complexity countries in the early 1990s. 11 This finding suggests that countries that are technologically superior (and are, thus, likely to benefit more from trade) tend to record higher de-facto openness to trade. We can also see trade integration has reached a peak before the start of the financial crisis in 2007/2008 according to the de-facto trade openness dimension. Against the background of changes in trade policy-in particular in the case of the US under president Trump (e.g. Eichengreen 2018)-and the potential repercussions of the COVID-19 crisis on the globalization process, de-facto international trade integration may be expected to continuously proceed at a much slower space than in earlier decades. With regard to de-jure openness to trade, the differences across country groups are less pronounced than in the de-facto dimension, as we see convergence since the late 1980s (Fig. 1, panel d) . The latter observation suggests that countries of moderate and low complexity have opened their regimes in terms of trade policy in the past decades and all countries have approached high degrees of de-jure openness. Several factors have been discussed in the literature to explain this change in trade policy (especially in developing countries), ranging from the policy-makers' intention to increase trade volumes to the effects of trade agreements within the WTO and policy prescriptions advocated by the IMF and the World Bank (e.g. Baldwin 2016; Rodrik 2018).",

Since then, the gap between the former and the latter two groups has grown substantially, which implies that financial integration among high complexity countries has proceeded faster than in the rest of the world. The large outward FDI stock of high complexity countries indicates that a large part of FDI in medium-and low complexity countries, where inward FDI is much larger than outward FDI, stems from the high complexity country group. Eventually, we observe that the financial crisis of 2007-08 only had a minor impact on financial openness: after a sharp reduction, the level of financial de-facto openness recovered rapidly and continued to grow across all country groups, which has not been the case for de-facto trade openness.",

Given the previous discussion, we would expect that indicators within the same group (e.g. de-facto trade openness) measure similar aspects of economic openness and, therefore, are strongly correlated with each other. To corroborate this hypothesis and to study the relationship between indicators belonging to different types, we now conduct a comprehensive correlation analysis of all available openness indicators (as well as their specific sub-components and variants) presented so far, which are technically suitable for such an analysis. Since many papers use the first difference of these indicators, we pay attention to both, correlations of the variables in levels as well as in first differences. 12 This exercise is useful for answering a variety of questions: for instance, whether indicators that were built to measure the same type of openness are consistent with each other or to what extent financial and trade indicators do behave similarly. In addition, such an approach allows for clarifying the degree of alignment between one-dimensional indicators on the one hand and hybrid and combined indicators on the other hand. Finally, studying the relationship between different indicators is a relevant preliminary exercise for examining the question whether the choice of indicators matters for empirical applications.

We report the results using the Pearson coefficient, which are qualitatively very similar, in the accompanying appendix. While Fig. 4 illustrates the correlation of the various measures in levels, Fig. 5 depicts correlations among the time series of the various indicators in first differences. The correlation analysis is based on 216 countries from 1965 to 2019, but for the individual indicators there are restrictions in the underlying country and time periods (see Tables 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6 and 7). Given these data restrictions, we calculate pair-wise correlations. When inspecting Figs. 4 and 5, we can identify clusters of closely related openness measures: we generally find stronger associations among the indicators within each type (trade de-facto; trade de-jure; financial de-facto; financial de-jure), but only weak to moderate correlations of indicators can be established across different types (e.g. trade de-facto vis-\u00e0-vis financial de-facto)-with some notable exceptions to be discussed below. Thereby, correlations are consistently weaker whenever one compares the differenced indicator (Fig. 5) , with indicators of different types now being almost completely uncorrelated. Furthermore, Fig. 4 Spearman correlation coefficients for the levels of the openness indicators discussed in this paper. Sources: see Tables 2 to 7; own calculations these correlations reveal that de-jure measures on trade and financial openness are more closely correlated than its de-facto counterparts, while the correlation between de-facto and de-jure in both dimensions (trade and finance) is weak. This result implies that economic policy in terms of trade and finance tends to be more convergent than de-facto outcomes; furthermore, countries that decide to reduce institutional obstacles to trade generally do it simultaneously for real and financial flows. Our findings lend support to the argument that de-facto indicators generally represent more than just the outcome of economic policy, while de-jure indicators measure the legal foundations of economic policy.",

Trade openness enables, for example, countries to exploit comparative advantages, to gain from specialisation, to foster innovation and efficient production.\" When it comes to financial globalisation, the most forceful prediction with the most influence on policy debates has also clearly pointed to overall positive growth effects, especially during the times of the \"Washington Consensus\" (e.g. Rodrik 2006) .

Within the cluster of de-facto trade openness measures, and for the case of 5-year averages in levels, the Generalized Trade Openness Index (Tang 2011) suggests a negative relationship between openness and growth. The remaining indicators, on the other hand, suggest a positive relationship, and only the real trade share obtains statistical significance. The picture is more ambiguous when we consider the first-difference estimations based on annual data: in this case, the Generalized Trade Openness Index and the KOF de-facto indicator show a negative sign, but only the latter is statistically significant. The remaining four indicators are positively correlated with growth, with trade to GDP being significantly so. These marked differences in how openness indicators correlate with GDP growth can be traced back to the methodological approach underlying the construction of different openness indicators, which is why our comparison of growth regressions results provides an illustration for the theory-ladenness of observation (Hanson 1958) in the context of measuring economic openness. The fact that moving from one measure for de-facto openness to another has such profound effects on the estimation results-remember that the underlying data sample in the different regressions is the same-strengthens our point that the choice of the indicator is important and requires both a case-based theoretical justification as well as thorough robustness checks.",

When we only include the KOF_econ indicator, we find a positive but statistically insignificant coefficient regarding the impact of economic openness on growth. However, when separating trade and financial openness using the KOF_trade and KOF_finance subindicators in models (3) and (4), we arrive at a more nuanced result: while the coefficient of KOF_trade is always positive and significant, KOF_finance is negative and in the FD specification statistically significantly so. In models (5) and (6), we find that the KOF de-jure measures (both in the trade and in the finance dimension) generally correlate positively with economic growth, but no such consistent observation is possible for the de-facto measures. The even more disaggregated models (7) and (8) suggest that openness to trade tends to correlate positively with growth in both de-facto and de-jure terms, but that financial openness is related negatively to growth when the de-facto dimension is considered. We find mixed results for the trade openness dimensions based on models (9) and (10). While the trade-to-GDP variable correlates positively with growth but is statistically insignificant, the Tariff_WITS coefficient is negative when we use the FD-specification. LMF_open has a negative sign, but it is only significant in model (9). KAOPEN shows positive correlation coefficients, which are, however, linked to large standard errors.",

Our results indicate that operationalizing economic openness for econometric research requires explicit theoretical justifications of the relevant dimensions as well as the available indicators within these dimensions. Differences in how openness indicators correlate with economic growth illustrate the theory-laddenness of observation (Hanson 1958) , i.e. the assumptions underlying the construction of different openness indicators make an important difference.

We have compiled openness indicators by merging publicly available data from different sources-the data set is published together with this article-and have categorized the indicators using a typology of economic openness, which distinguishes between 'real' and 'financial' openness, as well as a 'de-facto' dimension (based on aggregate economic statistics) and a 'de-jure' dimension (focusing on institutional foundations of openness), respectively. The data set consists of 216 countries over the time period 1965-2019, although there is wide variation in the coverage of the country and time dimension across different openness variables. We have used this data set to analyze the correlation across indicators, both in levels and in first differences. We find that indicators that belong to the same category of openness measures indeed tend to be correlated more strongly. Correlations among openness indicators are, however, in general much weaker in the case of first differences. By using a standard growth regression framework, we have shown how different types of economic openness as well as different indicators capture the impact of openness on economic growth in different ways. From this finding, it follows that applied researchers are well advised to motivate their choice of openness indicator rigorously, since different research questions might also entail different conceptions of economic openness. At the same time, it can be argued that the identification of reasons for why different measures of economic openness yield different results is an important and rewarding research activity.",
