Aims: This study focuses on socio-economic inequalities in social network, loneliness and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Two-hundred and fourteen residents of Wandsworth, a South West London Borough in the United Kingdom completed an online cross-sectional survey on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. Data were analysed using independent samples t-tests and multiple regression. Results: Middle-aged people reported a less strong social network and more loneliness, anxiety and depression than younger people. People with a long-term health condition reported a less strong social network, more loneliness, more general practitioner (GP) and hospital visits, and poorer mental health than those with no long-term health conditions. People receiving State financial benefits reported less use of public spaces, a less strong social network, more loneliness, more GP and hospital visits and poorer mental health than those not receiving benefits. Greater neighbourhood identification was associated with a stronger social network and better mental health outcomes. Multiple regression analyses showed that, over and above loneliness, perceived personal risk of COVID-19 constitutes an additional precipitant for both depression and anxiety when controlling for other variables. Conclusion: As a novel stressor associated with the pandemic, the situational and involuntary perception of being at risk of COVID-19 may be stimulating anxiety and depressive symptomatology, which will need to be managed effectively as resurgences of the disease are predicted and communicated to the general public under growing mistrust and uncertainty.",

            "text": "The deleterious effects of social isolation and loneliness on mental and physical health outcomes have long been recognised. There is now considerable evidence that older people, in particular, are at higher risk of social isolation, loneliness and, thus, poor mental and physical health outcomes (Erzen & \u00c7ikrikci, 2018; Golden et al., 2009; Singh & Misra, 2009 ). This has meant that there has been a recent focus on the health and wellbeing of older people in interventions, campaigns and initiatives introduced by local government authorities in the United Kingdom (UK) (e.g. Wandsworth Borough Council, 2015) . However, there has been less insight into the relationship between social isolation, loneliness and mental health in other potentially vulnerable communities, particularly those with lower income, people receiving State financial benefits and those with long-term health conditions. These are people who may lack the necessary social and economic capital to cope effectively with emergent social psychological 'stressors', such as the outbreak of COVID-19. In view of the pandemic, renewed focus on these social psychological challenges is necessary, especially as social distancing policies (which for some groups involve self-isolation or quarantine) are likely to accentuate feelings of isolation and loneliness (Jetten et al., 2020) . Social psychological factors, such as neighbourhood identification, participation in and engagement with one's local community (such as volunteering and use of public spaces), prior loneliness, strength of social network and perceived personal risk of COVID-19 are likely to determine, at least in part, people's mental health during the unprecedented circumstances brought about by the dangers of COVID-19. In this article, the role of socio-economic and health inequalities in strength of social network, loneliness, perceived personal risk of COVID-19 and mental health (depression and anxiety) is examined in a sample of adults in the London borough of Wandsworth.",

            "text": "There is evidence that both strength of social network and loneliness play a significant causal role in the onset of depression and anxiety in the population as a whole (Erzen & \u00c7ikrikci, 2018) and that older people, in particular, are at disproportionately high risk (Golden et al., 2009; Singh & Misra, 2009) . In their study of Spanish people aged 50 and above, Dom\u00e8nech-Abella et al. (2017) found that the type and size of one's social network mediated the relationship between loneliness and depression. Similarly, in an Irish study, Dom\u00e8nech-Abella et al. (2019) provide evidence that both objective factors, such as the size of one's social network, and subjective factors, such as loneliness, should be concurrently examined in addressing anxiety in older people. In research into younger adults, loneliness (as opposed to strength of social network) emerges as the most robust predictor of depression (Matthews et al., 2016;  see also Vasileiou et al., 2019) . Alpass and Neville (2003) found that social isolation (i.e. having a weak social network) had an impact on depression in older men, which they attributed to factors such as the loss of a professional identity, physical mobility issues and the loss of valued relationships. It has also been found that the availability of social support mediates the relationship between loneliness and depression (Liu et al., 2016) . Social support can be derived in many different ways and includes engagement with one's local community though volunteering and use of communal spaces (such as local charities, community centres and parks) (Pilkington et al., 2012) . The likelihood of engaging with one's local community in this way is likely to be tied to neighbourhood identification.",

Neighbourhood identification refers to the extent to which people see their neighbourhood as an element of their identity -it can be assessed in terms of the level of importance one appends to one's neighbourhood, how happy one feels about being a resident of it, how fulfilled one feels by it, and the extent to which one's neighbourhood affiliation guides one's behaviour and self-presentation.",

            "text": "Neighbourhood identification has also been found to be related to mental health outcomes. Fong et al. (2019a) showed that higher neighbourhood identification was directly associated with better mental health and attenuated the effects of living in a neighbourhood with low socio-economic status on mental health. Fong et al. (2019b) also showed that neighbourhood identification may perform a protective role against poor mental health associated with negative change in one's local environment. It can also be hypothesised that this form of social identification may also be protective against the stressors associated with COVID-19. Indeed, emerging research has found that perceived risk of COVID-19 is associated with negative affect, such as fear, as well as imposed identity change (Breakwell & Jaspal, in press; Harper et al., 2020) , suggesting that perceived personal risk constitutes a significant stressor during the pandemic. Since COVID-19 induces existential fear (the severity of damage), exacerbates uncertainty and insecurity (as an 'invisible enemy'), and incites interpersonal mistrust (anyone can infect you), it can be hypothesised that perceived personal risk will also be associated with depression and anxiety. Stafford et al. (2011) have shown that neighbourhood cohesion (as an aspect of neighbourhood identity) was inversely associated with depressive symptomatology independent of demographic and socio-economic factors, suggesting that the ability to build friendships within one's neighbourhood is associated with a lower risk of poor mental health. Unsurprisingly, the physical composition of one's neighbourhood (such as the availability of good housing and healthcare, and safe communal spaces) is also likely to play a role in social and psychological outcomes, such as neighbourhood identification and indeed mental health (Stockton, 2014) . Thus, neighbourhood identification must be viewed as part of a system of factors, including engaging with one's community, that potentially determine mental health outcomes during the pandemic.",

In their US study, Sturm and Gresenz (2002) found no evidence of an association between income inequality and depression. Conversely, Wildman (2003) has found that subjective financial status was a major determinant of ill health in a UK sample. Increasingly, it is recognised that social psychological factors are likely to mediate the potential relationship between income inequality and poor mental health outcomes. In their multilevel analysis of Welsh adults, Fone et al. (2007) found that income deprivation was associated with poor mental health and that social cohesion mediated this relationship. Zimmerman and Bell (2006) showed that social capital is also an important mediator. Being in receipt of benefits (that is, financial support from the government for the unemployed, those with ill health and those facing economic deprivation) is one indicator of income inequality. Being in receipt of benefits is also socially stigmatised and can reflect marginalisation (Garthwaite, 2015) . In view of previous research, it is hypothesised that people who are receiving benefits will report a less strong social network, more loneliness and poorer mental health than those who are not receiving benefits.",

Yet, loneliness itself has been observed to increase the risk of poor physical health outcomes (Jaremka et al., 2013) . There is a mutually reinforcing relationship between loneliness and physical illness. Accordingly, those with long-term health conditions may exhibit a less strong social network, more loneliness and decreased community participation (e.g. volunteering, use of public spaces). As likely indicators of physical health impairments, the number of visits to one's general practitioner (GP) and to hospital in the past 12 months should be positively associated with social isolation, loneliness and poor mental health outcomes.",

This clarifies the established finding that income inequality is associated with poor psychological outcomes (Fone et al., 2007; Wildman, 2003) . People with lower income are less likely to participate in their community perhaps because they possess less economic capital to do so, while those in receipt of benefits may face stigma and experience marginalisation, thereby limiting the amount of their community participation. Those receiving benefits also report poorer mental health. Similarly, having a longterm health condition appears to limit one's social network, accentuate feelings of loneliness and to be associated with poor mental health outcomes. There were no significant differences in perceived risk of COVID-19 between these groups. However, those facing health and income inequalities are more marginalised and, thus, their capacity to cope with emerging stressors, such as perceived risk of COVID-19, may be limited.",

It is possible that older adults in our sample were less willing to acknowledge their loneliness, depression and anxiety since to do so may be an acknowledgement of weakness and, thus, contribute to an erosion of their independence (e.g. Rokach et al., 2004) . A coping strategy on their part may be to attenuate or deny altogether these threatening aspects of their identity and experience (Breakwell, 2015) . In partial support of hypothesis 1, middle-aged adults (aged 41-65) appear to be at highest risk of poor outcomes but they tend not to be the focus of research and intervention. They should be. It will be necessary to focus on addressing the disproportionate psychological and physical health impact that COVID-19 may be having on these vulnerable communities (i.e. middle-aged adults, those of lower income, those in receipt of benefits and those with long-term conditions) during the pandemic.",

This was positively associated with both the amount of physical exercise undertaken and strength of social network. Consistent with the social cure perspective (Jetten et al., 2012) , neighbourhood identification may act as a 'gateway' to a sense of community and indeed other group memberships, which can provide a sense of support, belonging and affiliation with others (Wakefield et al., 2019) . Indeed, neighbourhood identification was also associated with having a stronger social network. This is consistent with research into place identity, which generally shows that place can come to form a central part of an individual's identity, shaping cognition, affect and behaviour (Bonaiuto et al., 1996; Dixon et al., 2014) . Indeed, place (in this context, Wandsworth) may constitute a fulcrum for neighbourhood identity, facilitating a sense of sharedness, commonality and belonging among residents. In view of recent research showing the benefits of a sense of community during the pandemic (e.g. Jetten et al., 2020) , it would be advantageous to promote a stronger sense of neighbourhood identity among residents by emphasising the positive aspects of one's neighbourhood, community involvement and interpersonal connectedness.",

            "text": "This study provides robust evidence that, when controlling for socio-economic and health inequalities, community participation, neighbourhood identification and strength of social network, the most important determinant of both depression and anxiety in this sample is loneliness. Although strength of social network (that is, the absence of social isolation) is associated with depression and anxiety, loneliness appears to explain poor mental health in our sample. This is an important finding because it clarifies that it is not necessarily the number of people that one knows, meets or speaks to, but rather the subjective sense of being lonely that affects people's mental health. After all, it is quite possible for an individual to know, meet and speak with many individuals but for them still to experience a sense of loneliness (Tanskanen & Anttila, 2016) . In addition to its impact on poor mental health, loneliness has been found to impede engagement with COVID-19 preventive measures, such as wearing a face mask (Stickley et al., 2020) . It is therefore important that the subjective psychological construct of loneliness, in particular, is the focus of our efforts to improve people's physical and psychological wellbeing. This will be especially relevant in the context of widespread social distancing measures to curb the spread of COVID-19.",

Indeed, the multiple regression analyses indicated that perceived personal risk of COVID-19 was a significant correlate of poor mental health outcomes. Since COVID-19 constitutes a pervasive societal hazard which affects us all (Jaspal, Fino, et al., in press), perceived personal risk of infection appears to add significantly to predicting the variance of both depression and anxiety in the sample -over and above loneliness. As a novel stressor associated with the pandemic, the situational and involuntary perception of being at risk of COVID-19 may be stimulating anxious and depressive symptomatology, which will need to be managed effectively as resurgences of the disease are predicted and communicated to the general public under growing mistrust and uncertainty (Breakwell, 2020; Breakwell & Jaspal, in press ).",

The hypothesis of a causal role of exercise would be consistent with previous research showing the physiological and psychological benefits of exercise (Hassm\u00e9n et al., 2000) . There is likely to be a reciprocal relationship between loneliness and exercise in that people who engage in exercise (e.g. in group settings, that is with other people and with motivation from others) may feel less lonely. Furthermore, those who are lonely may be less inclined to engage in exercise. Regular exercise must continue to be encouraged in the general population, which may be challenging in view of renewed social distancing measures. Opportunities for, and guidance about, exercising regularly in a safe and socially distanced manner must be facilitated. Amid COVID-19 and the restrictions to curb its spread, we must ensure that people continue to feel connected to others (virtually and in a socially distanced manner) to decrease loneliness (Jetten et al., 2020) -the most important determinant of poor mental health in our study.",

            "text": "These findings must be considered with caution due to several limitations. First, only an online participant recruitment method was used, which means that this sample is not necessarily representative of the Wandsworth population. Indeed, the high prevalence of long-term health conditions reported in the sample was uncharacteristic of the population of Wandsworth. Moreover, men and ethnic minorities are under-represented in this sample. The sample, on average, was also highly educated. All of these factors mean that the most vulnerable sections of the Wandsworth population (e.g. those who do not engage with charities and community organisations, those with no access to the Internet, and those with low levels of literacy) may not have been reached during participant recruitment. Future research should continue to focus on those facing health and socio-economic inequalities using other sampling strategies to triangulate these findings. It is also noteworthy that, given the demographics of Wandsworth, the borough itself is not particularly representative of the UK population, suggesting that data from other towns and cities would be beneficial. Second, this cross-sectional study provides an empirical snapshot of mental health during the pandemic at one point in time, that is, when lockdown measures were being eased after the first outbreak. Cross-sequential research would be valuable as it would enable us to identify trends in mental health outcomes at different points during the pandemic, especially as resurgences of the virus and future national lockdowns are occurring. Third, the economic implications of COVID-19 and changes to one's occupational identity (e.g. the need to work from home, job insecurity) have been major sources of uncertainty during the pandemic. It would be valuable to examine the impact of economic and job-related variables on mental health outcomes, especially in the commuter regions of London, where significant occupational changes have been imposed and experienced.",
