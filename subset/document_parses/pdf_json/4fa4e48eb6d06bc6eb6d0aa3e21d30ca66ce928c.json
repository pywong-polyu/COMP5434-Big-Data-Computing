Infection event timing, spatial, climate and ventilation conditions in the processing plant, sharing of living quarters and transport, and viral genome sequences were analyzed. Our results suggest that a single index case transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to co-workers over distances of more than 8 m, within a confined work area in which air is constantly recirculated and cooled. Viral genome sequencing shows that all cases share a set of mutations representing a novel sub-branch in the SARS-CoV-2 C20 clade. We identified the same set of mutations in samples collected in the time period between this initial infection cluster and a subsequent outbreak within the same factory, with the largest number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in a German meat processing facility reported so far. Our results indicate climate conditions, fresh air exchange rates, and airflow as factors that can promote efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 via long distances and provide insights into possible requirements for pandemic mitigation strategies in industrial workplace settings.",

Implementation of social and physical distancing measures resulted in declining infection numbers in most European countries. Currently, countries seek to implement alternative measures, for example, infection management focused on hotspots, contact tracing, and sentinel testing. Given this, it is important to immediately follow-up on local infection clusters to prevent re-emergence of large-scale community transmission as seen during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

Whereas droplets typically travel no farther than 2 m, aerosols can stay in the air for prolonged periods of time and may deliver infectious viral particles substantially beyond 2 m distances, especially in indoor settings with low fresh air exchange rates (Liu et al, 2017; Asadi et al, 2019 Asadi et al, , 2020 . Factors such as temperature, humidity, and air circulation are thought to significantly influence stability and transport of droplets and aerosols and consequently transmission efficiency (van Doremalen et al, 2020) .",

Viral sequence analyses revealed a previously unreported SARS-CoV-2 genotype that is not only shared by all individuals of the initial cluster, but also by samples collected shortly before a subsequent outbreak in mid-June, which represents the largest outbreak in a meat processing plant seen in Germany thus far. Our findings indicate that a physical distance of 2 m does not suffice to prevent transmission in environmental conditions such as those studied here; additional measures such as improved ventilation and airflow, installation of filtering devices, or use of high-quality face masks are required to reduce the infection risk in these environments.",

Whereas the B1 sequence is an exact prototype representative, we find an additional nucleotide exchange at 100% frequency (C7735T) in B2. The fact that this mutation is absent from the other samples rules out B2 as a possible source of the cluster with near certainty. Another six cases also exhibit a single additional nucleotide exchange that is not shared with any other sample. Taken together, these observations suggest prototype virus transmission by B1 as the common source of infection in the cluster. Given the overall scarcity of non-prototypical nucleotide variants, the presence of additional exchanges most likely resulted from ongoing viral mutagenesis in a subset of newly infected individuals. However, the sequencing data alone cannot rule out the formal possibility that at least some of these variants represent independent infection events.",

Positive rates were statistically significant only for a single shared apartment and associated carpool (a1 and c3), and a shared bedroom (r5). The fact that 5 of 7 members in a1/c3, and 2 out of 3 members in r5 have fixed work stations within the 8 m area (Appendix Table S3 ), however, suggests that high infection rates in these units primarily reflect the number of group members who work in close proximity of the index case, rather than resulting from independent infection chains within the units themselves. This hypothesis is furthermore supported by a general positive correlation (average Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.67) between unit infection rate and percentage of unit members working in the 8 m area (Appendix Fig S2) . Hence, while some secondary infections may have occurred within apartments, bedrooms, or carpools, our collective data strongly suggest that the majority of transmissions occurred within the beef processing facility, with case B1 being at the root of the cluster.",

We therefore determined viral genotypes in samples from 15 MPP-R employees collected during the early phase of the second outbreak. These included five samples from pork deboning workers who had tested positive on June 5 (P1, P2) or 8 (P3, P4, P7), and ten samples from employees with various internal roles tested positive between June 15 and 17 (O1-10). As shown in Fig 2B, all samples exhibit the dominant signature mutations defining the prototypic sequence from the early infection cluster in May. Additional nucleotide variants with frequency values between~20 and 100% were present in seven of the samples. Among the latter, two pairs (P2/O9, O3/O4) exhibited variant patterns which suggest that one of the employees had infected the other, or that both had acquired the virus from an individual not included in our sequencing regimen. Finally, we sought to evaluate whether the two hallmark mutations at position 6,406 and 18,972 may have emerged in the index case B1 or may have been already present in the ancestral virus. We therefore acquired samples from the two MPP-D workers (D1 and D2) who may have been in contact with B1 and B2 on May 17. As shown in Fig 2C, both MPP-D workers share the prototype sequence seen in B1. Of note, D1 additionally exhibits the same mutation (C7735T) that differentiates the genotype in case B2. Hence, since D1 sequences show this mutation with a frequency of~20%, it is possible that this individual may have been the common source of infection, passing on the prototypic sequence to case B1 and a variant genome to B2.

            "text": "Our results collectively point toward a super spreading event in the MPP-R beef processing plant that originated from a single employee. Our findings suggest that the facilities' environmental conditions, including low temperature, low air exchange rates, and constant air recirculation, together with relatively close distance between workers and demanding physical work, created an unfavorable mix of factors promoting efficient aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 particles. It is very likely that these or similar factors are also responsible for current worldwide ongoing outbreaks in other meat or fish processing facilities. The recurrent emergence of such outbreaks suggests that employees in meat or fish processing facilities need to be frequently and systematically screened to prevent future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. Furthermore, immediate action needs to be taken to quarantine all workers in a radius around an infected individual that may significantly extend beyond 2 m. Importantly, while we observed transmission in a~8 m area, exact transmission distances are likely to vary substantially depending on facility layout and operation conditions. Additional studies are therefore required to determine the most important parameters which may be altered to lower infection risk, for example via optimization of airflow or ventilation conditions. In contrast to work-related exposure, shared apartments, bedrooms, or carpools appear not to have played a major role in the initial outbreak described in this study. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that shared living quarters or work rides may have contributed to viral transmission in context of the second, larger outbreak in June 2020. Our genotyping results are fully compatible with the hypothesis that this second outbreak was seeded by cases related to the initial cluster. We point out, however, that we have no information regarding the frequency of the NRW-MPP-1 genotype within the broader population. While the genotype had not been deposited in GISAID as of May 19, and while we thus far have not seen it in our own sequencing of approximately one thousand infected individuals from the Hamburg metropolitan area (Grundhoff and Fischer, unpublished) , it is formally possible that NRW-MPP-1 may already have been more broadly distributed in the general population of the G\u00fc tersloh district in early June. In this context, it should also be noted that much of the production line workforce in meat processing facilities (including the majority of workers described here) is provided by external sub-contractors, potentially creating lines of transmission that interconnect facilities. It is therefore conceivable that NRW-MPP-1 is a genotype that may already have been particularly abundant among contractor employees. Given the large number of infected individuals in the second outbreak, it is likely that, by now, the NRW-MPP-1 genotype will have spread to the local population. It will therefore be difficult to retrospectively distinguish between the above possibilities. We therefore suggest that, in addition to frequent PCR testing across facilities, a subset of positive samples should be routinely subjected to viral genotyping to allow molecular tracing.",

The company adhered to the recommendations of the relevant occupational Health and safety guidelines (BGN \"Erg\u00e4nzung der Gef\u00e4hrdungsbeurteilung im Sinne des SARS-CoV-Arbeitsschutzstandards Branche Fleischwirtschaft\"). Additional measures were developed and implemented by the company. Hygiene regulations like hand hygiene and one-way traffic in hallways were reinforced, and an internal multi-lingual information campaign was enrolled to raise awareness for prevention and self-detection of early COVID-19 symptoms. A body temperature thermo scanner was set up to check all employees' body temperature entering the building. Workers have been made aware of the company's SARS-CoV-2 test center and were motivated to report any events where they see themselves being at risk. Specific workplace assessments were performed to decipher possibilities to extend distances between workers. Simple one-layer face masks were made compulsory. Regulations were in place to prohibit rotation between working places for the workers. Measures in the canteen were imposed to reduce physical contact and to enforce that workers would spend their break times exclusively with workers from their own shift. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the company managed to prevent intra-company infection chains until the event described in this paper. The implementation of the measures was audited on May 15 and May 29 by unannounced inspections of the Occupational Health and Safety Experts of the competent authority and on May 20 by the Occupational Health and Safety experts of the \"Berufsgenossenschaft Nahrungsmittel und Gastgewerbe\". The company had set up their own test center for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing in early May 2020. In the SARS-CoV-2 test, center trained staff takes oropharyngeal swap samples from workers and other staff. The samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR in an accredited laboratory (Labor Knei\u00dfler GmbH & Co.KG, Burglengenfeld, Germany). Staff was tested based on self-reported symptoms, possible contacts to other infected persons, returning to work after more than 96 h absence from work, or based on risk-assessment of possible workplace contacts.",
