Availability of testing is a bottleneck due to constrained resources and effective prioritization of individuals is necessary. Here, we discuss the impact of different prioritization policies on COVID-19 patient discovery and the ability of governments and health organizations to use the results for effective decision making. We suggest a framework for testing that balances maximal discovery of positive individuals with the need for population-based surveillance aimed at understanding disease spread and characteristics. This framework draws from similar approaches to prioritization in the domain of cyber-security based on ranking individuals using a risk score and then reserving a portion of the capacity for random sampling. This approach is an application of Multi-Armed-Bandits maximizing exploration/exploitation of the underlying distribution. We find that individuals can be ranked for effective testing using a few simple features, and that ranking them using such models we can capture 65% (CI: 64.7%-68.3%) of the positive individuals using less than 20% of the testing capacity or 92.1% (CI: 91.1%-93.2%) of positives individuals using 70% of the capacity, allowing reserving a significant portion of the tests for population studies. Our approach allows experts and decision makers to tailor the resulting policies as needed allowing transparency into the ranking policy and the ability to understand the disease spread in the population and react quickly and in an informed manner.",

Testing for COVID-19 has been an important tool in both monitoring the spread of the virus as well as in the attempts of preventing its rapid spread. Quickly identifying outbreaks is a key to combating the spread of the disease [2, 19] . However testing is bounded by the available resources such as number of available tests, reagent bottlenecks, laboratory accreditation and technical constrains. Since the number of tests is limited, governments and decision makers around the world apply policies guiding who should be tested. During the outbreak countries implemented different testing policies. These policies vary in a wide range of approaches such as: testing of symptomatic individuals only, testing of symptomatic individuals and their contacts, test only hospitalized patients [19, 8] , test severe cases [15] , test with a rigid policy for optimizing to the most likely phenotypes [20] , or testing with a policy and two random groups as done in Iceland [7] . In the case of unlimited test capacity a policy of testing everyone was applied in Wuhan (Wuhan May-2020, 11M tests) [24, 12] .",

Lack of information prevent governments from properly assessing risks in the first stages of a new pandemic when virus characteristics, such as the death rate, were unknown and estimated based on biased information [23] . Secondly, time to identify new disease clusters is prolonged, since most testing resources are spent on the existing clusters as symptomatic cases are prioritized (\"searching under the lamppost\").",

The purpose of data security is similar to the task of testing and contact tracing organizations. The sheer amount of daily user activity in IT database systems prevents testing and logging every action, instead these systems use an approach of ranking actions by risk using a policy and logging only potentially risky activity. This approach suffered from the same filter bubble problem of data biased towards the policy, and inability to quickly react to new threats or changes in activity.",

Using 10% the testing capacity is enough in order to identify 66.6% of the positive individuals (CI: 64.7%-68.3%), and at 70% of the capacity 92.1% (CI: 91.1%-93.2%) are identified. This enables diverting testing capacity towards exploration without harming recall and present a novel framework for COVID-19 testing policy. We trained two models on different time frames and find significant difference in their efficacy, suggesting policy changes affect what's learned from the data which provides another strong incentive for using a major part of the testing capacity for exploration such as random sampling.",

They suggest combining it with campaign and funding for isolation of infected individuals. Iceland testing policy was also made of both : targeted testings of individuals at high risk and population screening [7] . Initially they invested in testing all individuals who desired to get tested, mostly from the capital metropolis. To provide a control testing group they randomly selected individuals who where summoned to be tested representing the age and gender demographics. [20] modeled the probability of individuals to test positive to SARS-CoV-2 based on their response to a daily symptoms survey.

We suggest a testing framework that enables maintaining and constantly updating the testing policy in a principled manner while keeping the experts and decision makers in the loop. This framework also enables introducing new features to the model. The Icelandic research [7] also shows that targeted testing improves the tests' recall. 13.3% of the targeted tests resulted positive versus only 0.8% from the \"open invitation\" population, and only 0.6% recall for the randomly selected \"control group\", which is compatible both with [20] and our results that shows a \"risk score\" can be learned and improve the test recalls.",

The science community has been extensively working on using machine learning models for risk scoring in many domains [18, 6, 4] For an ML risk score to be accepted by the medical community it is important that it allows experts to tweak it (add clinical features, local biases) and is explainable [14] .

This exploration motive could be used for exploring geographic location, demographics, or exploration of symptoms that are currently not used in the model. For example, if the doctors are reporting of a symptom that is unknown or not in the model, the experts could set it as an arm that could be pooled using a Thompson sampling. The exploration portion of the tests can also be used as an intervention method. For example, testing all the residents and staff of a nursing home once a case is discovered. The experts' knowledge may be used for building the primary risk score model and introducing new possible features to the model or new arms that should be pooled.

A portion of the tests goes to the most likely infected individuals (exploitation) and the rest for exploration (random sampling, or any other expert defined population).

This approach allows the experts to make the high level decision on the policy while preserving the data discovery for re-evaluation. Exploration can be random or based on more complicated sampling schemes such as based on geographic features maximizing information for multiple objectives (based Thompson sampling) to overcome the filter bubble phenomena. Testing policies used by governments can be seen as private cases of this framework: testing only hospitalized patients is choosing maximize detection (100% exploitation, 0% exploration) while the policy in Iceland which used two exploration strategies is on the other hand (allocating 10-50% of the capacity for exploration and basing the exploitation on a manual ranking model).

Using the data released by the Israel Health Ministry we found ranking could have recall of 66.6% (CI: 64.7%-68.3%) on average using only 10% of the tests capacity and 92.1% (CI: 91.1%-93.2%) using 70% of the tests capacity. A simple rule based model based on the correlations achieved similar accuracy, suggesting that drawing an easy to explain model is possible (at the cost of a very little efficiency). Basing a policy solely on a ranking model would be very efficient capacity wise but would lock the decision makers in a filter bubble. This approach is based on solutions to similar problems where test capacity is limited in the realm of security [5] . Saving a major part of the testing capacity for exploration allows both informed decision making and updating the ranking model daily or weekly to maximize the efficiency. Training a second model using the same architecture on data collected in weeks 21-23 and testing both models on weeks 24-26 we found significant difference in model recall. This is not a surprising results as it is expected that different testing policies would bias the distribution of individuals identified. However, these results show that dedicating a significant portion of the testing capacity to random sampling would provide a clearer picture to decision makers. Furthermore, training such a model once is not good enough, and a framework to support retraining the model and choosing the best ranking model based on data is necessary. In our example, if dedicating 30% of the testing capacity to exploration it is advisable to use the first wave model, if exploration is raised to 60% the second model would achieve better recall (see Figure 4 ).",
