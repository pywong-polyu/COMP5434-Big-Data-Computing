The Lebanese national health authorities recommended the sustainment of immunization services' provision in primary healthcare centers and private clinics while adopting an appointment system and ensuring the adherence to infection prevention and control measures (IPC) (social distancing measures, correct use of personal protective equipment, screening for COVID-19, hand hygiene and waste disposal) [13] . Yet, the complexity of this pandemic's response with respect to obligatory confinement measures, the economic crisis ongoing in the country and the nationwide political unrest due to the October 17 th , 2019 uprising may have potentially hindered the access to RI services and subsequently set the floor for the occurrence of outbreaks in the near future. As a further matter, the country has been attempting to recover from two consecutive measles outbreaks in 2018 and 2019 with more than 2,014 infected cases by implementing a national measles/polio campaign; however, the campaign has been temporarily postponed due to the pandemic, hence delaying the vaccination of around 600,000 children and further increasing the country's susceptibility to measles outbreaks [14] . It's worth noting that, based on the 2019 WHO-UNICEF coverage estimates data for Lebanon, the complete immunization coverage were all below the targeted 95%: oral polio virus 3 (OPV) (81%); diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis 3 (DTP) (83%); hepatitis B 3 (HepB) (80%); haemophilus influenzae type b 3 (Hib) (85%); and measles-containing vaccine (MCV) (63%) [15] .",

A similar study was conducted in England to assess the early impact of COVID-19 on routine childhood vaccination by April 2020 [18] . Additionally, another report with similar objectives entitled \"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Routine Pediatric Vaccine Ordering and Administration-United States, 2020\", was published by Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on May 15 th , 2020 and assessed the changes in the number of vaccine orders and the number of doses administered in the united states between January and April 2019 as proxy-indicators of vaccine usage. Report results were consistent with our study findings as noticeable reductions in the number of non-influenza vaccine doses, specifically measles-containing vaccines, were observed for children below 2 years of age. The report also highlighted the declaration of a national emergency as a start point for deterioration in vaccine usage. Similar outcomes were observed in our study as the highest decrease rates in the utilization of immunization services were witnessed after the declaration of the general mobilization plan during the month of March 2020 in the public sector, and during the confinement period extending between February and April 2020 for the private sector [19] . The substantial reduction in vaccination services observed in our study between October 2019 and January 2020 before the detection of the first coronavirus case in Lebanon can be explained by the state of civil unrest due to the October 17 th , 2019 uprising coupled with road blockages and economic crisis. The road blockade were eased during December 2019 and thus private physicians regained their activities while the public sector was slower to recover as the trust of people in the State and all public services were deeply impacted by the news of corruption and inefficiency that accompanied the uprise.",

A study by Barden -O'Fallon et al. evaluating Ebola-related implications on newborn and child health service delivery and utilization in Guinea in both private and public facilities has revealed a 31% reduction in outpatient visits with child health services including immunization being the most affected by the Ebola epidemic [20] . Furthermore, our results indicated a 20% decrease in the provision of vaccination services at the primary healthcare level which was similarly observed in countries affected by the Ebola epidemic. A report entitled \"Rapid assessment of Ebola impact on reproductive health services and service seeking behavior in Sierra Leone\" indicated a 21% decrease in the proportion of children accessing primary healthcare units for key vaccination purposes during the Ebola epidemic [21] . Concerning the private sector, our findings highlighted a greater reduction in vaccine usage as compared to the public sector. An analogous pattern was observed by Barden-O'Fallon et al. where the utilization of services in private clinics, including vaccination, was most affected by the Ebola crisis [20] . Discrepancies in the results observed between the public and private sectors can be explained by the fact that all public healthcare facilities did not suspend the delivery of its services throughout the COVID-19 pandemic as per the recommendations of national public health authorities while some private physicians limited their services to urgent cases. Moreover, the economic crisis ongoing in the country may have shifted care seeking to primary healthcare centers where vaccines are free of charge. Another justification might be the accessibility to specific private clinics that can be challenging due to license plate restrictions, curfew measures and clinics' locations, whereas primary healthcare centers are often available in all areas.",

Nevertheless, decrease rates for measles vaccine detected in our study (-53 .3% in the private sector and -38% in the public sector) were greater than those stated in a report from the Ebola epidemic indicating a 20% decrease in measles coverage during December 2014 as compared to the previous year [22] . The inconsistencies with the literature can be associated with the difference in containment measures between the epidemics and length of the assessment period. When it comes to hepatitis A vaccine, which is administered solely in the private sector however deemed essential and recommended as per the Lebanese calendar developed by the Lebanese Pediatric Society, utilization rates has been reduced to more than half which indicates that the provision of vaccines that are excluded from the national immunization calendar are equally affected.",

To begin with, vaccine usage was assessed based on vaccine administration which is a proxy-indicator of vaccination coverage, rather than the latter itself. This was accomplished for ease of access to information and due to the impracticality of conducting coverage studies in pandemic circumstances. Moreover, assessing the utilization of vaccination services in the private sector was associated with several limitations. First, a relatively low survey response rate (26%) was identified, questioning the representativeness of the sample. Another limitation might be related to the methodology of our study where decrease rates in vaccine usage were determined by pediatricians based on subjective estimations as computerized patient records are rarely available. Hence, an overestimation of the observed rates is conceivable, and both recall and information biases are introduced. On the other hand, vaccination figures from the public sector are deemed of greater objectivity since they were extracted from electronic reports communicated on a regular basis by public immunization facilities with the ministry of public health.",
