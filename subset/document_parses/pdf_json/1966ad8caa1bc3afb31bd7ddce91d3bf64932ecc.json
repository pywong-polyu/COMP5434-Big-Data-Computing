            "text": "Open access deployed at scale in the UK. 6 7 Furthermore, while the condition itself is self-limiting in the majority of cases, a range of repurposed drugs are currently being used to alleviate symptoms and/or decrease mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients, mostly based on evidence emerging from clinical trials-including, for example, antiviral drugs that have previously been tested in conditions caused by similar viruses such as SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) or other viral infections such as HIV or Ebola 8 9 ; anti-inflammatory drugs including corticosteroids 10 and monoclonal antibodies [11] [12] [13] [14] ; and a raft of other drugs, from antibiotics 15 to interferons. 16 In addition, convalescent plasma therapy has been proposed. 17 With interest in this area remaining high, new study results being reported on a frequent basis, and several clinical trials still ongoing, treatment recommendations are rapidly updated 18 ; therefore, treatment guidelinesand, consequently, clinical practice-are likely to differ substantially, both across countries and over time. For instance, a recent multinational cohort study has investigated the use of repurposed and adjuvant drugs in hospitalised COVID-19 patients in China, South Korea, Spain, and the USA, and found that azithromycin, the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, and the antimalaria drug hydroxychloroquine were frequently used at the beginning of the pandemic; however, following reports of the non-effectiveness of these drugs in combination with safety issues related to hydroxychloroquine, their use has declined, and dexamethasone and remdesivir use have instead been increasing. In addition, use patterns differed considerably between these countries. 19 Dexamethasone, 20 remdesivir 21 and tocilizumab 22 have been recommended for use in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 within the UK based on randomised controlled trial evidence, most prominently the 'Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy' (RECOVERY) trial. 23 There is, however, currently limited real-world evidence available related to the use of these drugs in routine clinical practice. For instance, it is thus far unclear which patients are being prescribed dexamethasone, remdesivir and/or tocilizumab as part of their in-hospital treatment, and at what point; what the most common treatment patterns are; how the use of these drugs has changed since the start of the pandemic; and whether there are any geographical differences observable. Further evidence on the real-world clinical effectiveness and safety of these drugs is also required. 24 There have been few published studies of in-hospital drug utilisation. This has been due, in part, to patient-level data being unavailable as drug prescribing and administration records are paper-based in many secondary care settings. 25 The implementation of electronic prescribing in hospitals in Scotland has simplified data sharing across healthcare settings. The wider roll-out of the 'Hospital Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Administration' (HEPMA) system was initiated in 2014 26 in line with the Scottish eHealth strategy, 27 and HEPMA is now available to hospitals across five out of the 14 Health Boards in Scotland (regional organisations responsible for delivering healthcare to their respective populations). 28 Our aim is to contribute to addressing the prevailing knowledge gaps by conducting an exploratory drug utilisation study using data from in-hospital ePrescribing linked to the Early Estimation of Vaccine and Anti-Viral Effectiveness (EAVE II) COVID-19 surveillance platform. 24 This linked data will be analysed to provide an in-depth description of the treatments hospitalised COVID-19 patients receive (whether alone or in combination), and to describe the outcomes in these patients. The drugs of interest include dexamethasone, remdesivir and tocilizumab, based on information requests by clinicians working in this setting; these drugs are currently routinely used in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Scotland due to recent treatment recommendations.",

Comorbidities of interest will comprise mainly those conditions used to identify patients at high risk of adverse outcomes (ie, shielding list), 29 for example, respiratory disease (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cardiovascular diseases, diabetes (type 1 and type 2), chronic kidney disease and cancer; other comorbidities might also be included.
