Particularly in sheep, it is an important cause of the drop in production [1, 2] . This parasitic gastroenteritis is associated with different species of nematodes such as Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta, and Trichostrongylus axei that mainly act in the abomasum; Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Cooperia curticei, and Nematodirus spathiger in the small intestine; and Oesophagostomum venulosum in the large intestine [3] . In tropical areas, the most predominant are H. contortus and T. colubriformis [4] , which are considered the most important in small ruminants [5, 6] .",

The infection occurs when animals are grazing contaminated pasture, and the mix of larvae species (third-stage) ingested infects both the abomasum and intestine. The worm completes its development in adults in the gastrointestinal tract in approximately three weeks, and some species such as H. contortus may survive over a year inside a host sheep [7] . The gastrointestinal nematode parasitism may result in severe clinical disease, particularly related to the hematophagous H. contortus [8] . However, the disease is rarely due to just one parasitic species but rather to the cumulative effects of mixed parasitism [3] . Furthermore, the intensity of infection and clinical signs related to the disease could vary significantly depending on factors such as the severity of parasitism in the gastrointestinal tract, the general health and immunological status of the animal, type of climate and pasture, management, and diet [9] . Faecal worm egg counts (EPG) associated with the packed cell volume (PCV) are basic approaches that help to determine the severity of the infection [4, 10, 11] .",

In addition, the parasites lead to local oxidative damage during the digestion of host tissue [14] . Furthermore, in an attempt to damage the parasite, the host reacts by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which, depending on the antioxidant system's capacity, could produce a state of oxidative stress [15] . The local production and expression of oxidants and antioxidants in the gastrointestinal tract following a nematode challenge have been reported in sheep [16] . In addition, changes in serum biomarkers of oxidative stress have been described in lambs and sheep experimentally or naturally infected by gastrointestinal nematodes such as H. contortus [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

Daily at 6:00 a.m., all lambs were released from the shed to the paddocks where they grazed and had water ad libitum from drinking fountains.

In the late afternoon, the lambs were housed in a covered shed where they were feed with maise silage and concentrate. Maise with marandu palisade grass was sown in the same area in the summer, and mechanical harvesting for ensilage was conducted at the beginning of the autumn. The roughage:concentrate ratio was 30:70.

The TT is integrated mainly by free cysteine, glutathione, cysteine residues and albumin and includes both reduced and oxidised thiols, whereas SH represents only the reduced thiol [47] . The thiols have a high vulnerability to oxidation [45] , forming SS when oxidised [48, 49] .

This correlation was negative for TT, SH, SS and SH/TT ratio and positive for SS/TT and SS/SH ratios. Furthermore, the animals infected with more than 5000 EPG, independent of having anaemia or not, showed lower TT and SH than animals having lower than 5000 EPG. This may indicate that the infection by gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep causes changes in the steady-state balance between reduced and oxidised thiol. These changes consist in the decrease in the levels of reduced forms and increasing the oxidised components and consequently the ratios among SS and thiol forms, suggesting a state of oxidative stress. In addition, the results reveal that the more intense the parasite burden the greater the oxidative response. Similar changes have been described in sheep with sarcoptic mange [26] and in other species and parasitic diseases such as cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans [50] .",

Although the practice of only using anthelmintics was common in the past, it is not sustainable and has led to resistance [51, 52] . Therefore, an integrated approach (ICL) including environmental management and chemoprophylaxis to minimise the pressure for parasite adaptation and parasite control is frequently used nowadays [31] . In our study, the two different treatment methods used were efficient in decreasing parasite load and improving inflammation and oxidative status of the sheep. Our results are in line with a previous study in which the ICL associated with a good nutrition plan resulted in progressively declining degrees of gastrointestinal parasite infections and satisfactory performance of lambs [12] .",

In this study, FRAP did not change between groups; however, it increased after 70 days of study in G3, which could be in line with a previous study [19] that related its elevation to cellular protection during the infection with H. contortus in lambs. The antioxidant system has a cellular protective action against oxidative stress of cells, organs and tissue damage that results from parasitic invasion [55] . The depletion of systemic antioxidant status may reflect the increase in oxidative stress, which in this study was more pronounced in G1 and G2. The presence of the parasite increases mucosal damage and local oxidative stress, which depending on the intensity may lead to systemic changes. In addition, the pathogenesis of most parasitic infections has been associated with lipid peroxidation [56] . The increase in FOX in G1 after the treatment could be related to possible oxidative damage caused during the infection. However, additional studies are necessary to confirm this result.",

Moreover, in agreement with a previous study [57] , the use of various biomarkers should be strongly recommended for the evaluation of the redox balance in livestock species, in which reference intervals for each assay are still lacking. Additionally, the results of this study should be confirmed using a higher number of animals, and ideally, a healthy control group involving animals without parasites as well as a group of animals with more severe clinical signs of the disease should be included.",

The highly infected lambs showed lower TT and SH than those with a lower parasite burden. After treatment, these markers increased significantly in all groups of lambs, but the observed decreased SS/TT and SS/SH ratios were more intense in those highly infected animals. The results also indicated that the oxidised form of thiol decreased after reducing parasite load, where the thiol-disulphide homeostasis was more sensitive than other oxidative stress biomarkers in monitoring treatment. These results show that thiol-disulphide homeostasis is involved in parasitism by gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep and there is potential for using the biomarkers of this system to evaluate the severity of the disease and monitor treatment in sheep infected by gastrointestinal nematodes.
