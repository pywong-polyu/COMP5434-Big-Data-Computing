            "text": "This multicenter prospective phase 2 trial analyzed disease-free survival (DFS) in myelofibrosis patients receiving ruxolitinib for 6 months before transplantation. Seventy-six patients were recruited. Age-adjusted dynamic international prognostic scoring system was intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high in 27 (36%), 31 (41%), and 18 (24%) patients. All patients received ruxolitinib from inclusion to conditioning regimen (fludarabine-melphalan) or to progression. A donor was found in 64 patients: 18 HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD), 32 HLA-matched unrelated (UD10/10), and 14 HLA mismatched unrelated donor (UD9/10. Among 64 patients with a donor, 20 (31%) achieved a partial response before transplantation and 59 (92%) could be transplanted after ruxolitinib therapy (18/18 MSD, 30/21 UD10/10, 11/34 UD9/10), of whom 19 (32%) were splenectomized. Overall survival from inclusion was 68% at 12 months. One-year DFS after transplantation was 55%: 83%, 40%, and 34% after MSD, UD10/10 or UD9/10, respectively. Cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute graft-versushost disease (GVHD) was 66% and non-relapse-mortality was 42% at 12 months. Short course of ruxolitinib before transplantation is followed by a high rate of transplantation. With the platform used in this protocol, outcome was much better in patients transplanted with HLA-matched sibling donor as compared to unrelated donor.",

            "text": "Myelofibrosis (MF) is a chronic malignancy, characterized by marrow fibrosis and myeloproliferation due to constitutive activation in the janus-activated kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling pathway, mostly related to mutations in the driver genes JAK2, myeloproliferative leukemia virus (MPL) or calreticulin (CALR). In addition, comprehensive genomic characterization classified accurately this disease [1] . Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment that can be offered to younger, higherrisk patients who are fit enough to undergo this intensive therapy [2] . Unfortunately, there is a substantial proportion of failure after HSCT, either due to disease recurrence, graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), or toxicity. The general health of the patient before HSCT, disease features, and parameters related to the procedure is associated with post-transplant outcome [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor that reduces inflammation-related general symptoms and splenomegaly, has been approved in many countries for patients with myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib does not suppress fibrosis, or the malignant clone burden, but, although still a matter of debate, may improve life expectancy in very high-risk patients [12, 13] . We report here the results of a phase 2 prospective trial in myelofibrosis, using ruxolitinib in treatment-naive patients before HSCT. The primary aim was disease-free survival (DFS) 12 months after HSCT. The hypothesis was a reduction of general symptoms and an improvement of performance status before HSCT, which may improve post-HSCT outcome, with a better engraftment, a lower toxicity, and lower mortality. Furthermore, need for splenectomy before HSCT, performed in 40% of patients in France and potentially complicated by thrombosis or hemorrhage, may be reduced after ruxolitinib [6] . Concerns were that pre-transplant ruxolitinib may be associated with (1) a \"withdrawal effect\" after stopping ruxolitinib before HSCT, (2) a poor engraftment, (3) an increased risk of infection, and (4) a potential decreased graft-versus-leukemia effect due to its immunosuppressive properties.",

The study was approved by the national legal body and by ethical committee Paris IV, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, informed consent were obtained for all patients. The primary aim was DFS 1 year after allogeneic transplantation. Secondary objectives were splenectomy rate, engraftment, GVHD incidence, overall survival (OS), NRM, cytokine profile, assessment of quality of life, and symptoms related to the myelofibrosis. Patients with intermediate or high-risk MF according to Lille score [14] or DIPSS [15] , naive of JAK inhibitor treatment, aged from 18 to 69 years could be included. Ruxolitinib treatment and search for a donor were started, with the aim of performing the HSCT within 6 months after inclusion. Exclusion criteria, ruxolitinib treatment management, and transplant procedure protocols are detailed in Supplemental Data. Conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day for 3 days and Melphalan 140 mg/m 2 for 1 day. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. Anti-thymocyte globulin in the setting of an unrelated donor was left to the physician's discretion. Due to severe adverse events (SAE) and the possible relationship with ruxolitinib or RWS, several amendments had to be made during the protocol, as well as an interruption of inclusions from June 3, 2013 to October 8, 2014 before being validated by legal authorities (Supplemental Data and Fig. S1 for recruitment). Among changes, ruxolitinib discontinuation before transplantation was progressive within 15 days in the initial protocol and abrupt just before melphalan after amendment.",

Cardiogenic shocks occurred during systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which was not microbiologically documented. All but one patients with cardiogenic shock had a complete cardiac recovery without ruxolitinib reintroduction. The three other patients with cardiac SAE had moderate left ventricular ejection dysfunction, associated with major fluid retention in two patients and respiratory distress for one patient. Three patients developed a possible RWS without any cardiac failure (patients \"a\", \"g\", \"j\"). Patient \"a\" had ruxolitinib discontinuation for pancytopenia grade 4 and splenomegaly worsening under treatment. He developed a febrile renal failure, followed by multi-organ failure and death, with blood cultures positive for Enterococcus faecium. Patient \"g\" developed fever, increasing splenomegaly, and hypotension after ruxolitinib was transiently stopped, which resolved after re-initiation of ruxolitinib. Patient \"j\" developed fever during the peri-operative period of the splenectomy, which resolved under steroids, but also had a splenic thrombosis and attack of gout, which may also explain the inflammatory process (as well as surgery). Three patients had TLS (patient \"b\", \"d\", \"l\") 24 to 72 h after Melphalan and one of them had significant renal failure reaching the stage of clinical TLS in the Cairo-Bishop definitions [41] .",

In this trial, ruxolitinib was stopped before the conditioning regimen, either progressively (first part of the trial) or abruptly (after amendment). The probability to undergo the transplantation after ruxolitinib initiation was excellent (92%). This trial is one of the only prospective trial considering myelofibrosis patients at time of transplantation indication (and not just before transplantation) allowing the analysis of potential events between ruxolitinib initiation and transplantation. While outcome was very good with MSD, it was disappointing with UD. Higher mortality in patients who received a transplant from an unrelated donor was due to higher rate of hyperacute and grades 3-4 GVHD. In particular, more than 80% of patients transplanted from an HLA mismatched unrelated donor developed grade 3-4 acute GVHD. However, poor survival in patients with UD9/10 donor also included 2 patients who were never transplanted due to cardiac failure; all patients who were transplanted from UD9/10 had no response to ruxolitinib eventually explaining worse outcome in these patients who had possibly an advanced disease which is a potential bias in the study. Splenectomy was still performed in 30% of patients while it was 37% of patients in the last French registry study, showing that it was not dramatically decreased by ruxolitinib use [6] . One can argue that the ruxolitinib time was too short to achieve a significant spleen reduction, this point could not be assessed in the trial. Regarding the relative good survival in patients without a donor, the trial was not designed to analyze this secondary objective and more patients would be necessary to confirm this observation.",

            "text": "Mortality and acute GVHD risk have been regularly reported as higher in myelofibrosis patients receiving a transplant from an unrelated donor [7, 23, 24] . A combination of factors might explain this higher mortality: the use of melphalan, reported as more toxic than busulfan; [25] the absence of systematical use of anti-thymoglobulin (73% in unrelated transplant); an inflammatory cytokine profile; the combination of cyclosporine and mycophenolate GVHD prophylaxis and the use of peripheral-blood stem cells for all patients. ATG was associated with a lower risk of acute GVHD in our trial without reaching significance but statistical power was limited due to the low number of patients (HR < 0.5). Several prospective phase 3 studies have recently reported lower risk of GVHD with ATG (in different diseases) confirming that ATG may be recommended in these situations [26] [27] [28] . More recently, the question of ATG has been also addressed in the setting of HLAmatched sibling donor in a phase 3 trial and in an EBMT registry for myelofibrosis patients, showing a decreased risk of acute or chronic GVHD [29, 30] . Regarding GVHD prophylaxis, it has been reported by CIBMTR in AML patients received RIC and MUD that cyclosporine and mycophenolate were followed by higher risk of acute GVHD as compared to the combination cyclosporine and methotrexate [31] . The role of ruxolitinib on post-transplant outcome is difficult to determine, since the trial was not designed to compare patients with and without ruxolitinib. We suspected that progressive ruxolitinib discontinuation before conditioning regimen was associated with higher risk of complication and mortality. We could observe that the , IL-12 p70, IL-17A, IL-1ra/IL-1F3, IL-33, IL-5, IL-7,  TRAIL, CD40, HGF, IL-21, IL-27, MMP-3, Pentraxin 3, ST2, TPO,  LOLX2, Epo, IL-18, IL-22, CD25/IL-2 R alpha, VEGF-A, Reg3A , TNF RI, Trappin-2, IL-9, OSM. Serum levels of selected biomarkers are shown as heat maps (Panels a, b, c) they were selected by partial least square discriminant analysis for biomarkers with variable importance in the projection (VIP) score > 1). Each row constitutes the mean for several patients. Each column constitutes the period of serum collection. Blue and red denote markers that are expressed at lower and higher levels, respectively. a Cytokine profile from inclusion to 3-month post-inclusion. This panel shows the increase or decrease of biomarkers value (logarithmic transformation of the means and autoscaling) in biomarkers obtained from patients at inclusion (n = 54, before ruxolitinib) compared with 3 months after inclusion (n = 55, on ruxolitinib). The a shows that cytokines are down-expressed, except for the first four cytokines (first to fourth row). b Cytokines profile in responders and non-responders to ruxolitinib. This panel shows the cytokine value at inclusion and at month three in responders (n = 13) and non-responders (n = 42) to ruxolitinib. Comparing column two to column three, we can see which cytokines are differentially expressed in responders and non-responders. c Cytokine profile in patients with or without GVHD. This panel shows cytokine values at inclusion and at month three in patients who will develop GVHD and in patients who will not. risks of acute GVHD, NRM, and overall mortality were reduced when ruxolitinib was abruptly stopped but it did not reach significance, again, possibly due to low number of patients. We could observe that the cytokine profile was modified by ruxolitinib, as previously reported by others [32] . In addition, non-responders to ruxolitinib, and patients who developed acute GVHD, had close cytokines profiles, suggesting that an inappropriate biological response to ruxolitinib could be associated with the subsequent development of acute GVHD. The rebound of cytokines associated with ruxolitinib withdrawal has been suspected in this trial, as well as by others [20, 21, 33, 34] , but it was extremely difficult to prove. Firstly, there is no worldwide accepted definition of the syndrome, so we had to give a definition in order to prospectively capture and declare potential RWS. Furthermore, there were multiple interactions, which could explain symptoms presented by the patients. TLS which was not included in the definition of RWS, occurred in 5% of transplanted patients and always in days after melphalan.",

Salit et al. reported 28 patients from a prospective study treated by ruxolitinib and who received HSCT [36] .

No RWS was reported. A retrospective assessment by Kroger et al. explored the question of ruxolitinib given prior and after transplantation in 11 patients with myelofibrosis (MF) and observed a very low incidence of acute GVHD [37] .

The results were poorer in patients transplanted from unrelated donor than in those transplanted from SIB. Many different reasons may have contributed to this difference. In view of these results, the question of the timing of transplantation in newly diagnosed patients can be raised, especially in patients without a MSD, taking also into account that a delayed transplantation may expose to the risk of AML transformation, a stage with a very poor outcome after transplantation [39, 40] . The future national trials will test other conditions that may decrease GVHD and mortality in myelofibrosis patients transplanted from an unrelated donor.",
