These consequences are recognized as a separate pathophysiological entity, entitled post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), and may have a strong, negative impact on functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). For these reasons, HRQOL has emerged as an important measure of outcome in ICU survivors. Numerous studies, including meta-analyses, have reported poor HRQOL in ICU survivors in the months and years following hospital discharge when compared to normal controls [1] [2] [3] . Factors related to worse HRQOL are age, sex, health status prior to ICU admission, length of ICU stay, the severity of illness, the presence of organ failures, the admission diagnosis, and the quality of sleep after ICU discharge [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

More specifically, the time required for HRQOL recovery is not defined, and therefore, the optimal follow-up period for evaluation remains undetermined. The instruments used in the studies to assess HRQOL, along with other psychometric tools, are different, thereby complicating the systematization and interpretation of results. The populations studied may also differ, ranging from general ICU patients to patients with respiratory failure or trauma [7, 8] . Finally, the parameters in each study can also vary significantly. Some studies have focused on factors that existed prior to critical illness, others on the severity of critical illness and ICU-related factors, while others have focused mostly on post-ICU factors and related interventions [9] .",

All patients admitted to the ICU from 1 August 2017 through 31 December 2019 were assessed for eligibility. We evaluated ICU survivors one year after ICU discharge. Inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 68 years, ICU admission requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for more than three days, and survival at the time of the interview. We restricted inclusion age below 68 years since this is the usual retirement age in Greece, and we wanted to assess the \"return to previous occupation\" as a component of the quality of life. Exclusion criteria included the inability to attend the interview due to a long distance of residence, the inability to communicate, or still in a rehabilitation facility. Eligible patients were assessed for participation by telephone contact, and if patients agreed, an appointment for psychometric assessment was scheduled. Data retrieved from the electronic medical records included patients' demographics, the reason for hospital and ICU admission, length of ICU stay, previous medical history, and comorbidities. Additional information collected during the interview included family status, educational status, and occupation information. During the appointments, the patients were asked to complete the relevant questionnaires. All interviews were performed by a trained psychologist. Since there are no normal cut-off values for the WHOQOL-Bref, the questionnaire was also administered to a control group of subjects, age and sex-matched, who had never been admitted to the ICU and had no known comorbidities.",

It is a shorter version of the WHOQOL-100. Both were developed by WHO and were published in 1995. The WHOQOL-Bref questionnaire is one of the best-known instruments that has been developed for cross-cultural comparisons of quality of life, and it is available in many languages and has been validated for the Greek population [10] . It is composed of 26 questions on the individual's perceptions of health and well-being and covers four domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environmental quality of life. Responses to questions are on a 1-5 Likert scale. Raw domain scores are then transformed to a 1-100 score according to an equation provided in the instructions. Formal training is recommended for scoring and interpretation purposes; however, minimal training is required for administration [11] .

One possible explanation for this finding is that lack of comorbidities is compatible with better recovery of physical function. This also partly explains why rehabilitation trials testing numerous interventions during and after ICU have been proven ineffective in improving HRQOL [9] . There is, however, a counterargument in this theory. Orwelius et al. [22] used questionnaires administered to ICU patients who survived 6 months after ICU discharge to retrospectively assess pre-ICU health status. Their analysis suggested that even though the preexisting disease was a strong independent determinant of HRQOL, it was potentially subject to recall and response bias. In view of this argument, it is important that, in our study, results are based on medical records retrieved at the time of ICU admission rather than on post-ICU evaluation. Our results add to the body of evidence emphasizing the importance of considering comorbidities when discussing HRQOL as an outcome. We were not able to establish a relationship between impaired HRQOL and factors that have been previously related to worse HRQOL, such as unemployment, living alone, and the presence of cognitive decline [7, 8] . It is worth mentioning, though, that in our population, the frequency of cognitive decline, as described by the MMSE, was only 11%. This significantly lower percentage compared to other studies [23] is not surprising due to the inclusion of a younger population.",

On the contrary, most studies examining depressive symptomatology state that post-ICU depressive symptoms were associated with substantially lower HRQOL [24] . A high score in the CES-D scale for depressive symptoms was observed in 28% of our study population, a frequency comparable to that described in the literature, ranging from 28% to 33% [24] . Early post-ICU depressive symptoms are identified as a strong risk factor for subsequent depressive symptoms in ICU survivors, and therefore, the mental health and well-being of this population can be affected for prolonged periods of time.

Almost one-third of the patients in our study scored higher than the cutoff value in the IES-R scale. Interestingly, PTSD was once believed to stem primarily from experiences such as combat, assault, and exposure to natural disasters. It is now accepted as the most frequently identified anxiety disorder in ICU survivors. Despite being repeatedly identified as a factor affecting HRQOL, there is still an ongoing debate on the prevalence and severity of PTSD in ICU survivors, and the reported PTSD prevalence rates in different studies range from 5% to 63%. In a recent meta-analysis, the one-year prevalence of PTSD was reported to be approximately 20% [26] . We observed a higher rate of reported PTSD symptoms. What is more striking, though, is the frequency of abnormally high scores in the S-STAI and T-STAI scales for state and trait anxiety symptoms, respectively. The majority of our patients scored high in both scales, 96% and 72% for the S-STAI and the T-STAI, respectively. In the literature, the frequency for nonspecific anxiety ranges from 23% to 41% [21] . There are at least two possible explanations for this deviation. On the one hand, a high percentage of the interviews took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, a higher anxiety level is reasonably expected, particularly for health-related matters [27] . On the other hand, our study population included younger patients, who frequently returned to previous activities and employment. These features can be related to high expectations that may stimulate anxiety for their fulfilment.",

We provided supporting evidence to the notion that comorbidities play an important role in HRQOL outcomes in ICU populations. Most of the therapeutic interventions after ICU discharge focus on improving functional ability by means of physiotherapy and rehabilitation, and for good reasons. Critical illness can have devastating consequences on functional ability, muscular strength, and physiological reserve. However, little is known about the effect of different treatments on symptoms of anxiety and depression after ICU discharge. Likewise, little is known about the psychological morbidities of those patients who manage to achieve a good functional recovery and even return to work. They may represent a part of the population willing and able to contribute, who could significantly benefit from appropriate interventions. The best course of action for these patients could be early intervention, even prior to ICU discharge [28] . Interestingly, it has been reported that the mental health domain scores initially improved during the first year following ICU discharge and then declined to the hospital discharge levels at two years [7] . Inadequate psychological intervention could be an explanation for the delayed improvement of HRQOL or even a lack thereof.",

Firstly, our data did not contain information on the severity of illness, such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) or the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. The inclusion of such data would have allowed us to add to the existing knowledge on the relative importance of preexisting comorbidities versus acute illness factors in relation to HRQOL [1, 9] . Secondly, the lack of power analysis for sample size estimation and the high mortality and dropout rate in our initial population increased the risk of bias. Indeed, the final sample of our cohort included mostly patients with good recovery who were able to resume their previous activities. Nevertheless, the impact on their quality of life was significant, and their stress levels were higher than the levels described in other studies. A ratio different from the usual 1:1 between cases and control subjects was chosen because the search for participants in the cases group provided more subjects than the search for the control group. This would be expected to lead to loss of power, yet, for a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, a post hoc calculation regarding the comparisons of quality of life scales yielded a power level of 0.818. It would have been more impactful to compare the ICU survivor group to a chronic condition group who had never been admitted to an ICU. Moreover, our results are descriptive; no inference on the effect of tentative covariates was attempted because our sample could be considered to be one of convenience and not a random one. Finally, the sample size was relatively small, making it difficult to generalize our findings. Notwithstanding these limitations, this was a prospective study that applied different psychometric scales in order to assess the mental well-being of ICU survivors; it comprises one of the few studies reporting outcomes from southern Europe and the only one we are aware of in the Greek population.",

High levels of anxiety may be present in ICU survivors who achieve a good recovery, and this finding warrants further investigation since this population could benefit significantly from appropriate psychological and medical support.
