            "text": "We present the spectroscopic and photometric study of five intermediate-luminosity red transients (ILRTs), namely AT 2010dn, AT 2012jc, AT 2013la, AT 2013lb, and AT 2018aes. They share common observational properties and belong to a family of objects similar to the prototypical ILRT SN 2008S. These events have a rise time that is less than 15 days and absolute peak magnitudes of between \u221211.5 and \u221214.5 mag. Their pseudo-bolometric light curves peak in the range 0.5 -9.0 \u00d7 10 40 erg s \u22121 and their total radiated energies are on the order of (0.3 -3) \u00d7 10 47 erg. After maximum brightness, the light curves show a monotonic decline or a plateau, resembling those of faint supernovae IIL or IIP, respectively. At late phases, the light curves flatten, roughly following the slope of the 56 Co decay. If the late-time power source is indeed radioactive decay, these transients produce 56 Ni masses on the order of 10 \u22124 to 10 \u22123 M . The spectral energy distribution of our ILRT sample, extending from the optical to the mid-infrared (MIR) domain, reveals a clear IR excess soon after explosion and non-negligible MIR emission at very late phases. The spectra show prominent H lines in emission with a typical velocity of a few hundred km s \u22121 , along with Ca II features. In particular, the [Ca ii] \u03bb7291,7324 doublet is visible at all times, which is a characteristic feature for this family of transients. The identified progenitor of SN 2008S, which is luminous in archival Spitzer MIR images, suggests an intermediate-mass precursor star embedded in a dusty cocoon. We propose the explosion of a super-asymptotic giant branch star forming an electron-capture supernova as a plausible explanation for these events.",

Their typical peak absolute magnitudes are between \u221213 and \u221215 mag, and their spectra show narrow emission lines similar to Type IIn SNe (Schlegel 1990; Filippenko 1997) . Giant eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs) are considered a plausible interpre-The third group of gap transients are named intermediateluminosity red transients (ILRTs; , and references therein). These show a slow rise time (\u2248 2 weeks) to maximum (\u221211.5 mag <M V < \u221214.5 mag), followed by a linear decline or a plateau lasting about 2-4 months. When late-time light curves are observed, they decline following the expectation of 56 Co decay. Their light curves resemble those of very faint SNe IIP/L. The spectra are similar to Type IIn SNe with narrow Balmer lines in emission, but are characterised by prominent Ca ii lines (e.g. Ca H&K, [Ca ii] doublet, and Ca ii near-infrared triplet); in particular, the [Ca ii] \u03bb\u03bb 7291, 7324 doublet is always visible at all phases. ILRTs are linked to 8-15 M progenitors and are strong mid-infrared (MIR) emitters, suggesting their progenitors are embedded in dusty cocoons (see Prieto et al. 2008; Bond et al. 2009; Botticella et al. 2009; Berger et al. 2009b ; Thompson et al. 2009 ). However, their origin remains mysterious and different scenarios are contemplated. These transients have been proposed to be LBV-like outbursts of moderate-mass stars (e.g. Smith et al. 2009; Andrews et al. 2020) or stellar mergers (e.g. Kasliwal et al. 2011) . A third suggested scenario is that we are actually observing faint CC SN explosions triggered by electron captures in the core of super-asymptotic giant branch (S-AGB) stars, and these are therefore labelled electron-capture (EC) SNe (see, e.g. Botticella et al. 2009; Pumo et al. 2009 ). In recent years, a number of ILRTs have been studied, including SN 2008S (see, e.g. Prieto et al. 2008; Botticella et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2009; Kochanek 2011; Szczygie\u0142 et al. 2012; Adams et al. 2016) , NGC 300-2008OT1 (NGC 300 OT hereafter) (e.g. Berger et al. 2009b; Bond et al. 2009; Prieto et al. 2009; Kashi et al. 2010; Humphreys et al. 2011 ), M85 OT2006-1 1 Pastorello et al. 2007; Rau et al. 2007 ), PTF10fqs (Kasliwal et al. 2011) , AT 2017be (Stephens et al. 2017; Adams et al. 2018; Cai et al. 2018) , and AT 2019abn (Jencson et al. 2019; Williams et al. 2020 , Valerin et al. 2021 .",

            "text": "2.1. Host galaxies: distance, reddening and metallicity AT 2010dn was discovered by the amateur astronomer K. Itagaki in May 2010 at 31.523 UT (hereafter UT will be used throughout this paper) at an unfiltered magnitude 17.5 mag (CBAT 3 ). The object was detected at RA=10 h 18 m 19 s .89, Dec=+41 \u2022 26 28 .80 [J2000], 61 north and 33 east from the centre of NGC 3184. We adopt d = 14.40 \u00b1 0.33 Mpc (\u00b5 = 30.79 \u00b1 0.05 mag) as the distance to the host galaxy, as obtained from Cepheids (Ferrarese et al. 2000) . The Galactic reddening E(B \u2212 V) Gal = 0.017 mag is from Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) . The presence of narrow interstellar Na I D (\u03bb\u03bb 5890, 5896) absorption in the transient spectra at the host galaxy redshift is usually considered as evidence for additional internal extinction (e.g. Munari & Zwitter 1997; Turatto et al. 2003; Pozzo et al. 2006; Sahu et al. 2006; Poznanski et al. 2011) . In this case, the equivalent width (EW) of Na I D varies with time, suggesting that this dust is likely due to circumstellar material (CSM) . For this reason, we neglect the possible host component of extinction and adopt a total reddening E(B \u2212 V) Total = E(B \u2212 V) Gal = 0.017 mag, in agreement with Smith et al. (2011) .",

Howerton and the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS 4 ) in March 2012 at 27.460 UT (Berger et al. 2012; Howerton et al. 2012 ). Its coordinates are: RA=14 h 53 m 53 s .95, Dec=+03 \u2022 34 04 .90 [J2000], and it is located at 85 north and 55 west from the centre of NGC 5775. Based on the weighted average of several estimates using the Tully-Fisher method (e.g. Tully et al. 2013; Sorce et al. 2014; Tully et al. 2016 ) from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic database (NED 5 ), a distance of d = 18.62\u00b11.12 Mpc (hence \u00b5 = 31.35\u00b10.13 mag) can be estimated for NGC 5775. A Galactic reddening E(B \u2212 V) Gal = 0.037 mag (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011 ) is adopted. We measure a constant EW 0.9 \u00c5 for the Na i D absorption at the redshift of NGC 5775 in the early spectra of the transient. Following Turatto et al. (2003) and assuming R V = 3.1 (Cardelli et al. 1989) , we obtain a host galaxy reddening of E(B \u2212 V) Host = 0.144 mag. Hence, the total reddening towards AT 2012jc is E(B \u2212 V) Total = 0.181 mag.",

Photometric measurements were performed through a dedicated pipeline, ecsnoopy 12 . ecsnoopy is a python-based script, which makes use of a series of packages for photometry and template subtraction (e.g. sextractor 13 , daophot 14 , hotpants 15 ; Bertin & Arnouts 1996; Stetson 1987; Becker 2015) . Individual instrumental magnitudes were measured with the point-spread function (PSF) fitting technique. We first subtracted the background contaminating the object using a low-order polynomial fit. A standard PSF template was constructed by fitting the profiles of several isolated stars (usually from 5 to 10 stars) in the SN frames. The PSF model was then fitted to the target source, and the goodness of the fit was evaluated by inspecting the residuals at the SN location. When the object was faint or had a complex background, we used the template-subtraction technique to remove the background contamination from our measurements. Specifically, we applied it to measurements of AT 2010dn, AT 2013la, and AT 2018aes. The errors were estimated via artificial star tests, in which several fake stars were placed close to the SN location. The fake stars were fitted with the PSF method, and the standard deviation of these measurements provided us the instrumental errors. These were combined in quadrature with the PSF-fit error, finally providing the total photometry error.",

These pBCD images are composed of a mosaic image, after rejection of most instrumental artefacts, an uncertainty image, and an associated coverage image which is the map of how many frames per position are available to generate the mosaic image. We note that AT 2010dn was targeted at 14 epochs by the Spitzer Space Telescope during 2010 -2015 and the data are available from Spitzer Heritage Archive (SHA) 18 . We took the Spitzer images from 2019 September 14 as templates 19 , which were matched and transformed to each epoch of the observed images and then subtracted using hotpants (Becker 2015). We performed aperture photometry on the subtracted images using a small (4\u00d70.6 pBCD pixel) aperture, and then applied an aperture correction and a conversion from MJy/sr to mJy/pix to get the fluxes. With this approach, we obtained ten detections for the CH1 and CH2 channels over a time-span of five years (from 2010 to 2015). For a few other epochs we have non-detections down to 3\u03c3.

At the later phases (>100 days), B \u2212 V becomes bluer again, from 0.8 to 0.5 mag. At similar epochs, the R \u2212 I/r \u2212 i colours increase from \u223c 0.1 -0.3 mag to 0.5 -1.0 mag ( Figure 3, panel b) . Very late-time colours show a large dispersion. AT 2013la is somewhat discrepant, with the r \u2212 i colour becoming bluer (reaching \u223c \u22120.2 mag) than at early epochs. The J \u2212 K colour usually shows a minimum at 30-70 days. The best-sampled NIR dataset is that of NGC 300 OT, which allows us to estimate a minimum value of \u223c 1.1 mag. Later, J \u2212 K rises to 3.0 mag at \u223c 230 days ( Figure 3 , panel c). As shown in Figure 3 , the comparison objects are bluer (e.g. SN 2018zd and SN 2005cs: B \u2212 V \u2248 \u22120.2 mag) at early phase and become redder (e.g. SN 2005cs: B \u2212 V \u2248 2.0 mag at tail phase) over time.",

However, in most cases, observations at wavelengths shorter than the u band, and longer than I/i-band are not available. For this reason, to achieve meaningful comparisons among ILRTs, we computed pseudo-bolometric light curves including only the contribution from the B to the I/i band. We first converted the extinction-corrected magnitudes to flux densities, and finally integrated the SEDs at their effective wavelengths, assuming a negligible flux contribution outside of the integration region. The resulting pseudo-bolometric light curves are pre-sented in Figure 5 , while peak luminosities are reported in Table 3. They show faint peak luminosities ranging from 0.5 \u00d7 10 40 erg s \u22121 to 9.0 \u00d7 10 40 erg s \u22121 . For comparison, the claimed EC SNe SN 2018zd and SN 2015bf have peak luminosities of \u223c 3.7 \u00d7 10 42 erg s \u22121 and the faint Type IIP SN 1999br is about 4.7 \u00d7 10 40 erg s \u22121 (see Figure 5 ). The pseudo-bolometric light curve shapes of ILRTs are broadly similar to Type IIP (in particular, PTF10fqs and AT 2017be) and/or Type IIL (SN 2008S and AT 2012jc) SNe, as demonstrated in Figure 5 . In analogy to Type IIP SNe, the light curves for ILRTs are influenced by a number of factors, such as the presence of a CSM, the H recombination timescale, and 56 Ni distribution. Finally, we perform a non-parametric fit using the ReFANN 21 code to reconstruct the pseudo-bolometric light curve, and integrate it over the covered photometric evolution. The resulting radiated energies are in the range of (0.30 -2.94) \u00d7 10 47 erg, with values reported in Table 3 . These values should be regarded as lower limits due to our incomplete wavelength coverage and limited temporal coverage. These observed ILRTs radiated energies are fractions of about 10 \u22124 -10 \u22123 of the theoretical predictions for the explosion energy of EC SNe (about 10 50 erg, Kitaura et al. 2006; Wanajo et al. 2009; Tominaga et al. 2013 ). Stritzinger et al. (2020b) pointed out that theoretical EC SN simulations may overpredict the explosion energy. Therefore, this discrepancy should be considered in future observations and modelling efforts.",

Unfortunately, most objects do not have MIR observations, and optical and/or NIR light-curve information is sometimes incomplete at late times. SN 2008S and NGC 300 OT are exceptions, as 21 ReFANN is a nonlinear interpolating tool based on Artificial Neural Networks that can reconstruct functions from data (see https://github.com/Guo-Jian-Wang/refann). they were followed until late phases, and also have MIR coverage. Observations of these two objects revealed that the SEDs of ILRTs shift from the optical to the MIR domain, with the MIR being dominant at late phases (e.g. Botticella et al. 2009; Kochanek 2011) . To mitigate the limited observational information available for other objects, we adopted SN 2008S as a template for other ILRTs, and assumed that all others share the same SED evolution. Hence, we used SN 2008S to determine the bolometric corrections for all ILRTs that had incomplete wavelength coverage. We estimated the optical and NIR luminosity contribution of SN 2008S, using the bolometric light curve model (L bol = L 0 \u00d7 exp(\u2212t/t 0 ) + L 1 , with L 0 10 7.3 L , L 1 10 5.8 L and t 0 48 days) from Kochanek (2011) . We first computed the L opt L bol , L NIR L bol , and L opt +L NIR L bol ratios at late phases for SN 2008S. The L opt , L NIR , and L opt + L NIR contributions for other ILRTs at the same phases were then calculated, assuming the same ratios as for SN 2008S. Specifically, L bol was computed starting from the measured L opt + L NIR for AT 2010dn, from L opt for AT 2013la, and L NIR for AT 2017be, and then by applying the adopted bolometric corrections.",

The first optical to MIR SED is obtained at t \u223c30.6 days after maximum, which clearly reveals an IR excess over a single black body (BB) model (see the top panel of Figure 6 ). Hence, the SED was fitted with twocomponent ( We also measured the residual flux at the location of AT 2010dn in Spitzer MIR images taken more than 3 years (+1333 days) after the outburst, and constructed a very late-time SED. This SED can be reproduced by a single BB function with a characteristic temperature of 440 K (see the bottom panel of Figure 6 ). We caution that this temperature should be regarded as an indicative value because of the limited coverage of MIR data. Similarly, AT 2012jc has very late-phase (+1155 days) Spitzer MIR photometric fluxes suggesting a BB temperature of about 600 K. Based on the similarity of these three cases, we suggest that this SED evolution seems to be typical of ILRTs. A plausible explanation is that a dusty environment has formed through mass-loss events prior to the ILRT outbursts, in analogy to what is frequently observed in a few CC SNe (e.g. SN 1995N, SN 1998S, SN 2010jl, SN 2014ab, SN 2015da; see Gerardy et al. 2002; Andrews et al. 2011; Fransson et al. 2014; Tartaglia et al. 2020; Moriya et al. 2020) . The slowly declining IR flux lasting around 4 years suggests that the outer dust shell was not destroyed by the radiation field emitted by the luminous outburst (regardless of the physical mechanism that produced the ILRTs; Botticella et al. 2009 ",

At all epochs, the spectra have an almost featureless continuum, which is relatively blue at early phases, becoming redder with time. Narrow emission lines of the Balmer series are superposed on the continuum, with H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 being the most prominent spectral features. Weak Fe ii lines are also observed, along with Na I D and Ca H&K in absorption. Apart from the H lines, the most prominent spectral emissions are the [Ca ii] doublet (\u03bb\u03bb 7291, 7324) and the Ca NIR triplet (\u03bb\u03bb 8498, 8542, 8662) . In addition, O i, Fe ii, Sc ii and Ba ii lines are also tentatively identified in some spectra with decent S/N and resolution (e.g. see a GTC/OSIRIS spectrum at + 41.9 d of AT 2013la). Detailed line identification performed on the bestquality spectra of the five transients is given in Figure 8 . We note that the lines of the [Ca ii] doublet are visible in all spectra with good S/N shown in this paper and are therefore considered a characteristic feature of ILRTs. In Figure 9 , all ILRTs share almost the same spectral features, supporting a remarkable overall homogeneity in their observables. However, as shown in Figure  9 , the spectra of the comparison objects show much bluer contin- During the follow-up campaign of AT 2013la, we collected spectra covering all the evolutionary phases. Hence, we take AT 2013la as a representative object to describe the spectral evolution of ILRTs. The spectral continuum evolves quite slowly, from initially blue (e.g. at phase \u223c +13.2 d) to much redder at late phases (+360.0 d). AT 2013la resembles other ILRT spectra in its continuum evolution and characteristic lines. However, we see additional strong He I (5876 \u00c5) absorption feature in all GTC/OSIRIS spectra, most clearly at +42.2, +65.2, +202.9, +231.9, and +360.3 days (see middle right panel in Figure 7 ). We note that narrow P-Cygni absorptions imposed on H\u03b1 lines are also detected in the highest resolution spectra (see e.g. the GTC/OSIRIS spectra of AT 2013la in Figures 7 and 13) . Such spectra allow us to infer the wind velocity via measurement of the position of the deep minimum of the P-Cygni profiles. This blueshifted absorption component on top of the H\u03b1 emission (see Figure 13 ) has velocities of \u223c 360 -410 km s \u22121 , and may originate from a dense, slow-moving wind. This is discussed more widely in Sect. 4.2.",

We measure the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of H\u03b1 through a single Lorentzian function fit, as in general this type of fit accurately describes the line profiles of narrow-lined SNe (e.g. SNe IIn; see Taddia et al. 2013; Smith 2017; Nyholm et al. 2017) . The H\u03b1 profile is dominated by a narrow component in the spectra of most objects (e.g. AT 2010dn, AT 2012jc, AT 2013lb, and AT 2018aes). However, AT 2013la shows H\u03b1 with a more complex profile, with narrow, blueshifted P-Cygni absorption lines. For AT 2013la, we therefore fitted the H\u03b1 emission lines in our higher resolution spectra (i.e. at phases +65.2d, +202.9, +231.9 and +360.3d) via multiple components: an intermediate-width Lorentzian profile, a narrow Gaussian emission and a Gaussian absorption. We also fitted the H\u03b1 line at phase +42.2d with 23 These critical phases are fixed on the basis of relatively large changes in the colour evolution. Table 5 and plotted in Figure 11 . We note that most spectra of our sample have modest resolution. Hence, in most instances our measurements have to be considered upper limits for the expansion velocities. We also measured the H\u03b1 velocity for the comparison objects in Figure 11 , which were inferred from the minima of the broad P-Cygni absorptions. These show a remarkably large velocity evolution, ranging from \u223c 8000 km s \u22121 to \u223c 1000 km s \u22121 . In contrast, ILRTs show a slow evolution in H\u03b1 velocity (< 1000 km s \u22121 ) over the entire monitoring campaigns. In Figure 12 , we show the temporal evolution of H\u03b1 profiles in the velocity space for AT 2013la, SN 2018zd, and SN 2005cs. AT 2013la shows a modest velocity evolution in H\u03b1 profile, while SN 2018zd and SN 2005cs experience significant velocity evolution along with the gradual emergence of broad P-Cygni features.",

We conclude that in all ILRTs the ejected material expands with similar velocities of several hundred km s \u22121 . In most cases the FWHM of the [Ca ii] doublet is below the resolution limits, and we do not have reliable estimates for the outflow velocity inferred from this feature. The doublet is resolved only in the spectra of AT 2010dn at \u22123.0 d, providing an FWHM velocity of 145 km s \u22121 . The feature was also resolved in a spectrum of AT 2012jc at phase \u22126.2 d, where we measured v FWHM \u223c 220 km s \u22121 . For AT 2018aes, a velocity of v FWHM \u223c 310 km s \u22121 was derived for the [Ca ii] feature at phase -3.0 d. We conclude that the [Ca ii] doublet originates in a slow-moving CSM (\u223c 145 -310 km s \u22121 ), while the broader H\u03b1 component forms in fast-expanding ejected gas.",

The spectra of AT 2013la also provide an averaged [Ca ii] v FWHM \u223c 365 km s \u22121 . In most cases, the low resolution or the low S/N of our spectra prevent us from probing the Ca ii triplet lines in detail, with an exception being the Magellan spectrum of AT 2012jc obtained on 2012 June 23 (phase +77.7 d), where the triplet emission lines show a symmetric profile, with an average v FWHM 905 km s \u22121 . The [Ca ii] profile appears to show very little evolution in the FWHM until t \u223c 70 days, and this is a further argument in favour of the hypothesis that these lines form in the circumstellar environment. We also note that none of the typical nebular lines, such as [O iii] (\u03bb\u03bb= 4959, 5007 \u00c5) and [S ii] (\u03bb\u03bb= 6716, 6731 \u00c5) lines (Lundqvist & Fransson 1996; Lundqvist et al. 2015 Lundqvist et al. , 2020 , were detected in spectra. This implies that the wind density is high enough for those nebular lines to be collisionally de-excited, but that [Ca ii] can exist at much higher density (e.g. critical density: \u03c1 [S II] = 1 \u00d7 10 4 cm \u22123 , \u03c1 [Ca II] = 1 \u00d7 10 9 cm \u22123 ; Li & Mc-Cray 1993) . In such a dense wind, the [Ca ii] lines could also be broadened by Thomson scattering, albeit to a lesser extent than Pastorello et al. (2004) , and Pastorello et al. (2006 Pastorello et al. ( , 2009 ). The right panel shows the region of [Ca ii], marked with the grey-shaded region in the left panel.

The ILRTs in our sample are distributed in a 25 We note that we only include confirmed ILRTs prior to 2020, as systematic surveys and monitoring campaigns were almost globally suspended because of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. In addition to the objects listed in Table 1 (M85 OT was excluded in the rate estimate sample because of its controversial nature as discussed by Kulkarni et al. (2007) , Pastorello et al. (2007) , and Rau et al. (2007) radius of 30 Mpc, corresponding to a volume of 1.13 \u00d7 10 5 Mpc 3 . Hence, we obtain a volumetric rate of ILRTs of 0.09 \u00d7 10 \u22124 Mpc \u22123 yr \u22121 . In the same temporal window and volume, 147 CC SNe were discovered 26 corresponding to a rate of 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 Mpc \u22123 yr \u22121 . Therefore, assuming that the discovery of ILRTs suffers the same selection effects as all CC SNe, the rate of ILRTs is 8% that of CC SNe. We note that Thompson et al. (2009) estimated an EC SN rate of 2%-10% of CC SNe in 10 years (before 2008), while Poelarends et al. (2008) obtained an EC SN fraction of CC SNe of only about 6% based on a standard Salpeter initial mass function (IMF; Salpeter 1955) and an EC SN mass range of 9.00 -9.25 M . Assuming a narrow mass range \u2206 \u2248 0.2 M and a metallicity range Z = 0.0001 -0.02, Doherty et al. (2015 Doherty et al. ( , 2017 calculated that 2%-5% of CC SNe are EC SNe. However, theoretical estimates for EC SN rates are dependent on the uncertainties on the initial mass range, metallicity, and the details of stellar models. While theoretical calculations show some variations, they are roughly consistent with our rate estimate based on the observations. We note that we did not take into account the fact that ILRTs are on average fainter than CC SNe and surveys are incomplete up to 30 Mpc. Therefore, the true relative rate is larger than the current observed rate, and future advanced surveys could increase this estimate.

            "text": "In order to better characterise ILRTs, we looked for possible correlations among their physical parameters. In Figure 15 , we plot peak luminosity (L peak ; reported in Table 3 ) against different physical parameters of ILRTs, namely the time (\u2206t 0.5 ) for the luminosity to decline by a factor of two from maximum, the 56 Ni mass, the H\u03b1 velocity, and the H\u03b1 luminosity at maximum. Unfortunately, several factors (e.g. poorly sampled light curve peaks; lack of late-time observations; low spectral resolution or modest S/N; incomplete wavelength coverage) limit the information available for the sample. More specifically, there seems to be no correlation between L peak and decline time \u2206t 0.5 , which is in the range of 20-50 days (Figure 15, top-left  panel) . The lack of a correlation may point to variation in the progenitor mass loss or the strength of CSM-ejecta interaction. A trend may exist linking the peak luminosity to the ejected 56 Ni mass (Figure 15 top-right panel), although the lower limit for AT 2013la is somewhat discrepant with those of other ILRTs. We cannot rule out that the ejecta-CSM interaction significantly affects the late-time luminosity, therefore biasing the 56 Ni mass estimates of the sampled objects. The limited range of 56 Ni masses (\u223c 1-5 \u00d710 \u22123 M ) may be attributed to their progenitor masses lying within a narrow mass range (\u223c 8-10 M ). As a comparison, both Type II and Type Ib/c SNe also show a similar correlation, but they have higher energies and wider 56 Ni mass ranges than ILRTs (Hamuy 2001 (Hamuy , 2003 Pastorello et al. 2005) . SN 2018zd 27 , which was also proposed as a possible EC SN, has a significantly higher 56 Ni mass (0.013 -0.035 M ; Zhang et al. 2020) , exceeding that of ILRTs (\u223c 1-5 \u00d710 \u22123 M ) by nearly one order of magnitude. In the bottom-left panel, the H\u03b1 velocity seems to be uncorrelated with L peak . The fact that v (H\u03b1) = 600 \u00b1 200 km s \u22121 for all objects suggests a common explosive or eruptive mechanism for all ILRTs, and again a relatively small range of progenitor masses. From this, the LBV giant eruption scenario appears less likely. The diagram showing bolometric versus H\u03b1 luminosity at peak reveals a trend, with ILRTs clustered along two different lines. In particular, we note that ILRTs along the lower line of the diagram (PTF10fqs, AT 2017be, and AT 2013la) show a clear plateau in their light curves. A wider sample of well-monitored ILRTs is necessary to confirm or rule out the putative trends mentioned above. Figure 15 shows how the different classes of objects discussed in this paper distribute in the L peak versus \u2206t 0.5 and H\u03b1 velocity diagrams. The clear separation of ILRTs from the comparison SNe II suggests that they are a distinct class of transients.",

The final O-Ne-Mg core mass is determined by the competition between core increase from the He and H shell burning and mass loss through thermal pulses (Siess 2007; Langer 2012; Leung et al. 2020) . Once the core reaches the Chandrasekhar mass (1.37 M ; Nomoto 1984) , electron capture reactions on 20 Ne and 24 Mg take place, and eventually ignite an O-Ne deflagration that propagates outward. This type of CC explosion is referred to as an EC SN (Nomoto 1984; Zha et al. 2019; Leung et al. 2020) . According to models, EC SNe are expected to explode with low energy, low ejected 56 Ni mass, and typically in a dense and dusty CSM (e.g. Poelarends et al. 2008; Woosley & Heger 2015; Moriya & Eldridge 2016 Although Fe-core progenitors at the low-mass end of the CC SNe also explode with low energy (\u223c 0.5 \u2212 1.0\u00d7 10 50 erg) and small 56 Ni mass (4-6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M ) (Stockinger et al. 2020) , some of them (e.g. low-lominosity Type IIP SNe 2003gd, 2005cs, and 2008bk; Eldridge et al. 2007; Maund et al. 2014a,b) can be distinguished from EC SNe through the explosion mechanism, chemical composition, and nucleosynthesis (Jerkstrand et al. 2018) . The possible correlations among physical parameters, the homogenous observational properties and the L-T evolution suggest that all ILRTs are regulated by the same mechanism, and the EC SN explosion is a plausible scenario. In particular, this scenario for ILRTs is supported by the following arguments:",

If we consider all objects in this study, we obtain an averaged absolute peak magnitude of M R = \u221213.04 \u00b1 0.91 mag. As shown in Figure 4, we compared the R/r-band absolute light curves of ILRTs with three proposed EC SN candidates: SN 2018zd, SN 2018hwm, and SN 2015bf; and two subluminous Type IIP SNe: SN 1999br and SN 2005cs.
