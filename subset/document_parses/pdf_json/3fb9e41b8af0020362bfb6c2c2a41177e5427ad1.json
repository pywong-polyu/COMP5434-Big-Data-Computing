We explored the traditional usage of wild animals by the local inhabitants in Ladakh area of Trans-Himalayan region, India, using questionnaires and interviews. Furthermore, associations between ethnozoological usage and animal species were also evaluated through multivariate ecological community analysis. The highest priority of local inhabitants was for food followed by medicinal usage. We documented therapeutic uses of 48% of the reported species. Among these Alectoris chukar (chukar), Cuon alpinus (Asiatic wild dog), Lepus oiostolus (hares), Marmota himalayana (marmots), Ovis aries vignei (Ladakh urial), Pantholops hodgsonii (Tibetan antelope), Procapra picticaudata (Tibetan gazelle), Pseudois nayaur (blue sheep), Tetraogallus himalayensis (Himalayan snow), Tetraogallus tibetanus (Tibetan snow cock), and Lutra lutra (common otter) were reported for the first time from this region and are being used for medicinal purpose. Our findings could be valuable as reference data for policymakers, researchers, land managers, common public, and the other stakeholders to develop logical and scientific approaches for sustainable use of faunal diversity in biodiversity hotspot regions.",

The present study assessed the traditional ethnozoological usage of wild animals by local inhabitants in Ladakh region, India, and the reference data for scientific approaches for protection of faunal diversity in trans-Himalayas. The ethnozoological documentation of the animals in Ladakh was carried out through semistructured and close-ended questionnaire surveys and interviews. Multivariate ecological community analysis was used to elucidate the relationship between ethnozoological usage and animal species. Our results showed three animal usage clusters with 32% similarity. Moreover, the similarity in animal usage between digging tools, trophy, handle of tools, decoration, and matting, showed less than 32% of similarity. The highest priority of local people was for food followed by decoration and medicinal usage. The most frequently used animal parts were meat followed by fur and horn. Medicinal uses of 48% of the reported species, i.e., Alectoris chukar (chukar), Cuon alpinus (Asiatic wild dog), Lepus oiostolus (hares), Marmota himalayana (marmots), Ovis aries vignei (Ladakh Animals 2020, 10, 2317 2 of 21 urial), Pantholops hodgsonii (Tibetan antelope), Procapra picticaudata (Tibetan gazelle), Pseudois nayaur (blue sheep), Tetraogallus himalayensis (Himalayan snow), Tetraogallus tibetanus (Tibetan snow cock), and Lutra lutra (common otter) were reported for the first time from this region. Our study provides innovative information regarding the ethnozoological knowledge in the Ladakh region and reference data for policymakers, researchers, land managers, common public, and the other stakeholders to develop logical and scientific approaches for sustainable use of faunal diversity in hotspot regions like trans-Himalayas and other similar biodiversity-rich sites.",

These intricate relations between mankind and wildlife are found in every culture throughout the world, in numerous types of associations with animals and plants living in their locality [1] . Wild animals play a considerable role in human culture, religion, and economy. The utilization of animals and plants for medicinal purposes has passed in the form of traditional knowledge from generation to generation. Different tribal and ethnic people have been collecting this precious information for generations. While the application of animals in traditional systems of medicine is not new, its documentation is so far very restricted. The exploration and documentation of this indigenous knowledge is essential to get firsthand information about the various uses of animals [1, 2] .",

The World Health Organization report stated that out of 252 essential chemicals used in medicines, 8.7 percent have their origin in animals and 11.1 percent in plants [3] . These animal-derived medicines are mainly obtained from animal's body parts, their metabolic products, or products such as cocoons and nests [4] . Such use is indeed ancient and has long been documented. It is known that Chinese people have been using earthworms for 4000 years to cure various diseases [5] . Further, it has been documented that 1500 animal species are used in Traditional Chinese healthcare [1] . In addition, it has been reported that about 15-20% of the Ayurvedic medicines (traditional Hindu system of medicine) find their origin in animals [6] and about 500 species of invertebrates are being utilized to treat ailments [7] . Chemicals derived from different plants and animals have been used from times immemorial by humans to improve their health [8] . For instance, due to antibacterial, immunological, diuretic, analgesic, anesthetic, and antirheumatic properties, insects make up an important part of modern allopathic medicines [9] . Chitosan, derived from the exoskeleton of insects, is used in modern healthcare systems as an anticoagulant, to reduce blood cholesterol and repair tissues [10] . Similarly, potential anticancer medicines have been obtained from the legs and wings of Taiwanese stag beetles and Asian sulfur butterflies [11] . Many animal species are tested for drug discovery by the pharmaceutical industries. An inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was obtained from snake venom. This ACE enzyme converts the inactive angiotensin into its active form resulting in narrowing of blood vessels and thus increases in blood pressure. However, this inhibitor obtained from snakes prevents the conversion of angiotensin into its active form and thus keeps the pressure at at normal rate [12] . Likewise, several compounds having defensive functions such as alkaloids, steroids, biogenic amines, and peptides have been obtained from amphibians and have numerous pharmacological effects such as myo-toxic, neurotoxic, and cardio-toxic activities [13, 14] .",

The results of this assessment provide reference data for policymakers, researchers, land managers, common public, and other stakeholders to develop logical and scientific approaches for protection of natural resources and sustainable utilization of fauna diversity in hotspot regions like trans-Himalayas and other similar biodiversity-rich sites.",

A forest working plan was accessed for authentication of administrative jurisdiction, geographical location, and wild fauna. The selected sites (n = 54) were observed in five field trips during the study year 2019. The methodology was based on interviews (269 interviews, of which 184 were individual based and 17 were group based) using semistructured and closed ended questionnaires and discussions to document the folk knowledge and ethnozoological uses of animal resources. The information was collected from diverse groups of the area, i.e., Amchis (traditional doctors), hunters, herders, shopkeepers, farmers, daily wage labourers, hotel owners, museum owners, housewives, govt. employees etc. by interviewing and completing a questionnaire. To document the traditional knowledge of wild fauna of the study area, questionnaires and interviews method (intersperse fact-based questions) was used. The interviews were carried out both at individual and group level. All interviews were conducted only after obtaining prior informed consent of the village heads, tribal leaders, and individual informants, by explaining clearly the objectives of the study. Participants whose photos are shown in Figures 2-4 agreed to this use. The most important ethnic groups are the Amchis, remote, rural or far flung villagers, herders, and hunters, who are directly dependent on wildlife products for their livelihood ( Figure 2) . A local community member of these tribes who knew the norms and traditions of that indigenous society was taken as a guide",

In other words, if an animal species has two or more different usages, these usages will be clustered closer. Heatmap and S\u00f8rensen's (Bray-Curtis) distance was used to identify significant differences among the different ethnozoological usage similarities [26, 27] . Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to find hypothetical variables (components) that account for as much of the variance in our multidimensional data as possible. The contribution of different animal part usage was displayed in chord diagrams using circlize package [28] in R software 4.0.0 [29] . To run a preference analysis, i.e., whether there is difference between animal usage, and between animal parts used, we used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with binomial distribution followed by Likelihood-Ratio test using the packages \"stats\" [30] and \"car\" [31] . For that, we used the number of species divided by the total number of species observed multiplied by 100.",

Most of the respondents were 46-65 (48%) years old, followed by 66-88 (40%), and 25-45 (12%). The respondents interviewed included farmers (30%), housewives (19%), herders (9%), Govt. employees (8%), daily wage labourors (8%), hunters (6%), hotel owners (6%), shopkeepers (5%), and museum owners (1%). About 66% informants were Buddhists, while the other 34% were Muslims. Among these different groups, the Amchis, hunters, herders/shepherds, and those inhabiting rural and/or far-flung areas are much more informative as compared to others as they are directly dependent on animals' products for their livelihoods. Many faunal species had cultural values. Different mammalian and bird species were used in magic or rituals. The bones, meat, and hair of Panthera uncia and Camelus bactrianus (camel) were used in the treatment of black magic (Kalaa Jadoo). Similarly, the horns of Ovis aries vignei and Capra sibirica were used as trophies at the entrance of temples and houses to protect the families from bad spirits. Likewise, the horns and bones of Capra sibirica were use as defensive and digging tools. Similarly, the bones of the Brown bear were used as defensive tools. The dried meat of Lynx lynx and Panthera uncia were used as amulets to protect the body from diseases and masculine disorders. Furthermore, it was also found that decorated Camelus bactrianus were used in wedding ceremonies. In addition, Ibex horn, brown bear head, and fox tail were used for decoration purposes. The wool of the Tibetan antelope is known for making famous Shahtoosh and as a status symbol.",

We observed that local Amchis and old people had great familiarities with traditional usage of animal species, compared to younger participants; and this trend was comparable to previous reports from other parts of Himalayas [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] .

To mitigate these problems, locals take advantage of pet dogs, campfires, and sometimes professional hunters are also called. Rigg et al. [37] while studying carnivore-livestock conflicts in Europe (Slovakia) suggested that livestock guarding dogs are particularly appropriate for wolfs, which cause four to six times more damage to domestic and wild animals than brown bear (Ursus arctos) [37] .

Few animal species such as Capra sibirica (Asiatic Ibex), Ovis aries vignei (Ladakh Urial), Pantholops hodgsonii (Tibetan antelope), and Ovis ammon (Tibetan argali) were used for food as well as other ethnozoological usage (trophy and decoration) (Table 1, Figure 5 ). The clustering of wild fauna based on the ethnozoological usage is presented in Figure 5 where animals grouped in one limb are more similar in usages and show proximity to each other.

The other parts used were horns (9%), tongue, blood and eggs (7% each), claws and liver (4% each), bile, fat, bone, heart, milk, and wool (2% each) (Figure 8b ). This fact is also supported by PCA which showed distinct usage segregation based on variations in the preference levels ( Figure  10 ). Dried meat is used to overcome body weakness, arthritis.",

These uses of C. bactrianus were found to be different compared to previous reports [34, 41] . Likewise, use of Columba rupestris (Pigeon/Mukron) against inflammation was different than uses reported by Yeshi et al. [44] . Ladakhi communities use bile and dried meat of Panthera uncia to treat respiratory disorders and body weakness, whereas nails and hair of the same species were reported to keep away the evil spirits [48] . Similarly, ethnomedicinal uses of Vulpes vulpes (Tibetan sand fox/Watse) and Equus kiang (Wild ass/Khyang and Gorkhar) as given in Table 2 , were different from previous reports [43, 45] . The decoction of horns (crushed) of Capra sibirica is used against chest infections in the studied area. This use was similar as reported previously [49] . In the Ladakh region, the use of Lynx lynx dried meat to overcome body weakness and arthritis was found similar to that reported by Alves et al. [46] . To take full advantage of the potential benefits of traditional animal-based medicines, we need integration of traditional and biomedical medicine and health care [35] . Closer combination may advance the quality, effectiveness, and safety of traditional medicinal services and may at the same time enrich the quality, knowledge, and cultural analogies of diverse medical care services [35] .",

This study acts as a base to demonstrate the scientific confirmation of therapeutic efficiency of different animal based traditional drugs utilized by the indigenous people and might allow for the discovery of some novel biocompounds and new drugs. This study also provides insights about the perception of indigenous people about the wildlife and how their perception can be changed by providing awareness about the role of wildlife in sustenance of ecosystems. However, it was found that utilization of these wild animals is known to spread many diseases. These animals are known to contain various viral and bacterial pathogens and their use and trade is known to spread a large number of diseases. Recently, the human population is witnessing one of the worst pandemics the world has ever witnessed, which now is known to have spread from bats. This pandemic caused by the virus SARS CoV-2 started in December 2019 in Wuhan province of China and was declared as global health emergency by WHO [50, 51] . These types of diseases spread by these wild animals can be prevented by preventing the illegal trade of many wild animals, especially the wild animals in the threatened categories. In addition, this study provides new insights about the importance of biodiversity in these biodiversity hotspots and offers new mitigation and conservation strategies to be taken for the restoration and preservation of wildlife in Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. However, it is imperative to prevent the change in population dynamics of these wild animals by conservation education and awareness involving all the stakeholders and local ethnic people. Nevertheless, it should also be noted that while framing any action plans for conservation, the local traditions should be respected, otherwise it will do more harm than good [52, 53] .",

            "text": "This study offers new contributions to the knowledge of faunal composition and usage by local inhabitants in the Ladakh mountainous regions. Studying the fauna composition and usage of wild animals is fundamental to understanding the association between mountainous communities and animal sources of the region and how the animal population in these regions is being affected by human actions. The use of these animals' products for different purposes becomes more and more vital for the people of this biodiversity hotspot region. This study will not only make the young generation more aware about their traditional knowledge related to uses of animals and their parts but also the people will have easy and cheap remedies which they think will cure some minor diseases. However, careless and improper utilization of this faunal biodiversity is known to radically alter their population and hence affect the ecosystem stability. Thus, we highlight the importance of our study as a tool that will help in the understanding of the faunal diversity in these regions and how conservation and mitigation measures can be put into action for the preservation of the Himalayan wildlife. Acknowledgments: Thanks are due to the local people of Ladakh for sharing the ethnozoological information and cooperating during the surveys and interviews. We are thankful to the Wildlife Trust of India for providing necessary facilities during the present study.
