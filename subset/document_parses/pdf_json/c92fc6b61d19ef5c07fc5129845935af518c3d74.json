It has been estimated that there are over eight thousand sacred sites in Iran alone and every year around eight million foreigners visit these shrines ( Figure 1 ). The pilgrimage mostly includes visits to cities like Karbala, Najaf, Kufa, Samara, and Baghdad in Iraq and several places in Damascus in Syria. These religious visits peak around the birth and death anniversaries of various religious leaders. Besides these specific anniversaries, the early spring season is a favorable time for the pilgrimage to these holy ",

From 19 th February to 22nd March 2020, thousands of religious tourists traveled from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Oman, Yemen, Qatar, Bahrain, and other neighboring countries to Iran and returned to their home countries.Initially, Pakistan did not stop these religious travellers, as the spread of COVID-19 in Iran was not clear due to a lack of testing and hence reporting. However, when COVID-19 infection was detected in two patients in the city of Karachi on 26 th February 2020 and it was discovered that they had traveled to Iran, then the Pakistan government started precautionary measures at the Taftan border crossing area with Iran (Figure 2). However, by that time around eight thousand pilgrims had returned to different cities of Pakistan. The initial precautionary measures taken by Pakistan at the Taftan border were thermal scanning of returning pilgrims. Later, a quarantine was imposed on incoming pilgrims from Iran by taking them to quarantine camps for ten days, but secondary cases were already occurring as a result of those pilgrims before the institution of quarantine. Further, due to lack of facilities at the Taftan border, around two thousand returning pilgrims were shifted to their home cities quarantine centers while 2800 more returning pilgrims from Iran were received at the Taftan border. At this time in Dera Ghazi Khan city of Punjab in Pakistan, around 750 returning pilgrims are in a quarantine camp but have not yet been tested for COVID-19. Almost all provinces of Pakistan are reporting COVID-19 cases and the numbers are increasing. By 24 March, 2020, Pakistan reported 990 cases and 6 deaths. 2 Among these infected patients, sixty percent were pilgrims who travelled to Iran. The NIH institute in Islamabad Pakistan is the guidance for its citizens. Given the lack of extensive testing, it is highly likely that the disease is spreading and the exponential increase in cases will only be recognized by increasing hospital admissions. A country like Pakistan with a population size of 200 million is extremely vulnerable to COVID-19, further compounded by a weak health care infrastructure. A lock-down may be inevitable.
