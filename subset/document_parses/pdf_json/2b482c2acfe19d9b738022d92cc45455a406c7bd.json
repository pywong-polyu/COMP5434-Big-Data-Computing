For example, it was reported that miR-30c-5p was significantly decreased in gastric cancer, which suppressed invasion and metastasis by targeting MTA1. 13 Exosome-derived miR-30c-5p relays anti-metastatic effects as a biomarker of clear cell renal cell carcinoma that inhibits progression by targeting HSPA5. 14 Although miR-30c-5p is considered a potential diagnostic indicator, it has also been reported to act as a tumor promoter in various tumor types. 15, 16 Inhibiting miR-30c-5p expression offers a possible treatment of isolinderalactone-induced apoptosis for triple-negative breast cancer. 17 A previous study showed that the expression profile of serum miR-30c-5p was found to be deregulated in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive HCC. 18 However, the effects of miR-30c-5p in HCC are still elusive. Therefore, it is of great significance to reveal the precise molecular mechanism of miR-30c-5p for understanding the pathogenesis of HCC. The present study was designed to clarify the function of miR-30c-5p and its downstream targets in HCC.",

Real-time PCR revealed that miR-30c-5p underwent downregulation in approximately 80% of cases ( Figure 1A ). The statistical results showed that miR-30c-5p was significantly downregulated in HCC compared with adjacent normal tissues ( Figure 1B ). Detection of miR-30c-5p expression was then performed in HCC cell lines and immortalized liver cell line. We found that miR-30c-5p expression was lower in every HCC cell line compared with normal liver cell line HL-7702 ( Figure 1C ). Clinicopathological analysis of miR-30c-5p expression revealed that reduced miR-30c-5p expression was significantly negatively associated with tumor size (T stage). However, no significant link was observed between miR-30c-5p level and age or sex ( Figure 1D ). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that miR-30c-5p level was significantly associated with overall patient survival; those patients with lower miR-30c-5p levels had shorter overall survival (OS) ( Figure 1E ). Thus, these data indicate that the expression of miR-30c-5p is downregulated in HCC, and reduced miR-30c-5p expression predicts poor prognosis in HCC patients and may contribute to the progression of HCC.",

According to the expression level of miR-30c-5p in HCC cell lines, we stably knocked down miR-30c-5p in high-miR-30c-5p-expressing HepG2 cells and overexpressed miR-30c-5p in low-miR-30c-5p-expressing SMMC-7721 cells by lentivirus (Figures S1A and S1B). We then examined the effect of miR-30c-5p on cell growth of HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells. Cell viability and colony formation assays indicated that silencing miR-30c-5p expression significantly promoted cell growth of HepG2, and miR-30c-5p-upregulated SMMC-7721 cells showed largely impaired growth and formed fewer colonies compared with the control group (Figures 2A and 2B) . To investigate the involvement of miR-30c-5p in vivo, we generated xenografts of subcutaneously implanted miR-30c-5p and control SMMC-7721 cells into nude mice. We found that miR-30c-5p overexpression in SMMC-7721 cells led to significant decreases in tumor size and weight (Figure 2C ). From the third week, miR-30c-5p dramatically inhibited the growth rate of xenograft tumors ( Figure 2D ). Meanwhile, at week 5, mice in the miR-30c-5p-overexpressed group had slightly less body weight loss compared with the control group ( Figure 2E ). To further determine the growth of xenograft tumors, we carried out immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for Ki67, which represents tumor proliferation. The results revealed that Ki67 was lower in the xenograft tumors of the miR-30c-5p-overexpressed group compared with the control group ( Figure 2F ). Collectively, these results demonstrate that miR-30c-5p inhibits HCC cell growth and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo.",

In contrast, miR-30c-5p-overexpression cells showed significantly reduced ability to invade and migrate in vitro ( Figure 3B ). The wound-healing assays also showed that scratch-healing ability was enhanced considerably in miR-30c-5p-inhibited HepG2 cells, whereas overexpression of miR-30c-5p exerted the opposite effect on SMMC-7721 cells ( Figures 3C  and 3D ). Also, we checked epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, b-catenin, snail, and vimentin, in our experiment. The result showed that anti-miR-30c-5p upregulated the expression of vimentin, b-catenin, snail, and N-cadherin and downregulated the expression of E-cadherin in HepG2 cells, indicating the activation of EMT. Meanwhile, miR-30c-5p inhibited the EMT process, as indicated by downregulation of vimentin, b-catenin, snail, and N-cadherin and upregulation of E-cadherin in SMMC-7721 cells ( Figures 3E and 3F ). These data indicated that miR-30c-5p plays an essential role in suppressing invasion and migration of HCC.",

Comparative gene expression profiles of miR-30c-5p-inhibited and control cells demonstrated that the expression of 989 genes was significantly changed, of which 56.5% (559 of 989) were observed to be upregulated ( Figure 4A ). We next used the computational prediction program Tar-getScan 7.2 to predict 1,576 potential target genes of miR-30c-5p. 19 Targets for the 14 genes were screened out with TargetScan 7.2, crossed with the 559 upregulated differentially expressed genes ( Figure 4B ). We then verified the results using real-time PCR and identified genes that were regulated by miR-30c-5p. Among these targets, RAB32 mRNA levels were upregulated in miR-30c-5p-inhibited cells and downregulated in miR-30c-5p-overexpressed cells ( Figure 4C ; Figure S2). Meanwhile, RAB32 protein levels were increased upon miR-30c-5p inhibition, and vice versa ( Figure 4D ). Also, the expression level of RAB32 was significantly downregulated in miR-30c-5p-overexpressed tumor xenografts ( Figure 4E ). Furthermore, we evaluated the 3 0 UTR sequences of RAB32 and found that this complementary site is highly conserved in Homo sapiens ( Figure 4F ). This result implies that RAB32 may be directly epigenetically regulated by miR-30c-5p. Moreover, using a RAB32 3 0 UTR reporter luciferase assay, we found that a significant increase of the relative luciferase activity was observed in miR-30c-5p-inhibited HepG2 cells. In contrast, upregulated miR-30c-5p largely reduced luciferase activity. Meanwhile, mutation of miR-30c-5p binding sites within RAB32 3 0 UTR abolished the effects of miR-30c-5p or anti-miR-30c-5p ( Figure 4G ). Taken together, these data suggest that RAB32 is a direct target of miR-30c-5p in HCC cells.",

RAB32 knockdown reduced cell viability and colony formation compared with control. Meanwhile, RAB32 silencing in the miR-30c-5p-inhibited cells abrogated the increase of cell viability and colony formation compared with that of the control cells ( Figures 5B and  5C) . Furthermore, the transwell and wound-healing assays revealed that RAB32 knockdown also significantly suppressed the miR-30c-5p inhibition-dependent increase of HCC cells' invasion and migration capacities (Figures 5D and 5E ). To rule out the potential off-target effects of short hairpin RNA (shRNA), a shRNA-resistant RAB32 plasmid was construct and verified in RAB32-silenced HepG2 cells ( Figure S4 ).

Drizyte-Miller et al. 35 reported that RAB32 activated mTORC1 signaling, regulating autophagy and promoting cell proliferation, viability, and size in Hep3B and HeLa cells. Bao et al. 36 reported that RAB32 inhibited proliferation and migration and promoted apoptosis in K562 cells. In this study, we showed that RAB32 was involved in HCC progression, and it is the effector responsible for miR-30c-5p-related cell growth and invasion of HCC cells.",
