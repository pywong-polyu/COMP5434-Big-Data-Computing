It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main result is that the vaccination strategy that prioritizes younger generation outperformed the other strategies in terms of deaths. On the other hand, when we focused on strategies that prioritize older generation, as Japan has decided to do, the optimal vaccination strategy was determined by the basic reproduction number and acceptable economic loss. The strategy vaccinating the young next to the old age group was the best when acceptable economic loss was high, or the basic reproduction number was low. Alternatively, the strategy vaccinating the middle next to the old age group was superior to the others with a moderate acceptable economic loss and the high basic reproduction number setting.",

This measure resulted in economic losses like lockdown policies in other countries.

It is noted that the lockdown used in this study is defined as countermeasures not only reducing transmissibility but also causing economical damage. Our usage of the lockdown includes containment and closure indicators of OxCGRT indicators [13] , for example workplace closing, cancel public events, restrictions on gathering size and stay-at-home requirements.

One scenario was equal allocation for all age groups. 6 scenarios were precise prioritization for 3 generations. For example, old generations were targeted at first.

The lockdown was equally imposed to all generations and the basic reproduction number, R0, was set to be 1.3. Overall, three young first strategies were the most effective in reducing the number of deaths and infections for most of the cases. The fourth effective strategy would be one that distributed vaccine equally to all age groups, especially in lower acceptable economic loss. The optimized values of the start timing of the lockdown, ts, were the start timing of the simulation, that is, 0 for the most of simulations. The strong lockdown with short interval was preferable for young first strategies since young population had high contact rates.
