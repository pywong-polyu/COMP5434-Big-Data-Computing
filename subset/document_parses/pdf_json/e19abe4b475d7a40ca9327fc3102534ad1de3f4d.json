The outbreak in India has resulted in emergency lockdown in the country for more than 2 months, and that caused decline in the catch, demand, and supply of fish. It has severely altered the life and livelihoods of the floodplain wetland fishers. These floodplain wetlands play a key role in socio-economic development of stakeholders, by generating employment and livelihood in the studied regions. In the present study, a systematic assessment was conducted to identify the impact of lockdown on floodplain wetland fisheries in India with the aim to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on wetland fishing, fisheries production, income, and food access. We conducted a rapid telephonic survey covering176 wetland fishers in 3 states to document the early impacts of the pandemic and policy responses on floodplain wetland fisher households. The majority of fishers report negative impacts on production, sales, and incomes. Fishers of three Indian states Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam lost 20, 25, and 9 fishing days, respectively. About 70, 60, and 55 % fishers of floodplain wetlands of the three states admitted that lockdown made them partially jobless. Fish harvest during March to May was 32, 44, and 20 % lower than the previous years in Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam. The fishers of Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam lost income of INR 10000/-, 12500/-, and 4500/-due to lockdown. The analysis also showed that 25% of fishers each responded moderate to severe psychological impact and anxiety symptoms due to COVID-19. Demand supply gap during the lockdown led to the in 20-40 % increase in farm gate price of fishes at the wetland level. The present study is the first of its kind in India to systematically assess the impact and discusses several magnitudes on floodplain wetland fisher livelihood, income, and food access and suggests strategies and decision support. for providing facilities to carry out the study. We are also thankful to respective state fisheries and the members of the cooperative societies for their cooperation during data collection. The authors also acknowledge constructive suggestions of anonymous reviewers and constructive comments which helped us in strengthening the manuscript.",

The Prime Minister of India declared nationwide complete lockdown since 24 March 2020; during this period, restriction imposed on the commercial and industrial activity coupled with ban on the movement of people and goods was deemed non-essential in nature as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 pandemic in India. These lockdown measures were anticipated to safeguard the public health and, however, have a direct and distressing impact on income and food security, predominantly for the susceptible subsistence segment in rural India. Complete lockdown of all economic activities created an immediate economic crisis leading to extreme hardship and rising food insecurity. This unprecedented lockdown measures have resulted in adverse impacts on employment, income, food, and nutrition security of the fishers and the potential to cause social unrest. The SSF are in fact characterized by high level of risks and uncertainty and COVID-19 lockdown, a shock that accelerate the uncertainty and leads the vulnerability of the poor fishers. The FAO define SSF as encompassing wide-ranging activities undertaken throughout the value chain by both men and women in inland and marine fisheries, including harvesting from boats and on foot, along with pre-and post-harvest labor that occurs on land (FAO 2015) . The several reports indicate that inland SSF likely provide even more jobs than their marine counterparts (56 versus 52 million) and play an especially important role in local nutrition and food security (World Bank 2012; Bennett et al. 2018; Funge-Smith 2018; Jena and George 2018) . The composition of the SSF workforce is also more diverse than previously thought, with women representing nearly half of SSF workers globally (World Bank 2012; Smith and Basurto 2019). The inland fisheries sector in India especially floodplain wetlands are dominated by SSF mostly belonging to fisherman community (Chandra and Ekka 2015) . Worldwide, SSF is responsible for sustainable livelihoods of more than 120 million people, 95% of them belong to developing countries (FAO 2000) . The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in India has called for sudden strict and prolonged lockdown in the country for more than 2 months that caused adverse impact on the SSF, fish demand and supply, and value chain disruptions in the fishery sector. It has put the Indian marine sector in a deep sea imposing a daily loss of INR 224 crore, and monthly loss was estimated at INR 6838 crore (Aqua International 2020). The inland fishery sector of India is dynamic in nature, which produces more than 8.4 million tonnes including culture and capture fisheries and contributes more than 65% of total fish production during 2018-2019 (Handbook on Fisheries Statistics 2018). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reported 11.9 million tonnes of global inland fishery catch, representing 12.7 percent of total global capture fisheries (FAO, 2019) . Worldwide, inland fisheries contribute a significant role in food and nutritional security, poverty alleviation, gender empowerment, socio-economic development of small and marginal fishers, ecosystem services, and biodiversity conservation (Funge-Smith and Bennett 2019; Zhang et al. 2020) . As per Livestock Census 2003, the total inland and marine fisherman population in India was 14,485,354 which includes 4,696,158 males, 4,033,963 females, and 5,755,233 children, contributing to 1.1 percent of the Indian GDP (Handbook on Fisheries Statistics 2014). The floodplain wetlands are one of the prime fishery resources of India having 525,028 ha water area and high production potential to the tune of 2000-2500 kgha \u22121 yr \u22121 Sugunan and Sinha 2001; Sarkar et al. 2019; Sarkar et al. 2020) . The average fish production from these water bodies is 230 kgha \u22121 yr \u22121 (Chandra et al. 2013) . Bihar has the highest area under floodplain wetlands (209,000 ha) followed by Uttar Pradesh (153,000), Assam (100,872 ha), West Bengal (42,500 ha), and Manipur (16,500 ha) Sarkar et al. 2020 ). These wetlands (locally known as beel/baor in West Bengal, maun or chaur in Bihar, beel in Assam) are the one of the prime SSF resources of eastern and north-eastern India (Sugunan and Bhattacharjya 2000) , providing livelihood and nutritional support to a large section of the population next only to agriculture (Chandra 2010; Chandra and Das 2019) . These invaluable resources are managed for various objectives like economic benefit, livelihood security, sustainability, equity, conservation of biodiversity, and maintenance of the ecosystem (Chandra 2009; Chandra and Bhattacharjya 2016; Sarkar et al. 2020) . Scientific management along with good governance and adoption of technological interventions can double the production of these wetlands (Sarkar et al. 2020) . Over the years, management guidelines for development of floodplain wetland fisheries were time to time issued by ICAR-CIFRI (Sugunan and Sinha 1997, Su gunan an d Bhattach arjy a 2000, S uguna n and Bhattacharjya 2000, Sugunan et al. 2002 .",

This lockdown was further extended for 19 days as phase two until 3 May 2020 and then further for 14 days until May 17 as phase three to stop the spread of COVID-19. However, many states including West Bengal extended to 31 May 2020. In this contributions, phase three included the period up to 31 May 2020. We conducted rapid assessment using semi-structured interview with questions including socio-economic and socio-psychological variables. We collected primary data through phone survey on wetland fishery operation undertaken between the months of March to May. We aimed to survey sample representative of wetland fishers of Assam, West Bengal, and Bihar. Following the survey, key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with nine managers (lessees in the individual managed wetlands and secretary of fisheries cooperative society for cooperative managed wetlands) from three wetlands each from Assam, West Bengal, and Bihar to understand the context and implementation of regulation in the studied location. One hundred seventy-six fishers having mobile phones were purposively selected for this study (Table 1) , and data were collected through direct conversation with the stakeholders. We conducted the interviews on three occasions, first week of April, second week of May, and second week of October 2020 over telephone to comply with the restriction imposed on movement within states and interstate in India and COVID-19 guidelines issued by respective state government. Telephonic interviews were restricted to limited numbers of questions to ascertain the impact of lockdown and fishers' response to mitigate the problem. The phone survey was conducted in the fishers' primary language (Bengali in West Bengal, Hindi in Bihar, and Assamese in Assam) and included questions on how wetland fishery operations were affected by the lockdown. We asked questions focused on stresses faced by the fishers. The survey also included question on access to food during the lockdown and month before the lockdown. The use of mobile phones/telephones as a method for conducting interviews has a number of benefits, such as cost-effectiveness, time efficiency, and access to individual, and it is now gradually becoming more popular data collection means (Cooper and Kurland 2002 , Polkinghorne 2005 , Schweitzer and Duxbury 2006 , Ilies et al. 2007 ). Studies conducted by using semi-structured interview methods through telephonic dialogue have gathered equally robust information with respect to breadth and depth (Block and Erskine 2012). Within the studied states, restrictions continued even after relaxations were announced in pockets depending on the status of the locality in terms of severity of contamination. Therefore, the last interviews with key informants were conducted in the month of October to comprehend the situation in the lockdown period with the normal period. The impact of lockdown during COVID-19 on environmental factor and pollution was discussed based on secondary available literature.",

The sudden lockdown falls during the medium intensity period of fishing in wetlands of Bihar, Assam, and West Bengal led to a significant economic loss to fishers because of loss of fishing days. In Bihar local administration allowed fishers to do fishing and sell for 4 h in the morning in the second phase. In third phase of lockdown, this restriction was lifted by the district administration leading to normalcy in the fishing operation. In West Bengal, though fishing is partially allowed in second phase of lockdown, most of fishers could not do fishing due to supply-side constraints. The fishers of Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam lost 20, 25, and 9 fishing days, respectively, due to lockdown. Overall, one fishing day provides an average income of INR 500 to wetland fisher.",

Fishers of Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam responded that the fish harvest during March to May was 32, 44, and 20 % lower respectively than the previous year due to lockdown restriction. Explanations for the reduced fish catch include reduction in fishing days, restrictions on group fishing due to COVID-19 measures, and time allowed for harvesting operation. The group fishing is a community-based practice in wetland fisheries in all three states, but due to COVID-19 measures, numbers of fishers fishing in wetlands were restricted. Fishers of West Bengal stated that due to restriction on group fishing, the harvesting operation was delayed. Fishers of Bihar stated that in earlier years, during this period, fish harvesting was done on alternate days with 300 kg catch per fishing day. The fish harvesting during lockdown was initiated after 15 April 2020 keeping with the COVID advisory by maintaining 2 m of physical distance with covering of the face. The distance between two boats was maintained at 6 m apart. Due to the loss of 20 fishing days in the month of March to April and reduced intensity of fishing after 15 April onwards, fishers estimated a loss of about 32%. ",

Supply-side constraint mainly mobility restriction and closure of transport led to disruption of fish value chain. During lockdown restrictions, the broadly operated value chain involving fishers-whole sellers-retailers-consumers was completely wanting. In Bihar after the relaxations in phase II, all harvested fish were directly purchased by the retailers from fishers at farm gate level in the morning hours due to restricted fish sale time from 8 to 10 AM. The other impact of lockdown was visible in increase in price of fish in market due to huge demand supply gap. The fish supply of fish was half of normal times in the market, and this demand supply gap led to 20-40 % increase in farm gate price of carps and catfishes in Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam. Approximately 15% of fish demand of Assam is met from other states of the country. Due to transport restriction, fish supply from other states has completely stopped, and this led to the increase of fish price by 25-40 % higher than the period before lockdown. In West Bengal, cooperative societies (PFCS) of the selected wetlands decided not to harvest the fish because of very low options of selling the harvested fish to the whole sellers.",

For rich and poor countries alike, the coronavirus pandemic and the associated policy responses brought a widespread health calamity, economic hardship, severe disruptions to services, and previously unimaginable restrictions on movement. Many poor and vulnerable people have faced serious threats to their immediate food security, health, and nutrition (IFPRI 2021). The pandemic's impacts on food security have been induced primarily by falling incomes. The World Bank estimates that the global economy shrank by 5 percent in 2020, with the greatest burden borne by poor people. Food supply chains were disrupted by labor restrictions and falling demand, although impacts varied along the value chains. The swift announcement of lockdown and closure of intra state and state borders has averted the catastrophic health crisis. The inland fisheries including wetland fisheries have not been immune to global health crisis (Bennett et al. 2021) . The review of literature shows very few reports about the crisis faced by fisheries sector due to COVID-19 pandemic (Eriksson et al. 2020 , Steenbergen et al. 2020 , Aura et al. 2020 , Campbell et al. 2021 , Mangubhai et al. 2021 , Love et al. 2021 .

Interestingly, fishers of different states responded differently to the crisis. Fishers of Bihar were able to harvest fish from 15 April 2020 and sell their produce. Fishers of West Bengal were facing supply-side problems in sale of their produce; with the issuance of movement pass, they overcome this problem. Assam fishers were most worried about the impending ban on fisheries from 15 April 2020. The Government of Assam allowed fishing until 20 April 2020, and this helped fishers to harvest fish.

A positive environmental change in aquatic ecosystem was observed in India after the COVID-19 lockdown and reported in electronic media; however, negative impact was marked on the fisherman community (Fig. 5) . Adverse impact was noticed on public health, employment and earnings, transport, alternate income generating option, food and nutritional security, mass socio-cultural-religious activities, etc. Shut down in educational sector hampered the access of learning of the children of fisher families. On the other hand, decrease in wetland pollution was noticed due to less anthropogenic activities, reduced industrial waste, and reduced emission of CO, CO 2 , NO 2 , and SO 2 . Less consumption of fossil fuel and less exploitation of aquatic biodiversity and fisheries caused improved water quality and ecosystem health, and it ultimately lead to flourish aquatic biodiversity and recruitment of indigenous fish in the wetlands.",

The state fishery departments and National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB), India, may also come out with need-based relief package for the floodplain wetland fishers on a priority basis. The timely advisories and recommendation can be applicable to the development of national and international wetland fishery guidelines in this pandemic situation. One of the most important learning of this lockdown for authorities is that there is no need to completely stop fishery activities in inland sector. In the future, during the pandemic situations, fishing practices in wetlands may be allowed in calibrated manner within time limits with restrictions to the number of fishers. It is expected that the information generated will help the policy makers in formulating policies and guidelines for inland SSF management in floodplain wetlands in pandemic-like situations.",
