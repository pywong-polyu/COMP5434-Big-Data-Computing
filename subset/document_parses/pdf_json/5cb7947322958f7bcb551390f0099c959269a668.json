            "text": "Background: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a significant effect on bone, affecting both trabecular and cortical compartments. Although parathyroidectomy results in biochemical improvement in mineral metabolism, changes in bone microarchitecture as evaluated by highresolution imaging modalities are not known. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides in-depth threedimensional assessment of bone microarchitecture, as well as determination of mechanical bone strength determined by finite element analysis (FEA). Methods: We conducted a single-centre longitudinal study to evaluate changes in bone microarchitecture with MRI in patients with SHPT undergoing parathyroidectomy. MRI was performed at the distal tibia at baseline (time of parathyroidectomy) and at least 12 months following surgery. Trabecular and cortical topological parameters as well as bone mechanical competence using FEA were assessed. Results: Fifteen patients with CKD (12 male, 3 female) underwent both MRI scans at the time of surgery and at least 12 months post-surgery. At baseline, 13 patients were on dialysis, one had a functioning kidney transplant, and one was pre-dialysis with stage 5 CKD. Seven patients received a kidney transplant following parathyroidectomy prior to follow-up MRI. MRI parameters in patients at follow up were consistent with loss in trabecular and cortical bone thickness (p = 0.006 and 0.03 respectively). Patients who underwent a kidney transplant in the follow-up period had reduction in trabecular thickness (p = 0.05), whereas those who continued on dialysis had reduction in cortical thickness (p = 0.04) and mechanical bone strength on FEA (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Patients with severe SHPT requiring parathyroidectomy have persistent changes in bone microarchitecture at least 12 months following surgery with evidence of ongoing decline in trabecular and cortical thickness.",

Additional risk factors for bone abnormalities in patients with CKDhyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia, 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency, reduced renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, chronic metabolic acidosis and inflammation and premature hypogonadismcompound the effects of SHPT and result in impaired bone quality and quantity. Fractures are a major consequence and are significantly more prevalent in patients with CKD compared to the general population, associated with increased hospitalization, morbidity and mortality (Alem et al., 2000) . Beneficial effects of Abbreviations: MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; HRpQCT, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography; DXA, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; BMD, bone mineral density; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; CKD, chronic kidney disease; PTH, parathyroid hormone; SHPT, secondary hyperparathyroidism. parathyroidectomy on reducing fractures have been reported in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (VanderWalde et al., 2006) and in patients with SHPT on haemodialysis (Rudser et al., 2007) . A retrospective study using data from the United State Renal Data System, with outcomes including incident hip, vertebral, and distal radius fractures as identified using hospitalized codes, showed an associated 32% lower risk of hip fracture with parathyroidectomy compared to matched controls (Rudser et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Optimal assessment of bone includes assessment of bone quantity (BMD) and bone quality (bone turnover, microarchitecture, mineralization, and accumulation of microdamage and collage properties). Determination of both bone quality and quantity remains a challenge in the CKD population. Renal bone disease can evolve and fluctuate over the spectrum of CKD and can differ depending on the skeletal site (Moe et al., 2006) . Serological markers routinely used to monitor bone turnover do not reliably distinguish between different renal bone pathologies, and, in addition, commonly used biomarkers can have assay limitations and inconsistent results in patients with CKD (Coco and Rush, 2000; Sprague et al., 2016; Danese et al., 2006) . Standard radiological techniques such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) only evaluate a two-dimensional assessment of bone quantity and provide a poor distinction between cortical and trabecular bone. Supplementary imaging modalities, in addition to traditional DXA, include trabecular bone score (TBS) and microindentation and are currently being investigated to determine microarchitecture and mechanical bone properties in patients with kidney failure (P\u00e9rez-S\u00e1ez et al., 2017a) and in kidney transplant recipients (P\u00e9rez-S\u00e1ez et al., 2018; P\u00e9rez-S\u00e1ez et al., 2017b) . In the CKD population, DXA can also potentially overestimate vertebral BMD due to the presence of overlying aortic calcification. Presently, bone biopsy remains the gold standard for adequately diagnosing renal bone disease, however it is rarely performed as biopsy acquisition is invasive, challenging to process and analyse, and fails to permit longitudinal measurements of bone structure at the same location.",

This sequence is commercially available on clinical MRI systems with a scan time of 12 min. The MRI scan was undertaken utilising a commercially available 15 channel transmit receive knee coil (Seimens, Erlangen, Germany).

Segmentation was determined by delineating the periosteal and endosteal boundaries of bone with an operator-guided semiautomatic algorithm using custom-built software (Rajapakse et al., 2012) and standard microarchitecture parameters were derived for trabecular and cortical bone. Trabecular parameters were evaluated by an increase in surface to curve ratio (S/C) and reduction in erosion index (EI). S/C ratio indicates the plate (surface) to rod (curve) ratio of trabeculae, with a higher ratio a marker of greater trabecular integrity (Sharma et al., 2018a) , whereas EI represents erosion caused by osteoclastic resorption with a higher index consistent with greater trabecular deterioration (Sharma et al., 2018a) .",

Similar findings were identified in a study of Japanese patients on haemodialysis, with an increase in vertebral BMD as early as one month post parathyroidectomy and sustained up to 36 months post-surgery (Yano et al., 2003) . Improvement in BMD measured by DXA and trabecular bone score has also been reported in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism following parathyroidectomy (Cipriani et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019) . DXA results have primarily demonstrated improvement in vertebral BMD, whereas micro-MRI to now has been limited to the distal tibia, ulnar and human cadaver femur bones. The distal tibial site for assessment has advantages over the distal ulnar as it is exposed to significant load and weight bearing, and this may be the most appropriate surrogate for assessment of bone microarchitecture at the femoral neck, however this cannot be definitively confirmed. Additionally, distribution of cortical and trabecular bone varies throughout the adult human skeleton, and we may expect our findings to be more relevant to the appendicular rather than axial skeleton.",

Utilising MRI to evaluate bone microarchitecture, Sharma et al. demonstrated deterioration in indices of trabecular network integrity (S/C and EI), however this was accompanied by an increased cortical area in a small cohort of patients 12 months post-kidney transplant (Sharma et al., 2018b) . Nishiyama et al. evaluated HR-pQCT of the distal tibia and radius in 31 patients at the time of kidney transplantation and after one year and reported cortical porosity increased by 63.4% at the radius and 17.6% at the tibia (Nishiyama et al., 2015) . Another study in kidney transplant recipients identified no change in BMD of the hip and lumbar spine from baseline to 12 months but a significant reduction at the distal radius. HR-pQCT of the distal radius and tibia demonstrated a decline in cortical area, density and thickness, trabecular density, stiffness, and failure load (Iyer et al., 2014) . Transplant recipients in our cohort showed a reduction in trabecular thickness and no improvement in other bone microarchitecture parameters on MRI.",

Improvement in bone microarchitecture following treatment of SHPT, such as with surgery, may take longer than our follow-up period of 15 \u00b1 2 months to be apparent. A subset of participants showed improvement in bone microarchitecture parameters at follow up, however with our small study size we could not identify any specific factors which predicted improvement in bone microarchitecture. Additionally, the heterogeneous cohort which included participants who received a kidney transplant and those that remained on dialysis make it difficult to interpret all changes in bone. A larger cohort study is likely needed to identify those who could benefit in relation to changes in bone microarchitecture post-parathyroidectomy.",
