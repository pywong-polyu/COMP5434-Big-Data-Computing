            "text": "This past winter, GSWs in California and throughout the U.S. faced rising COVID-19 cases. According to a news article, more than 800 Southern California grocery store and food system workers tested positive for COVID-19, with outbreaks at more than 137 Los Angeles area supermarkets in November and December 2020 [3] . There have been close to four million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 64,328 deaths in California, as of 10 August 2021 [4] . Interacting with the public on a regular basis, GSWs have increased chances of contracting COVID-19 while working, putting their lives at risk [2] . GSWs have made headlines in past news coverage for having to engage in uncomfortable and potentially threatening interactions with customers who defy mask wearing mandates within stores [5] . Because of such experiences, working as a GSW during a global pandemic may be particularly stressful. Research is needed to understand how the threat of COVID-19 and experiences at work impact GSWs. Thus far, research on essential workers has primarily focused on healthcare workers, and although more research is needed pertaining to this population, limited studies on other essential workers exist. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health (MH) and psychosocial functioning of GSWs.",

As a result, GSWs face increased risk of exposure to COVID- 19 . In a single Boston grocery store, employees with direct customer interaction were five times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than the surrounding communities, most of whom were asymptomatic [6] . Several news organizations reported stories of GSW deaths and widespread infections in the early months of the pandemic [7, 8] . Significant asymptomatic infection rate and exposure risks were associated with psychological distress of GSWs [6] . The inability to engage in social distancing while at work was a significant risk factor for anxiety and depressive symptoms [6] . GSWs may also experience COVID-19 health anxiety, which is a heightened and continued state of vigilance toward one's body for COVID-19 relatedsymptoms. COVID-19 health anxiety can result in cycles of increased anxiety, endorsement of a greater number of COVID-19 related symptoms, and misreading of one's health, even amid negative COVID-19 tests [9] .",

About 24% of a study sample of GSWs met criteria for at least mild anxiety or greater, while 8% met criteria for at least mild depression [6] . Results from the Arizona Frontline Worker Survey found that female frontline workers in the grocer and food processing industries reported more anxiety, depression, and stress than males, and younger workers reported more distress than older workers (55 years of age and above) [10] . Additionally, grocer and food processing workers reported distress three times greater than national average scores and majority (60%) reported above-average levels of stress [10] . High levels of grocer and food processing workers' concerns were related to safety measures, especially those pertaining to customers and their behavior [10] . Less than a quarter of all grocer and food processing workers (22%) reported they believed it was likely they would be assaulted by a customer and over half (54%) believed it was likely they would be threatened by a customer for enforcing safety guidelines [10] . Perceptions of safety in the workplace were found to be the greatest predictor of MH [10] . The MH of GSWs may be affected by fear of contracting COVID-19, increased demands and stress at work, and whether COVID-19 workplace safety measures are enforced or not. Further, GSWs may be seen as low status due to irregular working hours and low pay in comparison to health care workers, which may further exacerbate stress reactions.",

Such experiences may involve leadership failing to adequately protect, advocate on behalf of, or support workers' well-being or safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moral injury may contribute to negative thoughts about oneself or others [11] or MH problems like depression, PTSS, and anxiety [12] . GSWs may grapple with the difficult decision of whether to continue working, even though there are increased risks of illness and death for themselves, and their loved ones. Worries about contracting COVID-19 while at work, and possibly bringing the virus home and infecting loved ones were found to be higher for GSWs than health care workers [13] . Many GSWs may feel as though they have no choice, except to work to financially support themselves and their loved ones [2] . Possible reactions to this dilemma may include outrage, despair, grief, guilt, or remorse toward their employers, work situation, or personal decisions, which can contribute to distress [2] . Some efforts have been made by several grocer retailers to instate measures to protect their employees, such as limiting the number of customers in a store at a given time, adding plexiglass partitions at the register [1] , and requiring masks to be worn within the store [10] . The impact of such measures aimed at increasing workplace safety should be documented and studied, as their impacts on GSW well-being, health, and MH functioning are not fully understood yet.",

Next, differences by gender identity among study variables were assessed using an independent samples t-test. Differences by age and ethnicity were each assessed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post-hoc Tukey HSD tests revealed differences, which provided rationale for including age and gender identity as covariates. Lastly, three hierarchical linear regression models were conducted to examine the variance in MH outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTSS symptoms,) accounted for by demographic variables (i.e., age and gender identity), disaster fear and threat (i.e., COVID-19 fear and workplace threat perception), perceived stress, and social support (lack of from family and friends).",

Employers may consider engaging in a number of actions to support their workers such as establishing strong occupational health and safety programs in line with public health guidelines, assessing risk in the workplace, allowing employees to express concerns through surveys, interviews, or informal meetings without fear of later consequences for speaking up, identifying employees at-risk of adverse physical or MH outcomes, providing education on how employees can protect themselves, allowing GSWs greater flexibility and paid time off for COVID-19 related issues (without fear of losing their job), and disseminating information about physical and MH services or resources to assist employees in managing distress, health, or psychological issues [2] . Engaging in such acts may build trust among employers and GSWs, increase GSWs' feelings of safety, care, and appreciation, build resiliency [2] , and reduce the risk of experiencing moral injury, distress, and long-term MH consequences. It would also be beneficial for employers, management, or union leaders to closely document implemented safety measures and assess the potential impacts they have on GSWs to determine if they are associated with reductions in fear, workplace threat perceptions, and MH outcomes.",

Apart from therapy, GSWs can also employ other stress-reduction strategies such as engaging in physical exercise [36] , spiritual, religious, or mindfulness and meditation practices [37, 38] , or eating a healthy diet [39] , which have shown to be effective against reducing stress and stress-related outcomes.

Networks of MH professionals providing low cost or free services to essential workers could compiled and their information shared and disseminated to GSWs, in addition to health care and other workers. MH professionals can also engage in advocacy work illuminating the need for protection, access to MH services, and support for GSWS and other essential workers throughout the world [41] . The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified several strategies to guide the strengthening of MH care and accessibility, which include working to reform MH care systems and investing in MH workers [41] . Additionally, MH providers may need to be aware of the unique psychosocial influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on GSWs. Their experiences during the pandemic may differ from those of health care workers (e.g., in terms of implemented protections, status, public perception, and treatment), and other essential workers. MH treatment modalities and psychosocial tools can also be tailored for use within the COVID-19 context [41] .

First, since most respondents were solicited via an email/text list through a union in California, the findings may not generalize to all GSWs or those belonging to unions with varied levels of support. Additionally, the response rate for the current study was very low in comparison to the number of individuals who had received the survey invitation, thus there is a selection bias. Only those participants who were interested in the survey replied and may have unique characteristics, which may not be generalizable to the general GSW population. Thus, the results of the study should be interpreted with caution. The cross-sectional design of this study also makes it difficult to assess temporal priority among variables. Measuring independent and dependent variables from a single respondent can increase risk of shared method variance, which can inflate associations. We also lack information about previous MH history or functioning and experiences of other traumatic events, which are also known to be predictive of post-disaster adjustment and resiliency [14, 44] . Lastly, focus groups or interviews would have provided a richer depth of knowledge about GSWs' experiences, support needed, and MH.",
