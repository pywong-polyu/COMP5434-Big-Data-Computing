This resulted in a new round of lockdown in Harbin, the capital city of Heilongjiang, from 20 January to 22 February of 2021. A field campaign was conducted to explore the responses of haze pollution in Harbin to the lockdown. Levoglucosan was used to reflect biomass burning emissions, while the molar ratio of sulfur (the sum of sulfur dioxide and sulfate) to nitrogen (the sum of nitrogen dioxide and nitrate), i.e., R S/N , was used as an indicator for the relative importance of coal combustion and vehicle emissions. Based on a synthesis of the levoglucosan and R S/N results, reference period was selected with minimal influences of non-lockdown-related emission variations. As indicated by the almost unchanged sulfur dioxide concentrations, coal combustion emissions were relatively stable throughout the lockdown and reference periods, presumably because the associated activities, e.g., heating supply, power generation, etc., were usually uninterruptible. On the other hand, as suggested by the increase of R S/N , vehicle emissions were considerably reduced during lockdown, likely due to the stay-at-home orders. Compared to results from the reference samples, the lockdown period exhibited higher levels of ozone and various indicators for secondary aerosol formation, pointing to an enhancement of secondary pollution. In addition, photochemistry-related reactions in aqueous phase appeared to be present during the lockdown period, which have not been reported in the frigid atmosphere over Northeast China.",

Strict measures were implemented in China during late January and late February 2020 to control the spread of the disease. These measures, e.g., stay-at-home orders, markedly reduced primary emissions of air pollutants, especially nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ; Bauwens et al., 2020; Le et al., 2020) . A variety of studies were conducted to investigate the responses of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and ozone pollution to the emission reduction. These studies most frequently relied on air quality data from the China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC) and air quality models, which typically suggested a nationwide increase of ozone during lockdown (Shi and Brasseur, 2020; Venter et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021) . On the other hand, the stay-at-home orders largely limited field observation of PM 2.5 compositions, while results from a limited number of cities such as Wuhan (Zheng et al., 2020) , Beijing (Lv et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020) , Shanghai (Chang et al., 2020) and Hangzhou pointed to enhanced secondary aerosol formation during lockdown.",

During this round of outbreak, Heilongjiang was one of the worstaffected provinces, and lockdown was implemented in its capital city, Harbin, from 20 January to 22 February of 2021. Here we explored the lockdown influence on the air pollution in Harbin, based on a recent field campaign. Harbin differs from other megacities in China by its extremely cold winter (with daily average temperatures down to < \u2212 20 \u2022 C) and complex emission sources (e.g., coal and biomass burning for heating). Thus, this study helped unfold the interplay between emission and atmospheric chemistry in a frigid environment, which was unique compared to the much more intensively explored megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai.",

As shown in Fig. 1a , a common feature of the lockdown period was that the daily average temperatures stayed below \u2212 6 \u2022 C, i.e., the lockdown occurred within the relatively cold segment of this study. Thus, the reference samples were selected as those collected at < \u2212 6 \u2022 C during the non-lockdown period (N = 70), with the majority of them from 63 successive days before the lockdown (starting from 19 November 2020). A benefit of this classification approach was that the influence of temperature-dependent variation of heatinginduced coal combustion emissions could be largely reduced. Another benefit was that the influence of agricultural fires could also be minimized. This was because all samples characterized by elevated LG to OC ratios, which were typically associated with intensive fire hotspots (Fig. S2) and consequently pointed to open burning activities in Harbin and the surrounding regions, gathered in the \"other\" samples collected at temperatures > \u2212 6 \u2022 C (Fig. 1b) .",

SO 2 concentrations were also comparable between the two periods, whereas R S/N differed substantially with higher values during lockdown ( Fig. 1c and d) . For example, as much as 48% of the lockdown samples showed relatively high R S/N values of above 0.55, compared to a corresponding fraction of only 29% for the reference samples. The most likely explanation for the almost unchanged SO 2 but increased R S/N during lockdown was that the COVID-19 control measures mainly reduced vehicle emissions, but did not impact coal combustion emissions significantly (Lian et al., 2020) . The lockdown-induced reduction in vehicle emissions was within expectation, since people were required or advised to stay home, and travel (which frequently relied on gasoline cars) was largely restricted. On the other hand, coal combustion activities such as those for heating supply, power generation and some industrial processes were usually uninterruptible Chu et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2021) , which should be responsible for the relative stable coal combustion emissions throughout the lockdown and reference periods.",

Previous studies typically suggested that \u0394EC/\u0394CO were substantially lower for gasoline vehicle exhausts than coal combustion emissions (Wang et al., 2011) . Thus the lockdown-related increase in \u0394EC/\u0394CO was in line with the inference that the contribution of vehicle exhausts, especially those from gasoline cars, was considerably reduced by the COVID-19 control measures.",

Meanwhile, the carbonaceous aerosol became more abundant in secondary OC (Fig. S5a-S5b) , i.e., SOC determined as the sum of OC masses attributed to the secondary aerosol factors. The fraction of SOC in total OC (f SOC ) increased from 38% for the reference period to 45% during lockdown (Fig. 1f) , and a similar increase was identified for the SOC to EC ratio, SOC/EC (from 2.3 to 3.1). The lockdown period also exhibited higher levels of the sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR; Fig. S5c ) and the nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR; Fig. S5d ). Given the comparable RH but different ozone levels between the two periods, the higher f SOC , SOC/EC, SOR and NOR during lockdown should be primarily attributed to stronger photochemistry. Regarding these four ratios, in addition, their largest values were observed in the same lockdown sample (Fig. S6) , which also showed the maximum ozone (87.22 \u03bcg/m 3 ) and an extremely high AWC (227 \u03bcg/m 3 , with a pH of 5.3). This coincidence might point to the presence of photochemistryrelated reactions in aqueous phase (Kuang et al., 2020) , which have not be observed in the frigid atmosphere over Northeast China.",

Taking together an organic tracer for BB emissions and a diagnostic ratio for non-BB sources, the reference period was selected with minimal influences of non-lockdown-related emission variations, i.e., occurrences of agricultural fires and temperature-driven changes in heating-induced coal combustion. Compared to the reference period, SO 2 were almost unchanged whereas R S/N considerably increased during lockdown, indicating relatively stable coal combustion emissions but reduced vehicle emissions. The elevated R S/N were accompanied with concurrent increases in ozone and various indicators for secondary aerosol formation, pointing to enhanced secondary pollution driven by NO 2 reduction (Huang et al., 2021) . In addition, indirect evidence for the presence of photochemistry in aqueous phase was observed despite the low temperatures in Harbin. ",

Comparisons of (c) SO 2 concentrations, (d) normalized frequency (F) distributions of R S/N , (e) O 3 concentrations and (f) OC source apportionment results between the lockdown and reference periods. In (b), LG/OC values of above 2% were typically associated with intensive agricultural fires in Harbin and the surrounding regions. In (c) and (e), lower and upper box bounds indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, the whiskers below and above the box indicate the 5th and 95th percentiles, and the circle within the box marks the median. In (d), R S/N values determined for the lockdown period were first divided into six bins with R S/N ranges of 0.25-0.35, 0.35-0.45, 0.45-0.55, 0.55-0.65, 0.65-0.75 and > 0.75, respectively; then for each bin, the frequency F was normalized by the total number of lockdown samples. For the reference period, the R S/N distribution was determined similarly. In (f), OC BB , OC non-BB and OC sec indicate OC concentrations contributed by primary BB emissions, primary non-BB emissions and secondary formation, respectively (Fig. S1 ). As indicated by (a) and (b), the lockdown and reference samples were collected under relatively cold conditions and were insignificantly impacted by open burning. Thus the comparisons in (c)-(f) would not be complicated by temperature-dependent variation of heating-induced coal combustion or open burning, neither of which was associated with COVID-19 control measures.",
