Whilst national and international COVID-19 lockdown and travel restriction measures have had widespread negative impact on economies and mental health, they may have beneficial effect on the environment, reducing air and water pollution. Mass bathing events (MBE) also known as Kumbh Mela are known to cause perturbations of the ecosystem affecting resilient bacterial populations within water of rivers in India. Lockdowns and travel restrictions provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of minimum anthropogenic activity on the river water ecosystem and changes in bacterial populations including antibiotic-resistant strains. We performed a spatiotemporal meta-analysis of bacterial communities of the Godavari River, India. Targeted metagenomics revealed a 0.87-fold increase in the bacterial diversity during the restricted activity of lockdown. A significant increase in the resilient phyla, viz. Proteobacteria (70.6%), Bacteroidetes (22.5%), Verrucomicrobia (1.8%), Actinobacteria (1.2%) and Cyanobacteria (1.1%), was observed. There was minimal incorporation of allochthonous bacterial communities of human origin. Functional profiling using imputed metagenomics showed reduction in infection and drug resistance genes by \u2212 0.71-fold and \u2212 0.64-fold, respectively. These observations may collectively indicate the positive implications of COVID-19 lockdown measures which restrict MBE, allowing restoration of the river ecosystem and minimise the associated public health risk.",

The ensuing COVID-19 global pandemic has severely impacted the healthcare systems worldwide, causing ~ 3.39 million deaths as of May 19, 2021 [2-4] . World leaders responded by imposing restriction on the movement of people, lockdowns and implementation of public health measures including social distancing, hand washing and wearing of face masks [5] . India was not an exception and imposed its nationwide lockdown on March 25, 2020. Considering India's population and the population density, an event of community transmission might have led to a havoc [6] . Most countries have implemented lockdown measures with national and international travel restrictions, which have affected all facets of life globally with major negative social and economic consequences [7] . On the other hand, the reduced movement of humans may have played a role in cleansing and restoration of environment, biodiversity and ecosystems that were under the perpetual anthropogenic stress [8] . Hence, it became important to evaluate the implications and/or beneficial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the environment [9] .",

            "text": "A recent study by Somani et al. [6] , detailing the comprehensive analysis of various pollutants, suggested positive implications of restricted anthropogenic activities during the COVID-19 lockdown, particularly on the quality of water, level of air pollution, noise pollution, waste generation, etc. Restricted movement and lower traffic were also found to aid in dropping the levels of nitrogen dioxide and noise pollution [10] . Similarly, a review by Rume and Islam [9] on environmental implications of COVID-19 underscores the improved quality of air with the reduction in emission of greenhouse gases and decrease in water pollution across the globe. Additionally, the review also highlights the plausibility of ecological restoration especially at the tourist spots. In Indian, the concentrations of pollutant such as PM 2.5 , PM 10 , O 3 , NO 2 , SO 2 and CO were consistently noted to be higher than its permissible limits, but during the course of lockdown, it was found to be under the permissible limits (with some occasional spikes) in the various megacities [5, 11, 12] . Additionally, the stringent lockdown had its contribution in cleansing the rivers and other aquatic ecosystems which are otherwise under the continuous burden of discharges from untreated sewage and industries [13] [14] [15] . Surprisingly, in the matter of weeks of lockdown, the water quality of the longest river of India, i.e. Ganga, was more pronounce than the collective efforts of more than a decade [16] [17] [18] . Singhal and Matto [17] highlighted that the sudden decrease in the number of pilgrims and the 500% decrease in the introduction of domestic and industrial effluents have led the improvement of the water quality. Similarly, in case of rivers Yamuna, Cauvery and Krishna, Central Pollution Control Board [19] reported concentrations of various factors like dissolved oxygen (DO), pH and coliform count to be under the permissible limits during the lockdown. Alternatively, the COVID-19 was associated with the inevitable situation of generation of enormous biomedical waste. Ineffective disposal of the biomedical waste was related to the environmental hazard especially affecting the water bodies [9] . The latter was also supported by a case study from Bangladesh indicating responders suffering effective disposal of COVID-19 preventives, leading to contamination of the water bodies [20] .",

The Kumbh Mela involves the ritual practice of bathing in the river which substantially increases the risk associated with the spread of water infectious diseases among the fellow pilgrims [23] and also causes perturbations of the ecosystems. Our spatiotemporal investigation of the river Godavari during the 2015 Kumbh Mela event by using bacterial communities as a proxy revealed the deleterious impact of the mass bathing event (MBE). It was observed to be associated with the loss of diversity, with invasive establishment of allochthonous bacterial communities, enormous introduction of human faecal microbiota and increased virulence and drug resistance genes [25] .",

Recent studies on the river Ganga found a reduction in the biological oxygen demand (BOD), faecal coliform count and nitrate (NO 3 ) concentration and an increase in dissolved oxygen during the lockdown [26, 27] . However, both the studies primarily focus on the quality of the river water and adopted a classical approach of assessment of physiochemical factors and microbial contaminants, and investigation was restricted to the faecal coliform and total coliform counts [26] . However, it fails to provide insight into the bacterial communities thriving in the environment at given time and space. As the bacterial communities are sensitive to subtle variations in their environments, it can serve as a proxy to delineate the extend of ecological disturbances or restoration, if any [28] . In the recent year, the next-generation sequencing has widely been used and has proven its competency in determining such anomalies associated with changing environment or in human health [29] .",

The estimates of the TS, TDS and TSS were found to increase during the course of MBE (by 2.08-, 1.72-and 2.45-fold, respectively) and decrease during the minimal anthropogenic activity, i.e. the period of lockdown (\u2212 0.74-, \u2212 0.65and \u2212 0.81-fold, respectively). The significant increase in the TS (p \u2264 0.01), TDS (p = 0.055) and TSS (p \u2264 0.005) leads to a surge in the turbidity of water. A significant variation in turbidity was noted under the temporal gradient (p \u2264 0.02). The turbidity increased by 2.26-fold during the course of mass bathing event. In contrast, the turbidity was found to degrease by \u2212 0.79-fold during the lockdown period. Increase in the turbidity and solute concentration during MBE corroborated the fact that the event attracts participation by millions of pilgrims at the event. Additionally, the untreated human solid and sewer waste along with the industrial and household waste being routinely discharged into the river lead to deterioration of water quality [22, 23] . Contamination of freshwater ecosystem consequently has a deleterious impact on the aquatic biota, including microorganisms [15, 51] . In contrast, the imposed restriction due the COVID-19 pandemic has been found to improvise the water quality and ecosystem, which was also noted in the case of river Damodar [27] . The observation was further supported by the study on river Ganga, suggesting positive implications of the lockdown towards ecosystem restoration [26] . Further, a study by Cooke et al. [7] highlighted both the benefits and risk due to pandemic on the freshwater fishes. In contrast, pH and temperature of the water were not found to differ significantly (p = 0.65 and p = 0.62, respectively). Further, evaluation of the oxygen relationship depicted a significant variation in the BOD (p \u2264 0.009) under temporal variation across mass bathing sites. The BOD was increased by 1.13-fold during the mass bathing event but was found to decrease by \u2212 0.94-fold during the lockdown. The variations in BOD was the consequence of substantial variation in the concentration of the DO (p = 0.11). The concentration of the DO was decreased by \u2212 0.6-fold but raised by 2.5-fold during the lockdown. Similarly, the microbiological assessment of the river water indicated a 67.7-fold increase in the MPN count (p = 0.34) which was found to reduce to \u2212 0.99-fold during the lockdown. Similarly, the faecal coliform count (p = 0.052) raised by 0.98-fold and lowered to \u2212 0.87 during the lockdown. The increase in the BOD is suggestive of Table 1 Environmental parameters and alpha diversity across the temporal variation of mass bathing event and COVID lockdown Sample ID Event the enormous influx of solutes due to bathing in the river, sediment resuspension, discharge from industries and leaching from unattended solid wastes during the MBE [51] [52] [53] . These changes in the river physiochemistry collectively have deleterious impact on the river microbial communities. Perturbation to the river bacterial communities and augmentation of specific bacterial groups like faecal coliforms pose a risk of spread of gastrointestinal diseases during the event [54, 55] . However, the lockdown was also found to be beneficial concerning the oxygen relationship of the river water which also coincides with observations of Dutta et al. [26] depicting the increased level of DO and reduction in BOD and faecal coliform counts in the river Ganga.",

The estimates of alpha diversity index revealed substantial variability under the spatiotemporal realm; however, it was not be supported by the statistical significance ( Table 1 ). The estimates of the non-parametric Shannon index depicted variance with respect to the time; i.e. it was found to decrease by \u2212 0.53-fold during the mass bathing event whilst it was found to recover during the lockdown by 0.87-fold. This observation suggested potential re-establishment of diversity as minimal divergence of \u2212 0.13-fold was noted between before MBE and lockdown samples. It was further supported by the assessment of Chao1 index and observed OTUs (Table 1 ). In summary, the species richness was found to follow an order of during MBE < lockdown < before MBE samples (Fig. S1 ). Loss of bacterial diversity found during the MBE might be supported by deteriorated quality of the river water and enormous influx of organic and inorganic waste having adverse impact on the microbial communities and river ecosystem [52, 53, 56] . Alternatively, a 0.87-fold increase in the Shannon index implied the events of ecosystem restoration under the improvised water quality during the imposed lockdown period [9, 26] .",

The river bacterial community composition before the MBE was comprised of varied bacterial taxa having relative abundance \u2265 1%, viz. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Cyanobacteria. These phyla are known as the major constituents of river autochthonous communities driving key functions of primary production in river ecosystem [57, 58] . Conversely, members of bacterial phylum Actinobacteria are effective players in the degradation of a variety of compounds [59] . However, these phyla were found to be replaced by the selective augmentation of phylum Firmicutes (94.6%) along the mass bathing sites during the course of mass bathing event. It indicated the potential of members of phylum Firmicutes to withstand and flourish in the oxygen-limiting and high-solute conditions [60] . Minimal human activity during the period of lockdown sites featured re-establishment of various bacterial phyla Proteobacteria (70.6%), Bacteroidetes (22.5%), Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria having relative abundance of \u2265 1%. It further supported the observed increase in the Shannon index by 0.87-fold during the lockdown period.

In contrast, enrichment of Planococcaceae (53.1%) (Fig. S2) , Bacillaceae (41.1%) and Sphingomonadaceae (2%) was noted during the course of mass bathing due to its virtue of sustaining the extreme conditions of high-solute concentration and low-oxygen conditions [60, 61] . Furthermore, due to minimal human interference during the lockdown period, augmentation of diverse families, viz. Moraxellaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, [Chromatiaceae], Comamonadaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Oxalobacteraceae and Rhodocyclaceae (relative abundance \u2265 1%), was observed.",

Conversely, Lysinibacillus (43.8%), Bacillus (41%) and Planomicrobium (4.9%) were found to flourish during the MBE. Moreover, the correlation between the changing environmental factors and bacterial community at the level of genus was carried which revealed a distinct influence of environmental factors on the bacterial communities (Fig. S4) . The variations in the optical density of the water along with the TS, TDS, TSS and BOD were found to favour the bacterial genera Lysinibacillus, Bacillus and Planomicrobium (p \u2264 0.05). However, the dissolved oxygen was found to cast negative impact on the Lysinibacillus, Bacillus and Planomicrobium (p \u2264 0.05). Additionally, the substantial variation in the dissolved oxygen was found to be positively correlated with the Rhodobacter and Novosphingobium (p \u2264 0.05), whereas changes in the estimates of faecal coliforms were found to favour the Lysinibacillus (p \u2264 0.05). Interestingly, the Lysinibacillus, Bacillus and Planomicrobium showed a positive correlation between themselves (p \u2264 0.001); in contrast, they cast negative impact on the bacterial genera, viz.

Conversely, Acinetobacter shares a positive correlation between Rhodobacter (p \u2264 0.001) and Novosphingobium (p \u2264 0.01). Similarly, Rhodobacter and Novosphingobium depict a significant positive correlation (p \u2264 0.01). Enumeration of members of Lysinibacillus and Bacillus indicates the potential shedding of human skin-associated microbiota during the MBE. Enrichment of Planomicrobium corroborated the facts of the ability of various Planomicrobium species to thrive in a variety of halophilic environments and their association with recreational waters [28, 60] . Although species of Lysinibacillus represents common members of human skin microbiota, some species of Lysinibacillus have also been associated with the sepsis in immunocompromised patients [61, 62] . Thus, an increase in abundance of Lysinibacillus may pose a serious health risk for the fellow pilgrims bathing in the river. Interestingly, during the lockdown period, re-establishment of few bacterial genera that were observed before the MBE, viz. Acinetobacter, Flavobacterium and Limnohabitans (relative abundance \u2265 1%), was observed.",

Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis demonstrated three distinct groups based on the temporal variations (i.e. before MGE, during MGE and lockdown) indicating a significant impact of mass bathing on the river bacterial communities. The samples belonging to the before MGE and lockdown period showed lower intra-group variability (Fig. S5) . However, the during MGE samples showed higher intra-group variability which corroborates the fact of samples DS4 and DS5 being sink to other mass bathing sites. Although the Shannon index demonstrates the increase in bacterial diversity during the lockdown period whilst, the distinctive clustering observed during the beta diversity analysis indicates the variation in the bacterial community structure and composition across the studied time points. The latter is supported by the observed changes in bacterial community structure and composition at the level of family and genera (Figs. S2 and S3) . The composite observation of distinct clustering, lower intra-group variability during the lockdown period, significant increase in bacteria diversity (0.87-fold increase in Shannon index) and enumeration of resilient bacterial communities imply a positive impact of lockdown on the river ecosystem and, consequently, on the river bacterial communities [9, 26] .",

It is suggestive of the fact that the lockdown had a positive impact, as it indirectly led to cleaning of the river ecosystem. Although health risk associated with such alien communities remains largely unknown however, assessing the source of these microbial communities might aid to devise the mitigation strategies for potential infections related to the eye, skin and bowel [63, 64] . As observed, earlier prevalence of Lysinibacillus during the MBE might have an unfavourable outcome of sepsis [61] .

However, gene families related to the infectious diseases and drug resistance were targeted to evaluate the impact of changes in the bacterial communities on the public health. (Fig. 5a) . Likewise, gene families driving the drug resistance in the bacterial communities were also found to rise with the MBE. Specifically, an increase in beta-lactam resistance (1.04-fold), vancomycin resistance (2.49-fold), cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance (2.86-fold) and platinum drug resistance (1.75-fold) was observed during the MBE. The plausible re-establishment of the bacterial communities during the lockdown appeared to have lower prevalence of the gene families associated with drug resistance. A reduction in the levels of beta-lactam resistance (\u2212 0.39-fold), vancomycin resistance (\u2212 0.73-fold), CAMP resistance (\u2212 0.76-fold) and platinum drug resistance (\u2212 0.59-fold) was noted during the lockdown period (Fig. 5b) . Such elevated levels of gene families involved in the infectious diseases and drug resistance during the mass bathing event might pose a serious threat to the attendees which may have catastrophic outcomes like epidemics. Many recent studies on the river ecosystem and/or the religious pilgrimage support the observed increase in the abundance of gene families involved in infectious diseases and drug resistance. Specifically, the study on Ganga targeting the bla NDM-1 gene revealed an increase in antibiotic resistance during the period of pilgrimage [21] . Similarly, in our previous study, we also noted an increase in antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated across the MBE and described a novel cefotaxime-resistant strain of Corynebacterium godavarianum from the Godavari River, India [66, 67] . The recent study by Yadav et al. [68] involving shotgun metagenomic analysis based on the MinION sequencing supports the observed elevated levels of antibiotic resistance genes during mass bathing.",
