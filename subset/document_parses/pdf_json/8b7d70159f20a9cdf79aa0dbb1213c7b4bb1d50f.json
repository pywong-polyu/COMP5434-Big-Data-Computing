Despite three decades of genome sequencing, our understanding of the role of genomic diversification across continents and time is incomplete. To close the spatiotemporal gap of genomic information of human noroviruses, we conducted a large-scale genome-wide analyses that included the nearly full-length sequencing of 281 archival viruses circulating since the 1970s in over 10 countries from four continents, with a major emphasis on norovirus genotypes that are currently underrepresented in public genome databases. We provided new genome information for 24 distinct genotypes, including the oldest genome information from 12 norovirus genotypes. Analyses of this new genomic information, together with those publicly available, showed that (i) noroviruses evolve at similar rates across genomic regions and genotypes; (ii) emerging viruses evolved from transiently-circulating intermediate viruses;",

This study provides a comprehensive genetic analysis of diverse norovirus genotypes and the role of non-structural proteins on viral diversification, shedding new light on the mechanisms of norovirus evolution and transmission.",

In healthy individuals the disease is resolved rapidly, but in vulnerable populations (e.g. the elderly, malnourished children, or immunocompromised patients) symptoms can last longer, resulting in severe dehydration and death. Annually, norovirus is associated with over 600 million cases of acute gastroenteritis and up to 200,000 deaths in children, mostly from developing countries [1, 2] . Thus, a vaccine could save hundreds of thousands of lives and help to mitigate the burden of norovirus disease.",

            "text": "The human norovirus genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense, polyadenylated, RNA molecule of~7.5kb in size, organized into three open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by two short untranslated regions. ORF1 encodes the non-structural proteins (NS1/2-7), required for virus replication, while ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major (VP1) and minor (VP2) capsid proteins, respectively [3] . The genome is enclosed by an array of capsid proteins that form icosahedral particles with a diameter of approximately 27 nm [4] . The structural model of norovirus VP1 presents two domains, the shell (S) and the protruding (P) domain [5] . The S domain forms the scaffold of the icosahedral capsid, while the P domain is a projection that contains the determinants of host interactions, including neutralizing epitopes and carbohydrate binding sites that act as attachment factors to facilitate infection [6] [7] [8] . While the precise role of VP2 remains to be elucidated, there is evidence that it might be involved in particle stabilization [9] .",

            "text": "One of the major obstacles for norovirus vaccine development is the large viral genetic and antigenic diversity [10] . Genetic differences within VP1 have been used to classify noroviruses into genogroups and genotypes [11] . Over 30 different genotypes, mostly from genogroups I (GI) and II (GII), have been shown to infect humans. While most genotypes circulate with variable incidences, a single genotype (GII.4) predominates globally [12, 13] . This dominance of GII.4 viruses has been explained by the accrual of mutations on the VP1, resulting in the emergence of new variants [14] [15] [16] . Although GII.4 predominance has been recorded for over two decades, other genotypes can transiently predominate in a given geographical location. This is evidenced by the recent emergence and increase in incidence of GII.17 and GII.2 in different countries [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . While these two viruses are antigenically distinct to GII.4 [8, 22] , suggesting immune escape as a mechanism of emergence, it seems that norovirus emergence is a multifactorial event that includes changes in viral proteins other than VP1 and virus-host interactions [12] . Thus, the emergence of epidemic GII.2 viruses was associated with changes in the NS7 (viral RNA polymerase) [23] , and the emergence of epidemic GII.17 viruses was associated with mutations in VP1 that resulted in the emergence of a new variant and changes in host susceptibility [24] [25] [26] .",

Thus, because norovirus also presents different types of viral RNA polymerases [11] , viruses with different combinations of capsid and polymerase types have been detected in nature [27] [28] [29] . While most recombinant viruses have been found circulating at low levels in the human population, emergence of epidemic viruses has also been associated with recombination events. The most recent example is the emergence of different viruses associated with the GII.P16 polymerase type causing outbreaks around the world [30] . It seems that mutations in this viral polymerase provided new characteristics for successful human infection, as shown by the large outbreaks of GII.2[P16] (GII.2 capsid and GII.P16 polymerase) viruses reported in the 2016/2017 season. This polymerase was initially associated with GII.2 and GII.4 capsids [17, 31] , but recently this polymerase has been reported with multiple other capsids, including GII.1, GII.3, GII.12, and GII. 13 [30,32] . The mechanism by which the viral polymerase is involved in viral emergence is not completely understood, but might include differences in the mutational and/or transcriptional rate that could facilitate transmission at the individual or population level [33] [34] [35] .",

Moreover, most norovirus genome records available were obtained from predominant genotypes that circulated since the mid-2000s in developed countries. Thus, there is a large data gap on the spatiotemporal genomic diversification of human noroviruses. To gain insights on the evolution and mechanisms of norovirus emergence, we collected archival samples and sequenced over 281 viruses circulating since the 1970s in over 10 countries from four continents, with a major emphasis on those genotypes that are underrepresented in the public databases. Thus, using this improved dataset of human norovirus genomes we aimed to (i) revisit evolutionary parameters at the genome-wide level that could provide insights on norovirus diversification, (ii) perform a detailed analysis of the phylogenetic relationship among atypical and untypeable viruses, and (iii) investigate factors that govern recombination among noroviruses.",

Thus, because our work provided the oldest genome information for 12 out of the 36 genotypes described for human norovirus, we thought to calculate the evolutionary rates using this novel information. We found that inclusion of historical samples collected before the 1990s significantly improved the clock-likeness of the VP1-encoding sequences in the dataset (P<0.01 in Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, Fig 2A) . The R 2 from VP1 phylogenetic root-to-tip regression was improved in correlation with longer duration of years analyzed, providing the accuracy of evolutionary rates estimated. Overall, the rate of evolution was similar for most of the human noroviruses (1.12-4.86 \u00d7 10 \u22123 nucleotide substitutions/site/year), with the 95% highest posterior density (95%HPD) intervals overlapping among most of the genotypes/variants (Fig 2B and S2 Table) . Some of the 95%HPD intervals did not overlap with others, suggesting small differences among the rate of evolution of distinct genotypes. The highest evolutionary rate on VP1-encoding sequences was recorded in GII.4 viruses, which presented periodic emergence and replacement of variants [12] . Some non-GII.4 viruses, e.g. GI.3, GII.6, and GII.17, could be also divided into variants using a cutoff of 5% amino acid differences in the VP1. Notably, while GII.4 variants circulated only for a short period (3-8 years), most non-GII.4 variants have been shown to co-circulate for decades [14, 46] . The distinct non-GII.4 variants presented only minor differences in the rate of evolution, but that difference did not correlate with the prevalence and epidemic potential of viruses.",

Accordingly, the estimated number of sites under positive pressure decreased sharply when looking into individual variants, with a smaller number of sites on P2 domains identified to be under pressure (S1 Fig).

However, none of those mutations were detected in non-structural proteins from epidemic GII.4[P4] viruses, indicating that these different residues could have emerged due to founder effect and/or not by contributing to epidemic potential [12] .",

Thus, we sequenced a GII.17 virus (Arg13099) detected in 2015 in Argentina that did not cluster with any of the variants described for the VP1 [52] (Fig 7A) . We also found in our dataset two archival GII.17 viruses (T055/Tunisia and DS284/Saudi Arabia from 1977 and 1990, respectively) that were indeed intermediate, and did not cluster with the rest of the viruses of each given variant on the VP1 tree. To gain insights on the diversification of GII.17 viruses, we also analyzed the NS7 sequences from those viruses. The Arg13099 virus did not cluster with any polymerase type, and the T055 virus was typed as GII.P13, but situated outside of the cluster that included other GII.P13 viruses ( Fig 7A) . DS284 was the only GII.17 virus that presented a GII.P3 polymerase. Because GII.P3, GII.P13, and GII.P17 NS7 sequences share a common ancestor and are all genetically close, it is difficult to determine whether the DS284 virus is a recombinant or another lineage. Other intermediate viruses from GII.17 were also reported in the public database, e.g. 27-3/Japan, NORO_231_20/ United Kingdom. Thus, these different intermediate viruses suggest that the GII.17 virus explored multiple variants (and phenotypes) until reaching epidemic potential in 2014.",

One of the viruses was a recombinant with a VP1 sequence from GII.12, and all of them presented similar VP2 sequences with those from GII. Finally, multiple untypeable viruses were detected when their NS7 were analyzed ( Fig 7C) . While the NS7 protein showed less variation as compared with VP1 sequences (Fig 5) , the untypeable viruses were placed on the tree as intermediates of the evolution among polymerase types. In norovirus nomenclature, the different genotypes are assigned by a tight phylogenetic clustering of viruses, and recombinant viruses are mostly recognized by presenting a VP1 capsid genotype and a different polymerase type. Thus, these intermediate viruses make the polymerase clustering less distinct, and the typing of novel strains more challenging.",

A large number of recombinant viruses has been reported in the literature [28, 29] , but only a few are regarded as epidemiologically relevant. Some of those are GII. 4 Based on the number of genotypes and polymerase types, recombination at the ORF1 and ORF2 junction region could theoretically generate >1200 capsid-polymerase combinations; however, in our nearly full-length database we only found 92 capsid-polymerase combinations, including 18 new combinations that were confirmed with full-length genome sequences in this study (Table 2) . To gain insights on the mechanisms behind norovirus recombination, we first organized and tabulated all capsid and polymerase types included in our dataset based on their phylogenetic clustering (Fig 8) . Notably, the phylogeny from NS7 presented five major clusters, each including several polymerase types (Fig 8) , that were associated with a specific subset of capsid genotypes. Thus, the GI genotypes presented two distinct clusters at the NS7 and VP1 tree, and recombination was detected only among genotypes from the same clusters. Similarly, the GII polymerase types showed one large and two small clusters, and recombination was restricted to capsid genotypes linked to the viruses grouped in the same NS7 cluster. One of the smaller groups included viruses presenting the GII.P6, GII.P7, GII.P8, GII.P20, and GII.P36 polymerase that were linked only to the GII.6, GII.7, GII.8, GII.9, GII.14, or GII.20 capsid genotypes, while the other small group included recently described genotypes (GII.22-GII.27) and polymerase types (GII.P22-GII.P27, GII.P40). The latter could be embedded within the larger group that include all other GII viruses because of the phylogenetic clustering and a limited number of viruses from three genotypes (GII.2, GII.5, and GII.12) presenting the newly described polymerase types (Fig 8) . Notably, GII.P15 and GII.P28 did not follow the recombination restriction, as they were associated with only the capsid from non-GII viruses, GIX.1 and GVIII.1, respectively. Viruses presenting these combinations confirm the possibility of inter-genogroup recombination; however, no parental viruses have been detected so far.",

Thus, we examined 200 nt from the 3'-end of the NS7 (ORF1) and 200 nt from the 5'-end of the VP1 (ORF2). This junction region is highly conserved [27] , particularly within the~20 nt encompassing the ORF1/2 overlapping region ( Fig 9A) . To explore the sites correlated with groups presenting recombination restriction, we performed a multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis using nucleotide sequence variation at the ORF1/2 junction (Fig 9B) . The 400 nt junction region was divided into four windows, each corresponding to 100 nt in length. The first two regions correspond to the 3'-end of ORF1, and the last two correspond to 5'-end of ORF2 sequences (Fig 9A) . These MDS maps indicated strong clustering in the first window (Fig 9B) , while the second window presented modest clustering by recombination group. On the other hand, the two windows from the 5'-end of ORF2 showed strong clustering by genogroups, but not by recombination groups. The MDS maps were also created from genome regions by their function: namely 3'end of ORF1 (NS7), 5'end of ORF2 (sub-genomic RNA), predicted stem-loop, and linker sequence between predicted Genotypes were determined for all the viruses in the nearly full-length dataset using Norovirus Genotyping Tool [102] . Viruses were grouped phylogenetically and the number of viruses with a given capsid and polymerase types was recorded in each cell. Phylogenetic trees were calculated using a subsampled dataset: a maximum of two viruses from each combination of genotype and polymerase type. The colored boxes in the matrix indicate the recombination groups associated with the phylogenetic clustering on the NS7-encoding nucleotide sequences. The crossing lines on the phylogenetic tree of the VP1 indicate the disruption of VP1-clustering and recombination groups.",

One advantage of the full-length sequencing platform presented here is that we utilized full-length PCR amplicons and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology [14] , which enabled us to detect reads from different viruses in a given sample. We found five mixed-infection cases in our virus collection, three from cross-sectional studies and two from cohort studies. The three cases from the cross-sectional study included mixed-infections with GII.14 and GII.4, GII.2 and GII.14, and GII.12 and GII.6 ( Fig 10A) . By applying a clonal population analysis, which determines the clones (haplotypes) present in the sample by association of NGS reads by similarity [62,63], we reconstructed the consensus sequences from multiple clones or genotypes at the near full-length level (>7400 nt, Fig 10A) . Two cases from Peruvian birth cohort and family cohort studies included mixed-infection with GII.4 and GII.3, and GII.NA2 and GII.4 viruses. In these studies, stool samples were collected regularly, which allowed us to follow up virus diversification during the shedding phase of these two reinfection cases (Fig 10B and 10C) . Child NV066X was infected with GII. Fig 10C) . On Day 0, most of the genomic reads were mapped against GII.4 virus (86% in total reads), while GII.NA2 was detected as a very minor population (6%). This prevalence was reverted by Day 15, with GII. NA2 becoming predominant on Day 15 and 21. Finally, GII.4 virus disappeared and only GII. NA2 virus was detected on Day 29. Genome titers calculated by qPCR recapitulated this trend (S10A Fig). The presence of mucosal IgA was measured using the stool samples and norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) as antigens. Surprisingly, norovirus genotype-specific IgA response was detected only against one of the infecting genotypes, the major clone at the end of the infection, and not the one first cleared (S10B Fig) . Viral mutants (subclones) were detected in both major viruses at the end of shedding periods, possibly as a result from the mucosal response (Fig 10B and 10C) .",

            "text": "Another evidence for the limited intra-genotype recombination of human noroviruses is revealed by tracking the changes in the polymerase type along the evolutionary trees of VP1 (Fig 11) . Examination of the phylogenetic trees from four of the most frequent norovirus genotypes reconfirmed that most recombination events occurred with polymerase types from the same branches on the NS7 phylogenetic tree (Fig 11) . The number of changes of polymerase types along branches, as counted with Markov-jump counting method [64], suggested limited recombination events during the evolution of these GII genotypes during the last 40 years. Thus, GII.2 viruses present two major polymerase types, GII.P2 and GII.P16, and recombination from GII.P2 to GII.P16 occurred three times throughout their evolution while recombination with other minor polymerase types occurred only once. In GII.6 viruses, recombination from GII.P6 to GII.P7, which are very close to each other, also occurred three times but not vice versa. The GII.4 viruses circulating in the 1970s and early 1980s presented the GII. (Fig 11) . No opposite direction of recombination (from GII.P16 to GII.P4 or GII.P31) was estimated from the tree. Finally, GII.3 viruses experienced multiple recombination events: three times from GII.P21 to GII.P16, two times from GII.P21 to GII.P12 and GII.P41 to GII.P3, and a single recombination event was recorded for GII.P3 to GII.P16, GII.P41 to GII.P29, GII.P29 to GI.P21, and GII.P12 to GII.P16. While GII.2 and GII.3 present over ten recombination events, that still could be regarded as a low number of recombination considering that this occurred over four decades. Together, this shows that recombination in human noroviruses is not a frequent event, or a small number of recombinant viruses are fit to emerge and circulate in the human population.",

            "text": "Because of the public health impact and development of new technologies to study virus genomics, the epidemiology and diversification of norovirus has been widely investigated [13, 14, 66] . Over the last two decades, a great number of norovirus sequences have been recorded in public databases; however, this public dataset is currently biased at the geographical and temporal level, and only limited genotypes and genomic regions have been widely sequenced. Thus, most records belong to capsid sequences from the major genotypes (GII.2, GII.3, GII.4, GII.6, and GII.17) detected in developed countries since the 2000s. In this study, we successfully closed some of the information gaps by adding new sequence information for 24 genotypes and over 80 noroviruses circulating prior to 2000. Removal of temporal bias improved the fitness of the molecular clock analyses and our estimates of norovirus evolution. Many studies have reported the evolutionary rate of noroviruses, with some suggesting that differences in the evolutionary rate among different norovirus genotypes could account for the emergence and predominance of certain viruses [21, 67] . Our analyses showed that norovirus presented similar rates of evolution across the different ORFs and genotypes/variants (mean 1.37-5.38 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions/site/year) with overlapping 95%HPD intervals. Some genotypes, e.g., GII.1, GII.3, and GII.6, presented substitution rates that did not show overlapping of the 95%HPD intervals as compared with other genotypes; however, those differences were not related with the epidemic potential of the viruses. Thus, newly emerged or predominant viruses, like GII.2, GII.6, or GII.17 did not present higher rates of evolution as compared to other minor genotypes. Diversifying pressure on VP1, mostly on the P2 sub-domain, was detected in predominant genotypes and those with multiple variants. However, only viruses from the GII.4 genotype accumulate changes on the VP1 protein. Detection of diversifying pressure on non-GII.4 viruses with multiple variants suggests that these different lineages emerged, rapidly adapted to the human population, but showed low genetic robustness to accommodate major changes on their VP1 protein after decades of circulation and evolution. The significance of the co-circulation of multiple non-GII.4 variants is not completely understood. Changes in susceptibility and antigenicity have been attributed to the recent emergence of the new GII.17 variant that predominated during 2014-2015 in Asia [25, 26] ; however, additional studies are required to determine the phenotypic differences that could account for the emergence and co-circulation of the other non-GII.4 variants.",

These series of events have been shown to occur in the emergence of different GII.4 variants [14, 16, 69] , but most recently in the emergence of predominant GII.17 viruses. With stronger surveillance systems, the emergence of GII.17 was characterized by the quick change from one transiently circulating variant (namely C, circulated during 2012-2015) to the predominant variant (namely D, which was detected since 2013 and is still reported in certain countries, e.g. Japan [70] ). Thus, this rapid adaptation to the human population makes the detection of the intermediate viruses very difficult. In our historical samples, by focusing the attention on those less prevalent viruses, we detected multiple viruses that branched between defined variants or genotypes. While different hypotheses were presented on the emergence of novel norovirus (e.g. spill-over from hidden animal reservoirs [71] or variants originated in immunocompromised individuals [72] ), it is possible that the genetic drift operates over long periods and the intermediate viruses are cryptically circulating in under-sampled populations, as shown by the recent detection of 'novel' noroviruses in active surveillance in communities [44,45,73] or country-wide monitoring systems [51] . Considering the cryptic genetic drift and rapid adaptation to achieve epidemic potential, we may need to accommodate multiple evolutionary steps, i.e. genetic drift, rapid adaptation, and exponential growth of viral population followed by predominance in the communities, to the evolutionary models or in-depth analyses of the intrahost evolution of noroviruses to fully understand the emergence of novel viruses.",

While this seems to be the case for GII.4 noroviruses that presented continuous changes on the VP1, the recent predominance of GII.2 has been explained by changes on the viral polymerase [23] . Thus, it has been suggested that higher mutational rates, escape from T-cell immune responses to non-structural proteins, or increases in the replicative efficiency that results in higher levels of virus shedding could enhance transmissibility [33, 35, 69, 74] . In that regard, the role of other each polymerase type was determined from the phylogeny of the NS7-encoding nucleotide sequences. The direction and number of changes of polymerase types, i.e. recombination events, were estimated using Markov jump counting along the branches. Events with mean frequency >0.5 were summarized as bar graphs (the mean and the 95% highest posterior density interval).",

Thus, in addition to mutations on the viral polymerase (NS7), our study found high variability and mutations on the NS1/2 (Nterm) and NS4 (3A-like) proteins from epidemic vs. endemic GII.P16 and GII.P31 viruses. NS1/2 and NS4 proteins have been shown to induce replication complex formation by recruiting cellular membranes, and NS1/2 has been suggested to mediate and control the pathways of innate immunity [75, 76] . Whether changes on these proteins are the consequence of founder effect or indeed enhance the epidemic potential from some viruses, warrants further research.",

A hot spot for norovirus recombination has been identified at the ORF1/ORF2 overlapping region [27] , reinforcing the role of non-structural proteins in the emergence of new noroviruses. Although a very large number of combinations of genotypes could be present in nature by means of recombination, our findings indicate that noroviruses show restriction in their ability to recombine with phylogenetically unrelated genotypes. This was supported by large-scale population genomics analyses, as well as the analysis of the intra-host diversity of patients with mixed infections. The latter provided a unique opportunity to determine the frequency of recombination among two viruses from the same phylogenetic cluster (i.e. GII. While one chimeric read (0.005% of coverage) was detected from the second sample (day 7), this was not reproducible in a second experiment. These data indicate that recombination at the ORF1/2 overlapping regions may occur under strong restriction and less frequently than initially thought. Previous studies reported a small number of recombinant viruses with capsid and polymerase combinations that do not follow the proposed restriction in this study, e.g. GII. 4[P7] or GII.7[P21] [28, 30] . Careful interpretation should be given to those reports, as the recombinants were determined with short-length sequences that could be incorrectly typed and/or amplicons from separated regions of the genomes that could be an experimental artifact of mixed infections. Whether recombination events occur more frequently at the intragenotype or at the variant level [41,50] remains to be determined. A limitation of our analyses is that it is technically difficult to define recombinants or false-positives among genetically similar viruses with intermediate viruses undetected.",

            "text": "Template switching between genomic and sub-genomic RNA is widely accepted as the molecular mechanism for ORF1/2 recombination in noroviruses [3, 28] ; however, there are no sufficient data to determine whether the sub-genomic or genomic RNA works as the acceptor molecule. Simmonds et al. predicted a stem-loop structure at the 3' end of ORF1 (\ufffd7 nt downstream of the (-) sub-genomic RNA start position) [60] , that was shown to be part of the subgenomic RNA promoter in murine norovirus [77] . If template switching occurs at the stemloop as suggested in the copy-choice model [78] , acceptor genome should be derived from genomic RNA with this stem-loop promoter sequence. Indeed, Bull et al. estimated the recombination breakpoints were located on average 16-19 nt upstream from the start of (+) ORF1/ ORF2 overlap [29] . Our finding supports the idea that genomic RNA, not sub-genomic RNA, works as an acceptor template. The acceptor genomic RNA could be annealed with the donor template at the 3' end of the ORF1, and thus the template-switching is restricted by the sequence identity on those regions between donor and acceptor RNA molecules. Based on these recombination restrictions, human noroviruses seem to be clustered into five recombination groups of viruses that do not genetically interact among each other. Restrictions on recombination of genes have been shown for multiple positive-sense RNA viruses, including enterovirus [79] and flavivirus [80] . Additionally, restrictions on the reassortment of genes have been reported for segmented viruses such as influenza virus and rotavirus [81, 82] . These restrictions seem to be governed by protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] . This study supports the mechanism of restriction to nucleic acid-nucleic acid interactions during the processing of (-) RNA genomes. Additional studies are warranted to determine whether exchange of genomes among the different genotypes may provide fitness disadvantages [89] [90] [91] , by which certain proteins interact better with the structural proteins or with host machinery during the replication process. Also, it is to be studied whether these restrictions occur in other positive-sense RNA viruses that utilize recombination as a mechanism of diversification [79, 92] .",

Briefly, complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated from the extracted viral RNA genome using the Maxima Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and a poly-A primer. The full-length viral genome amplification was done using the SequalPrep Long PCR Kit (Invitrogen) and primers listed in S3 Table. The resulting full-length viral genome amplicons (~7.5 kb) were run on the 1% agarose gel and extracted using Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, California, USA). The gel-extracted amplicons were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific), and subjected to NGS using MiSeq system (illumina, California, USA). The library for NGS was prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (illumina), and the paired-end 2 \u00d7 250 bp sequence reads were obtained. Reads were quality-filtered (base quality score \ufffd 20, and depth of coverage \ufffd 10) and i) mapped against reference genome set (all genotypes and polymerase types implemented in Norovirus Genotyping Tool [102] ) to screen the amplified genotypes, and ii) mapped against corresponding full-or nearly full-length reference genomes to reconstruct its consensus sequence using HIVE platform [62] . Samples were re-processed from the 10% stool suspension to confirm the mixed-infection if multiple genotypes were detected. Reads from mixed infection samples were then mapped against corresponding reference genomes followed by clonal population analysis using the Hexahedron Coordinated Clonal Analysis Tool implemented in the HIVE platform [63] . This clonal population analysis separately assembled all possible viral population (clones) contained in a single sample, and reconstructed their own consensus genomes at a near full-length level. Finally, chimeric reads were searched by HIVE using artificial chimeric genomes (400 nt ORF1/2 junction region) as references, and readmapping against the references were visualized with MSAViewer [103] . Nearly-complete consensus genome sequences and raw NGS reads from shedding cases obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank (Accession numbers: MG706448, MK733201-MK733207, MW261787-MW261800, MW305481-MW305742; summarized in S1 Table) and SRA (BioProject accession number: PRJNA659534), respectively.",

Clock-likeness of the dataset (genotypes/variants) was confirmed with linear regression analysis of root-to-tip distance using ML trees and TempEst v1.5 [108] , with and without historical sequences. The rate of evolution (substitutions/site/year) was calculated using BEAST v1.10.4 with strict-clock model [109] . The SRD06 model was used for estimating the nucleotide substitution process of the VP1-encoding sequences. The population size was assumed to be constant throughout their evolutionary history. The first 10% of the logs from the Markov chain Monte Carlo runs were removed as a burn-in before summarizing the posterior values. Recombination frequency, i.e. change of polymerase type, throughout the evolutionary history was estimated using asymmetric Markov Jump counting method [64] implemented in BEAST v1.10.4. The amino acid accumulation over time (distance from the oldest virus within each genotype) was calculated using phangorn package and R, with JTT model as the best-fit amino acid substitution model (in most of the genotypes) estimated using Smart Model Selection. Site-by-site selective pressure on VP1 from each genotype was estimated using MEME (Mixed Effects Model of Evolution) that detects sites under episodic selection by assuming varying pressure across branches on the phylogenetic tree [110] and FUBAR (Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation) that assumes constant pressure on the entire tree [111] , using Datamonkey (small dataset) [112] or HyPhy v2.5.14 (large dataset with \ufffd500 sequences) [113] .

The amino acid accumulation pattern was also estimated for other nonstructural proteins and VP2 proteins from each genotype. Maximum 50 nt of the 5' or 3' end of the NS1/2 or VP2-encoding region, respectively, was removed from the analyses to exclude the sequence gaps derived from partial genomes. To account for the sampling bias by predominance of certain genotypes, the ML phylogenetic trees and Shannon entropy values for each genomic region was estimated using randomly subsampled dataset which included a maximum of two viruses from each polymerase and capsid genotype combination (n = 33 for GI and n = 119 for GII viruses). The evolutionary rate of ORF1 (NS1/2-NS7) and ORF3 (VP2) sequences were estimated using BEAST v1.10.4 as described above. The ORF1 sequences were partitioned by each non-structural protein and rate of evolution was jointly estimated. The amino acid distance from the oldest virus within each genotype was calculated for the NS4, NS7, and VP2 proteins using R as described above. To explore key amino acid residues on nonstructural and VP2 proteins that could be associated with global spread and the epidemic potential of noroviruses, phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the amino acid sequences from NS1/2-NS7 and VP2 from GII.P4, GII.P16, GII.P31, and GII.2 viruses. The ML phylogenetic trees were built using PhyML as indicated above, and ancestral sequences on the nodes that diverged into epidemic clusters were estimated using maximum likelihood method implemented in phangorn package in R. The amino acid mutations on the NS7 of epidemic viruses were mapped on the structural model of the polymerase from GII.P4 virus (PDB number 4QPX) using UCSF Chimera v 1.11.
