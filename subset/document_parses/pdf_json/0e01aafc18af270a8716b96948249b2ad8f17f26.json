Hence, automatic and fast screening of COVID-19 infections has become an urgent need of this pandemic. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a commonly used primary clinical method, is expensive and time-consuming for skilled health professionals. With the aid of various AI functionalities and advanced technologies, chest CT scans may thus be a viable alternative for quick and automatic screening of COVID-19. At the moment, significant advances in 5G cellular and internet of things (IoT) technology are finding use in various applications in the healthcare sector. This study presents an IoT-enabled deep learning-based stacking model to analyze chest CT scans for effective diagnosis of COVID-19 encounters. At first, patient data will be obtained using IoT devices and sent to a cloud server during the data procurement stage. Then we use different fine-tuned CNN sub-models, which are stacked together using a meta-learner to detect COVID-19 infection from input CT scans. The proposed model is evaluated using an open access dataset containing both COVID-19 infected and non-COVID CT images. Evaluation results show the efficacy of the proposed stacked model containing fine-tuned CNNs and a meta-learner in detecting coronavirus infections using CT scans.",

These technologies can be used to diagnose patients in a variety of ways. With the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, the world has gone through a worldwide emergency causing significant casualties and impact on healthcare and socio-economic structures globally. The virus originally believed to be started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has rapidly spread all over the globe. As of December 7, 2020, there are approximately 67 million infected cases and more than 1.5 million mortalities all over the world [7] . The overall infected cases are constantly increasing due to the dearth of proper treatment and vaccines and the excessive rate of public transmission. World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the outbreak as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 [39] . COVID-19 is triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and is transmitted between individuals primarily through infection due to direct contact. The major symptoms found in COVID-19 patients are highly variable and commonly include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and so on. Individuals without any symptoms can even spread the virus and can stay infectious for a longer period.",

The test requires the specimen collection through an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab or a saliva sample for the detection of viral RNA. However, the use of RT-PCR test is limited due to several reasons. Firstly, it generates a high rate of false negative alarms and a patient initially assessed COVID-19 negative later could be tested positive [8] . Hence, multiple tests may be needed to verify a case which can take a maximum of two days. Secondly, the PCR test kits are short in supply as compared to the global demand due to the overwhelming infection rate. As a result, many coronavirus patients remain unidentified due to time-consuming and manual testing of PCR and are likely to infect others inadvertently. In such cases, alternative testing methods based on AI (Artificial Intelligence) techniques for automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 would be very useful to the clinicians. This will also facilitate the screening of COVID-19 cases on large scale.",

This type of inflammatory reaction can be effectively identified from radiology images such as chest X-Ray (CXR) or chest computed tomography (CT) . Earlier studies have demonstrated that radiographic features present in infected chest CT images come as a form of groundglass opacities (GGO) [6] . These visual elements specific to the novel coronavirus can be used by health practitioners to detect COVID-19 infection with the help of computer-aided diagnosis. There have been substantial works based on deep learning techniques that use radiology images of different modalities including chest CT and CXR images in diagnosing diseases in the smart healthcare domain. Specifically, several studies [18, 25, 30, 31] in the literature have developed various deep learningbased approaches to detect COVID-19 from the chest CT scan and CXR images and subsequently observe disease progress in the future. While these studies demonstrate promising results, they face several challenges. First, the diversity of COVID-19 radiographic features makes the deep learning models struggle in attaining superior diagnosis accuracy that complies with the clinical standard [35] . Second, the lack of a huge amount of training data typically required by deep learning models poses a serious challenge to models' generalizability to unseen data. It is challenging to collect a large amount of COVID-19 positive training data in this pandemic circumstance. Besides, some studies require manual segmentation of lungs or lesion masks which requires domain knowledge and is time-consuming. Hence, it is important to develop models that are effective with limited training data and do not necessitate domain knowledge in interpreting the diagnosis results.",

At first, patient data will be obtained using IoT devices and sent to a cloud server using 5G networks. In the stacking ensemble approach, model averaging is adopted where multiple sub-models, preferably deep and, are combined to obtain final prediction results. The ensemble model performance can be enhanced by taking the weighted contribution of each sub-model to the stacking model. This can be further improved by training a completely new model to combine the predictions from various individual sub-models in the best possible manner. This method is known as stacked generalization [43, 46] which was originally introduced to minimize the generalization error rate for one or more generalizers used on a learning dataset. Thus, the stacked generalization of deep CNN models provides the benefit of harnessing the strengths of a range of models on a prediction task and yields improved classification results than any of the sub-models in the ensemble. Specifically, we use three different fine-tuned CNN models called ResNet50V2, DenseNet121, and Xception as sub-models which are stacked together using a meta-learner for ultimate categorization of COVID-19 encounters from input CT images. Furthermore, we have used chest CT images from a public dataset consisting of 2484 samples to train our stacked ensemble model. Fig. 1 shows some positive and negative COVID-19 samples from the dataset. In summary, this work makes the following contributions:",

The proposed approach started with pre-processing the CT images to extract pulmonary regions and then used a 3D CNN segmentation model to segment multiple candidate infection regions. A location-attention classification algorithm was used to classify these image patches into IAVP, COVID-19, and irrelevant to infection groups. The model finally used the Noisy-OR Bayesian function to calculate the type of infection and confidence score for each image. Model training and evaluation were done using 618 CT images from all three categories mentioned above. The images were obtained from three COVID-19 hospitals in China. Evaluation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the model for early screening of COVID-19 with a modest rate of accuracy (86.7%). In another effort, Mishra et al. [23] proposed a deep learning system to detect COVID-19 in CT images using various off-the-shelf CNN models.

[9] introduced a hybrid system for the classification of COVID-19 patients from CT scans using a combination of automatic and handcrafted features extracted from deep learning models and Q-deformed entropy algorithm, respectively. The curated features are then fed to a long short-term memory (LSTM) classifier to discriminate COVID-19 cases from other pneumonia and healthy cases. The proposed model achieved the highest accuracy of 99.68% using CT images collected from a dataset consisting of 321 patients. In a more recent effort, Harmon et al. [8] proposed an AI-based approach to detect COVID-19 pneumonia using multinational chest CT datasets. The authors have developed a number of deep learning methods and trained them using CT images collected from a multinational cohort of 1280 patients. A lung segmentation model was developed using AH-Net architecture [20] to localize complete lung areas which are then fed to multiple classification models that perform 3D classification using multiple slices at fixed resolution and using one whole volume with fixed size as well. Evaluation results using an independent test dataset of 1337 patients showed that the model can achieve maximum accuracy of 90.8%. Some other works [5, 19] have also developed COVID-19 diagnostic tools using 2D and 3D CNNs based on CT scans. Moreover, some researchers adopted segmentation techniques for the rapid identification of COVID-19 using CT scans [28] .",

Specifically, the stacked ensemble of multiple CNN models permits us to combine the capability of each model (e.g., wide and deep) that has been trained for a particular task such as classification. Typically, different models learn for the classification task at hand and the outputs of these models are first collected to form a new dataset that contains the prediction probabilities of each model for every instance of data in the original training set. This new dataset is considered as the data for a second learning problem which is solved by using a second learning model called meta-learner. Thus, the original data and the models used in the first step are referred to as \"level-0 data\" and \"level-0 models\" (or sub-models), respectively. Likewise, the cross-validated data and the learning model in the second step are called \"level-1 data\" and \"level-1 generalizer\" (or meta-learner). Finally, we are going to have one stacked multi-headed system which is intended to function dependably for the categorization of unseen CT scans.

ResNet model deals with this issue by bypassing through less essential layers with the assis-tance of residual units during model training using a regular SGD optimizer. In our ensemble network, we have used ResNet50V2 consisting of 50 weight layers with a substantial drop in model size as well as the FLOP count. Our second model is Xception which is an extreme version of its pioneer called Inception [42] . The idea is to deal with each output channel separately by using a mapping of spatial correlations. Further inter-channel correlation is captured by performing 1\u00d71 convolutions. Finally, we use the DenseNet121 CNN model which is densely connected and requires fewer parameters as compared to a traditional CNN. Unlike ResNets, DenseNets have extremely constricted layers and use simply twelve filters along with a very few feature-maps. DenseNet121 can find gradient values directly from the loss function which improves the time required for training. This significantly reduces computation cost and makes this a superior option. As part of fine-tuning, we delete the classifier part of the transfer learning (CNN) models and include our custom prediction layer which consists of a global average pooling layer (GAP) followed by dual fully connected (FC) layers consisting of 256 neurons and a single neuron, respectively. As opposed to a flattening layer, a GAP layer can better address the overfitting problem by lowering the volume of parameters used in the model. In global average pooling, a feature map with dimension h \u00d7 w is converted to a single value by computing the mean of all the pixel values in the feature map and thus obtains 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 d tensor from a 3-D tensor with dimension h \u00d7 w \u00d7 d.",

Hence, we decided to use CT images instead of using CXR or other types of image data. We use a publicly available SARS-CoV-2 CT scan dataset which includes 1252 CT images collected from coronavirus infected patients and 1230 CT scans from individuals that are not infected by the coronavirus. The data is obtained from a hospital in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Overall, the dataset contains 2482 CT images of patients from both categories such as COVID-19 and non-COVID. A 5-fold cross-validation method is used to validate the stacked ensemble model as well as individual sub-models. Hence, we obtain five equal parts of the dataset in the image level that are used in the cross-validation process. The distribution of samples in the dataset for training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) is shown in Table 1 .

All the necessary packages are pre-installed and come with Jupyter notebook environment. After compiling the sub-models into a multi-headed single deep model using Keras functional API, a dense layer with ReLU activation function and with 256 neurons is added to the stacked model. Lastly, prediction results are generated using a dense layer and sigmoid activation function at the end of the model. We apply the commonly used loss function also known as binary cross-entropy for model learning which facilitates faster model convergence. Furthermore, we have used Adam optimizer for model training and validation. Adam is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm particularly designed for training deep neural network models. It can be considered as a combination of RMSProp and SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) with momentum where it leverages the squared gradients to scale the learning rate as done in RMSprop and exploits the benefit of momentum by utilizing the moving average of the gradient. This gives Adam optimizer a performance boost over other learning schedules. We set the initial learning of 0.001 for Adam optimizer. The subsequent decay is calculated by dividing the initial learning rate by the total number of epochs to update the learning rate during the training process. During the model training, the performance is monitored and the model with the best performance is saved based on some validation metrics.

The proposed ensemble technique constantly attains the best performance as compared to the sub-models in terms of accuracy, precision, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). The stacked ensemble network attains accuracy and specificity of 96.58 and 99.16%, respectively. These two performance measurement criteria are very important to assess the effectiveness of any diagnostic method in medical settings. The advantage of combining prediction probabilities from different fine-tuned CNN sub-models in the stacked ensemble framework is evident from this result. The high value of specificity (99.16%) obtained from the model evaluation We also observe the impact of the stacked ensemble model over individual CNN sub-models using class-specific results as shown in Table 4 . It is noticed that the submodels exhibit comparatively poor performance in categorizing non-COVID samples though demonstrate average performance in classifying COVID-19 positive samples. More specifically, the sub-models achieve better recall and accuracy scores in diagnosing infected cases. As expected, the proposed stacked model makes use of the advantage of a mix of several fine-tuned CNN sub-models by maintaining the power of ResNet50V2 to make up for the limitations of Xception and DenseNet121 in enhancing the classification results.

The ability of a model for separating the true positive and negative cases is manifested by a ROC curve where the true positive rate (TPR) is plotted against the false positive rate (FPR). Our stacked ensemble model outperforms other sub-models and achieves a mean AUC (area under the curve) value (as shown in Table 3 ) of 0.966 for both target labels. The individual CNN sub-models exhibit similar classification performance for both COVID and non-COVID classes having somewhat lower AUC scores than the stacked model. It is noticed that the ensemble model produces incredibly few false positive (FP) infected cases as opposed to the individual CNN sub-models. The reduced FP count implies that the number of incorrectly identified infected encounters is less and it improves precision and specificity rates. It is crucial to reduce the FP to avoid unnecessary monetary burdens on healthcare providers. However, the reduced count of FP is obtained with the expense of a relatively increased number of FN which causes a slight decrease in sensitivity obtained by the ensemble model as shown in Table 3 . All the sub-models generate relatively fewer FN cases but with increased FP counts. In practice, keeping the count of FN cases low is important since incorrectly identifying a COVID-19 patient as healthy will severely hinder proper treatment for the patient.

This research serves as one step towards a clearer comprehension of the characteristics of ongoing pandemic and offers a sophisticated deep learningbased solution for effective and rapid identification of COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless, we can positively advocate that our proposed stacked ensemble network is in no way a substitute for a human health practitioner but instead we anticipate that our experimental results provide a useful contribution towards an increasing acceptance of AI-based diagnostic tools in medical settings. Although we cannot merely depend on the diagnosis results found from CT scans to recommend the treatment plan for a patient, initial testing can support clinicians to isolate positive cases till a thorough checkup is completed.",

            "text": "In this study, we propose an IoT-enabled end-to-end integrated stacked deep learning method to precisely detect COVID-19 encounters using CT images. Initially, patient data are obtained using IoT devices and sent to a cloud server using 5G networks. Specifically, we develop a stacked ensemble model that exploits the benefit of a combination of multiple deep CNN models to speed up the assessment of chest CT images in automated screening of COVID-19 patients. We use three different fine-tuned CNN models called ResNet50V2, DenseNet121, and Xception as sub-models which are stacked together using a meta-learner for final categorization of COVID-19 encounters from input CT images. Our proposed stacked model attains an accuracy of 96.58% for the categorization of COVID-19 and non-COVID CT images with a high value of specificity. Besides, the stacked model exhibits a superior AUC (0.966) value in contrast with all other studied CNN sub-models suggesting its strong ability to dis-tinguish between the COVID-19 positive and negative cases. In the future, we plan to use a curated dataset of CT images containing more than two classes to better generalize the model's ability to diagnose potential COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, we intend to obtain better prediction results by utilizing the segmented lung area through state-of-the-art segmentation networks.",
