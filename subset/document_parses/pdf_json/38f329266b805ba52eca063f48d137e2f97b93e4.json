With evolution of the virus updated methods for the evaluation of the 5 immune response in infected and vaccinated individuals are required to determine the durability 6 of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 variants. 7 METHODS: We developed a multiplexed surrogate virus neutralization test (plex-sVNT) that 8 simultaneously measures the ability of antibodies in serum to inhibit binding between 9 angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and 7 SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein variants, 10 including wild type, The assay was validated against a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). 12 We evaluated 170 samples from 97 COVID-19 patients and 281 samples from 188 individuals 13 that received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines. 14 RESULTS: The plex-sVNT demonstrated >96% concordance with PRNT. Antibody 15 neutralization activity was significantly reduced for all SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to wild 16 type in both the infected and vaccinated cohorts. There was a decline in overall antibody 17 neutralization activity, within both cohorts, out to 5 months post infection or vaccination, with 18 the rate of decline being more significant for the vaccinated.",

During the peri-infection period, they found lower neutralizing antibody 300 titers in blood compared with non-infected matched controls (13). They also showed that higher 301 antibody neutralizing capacity was associated with lower viral loads. The plex-sVNT would be 302 an appropriate test should evaluation of a larger population prove to be warranted for research 303 and clinical investigations. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  397   398  Table 1 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58 59 60 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58 59 60",

            "text": "year and a half of the COVID-19 pandemic. The release of highly effective coronavirus 27 vaccines has greatly reduced the rate of severe disease and death in areas where vaccination rates 28 are high. Correlates of immunity in an individual are still not well defined. SARS-CoV-2 29 continues to mutate which raises uncertainty regarding the effectiveness and duration of the 30 immune response following natural infection and vaccination. Gain-of-function viral variants 31 can result in improved replication capacity, viral infectivity, transmissibility, and neutralizing 32 antibody escape. SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs) have been identified and currently 33 include; B.1.1.7 (UK, 201/501Y.V1, Alpha, or \u03b1), B.1.351 (South Africa, 20H/501Y.V2, Beta, 34 or \u03b2), P.1 (Brazil, Gamma, or \u03b3), and B.1.617.2 (India, Delta, or \u03b4). Additional Variants of 35 Interest (VOIs) currently include; B.1.525 (Eta, or \u03b7), B.1.526 (Iota, or \u03b9), B.1.617.1 (India, 36 Kappa, or \u03ba), C.37 (Peru, Lambda, or \u03bb), and B.1.621 (Columbia, Mu, or \u03bc). Other variants such 37 as B.1.429 (California, Cal20, Epsilon, or \u03b5), were once listed as VOCs or VOIs and have since 38 been removed from the list as others have emerged and become more dominant. Emerging data 39 suggests that these VOCs/VOIs are susceptible to neutralization by SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 40 convalescent and vaccinee serum, however, to a lesser degree than wild-type virus (1-4). Most of 41 these studies evaluated one time-point soon after vaccination with one specific vaccine for a 42 limited number of variants, limiting the ability to compare: 1) neutralizing capacity against 43 multiple variants within a specific group (e.g. \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 after infection) 2) neutralizing 44 activity in different groups (e.g. natural infection vs. vaccination), and 3) the rate of decline 45 between time-points (e.g. 1 vs. 5 months after onset of symptoms/first vaccination) for all 46 variants in different groups (e.g. natural infection vs. vaccination). tests (PRNT) measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer and 51 involve the use of live pathogens and target cells (6, 7). These laborious tests require a high 52 degree of expertise and expose laboratory personnel to infection risks, limiting the widespread 53 availability of testing. Surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNTs) based on antibody-mediated 54 blockage of molecular interactions have been described (8-10). An sVNT measures the 55 competitive inhibition of the interaction between a viral structural protein and angiotensin-56 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 on host cells. Like PRNT, sVNTs 57 detect neutralizing antibodies in an isotype-independent manner, offering a key advantage over 58 antibody concentration assays. Here we present a multiplexed sVNT (plex-sVNT) method for the 59 simultaneous evaluation of the ability of antibodies produced after infection or vaccination to 60 inhibit the interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein containing current 61 VOCs.

More specifically it measures the ability of infection-251 or vaccine-induced antibodies to inhibit binding between the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein 12 252 (wild-type and variant) and ACE2, serving as an in-vitro surrogate for in-vivo viral-host 253 invasion. The use of trimeric recombinant spike protein variants offers advantages over isolated 254 protein subunits or domains, such as the receptor binding domain (RBD) since it mimics the 255 natural conformation of the native spike protein. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibit 256 mutations or deletions in the spike structural domain other than the RBD or S1 subunit; 257 therefore, use of the trimeric spike protein has significant advantages for evaluating antibody 258 activity against variants. 259 To date, only one sVNT method has received emergency use authorization from the US 260 FDA (cPASS, GeneScript) for the analysis of neutralizing antibodies to wild-type virus, 261 however, this method is an enzyme-linked immunoassay designed for batch testing in a high 262 complexity laboratory. The plex-sVNT method is a high throughput assay that can measure 263 neutralizing antibodies to wild type and emerging variants in one test simultaneously on an 264 automated analyzer with all results obtained in 52 minutes. The high concordance and correlation 265 with a gold-standard PRNT supports its utility as a viable alternative to time-consuming 266 conventional cell-based assays which are limited in availability, and only capable of testing one 267 variant at a time. The PRNT and plex-sVNT methods were compared using the respective assay 268 cut-offs (titer and % inhibition). A more clinically relevant comparison would use the titer and % 269inhibition that signify viral protection, which are likely higher than the cut-offs, however, these270    are not yet defined. Assay agreement remained high (>93%) between PRNT 50 , at increasing 271 titers from 1:20 to 1:640, compared to plex-sVNT using optimized cutoffs, suggesting that the 272 plex-sVNT would be a viable surrogate to PRNT regardless of the cut-off used. Limitations in 273 sample volume prohibited comparisons between PRNT and plex-sVNT for the variants. As 274 variants continue to emerge, such as the most recent omicron variant, the plex-sVNT described",

Clinical data were extracted from electronic health records and included demographic information, patientreported symptom onset date and indicators of disease severity. Patients were categorized based on their level of care; patients admitted to an intensive care unit at any time were classified as ICU patients, whereas those admitted to a hospital or managed as outpatients were considered non-ICU patients. The criteria for ICU admission at the hospital remained the same throughout the course of the study. No patients received convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibody drugs.
