Patients were divided into mild (n = 12), moderate (n = 31), and severe (n = 8) groups based on clinical severity. An AI-based quantitative CT analysis, including lung volume, opacity score, opacity volume, percentage of opacity, and mean lung density, was performed in initial and follow-up CTs obtained at different time points.

            "text": "C oronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease was first reported as an unknown pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has rapidly evolved into a pandemic. The responsible pathogen was a novel coronavirus, which has been called \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2\". 1, 2 The ideal imaging method to be used in the evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia should be diagnostic. It should also be accurate in terms of quantifying parenchymal findings and objective evaluation of the time course of the disease. 3 Chest computed tomography (CT) has been widely used in diagnosis and follow-up with high sensitivity rates. 4 Computed tomography findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, correlation of CT findings with clinical severity, and temporal changes of the findings were previously reported in detail in the literature. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Initially, Pan et al 6 classified patients according to time from symptom onset and defined 4 consecutive CT stages as follows: earlystage (0-4 days), progressive stage (5-8 days), peak stage (9-13 days), and absorption stage (\u226514 days). The peak involvement was observed around day 10, and radiological improvement began after 14 days. In the early stage, the most common CT finding is unilateral or multifocal ground-glass opacities (GGOs); as the disease progresses, the number and extent of GGOs increase, and mixed patterns of GGOs, consolidations, crazy-paving pattern, and linear opacities appear. In the late stage, opacities gradually resolve, while subpleural fibrotic bands and residual GGOs are seen. 5, 6, 10, 11 While most patients have mild symptoms, approximately 14% and 5% of the patients progress to severe and critical disease, respectively. 12 Different visual and semiquantitative CT scoring systems were used previously to estimate lung involvement, disease severity, and prognosis. [13] [14] [15] However, adequate assessment in the follow-up period may be challenging. The search for rapid and objective evaluation led to the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. Regarding COVID-19 pneumonia, AI was used to detect and differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from communityacquired pneumonia, for quantitative evaluation of CT changes and assessment of disease severity. 7, 9, [16] [17] [18] [19] Shen et al 9 reported a moderate to high correlation between lesion percentage detected by radiologists and the software. Moreover, reduced reader variability was reported in the AI-based approach which is highly critical for the precise evaluation of disease progression. 20 In this study, we aimed to quantitatively assess the initial CT findings and temporal CT changes of COVID-19 pneumonia according to different clinical severity groups. Our secondary purpose was to investigate the performance of quantitative CT parameters in differentiating severe from nonsevere pneumonia.",

Our major findings are, first, quantitative CT parameters vary according to different clinical severity groups and different time points. Second, between stage 1 and stage 4, although total lung volume decreases, opacity score, opacity and high-opacity volume, percentage of opacity and high-opacity, mean lung density increases in all clinical groups. However, the only parameters that reached statistical significance were total lung volume loss, the increase of opacity score and percentage in the severe patient group, and the increase of opacity score in the mild patient group. Quantitative CT parameters (total opacity score, opacity volume, percentage of opacity, high opacity volume, percentage of high opacity, mean lung density) could differentiate severe from nonsevere pneumonia. The severe patient group had significantly more extensive involvement with bilateral and multilobar opacities on baseline CT. All 5 lobes were involved in all severe patients. The number of affected lobes, opacity score, opacity volumes, and opacity percentages were significantly higher in the severe group than that of the moderate group as reported previously in the literature. 9, 15, 23 The severe patient group had a significantly longer interval between symptom onset to baseline CT and a longer hospitalization period. These findings indicate that, although the treatment protocols may have slight differences among different institutions and countries, the hospital admission, diagnosis, and therefore, treatment may be delayed in severe patients. In Huang et al.'s study, the hospitalization period was longer, and the CT severity score was higher for patients if the time between symptom onset to diagnosis is more than 3 days. 24 Similarly, Liu et al 13 reported an association between initial CT severity score and extended hospitalization. Also, individual factors, such as older age, male sex, and comorbidities, were previously associated with disease severity, but age and sex were not significantly different between clinical severity groups in our study. 2, 25 We observed a decrease in total lung volume during the disease course in all patients, but it reached a statistical significance only in the severe patient group. Significantly lower lung volumes in severe COVID-19 pneumonia were reported in some studies. 9, 18, 26 This might be explained by the histopathological findings of diffuse alveolar damage with alveolar edema, exudation, hyaline membranes, inflammatory cell infiltration, and late phase fibrotic process. 27, 28 These changes assumably cause a decrease in functional alveolar capacity. In Iwasawa et al.'s 29 study using ultra high-resolution CT, they reported lower CT lung volumes in severe cases and smaller secondary lobes in crazy-paving pattern comparing to clear lungs suggesting local volume loss. This was explained by alveolar collapse, which is commonly observed in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

Also, 71% of these patients exhibited radiological abnormalities. 31 Santus et al 32 prospectively analyzed respiratory functions and DLCO of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization and 6 weeks after discharge. During the acute phase, a restrictive pattern was observed in approximately 50% of patients with a reduction of vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second and DLCO impairment. These findings were correlated with disease severity and the presence of consolidations on CT.",

Between fibrosis and nonfibrosis groups, no difference was detected in terms of the presence of comorbidities. Patients with older age, severe type disease, and who were mechanically ventilated were more likely to develop fibrosis, and these patients had higher opacity scores, opacity volume, and opacity percentage at discharge CT. Therefore, quantitative CT may give information about the necessity and duration of follow-up imaging. In Yang et al's study, 16% of the patients had lung distortion suggestive of fibrosis on peak CT (median, 20 days), but in 50% of these patients fibrotic-like changes resolved on the last follow-up CTs (median, 56 days). 35 It is still early to conclude whether these fibrotic changes are persistent, individual differences and aforementioned risk factors may play a role in the development and persistency of fibrosis. According to these recent studies, early fibrotic changes on CT may not represent actual fibrosis, be related to the recovery process, and may be partly reversible. 34, 35 The total opacity score, opacity volume, and percentage of opacity were the highest in the severe group in all stages similar to the literature. 9, 18, 26 We found that although the dynamic change of total opacity volume was not significant, the total percentage of opacity and opacity score based on percentages significantly increased in severe patients. As both opacity volume and lung volume vary with the patient's height, weight, disease severity, and time course, the percentage of opacity seems like a more reliable parameter than opacity volume in follow-up period.",

The increasing opacity trend through the first 3 stages was followed by a slight decrease in stage 4. The relatively stable course of nonsevere patients was previously described. 15, 36 However, this was not the case for the mild group in our study. The increase of opacity score was also statistically significant for the mild patient group from stages 1 to 4. This might be explained by the fact that for the mild group 91.7% of the initial CTs were obtained in stage 1. This rate was 74% for moderate and 25% for severe patients. Patients in the mild group had no airspace opacities on the baseline CT. Therefore, the progression of CT parameters may be because of the expected disease course. On the other hand, follow-up CTs of the mild group might have belonged to the patients with clinical deterioration. Follow-up CTwas probably not needed for clinically recovered and discharged mild patients.",

According to Ding et al.'s study, 98.1% of the patients still showed CT abnormalities (mostly GGOs) after 28 days from the symptom onset. 10 These residual opacities may be explained with the histopathological and radiological course of the disease. In a recent study, 3 histologic phases of diffuse alveolar damage (exudative, proliferative, and organizing-fibrotic) were correlated with CT findings. Ground-glass opacity was seen in all phases, either isolated in the exudative phase or in a mixed pattern in other phases. 37 A major mechanism possibly explaining why the clinical course of the disease is unpredictable might be cytokine storm induced ARDS that aggravates lung injury. In a recent study, a significant correlation between CT severity score and serum IL-2R and IL-6 was reported. 38 So, in patients with higher severity scores, there may be intervening or overlapping immunologic mechanisms causing persistent or new opacities.",

Hu et al 8 observed concomitant new lesions with absorbing ones on days 10 to 18. These residual opacities cannot be discriminated by AI-based algorithms, as all GGOs, fibrotic bands, and consolidations account for \"opacity.\" Thus, although AI-based quantitative CT analysis is more objective on follow-up evaluation, the inability in discriminating between acute versus residual changes still mostly requires the impression of a radiologist. Also, in a study radiologists observed GGOs in 69.7% of the patients, whereas AI could not find any opacities. 19 One of the reasons for the higher residual opacity rate in our study might be because of our supervision, as AI results were checked and corrected manually.",

Gouda and Yasin 41 also analyzed these parameters to differentiate mild to moderate cases from severecritical cases using the same AI-based software. The cutoff values were \u2212637.7 HU for mean lung density (sensitivity, 81.8%; specificity, 81.9%), 8.5 for total opacity score (sensitivity, 84.1%; specificity, 81.2%), 23.81% for percentage of opacity (sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 81.2%), and 5.61% for percentage of high opacity (sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 81.2%). The reason for our lower cutoff values may be the lack of critical cases and a relatively lower number of severe cases. Also, there was no mortality among our patients. Lower cutoff values in this study may indicate that multilobar (5 lobes) involvement with lower opacity percentages may also show severity. Our study has several limitations. To begin with, the study design was retrospective and the sample size was small especially in mild and severe groups. The relative scarcity of CT scans obtained on stage 4 in the mild patient group caused inadequate assessment. Residual opacities were present in all groups at the end of the study, thus monitoring the disease resolution completely was not possible.",

In the follow-up period, quantification of CT findings may give useful information to clinicians in monitoring disease progression and demonstrate the lung changes such as lung volume loss in severe pneumonia.
