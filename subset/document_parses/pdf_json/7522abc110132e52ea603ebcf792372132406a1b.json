Several glycans, including sialic acid, histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are reported as RV attachment factors. The glycan binding specificity of different P[3] RV VP8*s were investigated in this study. Human HCR3A and dog P[3] RV VP8*s recognized glycans with terminal sialic acid and hemagglutinated the red blood cells, while bat P[3] VP8* showed neither binding to glycans nor hemagglutination. However, the bat P[3] VP8* mutant of C189Y obtained the ability to hemagglutinate the red blood cells, while human P[3] HCR3A/M2-102 mutants of Y189C lost the ability. Sequence alignment and structural analysis indicated that residue 189 played an important role in the ligand recognition and may contribute to the cross-species transmission. Structural superimposition exhibited that bat P[3] VP8* model was quite different from the simian P[3] Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) P[3] VP8*, indicating that bat P[3] RV was relatively distinct and partially contributed to the no binding to tested glycans. These results promote our understanding of P[3] VP8*/glycans interactions and the potential transmission of bat/ human P[3] RVs, offering more insight into the RV infection and prevalence.",

RV genome contains 11 double stranded RNA fragments, encoding 12 proteins, including 6 structural and 6 nonstructural proteins (Estes 2013) . Based on VP6, RVs can be divided into ten different species by now, including A-H, one tentative species I, and a candidate species J (Banyai et al. 2017) . The RV particle consists of three capsid layers. Two major surface proteins, VP7 and VP4, formed the outer most layer and played an important role in inducing neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity. VP7 and VP4 defined the RV G and P genotypes, respectively (Matthijnssens et al. 2011) . The group A RVs are diverse and has been identified 51 P genotypes so far (https://rega. kuleuven.be/cev/viralmetagenomics/virus-classification/ 7th-RCWG-meeting). VP4 can be cleaved by trypsin into two fragments, VP5* and VP8* (Fiore et al.. 1991) . VP8* located at the distal part of the VP4 spike and was reported to be essential in the glycan recognition and cell attachment (Dormitzer et al. 2002a) .",

Bats, the reservoirs of many viruses, were also identified to harbor the RVs (He et al. 2013) . The genetic analysis of bat RVs indicated the bat-tohuman transmission and reassortment (He et al. 2017; Komoto et al. 2020) . The cross-species transmission of RVs has been reported in several RV genotypes, including P[6], P [3] RVs that were reported in both human and animal infections (Nyaga et al. 2018; Okitsu et al. 2018 He et al. 2013; Sasaki et al. 2016 ). Bat P[3] LZHP2 was identified in an insectivorous bat and shared high nucleotide identity with the unique human strain M2-102 that was suggested to originate from a bat RV as a result of crossspecies transmission and was divergent from other human RV strains (Dong et al. 2016; He et al. 2017) . Human HCR3A was supposed to be of dog origin (Tsugawa and Hoshino 2008) . The molecular mechanism of the prevalence of these P[3] RVs remained elusive. Attachment to the cell receptors is crucial for the virus infection and transmission. The illustration of the interactions between virus and ligand provided the basis for understanding host tropism, host adaptation, and zoonosis. Previous studies have shown that some animal RVs recognize sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates and are neuraminidase sensitive (Ciarlet and Estes 1999; Isa et al. 2006) . Some animal RV VP8*s, including P[1] bovine Nebraska calf diarrhea virus, P[2] simian SA11, P[7] porcine CRW-8 were reported to interact with terminal sialic acids on the cell surface glycans (Ciarlet and Estes 1999) . The simian P[3] Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) VP8* recognized N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and the crystal structure of RRV VP8* in complex with Neu5Ac has also been determined (Dormitzer et al. 2002b) . The glycan binding site located at one corner of the two beta-sheets. CRW-8 P[7] VP8* was found to bind the sialic acid using the same glycan binding site as that of RRV P[3] (Blanchard et al. 2007) .",

These indicated that species barrier probably existed for bat LZHP2 P[3] RVs. Bat LZHP2 P[3] RV could not transmit to humans at present but may infect human sporadically with the C189Y alteration. Analysis of all the reported bat P[3] RV VP8* sequences showed that bat LZHP2 and YSSK5 (He et al. 2017 ) possessed 189C, while other 8 strains contained 189Y (Fig. 8) , implying that some bat P[3] RV strains may have the potential to infect human like the M2-102 strain. Therefore, the consistent surveillance of bat and animal RVs is needed.",
