This study aimed to assess the mental health status of Bangladeshi university students during the lockdown period. Subject and methods Through an online-based questionnaire, information was collected from 509 university students of Bangladesh from June 19, 2020, to June 28, 2020, using convenient sampling. K-means clustering was applied to organize students according to their psychological health score, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also conducted to determine the association among the student's activities and their mental health during the pandemic. In addition, these associations were examined through chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression. Results Students were categorized into four categories where 4.32% had mild, 72.7% had moderate, 12.57% had moderately severe, and 10.41% suffered from severe mental health imbalance. The results showed that having family members affected by the coronavirus, facing insecurity, using social media, and smoking habits increased the mental health imbalances of students; in contrast, being worried about studying, future career, spending more time with family members, and participation in household chores reduced the mental health disturbances of students. On the other hand, the results of the ordinal logistic regression indicated that sleeping time and participation in household chores were preventive factors for students. Conclusion This study reveals that a large proportion of University students of Bangladesh suffered from mental health disturbances during the lockdown period. Implementing mental health plans and providing job security, improved communication approaches toward family members, not flattening illusive news, and preoccupation in household activities may assist to enhance the mental health status of the university students. The authors believe that this study's findings will be helpful to expedite the rate of attaining the sustainable development goal associated with health status in Bangladesh.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) revealed the appearance of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on January 30, 2020, as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) (World Health Organization 2020a). The pandemic has been threatening human welfare globally, including in Bangladesh. COVID-19 was officially introduced in Bangladesh on March 8, 2020 (Banik et al. 2020) , and since then, approximately 68,504 cases of COVID-19 were recorded and inveterate with at least 930 deaths as of June 08, 2020 (Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic impacts not only on substantial strength but also the mental health of the public due to being in quarantine for a long time during this ongoing global concern (Brooks et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020b ). Uncertainty and unpredictability concerning such pandemics ranging from epidemiological features, rapid transmission patterns, novelty, and severity of public health have effects in an extensive range of psychosocial aspects and mental catastrophes such as depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress (Xiao 2020; Zandifar and Badrfam 2020) .",

Similar to many affected countries, the Government of Bangladesh has also declared the closing of all educational institutions, including schools, colleges, and universities since March 18, 2020, to restrict public gathering and encourage staying home (The Daily star 2020). As a result, students' regular lifestyles were disturbed and this long lockdown period psychologically affects people, including through increased media reporting about an invasion of the latest transmissions (Rubin and Wessely 2020) . Evidence from another study showed that people in the quarantine may suffer psychological distress mostly in the form of anxiety, anger, frustration, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress (Brooks et al. 2020) .",

Because there is a certain age limit (30 years) of students to obtain a government job in Bangladesh, this unexpected delay to complete their final degree makes them upset as well as depressed (Lipi 2020) . Additionally, it is difficult to be confined in the home for a young person within the age range 19-28 years, which may lead to cabin fever that refers to the distressing claustrophobic irritability or restlessness experienced when a person, or group, is stuck at an isolated location or in confined quarters for an extended time. Moreover, the students who just started their university journey (first year) have done very few classes and therefore become impatient day by day. Importantly, many students plan to pursue higher education abroad each year, but due to this worldwide emergency, they had to cancel their plans. All these factors will lead to feeling psychological insecurity.",

Though this decision has been taken to ensure the health and safety of the students, the continuous lockdown has led some of them to mental disaster gradually. An online questionnaire-based survey was performed to assess the psychological state of university students of Bangladesh during this lockdown period. A large portion of the students were from urban areas, most of them were males and aged between 18 to 28 (Table 1) . In this study, the student's mental health numbers were categorized into four groups: severe, moderately severe, moderate, and mild.

Students who live in urban areas compared to those who live in rural areas suffer more stress. This situation occurs because of the strong maintenance of this deadly pandemic in urban rather than rural areas. The pandemic situation has produced much skepticism among the students. Students all across the world have suffered because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies have shown that undergraduate students were suffering from mental health stress during the COVID-19 pandemic (Kecojevic et al. 2020) . Pupils were anxious about their ultimate career, and the result recommended broadly that students were extremely concerned about not being able to arrange work because of the limitation of age restrictions of Bangladesh (Table 3) . Students were also troubled about this endless lockdown due to COVID-19 influencing their legitimate education negatively, and eliminating the opportunity of promotion and profession as well (Lipi 2020) . Students using social sites frequently in a day caused higher mental problems compared to those who used sites once or twice a day (Table 3) . Students who were able to sleep well were more likely to subdue the psychological health status concerning sleeping late. There is a general relationship between anxiety and sleep disturbances, which plays an enormous role during this pandemic situation, as people think more about job self-doubt and losing people around them (Akundi 2020) . Students who participated in household chores felt less mental health problems compared to those who did not participate (Table 3 ). The sharing of household duties was also supportive of overcoming the mental health problems of students. A survey was conducted of 1060 parents in different-sex couples, and the results show the portion of people sharing household weight equally since the outset of this pandemic (Ebbert 2020). This result also indicated that more communication with family members had a positive impact on the mental health of students (Table 3 ). The investigation proposed that pandemic situations make connections stronger with family and friends; 60% of personalities had a higher level of caring in pandemic situations than regular times (Liu 2020) . The results showed that students who wake up from sleep several times felt higher mental health problems compared to others (Table 3) . A study suggested that students more often found an increase in bed time hour, sleep latency, and wake-up time between before and during the COVID-19 emergency and a worsening of sleep quality and of insomnia symptoms (Marelli et al. 2020) .",

Students also worried about this continuous lockdown due to COVID-19 impacting their regular studies negatively; reducing the option of improving their career as well (Lipi 2020 ). An early sleeping schedule was also conducive to reduce the psychological health status in respect to sleeping late (p < 0.05).

This research indicates that students undergo mostly physiological culmination, and it is recommended that steps should be taken to accomplish mutually settling the difficulty of students as well as contributing physiological well-being services to the university students of Bangladesh. Most of the students seemed unusually stressed concerning their eventual career and education because there is an age limitation for obtaining a government job.
