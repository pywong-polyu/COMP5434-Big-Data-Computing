Mark, a hypochondriac fully covered by medical insurance, still requested a follow-up colonoscopy examination, which turned out to reveal cancerous polyps in his colon. A polypectomy afterward removed those polyps and saved his life. In contrast, Brian, constrained by his financial status, did not request a colonoscopy.",

The majority of prior literature adopted a snapshot view of trust and typically evaluated trust through questionnaires administered at the end of an experiment. More than two dozen factors have been identified to influence one's (snapshot) trust in automation, including individual factors such as culture and age (McBride, Rogers, & Fisk, 2011; Rau, Li, & Li, 2009) , system factors such as reliability and level of automation (Du, Huang, & Yang, 2020; Parasuraman, Sheridan, & Wickens, 2000; Wickens & Dixon, 2007; Wickens et al., 2009) , and environmental factors such as multi-tasking requirement (Zhang & Yang, 2017) . This snapshot view, however, does not fully acknowledge that trust is a dynamic variable that can change over time ( Figure 1 ). With few exceptions, we have little understanding of how trust strengthens or decays due to moment-to-moment interactions with automation (de Visser et al., 2020; Guo & Yang, 2020; Yang, Guo, & Schemanske, To appear; Yang, Unhelkar, Li, & Shah, 2017) . The limited amount of research on trust adjustment reveals two major findings.",

Based on the three properties, a computational model for predicting the moment-to-moment trust was developed (Guo, Shi, & Yang, 2021; Guo & Yang, 2020; Yang et al., To appear) . The computational model proposes that trust at any time, t, follows a Beta distribution.

Below we discuss three types of decision-making heuristics/biases, namely, hindsight bias, outcome bias, and contrast effect. Hindsight bias, as described by Fischhoff (1975) , is the tendency to adjust the estimates of various likelihoods of possible event outcomes in uncertain situations after the event has occurred and the outcome is known. Hindsight bias is also known as the creeping determinism (Fischhoff, 1975) and knew-it-all-along effect (Wood, 1978) . It has been documented in auditory processing, labor disputes, medical diagnoses, consumer satisfaction, personnel management, sporting events, political strategy, legal proceedings, and nuclear accident analysis (Bernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2012; Hawkins & Hastie, 1990; Roese & Vohs, 2012) .

As the occurrence of each pattern can only be determined posteriorly, participants might not necessarily display each performance pattern. Due to the extremely low number of occurrences for patterns 1 and 6, these two patterns are discarded from data analysis. As a result, a full factorial analysis is inappropriate. Instead, we conduct a series of planned comparisons. For the planned comparisons, we first conduct Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVAs) with both automation reliability and performance pattern as independent variables, and trust propensity as the covariate. Results show that neither automation reliability (i.e., 70%, 80%, 90%) or trust propensity had significant effects nor interaction effects in all the planned comparisons. Therefore, trust propensity (as the covariate) is removed from the analysis and the data are collapsed across the levels of automation reliability. The following analysis is conducted on the collapsed dataset using one sample and paired samples t-tests. Data points outside of three standard deviations of the mean are considered outliers and excluded from the data analysis. Note: Asterisks denote the exclusion of a pattern due to its low number of occurrences. H2a hypothesizes that an automation success would lead to a larger trust increment if the final outcome is good. We compare pattern 2 (wrong initial recognition -correct recommendation -wrong final recognition) versus pattern 3 (wrong initial recognition -correct recommendation -correct final recognition), where the only difference is the final recognition performance. The t-test shows that the difference is not significant (t(1, 67) = \u22121.08, p = .29) (Figure 11(a) ).",

Our finding that the magnitude of trust decrements is larger than that of trust increments (supporting H1b) is in line with previous studies in which the number of automation successes significantly exceeded that of automation failures (Lee & Moray, 1992; Manzey et al., 2012) . In Lee and Moray (1992) With respect to the outcome bias, we find supporting evidence for H2b that an automation failure leads to a larger trust decrement if the final outcome (i.e., the final recognition performance) is undesirable. In line with previous research in medical, gambling and business decisions (Baron & Hershey, 1988; Brownback & Kuhn, 2019; Gino et al., 2009; Sezer et al., 2016) , human operators demonstrate outcome biases in trust adjustments when the automation is wrong: an automation error is forgiven to some extent if the error does not lead to detrimental outcomes. This finding is disconcerting because the final outcome of a task can be due to a combination of 23 factors. The automation influences but do not entirely determine the outcome of the task. This finding should be explored further in follow-up experiments with more cognitively demanding tasks, such as medical decision-making, as the experimental task used in the present study is fairly simple.",

This non-significant result could have been due to the self-serving bias (Duval & Silvia, 2002; Miller & Ross, 1975; Weiner, 1985) . The self-serving bias is any cognitive or perceptual process that is distorted by the need to maintain and enhance self-esteem. It is particularly evident when individuals attribute the cause of outcomes. When explaining positive outcomes, their attributions emphasize the causal impact of internal, dispositional causes, but when identifying the causes of negative events, they stress external, situational factors. If we take a close look at the comparisons between pattern 2 (wrong initial recognition -correct recommendation -wrong final recognition) and pattern 3 (wrong initial recognitioncorrect recommendation -correct final recognition), the contrast between the two patterns suggest that the final correct outcome in Pattern 3 is largely due to the correct automation recommendation, and the final wrong outcome in Pattern 2 is largely due to the human operators' wrong initial recognition. According to the self-serving bias, the human operator would likely distort the trust adjustment process to maintain self-esteem, by appreciating the correct recommendation less than they should have done in Pattern 3.",

The experimental paradigm used in the present study allows direct assessment of human operators' ability (i.e., manual performance without the help of automation aids). Instead of assessing the participants' ability directly, prior literature often evaluated participants' self-confidence in performing a task manually and considered operators' self-confidence and their trust in automation two independent constructs (i.e., Two constructs have no association). For example, de Vries, Midden, and Bouwhuis (2003) and Lee and Moray (1994) found that trust and self-confidence predict participants' automation dependence behaviorshuman operators use automation when trust exceeds self-confidence and use manual control when self-confidence exceeds trust. Our findings reveal that human operators' ability and their trust adjustment are not independent of each other. Because of the strong association between self-confidence and ability (Wixted & Wells, 2017) , people's self-confidence and trust are probably not independent either, and therefore should not be viewed as independent constructs.",
