            "text": "Recent studies have indicated that facial electromyogram (fEMG)-based facial-expression recognition (FER) systems are promising alternatives to the conventional camera-based FER systems for virtual reality (VR) environments because they are economical, do not depend on the ambient lighting, and can be readily incorporated into existing VR headsets. In our previous study, we applied a Riemannian manifold-based feature extraction approach to fEMG signals recorded around the eyes and demonstrated that 11 facial expressions could be classified with a high accuracy of 85.01%, with only a single training session. However, the performance of the conventional fEMG-based FER system was not high enough to be applied in practical scenarios. In this study, we developed a new method for improving the FER performance by employing linear discriminant analysis (LDA) adaptation with labeled datasets of other users. Our results indicated that the mean classification accuracy could be increased to 89.40% by using the LDA adaptation method (p < .001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Additionally, we demonstrated the potential of a user-independent FER system that could classify 11 facial expressions with a classification accuracy of 82.02% without any training sessions. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study in which the LDA adaptation approach was employed in a cross-subject manner. It is expected that the proposed LDA adaptation approach would be used as an important method to increase the usability of fEMG-based FER systems for social VR applications.",

Emotion/facial expression can be useful not only for entertainment but also for the collaboration in a virtual meeting space or for any other application where displaying facial-expression is relevant.

To overcome this issue, researchers have attempted to incorporate additional cameras into the VR-HMD (Burgos-Artizzu et al. 2015; Thies et al. 2016; Olszewski et al. 2016) . For example, Hickson et al. installed ultrathin strain gauges on the VR-HMD pad to detect the facial movements around the eyes (Hickson et al. 2015) . However, these approaches made the VR HMD system bulky and increased the production cost (Hickson et al. 2015) .",

An fEMG indicates the electrical activity generated by facial muscle movements, which can be easily recorded using electrodes attached to the face. The fEMG-based FER is a promising alternative to the optical camera-based FER because these systems can be readily implemented using the conventional VR-HMD devices, by simply replacing the existing HMD pad with a new pad containing fEMG electrodes (Fatoorechi et al. 2017; Mavridou et al. 2017) . For example, Faceteq\u2122 developed a wearable pad 7 with electrodes embedded which is also compatible with commercial HMDs. Additionally, the fEMG-based FER system could be fabricated at a lower cost than the optical camera-based FER system because analog front-end (e.g., ADS1298), which is widely utilized for biosignal acquisition, does not cost as much as the image sensor (e.g., HM01B).",

It is to be noted that electrode locations reported in these studies were not determined considering VR applications; therefore, electrode locations varied from study to study. The highest classification accuracy reported thus far is 99.83%; in that study, 11 facial expressions were classified by attaching fEMG electrodes to the forehead and both sides of the face (Hamedi et al. 2018 ). However, this system required users to make facial expression four times for the registration, which does not seem to be practical enough to be used in real VR environments considering that the current FER systems require the users to repeat the registration process whenever they use the system. To address this issue, we suggested a new fEMG-based FER system in which only a single trial for each facial expression was necessary to build the classification model (Cha et al. 2020) . We also implemented a real-time FER system with a processing time less than 0.05 s and succeeded in reflecting user's current facial expressions onto a virtual avatar's face in real time.",

Next, three male adults were asked to freely move their facial muscles with the plastic film attached on their faces. From this preliminary experiment, it was found that electrodes above specific facial muscles such as the temporalis and corrugator frequently detached from the skin, which are marked with nine red circles in Fig. 1a .

The recording system included two additional electrodes-common mode sense (CMS) and driven right leg (DRL)-which were used as reference and ground channels, respectively. We attached the CMS and DRL electrodes to the left and right mastoids, respectively. Before the main experiment, a short training period was provided for the participants to become accustomed to mimicking the 11 emotional faces shown in Fig. 2 . The selected emotional-face pictures were presented on a computer monitor using E-prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA, USA). During the experiment, each participant mimicked the 11 emotional faces presented on the monitor repeatedly 20 times. Note that we repeated 20 times based on the maximum repetitions reported in the previous studies (see Table 1 ). The overall experimental procedure for a single trial is presented in the bottom panel of Fig. 2 . First, a reference emotional picture for the participant to mimic (e.g., happy face) was presented on the monitor. The participant pressed the space bar when he/she was ready to move to the next step. After the space bar was pressed, a short \"beep\" sound was generated, and the participant mimicked the emotional-face picture for 3 s. After the 3 s, the participant made a neutral facial expression and waited for the next trial. The 11 emotional-face pictures were randomly presented, to reduce the possibility of an order effect. This procedure would be needed to be done for every user to generate a user-customized classifier model in the application of the proposed FER system to practical VR applications. It is to be noted that only a single training trial per each facial expression is needed for the generation of the usercustomized classifier model in our study. Each participant completed a total of 220 trials (11 facial expressions \u00d7 20 repetitions). The corresponding dataset (.bdf format) is available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 6084/ m9. figsh are. 96854 78. v1. It is expected that this dataset can be utilized to develop new algorithms to enhance the overall performance of the fEMG-based FER system in a VR-HMD environment.",

The multifunction prosthesis which provides multiple control options allows patients to manipulate prosthesis in more flexible manner. To enable the multiple options, various pattern recognition techniques have been developed in many literatures. As for other myoelectric interfaces, the data-analysis procedure of the fEMG-based FER system includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification (Hakonen et al. 2015) . In this section, we introduce the three data-analysis procedures and then describe the concept of LDA adaptation with labeled datasets of other users in a detailed manner. Figure 3 shows stages of the fEMG signal preprocessing. The fEMG signals recorded from eight electrodes were notch-filtered at 60 Hz and bandpass-filtered at 20-450 Hz using a fourth-order Butterworth filter. The filtered fEMG signals were split into a series of short segments using a sliding window. The sliding window is one of the digital signal processing techniques; once a virtual window is set with its size, the window is sled with a fixed size until the window reached the end of a signal. In this study, we simply truncated the signal before and after of the window at each window. We set the sliding-window length to 300 ms and moved the sliding window from 0 ms to the end of the signal with a fixed time interval of 50 ms. According to the average fEMG onset time of 1.02 \u00b1 0.34 s after the presentation of the beep sound (Cha et al. 2020) , the first 1 s of the fEMG signals was excluded from the analysis; only the last 2 s of the fEMG signals was used.",

The space of a symmetric and positive-definite (SPD) matrix becomes a Riemannian manifold (F\u00f6rstner and Moonen 2003; Wang et al. 2012; Morerio and Murino 2017) ; therefore, an SPD matrix can be considered as a point on a Riemannian manifold. This property allows a covariance matrix to be used in the Riemannian manifold, because the covariance matrix has the properties of the SPD matrix. Unfortunately, in the Riemannian manifold, mathematical operations defined in the Euclidean space cannot be employed. To deal with the SPD matrix in the Euclidean manner, Arsigny et al. (Arsigny et al. 2007 ) proposed a logarithmic map defined as where logm(\u22c5 ) represents the logarithm of a matrix and C represents an SPD matrix. This equation allows C on a Riemannian manifold to be mapped to S on a tangent space generated by a reference point C r . A tangent space on a Riemannian manifold is locally isometric to a Euclidean space. Barachant et al. (Barachant et al. 2010 employed this approach and utilized the upper triangular elements of S as features in an electroencephalography-based brain-computer interface.",

The LDA model can be statistically derived by assuming that the data within each class follow a multivariate normal distribution (Morrison 1969) . Let the fEMG feature vector and a facial-expression class label be x and k , respectively; then, the feature vector x can be predicted as follows: where \u0177 represents the predicted label and k (x) represents the decision function.

We measured the Riemannian distances. Specifically, we first computed the geometric mean of a user's training dataset ( C tr r ) and the geometric mean for another participant p ( C p r ). Next, we computed all the distances in the Riemannian manifold between C tr r and C p r and selected n participants in the ascending order of the Riemannian distances.

The three largest accuracy increments between the baseline and optimal LDA adaptation conditions were observed for participants No. 36, 2, and 9; the increments were 14.88 pp \u00b1 10.15 pp, 14.67 pp \u00b1 5.60 pp, and 11.99 pp \u00b1 6.46 pp, respectively. Figure 7 presents the recall, precision, and F1 score (percentage) for each expression, relative to the baseline and optimal LDA adaptation conditions. The F1 score was computed using the harmonic mean of the recall and precision. The facial expressions on the three bar graphs were arranged in the order of decreasing accuracy relative to the optimal LDA adaptation. The recall, precision, and F1-score values were increased for all the facial expressions when the optimal LDA adaptation was utilized, except for the recall for happiness. The recall for the happiness expression was slightly reduced (by 0.75 pp) from 96.01% but still remained high (95.26%). The three facial expressions with the largest increases in the F1 score were fear, kiss, and anger, with increments of 7.58 pp, 6.67 pp, and 6.19 pp, respectively. Figure 8 presents the confusion matrices of the classification results for the baseline and optimal LDA adaptation conditions. The diagonals of the confusion matrices indicate the recalls. The facial-expression labels in the two confusion matrices were arranged in the order of decreasing recall for the facial expressions of the baseline. The average decrease for all the confusions was 0.41 pp. The top five largest decreases in the confusion were observed when (1) fear was misclassified as surprise, (2) surprise was misclassified as fear, (3) anger was misclassified as a frown, (4) sadness was misclassified as anger, and (5) clenching was misclassified as fear. The decreases in these five cases were 3.42 pp, 3.37 pp, 3.23 pp, 2.95 pp, and 2.94 pp, respectively. Although the average confusions were reduced, confusions for angry and surprise were increased for some participants (participant 8 and 38), leading to the deterioration of overall FER performance of those participants. Introduction of an improved technique to further elevate the FER performance after the LDA adaptation might be necessary in future studies. Figure 9 shows a snapshot of the online experiment taken when a participant was making a happy facial expression. It can be seen that a virtual avatar is mimicking the facial expression of the participant. Note that the electrodes for acquiring the fEMG signals were directly attached to the commercial HMD pad in this online demonstration.

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 4 , classification accuracy was increased as the number of participants included in DB was increased. This might be explained as follows: the original LDA model, which was overfitted owing to the limited training dataset (only a single training dataset), became more generalized via the LDA adaptation with large datasets from other users. Fig. 7 Recall, precision, and F1 score for each facial expression. The F1 score was the harmonic mean of the recall and precision. The facial expressions on the three bar graphs were arranged in the order of decreasing accuracy for the optimal LDA adaptation condition However, increasing patterns of classification accuracy differed among the four LDA adaptation strategies. The reason why the classification accuracy increased more rapidly when selecting the data in terms of the Riemannian distance (riDB) might be that the data with similar distributions with the user's training dataset were chosen first. Therefore, this strategy would be useful when DB is not sufficiently collected. On the other hand, the reason why the classification accuracies when a full DB was used were different depending on the selection of the reference covariances ( C tr r and C DB r ) might be explained by the generalization of LDA parameters. When features were extracted from the user's domain ( C tr r ), features that had similar distribution with the user's features could be extracted. This might lead to overfitting of LDA parameters, and thus the classification accuracy would not be increased much. Based on this result, selection of C DB r as the reference covariance is highly recommended to improve the overall FER performance.",

Thus, the development of a user-independent practical FER system is an important goal (Matsubara and Morimoto 2013; Khushaba 2014; Xiong et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2017) . In this study, our FER system became user independent under a specific condition, i.e., when the rnDB-C DB r approach was employed with = = 1 . To confirm the feasibility of the user-independent system, we computed the classification accuracy in this condition. The results are presented in Fig. 10 . Interestingly, the classification accuracy increased with the number of participants. The highest accuracy (82.88%) was achieved when all 41 participants' data were employed for the training. Although this accuracy was lower than that of the baseline system (85.04%) trained with the user's own dataset, the result is promising in that no training dataset from the user was required. The high accuracy is explained as follows: the geometric mean of the large DB yielded a large tangent space, which was helpful for making the feature distributions of the specific user and the other users similar. In the future study, we plan to develop an online user-independent FER system with a better performance, which is expected to increase the practicality of the FER system in many VR applications as the VR users can use the FER function without a need for a cumbersome registration session.",

The biggest drawback of the avatars in current social VR services is that they fail to convey users' emotional expressions. This greatly reduces VR users' level of immersion and acts as an obstacle to natural communication between users. The proposed method that can maximize FER performance with only a single training dataset can greatly contribute to building a huge metaverse world of the future. (2) The datasets available from this study can contribute to meaningful research exchanges with interested researchers on how to analyze data in VR environments. Unlike the data available in general environments, the data analyzed in this study are based on VR environments. It can be of great value to several researchers and companies interested in analyzing biosignal data in VR environments. (3) This study can contribute to the expansion of VR convergence research by increasing interest in applying biosignal analysis in VR environments. Recent advances in VR-based digital healthcare (Buettner et al. 2020 ) have made it increasingly important to monitor biosignals in VR environments.

            "text": "In this study, we succeeded in improving the performance of fEMG-based FER by using LDA adaptation in the Riemannian manifold without any additional training dataset of the user. However, for the system to be used in realistic scenarios, its limitations must be considered. First, the test/retest reliability should be tested to determine whether the LDA adaptation method is still feasible in cross-session environments. It is well known that the user's data domain can be affected by several factors, e.g., electrode shifts, humidity changes, and impedance changes (Young et al. 2012; Muceli et al. 2014; Li et al. 2016; Vidovic et al. 2016) . Second, new domain adaption technique based on deep learning should be researched. One sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the EMG features rejected the hypothesis that the features are not normally distributed, which is opposite to the assumption of the LDA that data are normally distributed. This indicated that the LDA might not be the best option for our system. It will be interesting to develop new deep learningbased domain adaption technique which is applied well with the EMG data. Third, our method must be validated using a dataset collected from a dry electrode-based EMG recording system. The portable biosignal acquisition system is generally susceptible to external noise and artifacts. Thus, an additional signal-processing method for denoising would be helpful for the development of a robust fEMG-based FER system. Fourth, our adaptation method resulted in better Fig. 10 Classification accuracy as a function of the number of participants included in DB for the baseline and user-independent conditions (rnDB-C DB r ). The highest accuracy for the user-independent condition is marked in red performance when the stimuli were static pictures of facial expressions, but it has not yet been tested in more realistic settings (e.g., presentation of video stimuli or natural interaction with others). Further investigation needs to be conducted under more realistic environments so that the proposed method can be utilized in practical VR applications. Fifth, the current electrode systems need to be further developed. Further studies are needed to enhance the attachability to the curved facial surface, increase robustness against temperature changes or sweats of the skin, and improve the recorded signal quality. Recently, ultra-thin, flexible, and breathable electrodes are actively developed as the substitute of the current rigid electrodes (Fan et al. 2020) , which is expected to be incorporated with the VR-HMD system in the near future. Lastly, directly capturing facial motions in a regression manner rather than a classification manner could be effective for developing a practical FER system. The pattern-classification method does not provide a solution to deal with unregistered facial expressions, which were not present in the training dataset. Thus, a regression-based FER approach should be investigated, which is an interesting research topic.",
