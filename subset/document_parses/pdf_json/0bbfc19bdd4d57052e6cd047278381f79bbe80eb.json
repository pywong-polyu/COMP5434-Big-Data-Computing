We aimed to create a diet quality index based on a scoring system for ages 12 to 23.9 months, the Toddler Diet Quality Index (DQI), and evaluate its construct validity using 24 h dietary recall data collected from a national sample of children from the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) 2016. The mean (standard error) Toddler DQI was 49 (0.6) out of 100 possible points, indicating room for improvement. Toddlers under-consumed seafood, greens and beans, and plant proteins and over-consumed refined grains and added sugars. Toddler DQI scores were higher among children who were ever breastfed, lived in households with higher incomes, and who were Hispanic. The Toddler DQI performed as expected and offers a measurement tool to assess the dietary quality of young children in accordance with federal nutrition guidelines. This is important for providing guidance that can be used to inform public health nutrition policies, programs, and practices to improve diets of young children.",

In the short term, proper nutrition influences optimal physical and cognitive growth and development. Over the long term, nutrition is important for reducing risk of diet-related chronic diseases and obesity [1, 2] . Food preferences and dietary patterns are established during infancy and early childhood, setting the stage for healthy (or unhealthy) eating habits later in life [3, 4] . For example, eating more fruits and vegetables during infancy is associated with higher fruit and vegetable preference and consumption at age 6 years [5] . However, unhealthy dietary behaviors during early childhood, such as sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption, can lead to increased consumption during later childhood and increased risk for obesity that continues into adulthood [6, 7] . Therefore, unhealthy or sub-optimal dietary patterns should be identified and addressed in early childhood to mitigate the risk of both current and future health concerns and to promote healthy eating habits early in life.",

However, until recently, the DGAs did not include recommendations for children under 2 years of age. In December 2020, the 2020-2025 DGAs were released and included guidance for healthy dietary patterns by life stage, including for children under the age of 2 years [9] . Diet quality assessments can evaluate how closely aligned eating patterns are with dietary recommendations. A commonly used tool to evaluate the degree to which a person's diet aligns with the DGAs is called the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) [10] . The most recent HEI, the HEI-2015, is a valid and reliable metric used to assess how well a set of foods and beverages align with the 2015-2020 DGAs [11, 12] . The HEI-2015 has been used for children ages 2-18 years, but a metric to assess diet quality similar to the HEI does not exist for infants and toddlers [13] .",

Some studies use indices originally designed to assess diet quality in older populations and may not appropriately evaluate the diets of young children [15] . Other studies use a diet diversity score as a measure of diet quality [16] . However, these indices are generally used to estimate risk for nutrient deficiencies. They also rely on a limited selection of components and use arbitrary cutoffs [17] . Evaluating the diet as a whole is important because often more of one food or beverage means less of another and the overall combination informs the comprehensive nutritional status of the child. Other studies create their own definitions for \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" dietary patterns to assess diet quality. Hamner and Moore assessed the diet quality of children aged 6 months to 4 years using a modified Diet Quality Index Score [18] . However, without specific dietary guidelines to base scoring on, the index had a limited set of components with wide scoring ranges.",

The remaining assess dietary components to limit: (10) refined grains; (11) sodium; (12) added sugars; and (13) saturated fat. Higher scores reflect better diet quality as moderation components are reverse scored. Each component is scored on a density basis, either as a percentage of calories or per 1000 calories. Summed scores of the 13 components yield a maximum score of 100, with a higher score reflecting greater compliance with the DGAs.",

In creating our index, we focused on toddlers ages 12 through 23 months. We excluded infants ages 6 to 11.9 months because they are just learning to eat complementary (table) foods and the variety and amounts consumed change substantially as the quantities and types are influenced by their consumption of breast milk and/or formula. Additionally, estimated average requirements have not been determined for most nutrients for children ages 6 to 11.9 months, whereas standards for nutrient adequacy exist for most nutrients for children ages 12 months and older [21] . Furthermore, as in the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern for Toddlers, our index does not include children consuming human milk or infant formula. After 12 months infant formula is no longer recommended, and according to the most recent CDC Breastfeeding Report Card, most infants in the U.S. are no longer receiving breast milk (65%) [22] . Additionally, it is difficult to quantify the amount of breast milk consumed in this age group using common dietary assessment methods used in survey research, so survey methods rely on estimates [23, 24] . Moreover, breast milk is highly variable in terms of its nutritional composition and the composition changes across time, with the concentrations of some nutrients varying based on maternal diet and the infant's age [25] .",

Given the similarities in food patterns and the fact that dietary intake tracks across life stages, we leveraged the extensive work done to develop the HEI and used the HEI-2015 as a model for creating a diet quality index for toddlers ages 12 to 23.9 months (Table 1) . However, as noted by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advisory Committee, toddlers have unique dietary needs for this rapid period of growth. Thus, to develop a scientifically accurate index that encouraged optimal health in this age group, we worked from the HEI-2015 model and informed our grading with empirical evidence from the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advisory Committee and dietary recommendations issued by other expert bodies noted earlier, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and National Academy of Medicine Dietary Reference Intake Reports.

This report followed a policy statement from the Academy of Pediatrics in 2014 in which they note fruit juice offers no nutritional advantage over whole fruit as it has less fiber and can be consumed quicker, where, like sugar-sweetened beverages, it can contribute to an energy imbalance [27] . Consuming juice early in life may influence consumption of not only juice, but sugar-sweetened beverages later in life [28] .

For children this age, nutrient needs are high; but the amount toddlers can consume is low leaving little room for calories that contribute mostly energy rather than the nutrients necessary for optimal growth and development.

However, unlike the HEI, which is meant for a range of ages and populations, not all components of the Toddler DQI are density based (e.g., per 1000 calories). The dietary recommendations for toddlers at the 800-1000 calorie level include consuming 2.0 ounce equivalents (oz-eq) per day of both whole grains and total protein and 2.0 oz-eq per week of seafood. This reflects the need for adequate intake of nutrient-rich foods. Additionally, as mentioned above, this is when eating habits and food preferences form, impacting diet-related outcomes across the life course. Thus, exposing children to a variety of foods, including seafood, is important during this life stage. Therefore, toddlers receive the maximum scores for the protein foods, whole grains, and seafood index components if they consume 2.0 oz-eq per day of protein foods, 2 oz-eq per day of whole grains, and 2.0 oz-eq per week of seafood. Except for sodium and 100% fruit juice, all other components rely on densities (amount per 1000 kcals), with scores assigned to each component by comparing the density to the relevant standards.

Eating fewer vegetables and fruit during infancy sets children up to eat less of these when they are older [5] . In addition, according to data from What We Eat in America, NHANES 2007-2016, approximately 90% of toddlers are falling short of recommended daily intakes for vegetables and approximately 40% of toddlers do not meet recommended intakes for fruit, with most coming from 100% fruit juice [9] .",

            "text": "The FITS 2016 was a nationally distributed, cross-sectional survey. The details for sampling selection and procedures are described elsewhere [30] . Following administration of a household survey by trained interviewers, dietary intake data were collected over the telephone from parents or caregivers of young children. Respondents were mailed materials to assist them with accurate reporting of portion sizes for their 24 h dietary recall. These included a ruler, a measuring cup, and a Food Measurement Aids booklet. All materials were in both English and Spanish. Respondents were asked to measure cups used by the child to drink beverages (e.g., sippy cups) per the provided instructions before the recall. The 24 h recalls were completed by telephone by trained and certified dietary interviewers from the Nutrition Coordinating Center (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN) using the Nutrient Data System for Research (NDSR) 2015. A second 24 h recall was conducted on 25% of the respondents who completed a first 24 h recall, at least one week later. Respondents for the second 24 h recall were selected at random during the recruitment phase. Informed consent was obtained from all participants involved in the study.2.5. Statistical Methods For the analyses reported in this paper, the analytic sample was limited to those aged 12 to 23.9 months who did not consume any breast milk or formula (n = 882). We aimed to describe average total and component scores and compare average scores by group. Thus, for those with two days of dietary intake data, only the first day of intake was used for analyses. Sampling weights were calculated to account for the probability of household selection and then adjusted for nonresponse and incomplete coverage to be nationally reflective of the U.S. population aged birth to 47.9 months. Toddler sociodemographic characteristics are summarized as frequencies (%) for categorical variables and means and standard errors (SE) for continuous variables. Toddler DQI scores were calculated using NDSR output. Each component was estimated using methods outlined by the Nutrition Coordinating Center for the HEI-2015 using 1 recall day for each participant (http://www. ncc.umn.edu/healthy-eating-index-hei/, accessed 17 December 2020). Total Toddler DQI and Toddler DQI component scores are summarized as means and SE. The percent of maximum score achieved [(mean score/maximum score) \u00d7 100%], is also presented since maximum scores differed for various components and ranged from 2.5 to 10. Covariates included sociodemographic variables thought to influence diet quality, including child race and ethnicity; first born; WIC eligibility status, as either self-reported or calculated based on income and household size; an indicator for a parent or caregiver reporting no other adults living in their household; a continuous measure of federal poverty level index (FPL); and urban/rural location of the child's household. FPL index is defined as a percentage at which the household income is compared to the poverty line, meaning 100% would mean that a given household is at the exact federal poverty line and anything over would be above poverty. Non-Hispanic other race children estimates are not presented due to insufficient sample sizes in the data, although they were included in the analysis. Wald F-tests were conducted to determine statistical significance within each covariate for overall Toddler DQI and each food component. If the overall test was statistically significant at the 0.05 level, pairwise t-tests of the least square means were conducted. Analyses are presented as adjusted for ever breastfed, WIC participation status, race and ethnicity, federal poverty level, households with one adult, and living in urban settings. Multivariate regression was conducted for each Toddler DQI component. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS (version 9, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SAS-callable SUDAAN \u00ae (version 11, RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) software.",

Eating in alignment with the DGAs is most often assessed using the HEI [31] , a validated measure of diet quality. However, the existing HEI was designed for ages 2 and over and is not appropriate for children younger than 2 years old. Therefore, we developed a new diet quality index for those 12 to 23.9 months of age who are no longer consuming breast milk or infant formula. This new index, called the Toddler DQI, was modeled after the most recent version of the HEI, the HEI-2015 using recommendations from the 2020-2025 DGAs and other expert bodies. Using data from the FITS 2016 survey, preliminary construct testing was carried out to see if this new index functions as expected. Using a national sample of toddlers, our results show the diet quality of toddlers aged 12 to 23.9 months is poor; with a score of 49 out of 100, indicating that there is vast room for improvement. Toddlers consumed too little seafood, greens and beans, and plant proteins and too many refined grains and added sugars. Our results found that Toddler DQI scores were higher among children who were ever breastfed, lived in households with higher incomes, and who were Hispanic.",

Hamner and Moore modified the Diet Quality Index Score (DQIS) and used NHANES data to assess diet quality in children 6 months to 4 years of age [18] . Although standards were based on alternative sources of information, such as the Child and Adult Care Food Program, some aspects of the DQIS are similar to the Toddler DQI, such as allotting maximum points for zero consumption of added sugars and consuming <4.0 oz/day of 100% fruit juice. However, the Toddler DQI allots maximum points for \u22652.0 oz-eq of whole grains, something known to be lacking in the diets of children, where the DQIS allots minimum points to children who have 0 or >2.0 oz-eq/day. Nevertheless, it is valuable to compare scores from each index to get an idea of how children in the U.S. are eating. Using the DQIS, 1 year olds scored 53% of maximum points, which is only marginally higher than our average score of 49% of maximum points.",

However, as noted in the 2015-2020 DGAs, the HEI-2015 is not designed for children under 2 years of age [8] . Compared to the Toddler DQI, the HEI-2015 allows for added sugar, more refined grains and less whole grains for maximum scoring for these index components. Given the high nutrient needs and small stomach capacity of young children, the standards in the HEI-2015 are not meant to be extrapolated to infants and toddlers, who require specific portion sizes appropriate for their age and development [32] . In fact, a large emphasis of the 2020-2025 DGAs includes shifting from the notion that \"food under one is just for fun\" to \"every bite counts\", highlighting that young children have very little, if any, discretionary calorie allotments that enable consumption of added sugars and other nutrients and food groups in excess of recommended intake the way older children and adults do [9] . Further, the maximum and minimum scoring standards for the HEI-2015 encompass a range of calories from 1200 to 2400 kcal, a range vastly different from the 800-1000 kcal most toddlers consume on a daily basis [12] . Thus, it is not surprising that the HEI-2015 score among this age group in the Au et al. study was significantly higher than the Toddler DQI in the present study.",

            "text": "Prior studies have shown that diet quality is often better among children receiving WIC benefits compared to children of similar economic status not receiving WIC [33] [34] [35] [36] . This may explain higher diet quality scores in Au et al., since the sample included children from the WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study 2 (WIC ITFPS-2), where 86% of 13 month olds and 69% of 24 month olds were still enrolled in WIC at the time of data collection. This is compared to the 35% enrolled in WIC in our sample. A study by Weinfield et al. also included children from the WIC ITFPS-2 but included only those with long-term follow up through 24 months of life [37] . In that study, 82% had continued participation in WIC through most of the first 2 years of life. The mean adjusted HEI-2015 was 60.4 and those who were in WIC longer had higher HEI scores. However, in our study, toddlers who were receiving WIC benefits had lower diet quality compared to their non-WIC counterparts. A study by Guthrie et al. using FITS 2016 data demonstrated poorer dietary habits among 12 to 23.9 month olds receiving WIC, including consuming more SSBs and fruit juice and less fruit compared to their non-WIC counterparts [38] . As mentioned above, the Toddler DQI does not allow for energy dense, nutrient-poor foods, per the 2020-2025 DGAs, and applies greater weight to fruits and vegetables compared to the HEI-2015. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the maximum monthly allowance WIC participants could receive for fruits and vegetables was $11 in cash value vouchers and up to 144 fl oz in juice [39] . Therefore, it is not surprising that WIC participants in our study had significantly lower scores for whole fruit, total vegetables and 100% fruit juice. As stated in a 2017 report by the National Academy of Sciences, the WIC food packages can be updated to better align with the DGAs; they specifically suggest increasing the dollar amount of the fruit and vegetable cash value voucher and reducing the amounts of juice in all food packages to improve the balance of food groups in alignment with the 2015-2020 DGAs [40] . Thus, although the WIC food packages provide nutrient-rich foods to supplement the diets of young children, it may not be enough to have significant impacts on toddler diet quality.",

In the 2017 National Academy of Sciences report, the committee recommended adding seafood to the WIC food packages given evidence of limited consumption. Few children in the FITS 2016 data set ate seafood, as demonstrated by the extremely low scores (8% of the maximum score). Thus, the emphasis on seafood in the 2020-2025 DGAs and potential inclusion in the WIC food package could benefit diet quality, but strategies to encourage acceptance may be needed. Fatty fish, such as salmon and tuna, are among the few foods that contain high enough levels of essential fatty acids in a portion size appropriate for very young children, but they are not often offered due to concerns about food allergies or mercury content [42] . Before we recommend increased intake of seafood, it is important to address concerns and clarify the benefits that consuming seafood can have on children's physical and brain development.",

Other studies demonstrate differences in diet based on origin of race or ethnicity in young children. Hamner et al. found differences as early as 6 months old [43] . Among non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic white 1 year olds, they found that more non-Hispanic Black children had 100% fruit juice, while fewer non-Hispanic white children had SSBs compared to their counterparts from other races and ethnicities. Fewer Hispanic 1 year olds had grains and snacks, which aligns with our results of Hispanic toddlers having less refined grains and sodium, often found in snacks, compared to non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic white children. Davis et al. found differences in sodium levels, with Mexican Americans consuming less than non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic white 0 to 24 month olds [44] . Traditional Hispanic diets often include an emphasis on vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, thus offering a potential explanation for the higher diet quality scores found among Hispanic toddlers [45, 46] . This presents an opportunity to offer targeted interventions promoting the use of legumes and beans that are often found in traditional Hispanic and Latino dishes, to increase diet quality.",

            "text": "Our study had a few limitations. We used data from a single 24 h recall; describing diet quality on a given day does not necessarily capture usual intake of a child. Toddler dietary intake was reported by the parent or caregiver, which could lead to over-or underestimation of overall intake. To avoid incomplete dietary recalls, FITS uses a form sent to childcare providers to collect information about foods fed by other adults. We excluded children receiving breast milk or formula given the inability of the Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advisory Committee to provide a recommended food pattern due to uncertainty about the associated nutrient intakes. However, in sensitivity analyses including children receiving breast milk one time per day, results were not significantly different. Although we adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics known to influence feeding behaviors, there is the possibility of residual confounding due to measurement error or selection of covariate categories. It is important to note that racial and ethnic categories are social constructs rather than biological designations and differences in intakes and feeding practices according to race, ethnicity, and income are correlated and impossible to fully disentangle. Lastly, the large number of comparisons performed can lead to inflated type 1 error rates. However, the focus of this study was to report construct validity, not present statistical comparisons. A strength of our study is the use of a large sample weighted to be nationally representative, allowing us to assess differences in diet quality by a range of sociodemographic characteristics. We adapted an existing food coding scheme for categories from the USDA's Food Patterns Equivalent Database. Lastly, this is the first study to develop a Toddler DQI that is modeled after the HEI; we based our scoring determination on existing recommendations from the most recent DGAs, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Heart Association.",

Our findings are largely in line with what has been reported in the literature using other diet quality indices. However, this is the first study to report on diet quality among a nationally distributed group of toddlers using federal nutrition guidelines, as the DGAs included toddlers in their recommendations for the first time. The Toddler Diet Quality Index could be adapted for use in other in countries with dietary guidance that is similar to that in the U.S. Future research can include assessing the validity of the Toddler DQI in other populations. Interventions should focus on supporting parents and caregivers in modeling healthy eating behaviors and involve children in food purchasing and preparation to foster positive eating habits they will maintain into adulthood. Findings from this study support focusing nutrition education messages on increasing intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and seafood, while reducing consumption of added sugars. During this formative period, it is important to increase exposure to essential fatty acids and decrease exposure to foods with added sugar and sodium. Dietary habits among US toddlers need to be improved because habits developed early influence dietary preferences for life.
