            "text": "The human adaptive immune system must generate extraordinary diversity to be able to respond to all possible pathogens. The T-cell repertoire derives this high diversity through somatic recombination of the T-cell receptor (TCR) locus, a random process that results in repertoires that are largely private to each individual. However, factors such as thymic selection and T-cell proliferation upon antigen exposure can affect TCR sharing among individuals. By immunosequencing the TCR\u03b2 variable region of 426 healthy individuals, we find that, on average, fewer than 1% of TCR\u03b2 clones are shared between individuals, consistent with largely private TCR\u03b2 repertoires. However, we detect a significant correlation between increased HLA allele sharing and increased number of shared TCR\u03b2 clones, with each additional shared HLA allele contributing to an increase in~0.01% of the total shared TCR\u03b2 clones, supporting a key role for HLA type in shaping the immune repertoire. Surprisingly, we find that shared antigen exposure to CMV leads to fewer shared TCR\u03b2 clones, even after controlling for HLA, indicative of a largely private response to major viral antigenic exposure. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that increased age is correlated with decreased overall TCR\u03b2 clone sharing, indicating that the pattern of private TCR\u03b2 clonal expansion is a general feature of the T-cell response to other infectious antigens as well. However, increased age also correlates with increased sharing among the lowest frequency clones, consistent with decreased repertoire diversity in older individuals. Together, all of these factors contribute to shaping the TCR\u03b2 repertoire, and understanding their interplay has important implications for the use of T cells for therapeutics and diagnostics.

The adaptive immune system of a healthy adult includes up to 10 15 highly diverse T cells [1, 2] . Antigen recognition depends on both T-cell specificity and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), encoded by the polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene complex, presenting the antigen. diversity of possible T-cell receptors (TCR) is generated by the recombination of genes in the third complimentary determining regions (CDR3) within the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains of a TCR. In the recombination process of the \u03b2 chain, loci of the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) regions are randomly spliced together with non-templated insertions and deletions occurring between each junction, resulting in up to 10 11 possible sequences [3, 4] . Recombination of the TCR\u03b1 chain includes only V and J gene segments, resulting in fewer possible rearrangements and making the TCR\u03b2 chain a more suitable target for identifying unique T cells. Recombined T cells that are capable of recognizing cognate antigens when presented by the MHC are selected for maturation and released from the thymus [5] . As a result, VDJ recombination, HLA restriction, and antigen exposure collectively contribute to a largely private TCR\u03b2 repertoire.",

Public TCR\u03b2 clones can arise either via convergent recombination-due to highly-probable rearrangements, or via convergent selection-due to proliferation after common antigen exposure. Biases in VDJ recombination and junctional indel patterns suggest that CDR3 sequences that more closely resemble the germline-encoded nucleotide sequence are more likely to occur and thus be shared between individuals [9, 10] . Additionally, publicly expanded antigen-specific T cells to a variety of pathogens including CMV and SARS-CoV-2 have been identified [11] [12] [13] [14] , supporting convergent selection. Together, both of these processes contribute to the existence of public clones, but much remains to be discovered about how factors such as additional antigen exposure and HLA type modify them.",

We assessed the role of HLA zygosity, HLA allele sharing, CMV exposure, and age both in shaping the immune repertoire, and in the sharing of TCR\u03b2 clones between individuals. By analyzing both the highest-and lowest-(single-copy) frequency TCR\u03b2 clones, we identified a consistent positive association between numbers of shared HLA alleles and TCR\u03b2 clones. Additionally, we found that CMV exposure and increased age result in more private TCR\u03b2 repertoires, in particular among high frequency clones. Our results demonstrate the impact of both age and HLA type on TCR\u03b2 clone generation and maturation, and indicate that pathogenic antigen exposure leads to the expansion of largely private and HLA-restricted TCR\u03b2 clones.",

The divergent allele hypothesis suggests that greater diversity of HLA alleles leads to a greater diversity of presented peptides [21, 22] , and thus potentially greater diversity of the TCR\u03b2 repertoire. To address this question, we utilized previously published TCR\u03b2 repertoire data from over 600 individuals. We restricted analysis to individuals in the cohort with full 4-digit resolution at 6 HLA loci (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1) and known CMV serostatus. To control for any technical variation due to differences in T-cell fraction or input material, we further excluded samples with less than 200,000 total T cells. After filtering, our analyses included repertoires from 426 subjects. We determined the zygosity of these individuals at the included HLA loci and quantified repertoire diversity with two metrics: richness and clonality. The richness of each repertoire was calculated as the number of unique TCR\u03b2 nucleotide rearrangements after computationally down-sampling all repertoires to 200,000 productive templates. Simpson clonality was also calculated for each repertoire to assess the dominance of high frequency clones in the repertoire. Within this cohort, 44% of individuals are homozygous at the HLA-DPA1 loci, and heterozygous at all other loci (S1 Fig) .",

We thus hypothesized that shared HLA alleles between unrelated individuals may contribute to the sharing of unique clones. The number of shared clones between each pairwise combination of repertoires was determined by comparing TCR\u03b2 clones by their functional identity (the V gene family, CDR3 amino acid sequence, and J gene). This allows clone sharing to be detected when different individuals generate TCR\u03b2 clones with the same specificity but distinct nucleotide sequences through VDJ recombination. An exact match was required to be considered a shared TCR\u03b2 clone. The HLA allele sharing between individuals was determined regardless of HLA zygosity, so that two individuals homozygous for a specific HLA allele were considered to share two alleles.",

Using a linear mixed-effects model, individuals with no HLA alleles in common shared on average 1,884 of their 200,000 down-sampled clones (0.94%), while each additional shared HLA allele resulted in an increase of 14 shared clones. This suggests a baseline population of public clones found across all subjects regardless of HLA type, consistent with the existence of bystander public clones with high generation probability, in addition to a subset of clones that are shared based on HLA type [10, 27] . While there was a similar relationship between shared alleles and shared TCR\u03b2 clones within both class I and class II alleles, this correlation was slightly stronger for HLAII alleles (Fig 2B and 2C ). This is consistent with CD4+ T cells (which bind class II alleles) making up a greater fraction of the repertoire than CD8 + T cells (which bind class I alleles) [28] .",

While immunosequencing cannot distinguish na\u00efve vs. memory T cells, we hypothesized that many singletons (TCR\u03b2 clones seen once in a sample) correspond to na\u00efve clones, while the highest frequency rearrangements correspond to clones that have likely expanded in response to prior antigen exposure. To characterize the singleton repertoire, we randomly selected 80,000 singletons from the repertoire of each individual. Singleton clones were selected by nucleotide sequence to best capture rearrangements that were present once in the full repertoire of an individual, but compared between individuals using functional identity. While this process may exclude rearrangements with high generation probability that are present multiple times in an individual [29] , it captures the lowest frequency clones in a repertoire. Similar to what we observed when analyzing the down-sampled repertoires, there was a significant correlation between the number of shared HLA alleles and number of shared singletons between individuals (p < 0.001, Mantel test, Fig 2D) . Notably, individuals with no shared alleles still shared on average 613 of 80,000 (0.77%) singletons. Since T cells that are present once in a repertoire are less likely to have encountered antigens, this overlap of singletons between individuals may be attributed to convergent recombination of frequently-generated TCR\u03b2 rearrangements. Each shared HLA allele was correlated with an increase of 6 shared singletons, consistent with a role for HLA type in the maturation of the TCR\u03b2 repertoire. However, even when individuals shared 10 HLA alleles, their repertoires were still largely private, sharing on average 660 of 80,000 singletons, which is still less than 1%. Thus, while HLA type plays an important role in the maturation of T cells, random VDJ somatic recombination results in most individuals having a highly private TCR\u03b2 repertoire.",

To do this, we determined the generation probabilities of all TCR\u03b2 rearrangements using OLGA [9] , which correlated strongly with CDR3 length and the number of indels (S5A- S5C Fig) . To distinguish rare from common TCR\u03b2 clones, we established a cutoff point (P gen = 1.66e-09) by finding the intersection point of generation probabilities between public TCR\u03b2 clones that occurred in more than one subject and private TCR\u03b2 clones found in only one subject ( Fig 3A, S4D Fig) . Each TCR\u03b2 clone was thus classified as \"rare,\" with generation probabilities lower than this cutoff, or \"common\" otherwise. Sharing of each subset of clones between individuals was examined in both the down-sampled, singleton, and top 5,000 rearrangements repertoires. While sharing of both common and rare clones were significantly correlated with increased sharing of HLA alleles, the relationship was stronger among rare clones (Mantel rho 0.28) compared to common clones (Mantel rho 0.12) (p < 0.001, Mantel test, Fig 3B and 3C ). This pattern persisted within the top 5,000 rearrangements (S4E and S4F Fig) , though this analysis is limited by the small number of rare high frequency clones. As rare TCR\u03b2 clones are those with rearrangements not commonly generated during VDJ recombination, these results suggest that their selection for maturation may be modulated by HLA genotype.",

These results suggest that HLA allele sharing affects both rare and common TCR\u03b2 clone sharing, but the degree of impact depends on the frequencies of those clones within an individual repertoire. TCR\u03b2 repertoire frequency is largely determined by antigen exposure, suggesting that expansion of rare clones may increase clone sharing among individuals with matched HLA types, although these clones only make up a small proportion of the overall repertoire.",

We next sought to determine whether common viral antigenic exposure would lead to differences in clone sharing. We focused our analysis on CMV, as our analysis cohort was split roughly equally between CMV-and CMV+ individuals (i.e. subjects with past CMV infection) [11] . We hypothesized that CMV+ individuals may share more clones than CMV-individuals. Surprisingly, we observed the opposite, with CMV-individuals sharing more down-sampled TCR\u03b2 clones than CMV+ subjects (Fig 4A) , and significantly more clones than a permuted null distribution ( [25] . To account for this disparity in diversity, we again looked at clone sharing among the top 5,000 unique TCR\u03b2 rearrangements. There was also greater sharing of top TCR\u03b2 clones between CMV-individuals compared to CMV+ individuals ( Fig 4B) and compared to the null (permuted P = 0.002). This suggests that TCR\u03b2 repertoires become more private after CMV antigen exposure, likely through the expansion of mostly private clones. Notably, this trend is consistent independent of shared HLA alleles (Fig 4C) . Despite the overall decrease in shared TCR\u03b2 clones compared to CMV-individuals, CMV+ individuals showed significantly greater enrichment in their top 5,000 clones of CMV-associated TCR\u03b2 clones, as identified in Emerson et al. (Fig 4D, P <2.2e-16, Unpaired Wilcox test) . This suggests that while some public clones expand based on common viral antigen exposure, most of the expanded antigen-specific clones are private to a given repertoire.",

Even when several HLA alleles are shared between two unrelated individuals, we see that over 98% of each repertoire is comprised of unique clones. Within the singleton repertoire, which best reflects the inherent diversity of the na\u00efve TCR\u03b2 repertoire, less than 1% of rearrangements are shared between individuals, demonstrating the high variability of VDJ somatic recombination. We show that HLA zygosity of an individual does not strongly affect the overall diversity of their TCR\u03b2 repertoire. While previous work with a similar dataset found a correlation between HLA class I zygosity and decreased repertoire richness among CMVindividuals, that analysis quantified diversity with different metrics and did not control for sampling depth, which could impact the finding [30] . One limitation of this cohort is that over half of the individuals are of European descent, and a more diverse cohort may have a different distribution of HLA zygosities. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that the space of potential TCR\u03b2 clones is diverse enough that the HLA genotype homozygosity of an individual does not affect the overall diversity of their repertoire.",

Even within fully heterozygous individuals, evolutionary divergence of HLA alleles is positively correlated with the number of peptides predicted to be recognized by the TCR\u03b2 repertoire of an individual [16, 22] . As such, it is perhaps not surprising that HLA zygosity alone is not enough to alter the shape of the TCR\u03b2 repertoire. Future work incorporating phylogeny-aware or distance-based clustering of HLA alleles [16, 35, 36] could better assess the functional diversity of the HLA alleles of an an individual and thus the relationship between potential bound peptides and diversity.

We show that individuals sharing more HLA alleles share more TCR\u03b2 clones, suggesting that HLA type impacts the specific T cells selected for maturation during thymic selection. Previous work has also shown that public clones occur more frequently than would be expected by chance due to biases in VDJ recombination and indels [1, 6, 10, 37] . Our analyses support these findings, as individuals sharing no HLA alleles still share TCR\u03b2 clones. Moreover, we see a stronger correlation between HLA sharing and the sharing of rare clones compared to the sharing of common clones, suggesting a background of easily generated clones while rare clones are more HLA restricted. Notably, even among commonly recombined clones, HLA restriction is significantly correlated with clone sharing, suggesting that convergent recombination alone cannot explain the prevalence of all public clones. Further work could also assess the similarity of HLA alleles between individuals to better quantify their overall ability to present common antigen.",

            "text": "Finally, while there has been demonstrated success in the diagnostic potential of public antigen-specific clones, our work suggests a largely private expansion of TCR\u03b2 clones in response to CMV antigen exposure. While public TCR\u03b2 clones exist, they may represent the minority of the overall antigenic response. We show that CMV exposure actually decreases overall clone sharing, regardless of the number of HLA alleles shared. While CMV is a unique virus in that it often remains dormant without being fully cleared, by extending this analysis to include the age of each individual as a proxy for continued pathogenic exposure, our data indicate that the expansion of private clones in response to antigen exposure is not unique to CMV. Older individuals have likely been exposed to a broader range of pathogens than younger individuals, shaping their TCR\u03b2 repertoires in an increasingly private manner as T cells specific to encountered antigens expand and remain in the memory compartment. Interestingly, work in identical twins has similarly shown predominantly private responses to common antigens across individuals with the same genetic background [38] [39] [40] . However additional studies confirming this pattern in datasets with other known viruses, such as EBV or HBV or pre-post vaccination would provide further support for the expansion of private clones to specific pathogens. These data underscore how finding public, antigen-specific clones is a difficult problem requiring large datasets. However, the individual nature of TCR\u03b2 repertoires provides utility in tracking clones within individuals over time or between individuals with allogeneic T-cell transplants. While posing a considerable computational challenge, important future work will include defining motifs or implementing clustering algorithms to identify TCR\u03b2 clones that bind the same antigen [36, 41] . Together, this work emphasizes the inherent diversity and private nature of human TCR\u03b2 repertoires, as well as the importance of incorporating HLA genotypes into models predicting both public TCR\u03b2 sharing and antigen-specific expansion.",

(B) The observed median number of clones shared between CMV+ and CMV-individuals was lower than the median of all shuffled comparisons, yielding a significant empirical p-value of 0.002. (C) The observed median number of clones shared between CMV-individuals was greater than the median of all shuffled comparisons, yielding a significant empirical p-value of 0.002. (D) Table containing the rank and empirical p-values of all clone sharing comparisons stratified by CMV serostatus. (E) Table containing the rank and empirical p-values of all clone sharing comparisons stratified by age relative to median age (42).
