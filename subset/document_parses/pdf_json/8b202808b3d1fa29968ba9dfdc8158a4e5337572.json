Although much of this is known anecdotally, to our knowledge, there is no quantitative documentation of the extent and timing of these changes. This paper attempts to address this gap in the literature by looking at the top 100 Alexa websites for over 25 years from the Internet Archive or the \"Wayback Machine\", archive.org. We study the changes in popularity, from Geocities and Yahoo! in the mid-to-late 1990s to the likes of Google, Facebook, and Tiktok of today. We also look at different categories of websites and their popularity over the years and find evidence for the decline in popularity of news and education-related websites, which have been replaced by streaming media and social networking sites. We explore the emergence and relative prevalence of different MIME-types (text vs. image vs. video vs. javascript and json) and study whether the use of text on the Internet is declining.",

Therefore, although our datasets have rich data about individual websites and even individual URLs, we look at them collectively, asking questions about how users spend their time on different categories of websites as well as how the popularity of individual websites within a category (such as social media), or the relative popularity of different categories of websites (e.g. news vs. social media), have changed over time. We also group together URLs by their MIME types 3 , which have historically been used to identify different kinds of multimedia content, and thus provide a convenient lens to study whether and to what extent the Web has moved away from its initial mainly (hyper)text-based origins. 2 Datasets and code are available at https://github.com/socsys/wayback-web-history. 3 MIME stands for Multimedia Internet Mail Extension and MIME types were developed in the context of email. IANA has changed the terminology and MIME types are now called media types [20] as their use has extended well beyond emails. However, it appears that the usage \"MIME type\" is more common, e.g. one of our primary data sources, archive.org, uses MIME rather than media types. Therefore this paper also uses MIME type as it may be more familiar to the readers.",

For example, we show evidence for decreased popularity of news and education websites, which have been replaced by streaming media and social networking. Using Google Trends, we are able to chart and compare the rise or decline of competing websites, such as different social media platforms, which may all be competing for a similar user base. We can also show, using the archive.org data, how the number of URLs in each website has been increasing steadily over time, and how the Web is increasingly turning to images, videos and other sophisticated forms of content. Despite these changes, we still find that text dominates in terms of the number of web resources (i.e. number of Uniform Resource Locators or URLs) available on most website categories. The time correlations that can be observed suggest that some of the changes, such as increased usage of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) objects or JavaScript URLs may be related to the rise in popularity of web programming frameworks such as AJAX and Representational State Transfer (REST).",

The Internet Archive was created in 1996 as a non-profit organization to preserve historical collections that exist in digital format. The Web collection is based on web crawls performed by Alexa Internet, a for-profit organization and crawls are done based on where the links point and where the users go. The main archiving strategy is the snapshot approach, where all the web material that the web crawler encounters is archived periodically [11] . The frequency of archival depends upon the rate at which a website is updated, e.g., Google's snapshot is taken from hundreds to thousands of times per day 4 . Till date, archive.org has collected more than two decades of Web history, through regular snapshots of websites, preserved, and made them accessible.

Google Trends data is available from 2004 onwards, so we obtain information from 2004-2021. For the popular search engine and social networking websites, we crawl Google Trends data for their search interest over time as it can be taken as an indicator of the popularity of a website. The value returned by Google Trends is termed as \"Interest Over Time\" and represents the volume of searches relative to the highest point on the chart. Hence, an \"Interest Over Time\" value of 100 stands for the highest number of searches within a set of values returned. As an example, if we compare two search terms \"foo\" (which receives 1k, 5K and 2k searches respectively over a three month duration under study) and \"bar\" (which was searched 5K, 10K and 8K searches in the same three month duration), then 10K is taken as \"100\", and foo will have \"Interest Over Time\" values of 10, 50 and 20, in comparison with bar, which will have values of 50, 80 and 100. Because popularity is computed on a relative basis for a given set of search terms and normalised to a value of 100, the popularity of different websites can be compared within a single Google Trends comparison (in Figure 2 ), but comparison is not possible across the sub-figures. We call this measure of popularity as the \"Google Trends popularity\" to distinguish it from other possible measures of popularity (e.g. number of monthly active users or number of app installs of a website).",

Figure 1b shows the average daily time spent on the website per visitor for each category over a 3-month period from Sep to Nov 2021. Surprisingly, visitors spend the most time on business-related websites daily, followed by shopping websites. In our list, business websites such as Alibaba.com are at the top, likely because of the additional services being offered by Alibaba and other websites. Social networking websites are at the third position, with visitors spending an average 8 minutes daily. The social network Facebook is at the top with 18 minutes as the daily time spent per visitor, followed by Twitter (12.5 minutes), and LinkedIn (11.25 minutes). These values may be indicative of how Alexa.com computes the time on each website: As it is based on toolbars installed in the browsers of its panel of users, we conjecture that the sojourn time on any website is based on new websites being loaded, and therefore may be missing pages being updated dynamically using AJAX and other techniques. Thus, the above timings might represent a lower bound on the actual times spent on each website. Figure 1c shows a different measure of how frequently each category of website is used, by measuring average daily page views per visitor over a 3-month period from Sep to Nov 2021 for each of the website categories. Again, business websites have the highest (9) unique daily page views per visitor. However, other categories such as social media, which typically rely on AJAX to dynamically load more content to the same web page on scrolling, have fewer distinct number of pages recorded and therefore slip in the rankings.",

Google Chrome, when first released in 2008, introduced this combined URL and search bar feature called Omnibox [31] . Other major browsers such as Mozilla Firefox introduced this feature in 2014 [18] . Thus, if a user enters the name of a website rather than its full URL, this results in a search in the default search engine (which may likely be Google), and therefore ends up being captured in Google Trends as one data point. Note that Google Trends only captures the searches on google.com. It is therefore interesting to note that despite this obvious bias, there were more searches for Yahoo! until nearly 2011 (i.e. even users whose default search engine was Google, as configured either manually or as setup automatically upon installation, were preferring to search for Yahoo!, likely because of the additional services being offered on the Yahoo! Portal). We also observe that the relative number of searches for Google on Google.com (likely a result of users typing in \"google\" into their browsers' URL/Search bars) has been in decline since 2015. Some believe that this may be a result of increasing shift towards app-based access 11 .",

Social networks tend to be a \"winner take all\" market [36] as users need to be on the same platform as their friends. Therefore, a handful of websites end up capturing large proportions of users. Figure 2b explores how the Google Trends popularity of major social networks changed over time. In 2004, the earliest date for Google Trends data, Orkut and MySpace were the most widely used social networking websites, as evident from their relative popularity in Google Trends when compared with other prominent social networking websites. Only around 2008 were they beaten by Facebook, and later on, by Twitter, based on the number of Google Searches made. Since 2010, the microblogging website Twitter became very popular and attained its peak in 2013. Around 2012, WhatsApp and Instagram came into existence and started to capture some of the Google Searches. By 2017, Instagram beat Twitter in Google Trends popularity. In 2019, WhatsApp beat Instagram in Google Trends popularity and became the most popular instant messaging application in the world, according to Google Trends data. In 2021, WhatsApp and Instagram are the two most popular social networking websites, according to Google Trends data. TikTok, a short video streaming application introduced in 2017, is rapidly gaining traction but has still not yet reached the same volume of searches on Google as the other sites. In contrast, Facebook is not shown as its search volume is much higher, making it difficult to visualise the changes in popularity of the other sites. Figure 2c compares the popularity of the two of the most popular websites, Facebook and Google. It can be seen that in 2008 Facebook surpassed Google in Google Trends popularity and reached its peak in 2013-14. After 2018 Cambridge Analytica Scandal, Facebook's reputation has been affected [35] and its Google Trends popularity has deteriorated rapidly.",

The stacked bar chart of Figure 3 shows the fraction of visits to the categories of websites other than the dominating category of search (normalised to 100% after removing search). This reveals a number of interesting trends: Web hosting sites such as GeoCities, a highly popular category in 1995-98 time frame, practically disappears from the top 10 by 2000. Similarly, education disappears after the initial years of popularity of the Web. News shows a decreasing trend and disappears from the top 10 after 2010. These categories are replaced by social network sites, which emerge around 2005, and streaming media, which becomes popular around 2010. We also note the new rise in popularity of online shopping sites in 2021, presumably a side-effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The number of URLs required to fully render a page is indicative of the complexity of the page or site. A rich diversity of MIME types requires more complex code in the browser and ability to display different types of content. The number of MIME types therefore can be seen as another measure of website complexity. Since 1998, when about 19 distinct MIME types were present on these top websites, there has been over a five fold increase to 113 different MIME types in 2021. We also see a rapid increase in the number of different applicationspecific MIME types. Note that the number of distinct MIME types is different from the actual prevalance of web resources (URLs) with these MIME types. Figure 4b shows the total raw numbers of new URLs (i.e. URLs added since the previous year) across the Alexa top 100 sites, from 1998 to 2021. This shows a general trend of websites getting increasingly complex with more and more URLs over the years (note that the Y axis is in log-scale). We can also see an increase in usage of web resources with application-specific MIME types, and in addition an increased usage of images over the years. Despite this, it is interesting to see that even in 2021, text-based MIME types (mainly HTML) still constitute a significant proportion of the Web, by number of URLs.",

In both cases, we find that the social networking category has the maximum number of image as well as application (mainly, json and javascript) URLs. Fig 6a digs deeper, showing the numbers of URLs of different MIME types across the years in websites belonging to the social networking category. This clearly shows the rise in URLs of MIME type application/* starting in 2005, with the rise of AJAX and the RESTful programming paradigm that characterised Web 2.0 [33] . Similarly, the usage and the number of image and other non-text MIME types appears to increase as Internet bandwidth availability increases over the years. We find similar trends for other categories of websites as well. As one example, Figure 6b shows that the search engine category follows a similar trend. Each category of MIME types discussed above (e.g. image or text) aggregates various different formats of a certain type (e.g. images can be image/jpeg, image/gif etc.). Each such aggregate category itself has an increase in complexity, with new formats being added under each category over the years. Figure 7 illustrates this for image-related MIME types, by looking at the number of different image-type URLs over the years and the different kinds of image MIME types being used on Alexa top 100 sites, as recorded by archive.org. In 1998 and 2000, GIF and JPEG images dominated. Since then, PNG has started to emerge as a common choice of image format. More recently, vector graphics (SVG) have started to be used as well for images. Again, we observe similar trends for other MIME-type classes such as application/* (not shown).",

These avenues for future work also highlight important limitations of our current work: For example, as a first attempt at a quantitative historical understanding, we only focus on the Alexa Top 100 websites. However, archive.org has data about many other websites which we plan to study in future work. Similarly, the common crawl 12 represents a huge dataset of Web URLs and their content, that can provide additional information. Alexa ranking is also not the only and the definitive ranking of websites; thus results may be slightly different if other rankings of Websites (e.g. Similarweb) are used. Also, we do not know the demographics of the users or the kinds of devices they use for browsing with Alexa plug-ins that generate Alexa rankings and Websites traffic information. Secondly, our focus on the \"worldwide\" top websites does not, in general, include sites that may be more relevant in non-western cultures, although some populous countries such as China are already represented in the Global top 100 through websites such as Baidu, Weibo and Alibaba. Future work may want to focus on country-or region-specific issues. Our list is also heavily biased towards the English Web, so a study of history of the Web in other languages is an important understudied problem. Other data sets we use, such as Google Trends, also introduce biases into our study: e.g. Google Trends does not capture the interests of users of search engines other than Google; thus it becomes important to check whether other search engines such as Bing or DuckDuckGo see similar trends as seen on Google. Finally, we also note that a quantitative study can miss several of the nuances that come from close study in the social sciences, thus there is a need to bridge Big Data methods such as ours with more traditional social science approaches [27] . Qualitative studies and approaches such as the regularly conducted Pew Internet Surveys 13 add important dimensions that cannot be easily captured by purely observational data-based studies such as ours.",
