We estimate that 20.4% [95% CI (13.7%, 27.2%)] of excess deaths between February 1 and August 26, 2020 were ascribed to causes of death other than Covid-19 itself. Excess deaths not assigned to Covid-19 were even higher than predicted by our model in counties with high income inequality, low median income, low homeownership, and high percentages of Black residents, showing a pattern related to socioeconomic disadvantage and structural racism.

            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 is an international public health emergency caused by the respiratory droplet transmission of the coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) virus. 1 Covid-19 infects humans through the lung epithelium and is associated with a high incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, vascular injury, and death. 2 The United States has emerged as an epicenter of the pandemic, with 5.9 million confirmed cases and approximately 181,000 deaths as of August 27, 2020. 3 Vital registration data on cause of death are likely to underestimate the mortality burden associated with the pandemic for several reasons. 4, 5 First, some direct deaths attributable to Covid-19 may be assigned to other causes of death due to an absence of widespread testing and low rates of diagnoses at the time of death. 6 Second, direct deaths from unfamiliar complications of Covid-19 such as coagulopathy, myocarditis, inflammatory processes, and arrhythmias may have caused confusion and led to attributions of death to other causes, especially early in the pandemic. [7] [8] [9] Third, Covid-19 death counts do not take into account the indirect consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on mortality levels. [10] [11] [12] Indirect effects may include increases in mortality resulting from reductions in access to and use of health care services and psychosocial consequences of stay-at-home orders. 13 Increases in stress, depression, and substance use related to the pandemic could also lead to suicides and overdose deaths. 14, 15 Economic hardship, housing insecurity, and food insecurity may cause indirect deaths, especially among those living with chronic illnesses or who face acute heath emergencies and cannot afford medicines or medical supplies. [16] [17] [18] On the other hand, the pandemic may reduce mortality as a result of reductions in travel and associated motor vehicle mortality. 19 It is also possible that Covid-19 deaths are over-recorded in some instances, e.g., because some deaths that should have been assigned to influenza were instead assigned to Estimates of excess deaths from all causes associated with the pandemic provide a useful measure of the total mortality burden associated with Covid-19. The term \"excess deaths\" refers to increases in mortality over what would normally have been expected based on historical norms for the period of analysis. Excess deaths include deaths directly assigned to Covid-19 on death certificates and excess deaths not assigned to Covid-19, which were either misclassified to other causes of deaths or were indirectly related to the Covid-19 pandemic. In summary, using deaths from all causes to measure the excess mortality impact of the Covid-19 epidemic can help circumvent biases in vital statistics, such as low Covid-19 testing rates, reporting lags, and differences in death certification coding practices, 5 21 Kontis et al. apply Bayesian ensemble modeling to obtain smoothed estimates of excess deaths by age and sex in .

Counties may have differential delays in reporting death certificate data that vary by county, state, rurality, or other area-level factors. In particular, counties that are currently reporting lower all-cause mortality in 2020 than in the historical period likely have incomplete data. Another challenge was that the majority of counties in the study had fewer than 50 directly assigned covid-19 deaths. Although NCHS excluded counties with under 10 directly assigned Covid-19 deaths, this only partially addressed the uncertainty caused by small numbers.",

As the impact of Covid-19 spreads over a broader swath of U.S. counties, many of which re-opened early and have struggled with testing and their overall response, the analysis of excess deaths will continue to be a valuable proxy measure for assessing the overall mortality burden of Covid-19.
