            "text": "Localized carbon reduction strategies are especially critical in states and regions that lack top-down climate leadership. This paper illustrates the use of coupled systems in assessments of subnational climate solutions with a case study of Georgia, a state located in the southeastern United States that does not have statewide climate goals or plans. The paper illustrates how robust place-specific plans for climate action could be derived from foundational global and national work and by embedding that research into the context of socio-ecological-technological systems. Our replicable methodology advances the traditional additive sectoral wedge analysis of carbon abatement potential by incorporating solution interdependencies and by spanning both carbon sources and sinks. We estimate that a system of 20 solutions could cut Georgia's carbon footprint by 35% in 2030 relative to a business-as-usual forecast and by 50% relative to Georgia's emissions in 2005. We also produce a carbon abatement cost curve that aligns private and social costs as well as benefits with units of avoided CO 2 -e. The solutions are affiliated with various social cocosts and co-benefits that highlight societal concerns extending beyond climate impacts, including public health, environmental quality, employment, and equity. carbon footprint | carbon neutrality | equity | climate roadmap A chieving the carbon reduction necessary to avoid costly climate change necessitates actions at every political scale and across all sectors of the economy. To realize such goals will require the promotion and adoption of high-impact solutions that appeal to different subnational localities, including states, regions, and municipalities. Local businesses and consumers must also find such solutions appealing because they are suitable for the economy, the wallet, and the climate. Thus, climate action plans must be highly tailored and site-specific. One lesson from the development of the Paris Climate Agreement is that countries want to design their own site-specific solutions (1) . To date, 191 parties to the Paris Climate Agreement have committed to Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The United States' original NDC pledged to reduce emissions 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025; within just a few months of taking office in 2021, President Biden introduced a more stringent at least 50% carbon reduction goal for 2030. The Paris Agreement also formalized the role of subnational and nonstate actors in pushing national climate commitments forward (2) .",

This is true, for example, in the European Union, where subnational goals have emerged alongside the bloc-wide goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 (4) . In the United States, subnational climate commitments have formed in the absence of coordinated federal climate policy (5) . Several US states have taken a wide range of climate actions. Some have adopted climate action plans that set greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals as well as policies and programs aimed at achieving those goals. This includes individual state actions and collective actions, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States that sets a cap on power sector emissions. America's Pledge, for example, brings together public and private leaders to mobilize a wide range of actors to take action on climate change. Collectively, subnational and nonstate actors, including states, regions, cities, and businesses, have the potential to make meaningful GHG reductions that could help bring national commitments in line with the 2-degree or 1.5-degree pathways (6) . There has also been a great deal of qualitative research on subnational actions to address climate change, including the development of design principles for frameworks that link multilateral and nonstate governance to avoid overlapping and redundant efforts and to fill gaps that might otherwise remain unaddressed, such as adaptation (7, 8) .",

Those with goals vary in detail and structure. Currently, 25 US governors have committed to meeting the goals Significance Only 22 states in the United States have climate action plans, and of these, only six consider carbon mitigation, negative emissions, and equity issues. In the absence of robust federal or state policy action, there is a need for subnational carbon abatement planning. However, many of the most robust frameworks for carbon abatement are at a global or national scale. We provide a framework for localizing an existing global roadmap of climate solutions for Georgia, a state located in the southeastern United States. We thereby provide a replicable model that documents how subnational actors can evaluate high-potential emission reduction and carbon removal solutions while considering systems of solutions and taking into account social, ecological, and technological issues and priorities. of the Paris Climate Agreement (9) , and 23 of these, and the District of Columbia, have set economy-wide GHG reduction targets using statutory and/or legally binding executive action (10) . Twenty-two of these same states have climate plans. A review of these plans indicates that only 15 states focus on net emissions (the difference between carbon emissions and sequestration), only 9 discuss equity issues, and only 6 address both net emissions and equity issues. The number of comprehensive state plans shrinks further as the treatment of other societal priorities such as ecosystem diversity and employment impacts are considered.",

While global and national studies provide powerful points of departure, their perspective must be tailored to meet the unique needs, resources, and preferences of specific localities. The conversion to state and local planning is further complicated by the need to study a system of climate solutions that consider a range of linkages and interactions as well as impacts on societal priorities that extend beyond climate concerns. The localized system's frame helps subnational actors to prioritize and plan for scaling climate solutions in their communities. More can be achieved at lower costs by exploiting socio-ecological-technological systems (SETs) that are mutually supportive (13) , and by considering their multidimensional impacts (14) . For instance, charging electric vehicles (EVs) with power from coal plants is counterproductive-it would increase carbon emissions and worsen air pollution. However, operating EVs with electricity from solar charging stations located in the retail centers of historically marginalized communities would enable ultralow emissions mobility that also creates local jobs.",

By embedding these scales of disruptive potential into broader SETs framing (10) , it is possible to distinguish between adaptive and transformational capacity. Adaptive capacity is the ability to confront potentially disruptive change in ways that keep systems operational, while transformative capacity reflects the ability to shift a system between regimes-for example, out of regimes supporting unsustainable pathways of development and into regimes supporting sustainable ones (27) .

For example, the largest wedge represents utility-scale solar that increases from 3.9 megatons in 2021 to 11.2 megatons in 2030. The wedge for energy-efficient trucks grows from 0.5 megatons in 2021 to 3.3 megatons in 2030. When all 20 abatement estimates are included and two major interactions are taken into account, the projected total GHG emissions in 2030 would fall from the forecast of 122 megatons to 79 megatons, a 35% reduction. Relative to Georgia's 156.5 megatons of net emissions in 2005, this would be a 50% reduction, which is consistent with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and follow-up commitments made on behalf of the United States in April 2021 by President Biden.",

Alternative mobility, retrofitting buildings, and afforestation would be large contributors to this future technically possible scenario. It is worth noting that a longer time horizon may have made certain opportunities for carbon reductions even more attractive. For example, an extended time frame might have put increased emphasis on carbon-neutral building construction given potential turnover rates in building stock, and increased focus on off-shore wind given technology breakthroughs and US experience with offshore wind farms that is likely to occur over the next decade.",

On the positive side, the public health benefits of solutions can reduce health inequities by offering improved air quality and public health benefits for underresourced communities.

With a combination of innovative rate designs and the direct load control of heat pumps, water heating, air conditioning, and EV charging, demand response also allows power providers to enhance system reliability and resilience. System peaks may be reduced by clipping demand during peak hours or shifting load from on-peak to off-peak hours. In either case, DR changes the standard electricity usage patterns of consumers, allowing utilities to reduce their use of expensive and carbon-intensive peaking resources and thereby decreasing GHG emissions. DR can be seen as a type of decentralized energy storage that enhances demand-and-supply flexibility, by separating the timing of electricity production from energy consumption. In Georgia, peak demand is met primarily by natural gas plants, but more polluting and inefficient single-cycle diesel combustion turbines also contribute. We modeled demand response using GT-NEMS by allowing consumers to shift 20% of their on-peak demand for electricity to off-peak hours. The result is a reduction of 1.7 megatons of CO 2 and a cut in utility bills across all customer classes, averaging $2.4 million annually over the next decade, reducing energy burdens. However, for low-income households, bill reductions may be limited without policy adjustments to target renters as well as owners and the lower penetration of targeted appliances such as clothes washers, dryers, and dishwashers (34) . All income groups would benefit from the improved public health from cleaner air, estimated to be worth $21 million annually over the next decade, principally from curbing childhood asthma and reducing adult lung and heart diseases. Rooftop solar systems. A second way to reduce emissions from the electricity sector is to expand green electricity such as rooftop solar systems. In 2020, Georgia had less than 2,000 home solar systems (displacing a fraction of 1-megaton CO 2 ), mostly located in large cities that have hosted Solarize Campaigns-communitybased solar purchasing programs. Based on Google Project Sunroof data (35) on existing flat and south-facing angled roofs located in Georgia and analyzed by county, Georgia has the technical potential for 24.3 GW of solar rooftop nameplate capacity, similar to an earlier National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) analysis by Lopez et al. (36) . This technical capacity would cut Georgia's carbon footprint by 12 megatons, making it an important target for future action. Fitting a generic logistic growth curve (see below) to past adoption trends and the estimated technical potential, we estimate that by 2030, Georgia could achieve close to 1 megaton of abatement by 2030. The generic logistic growth curve that was fitted to historic growth rates and the technical potential for rooftop solar in Georgia, is specified below:",

            "text": "(See SI Appendix for further details.) There are additional challenges associated with this transition to EVs, including the lack of affordability by resource-challenged consumers. Fortunately, there are several promising trends and tools underway to address this barrier, including steadily declining battery and EV prices, subsidies to help defray upfront investments, and programs geared specifically to low-income communities (44) . Building retrofits. Turning to the energy-consuming built environment, deep building retrofits offer sizeable potential energy savings at reasonable costs. The achievable scenario for retrofitting considers a 2% per year market penetration (above the baseline forecast) of smart thermostats, improved insulation, and light-emitting diode (LED) lighting for the residential sector and retro-commissioning, building automation, and LED lighting for the commercial sector. The result is an abatement potential of 2.4 to 4 megatons in 2030. This increases to 13.7 megatons in the technical scenario, with the addition of improved windows in the residential sector; high-efficiency heat pumps, hybrid heat pump water heaters, and improved insulation in the commercial sector; and the assumption of a 5% per year market penetration. Building retrofits are especially important to help deal with other solutions that could raise electricity rates and exacerbate household energy burdens (45) . The following points explain the magnitude of our estimated carbon-reduction potential: 1) the additional energy-efficiency gains are estimated with respect to a thorough business-as-usual scenario for existing buildings that is anticipated to deliver an estimated 9.6% decrease in energy per household over the next decade; 2) more efficient new buildings would deliver additional carbon reductions; 3) we considered the potential for a carefully selected subset of cost-effective technologies; 4) we rely on retrofit rates achieved by best-in-class retrofit programs; and 5) as more renewable energy penetrates the grid, we model the fact that carbon reduction from energy efficiency declines because the energy that is being avoided has lower carbon content. We estimate and discuss these interaction effects in the paper and its SI Appendix, to clarify some of these limitations. Indeed, with a more comprehensive approach to promoting energy efficiency, a longer time horizon, and aggressive incentives, it would be possible to go beyond our \"achievable\" scenario. However, a majority of energy-efficiency programs require upfront customer investments to leverage rebates and associated savings, which makes them unaffordable to low-income households (46) . When access to energy becomes difficult, the burden is felt in every facet of life-housing, mobility, health, work, education, and much more (47) . Thus, policy innovations are needed for this solution to be equitable. These innovations include programs such as utility financing via \"Pay As You Save\" and on-bill financing initiatives. There are also efforts that extend beyond financing and bill assistance to addressing root causes through, for example, correcting funding disparities between the federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which supports short-term energy bill assistance; and the Weatherization Assistance Program, which funds more permanently beneficial weatherization and energy efficiency for lowincome households (48) . Reducing food waste. In the food and agriculture sector, reducing food waste is a major potential contributor. More than one-third of food every year is wasted globally and nationally (49, 50) . In the United States, more than 55 million tons of food is wasted annually at the retail and consumer levels, and that is on top of the losses occurring throughout the production, processing, and transportation chain (51) . When food waste ends up in landfills, some is broken down to CO 2 where oxygen levels are high enough, but most degrades into methane, which is a particularly potent GHG (45) . Furthermore, there are significant GHG emissions throughout the food supply chain that could be avoided by reducing the throughput associated with wastage. By our estimate, reducing food waste by 20% could avoid almost 2 megatons of emissions in Georgia. To achieve this, we need comprehensive consumer education campaigns, institutional food reduction programs, more effective food donation programs, improved refrigerated storage and capacity, standardized date labeling, and robust data analytics on food waste measurement and monitoring (48) . In the end, reducing waste along the supply chain can benefit farmers, processors, wholesalers, retailers, restaurants, and consumers. Furthermore, it can help tackle the problem of food insecurity that has been made so visible by COVID-19. However, there also can be affordability challenges and/or cost pressures for individual actors in the value chain. Afforestation and silvopasture. Afforestation and silvopasture is a solution that illustrates the importance of expanding land sinks. Earth has three natural carbon \"sinks\" where carbon can be stored. The atmosphere is the most common waste repository for carbon (52) , which is causing the climate change that we now must manage. Carbon can also be absorbed by the ocean, but this causes issues of ocean acidification that harms shellfish and other aquatic life. Land sinks, on the other hand, can absorb carbon safely and securely. Almost 60% of land in Georgia is composed of naturally recruited and planted temperate forests, and Georgia is the number one forestry state in the nation (29) . Increasing forest cover in Georgia by 10% would increase the state's carbon storage by 2.8 megaton in 2030. In addition, more forests mean more wildlife habitats and low-cost recreational lands, as well as cleaner water and air because trees deliver powerful pollutant filtration ecosystems (48, 53, 54) .",

Synergies occur when the successful deployment of one solution magnifies the carbon reduction potential of another. In contrast, competitive effects occur when the deployment of one solution undermines the ability of other solutions to reduce carbon emissions. As outlined in ref. 32 , we distinguish between synergies and competition based on emissions vs. implementation. Synergistic emissions occur when the implementation of one solution (such as large-scale solar) boosts the emissions reduction of another, as occurs when EVs operate on lower-carbon electricity. With synergistic implementation, expansion of one solution such as afforestation, accelerates the implementation of another solution, such as coastal wetlands, which are a more robust carbon sink as the result of the pollution filtering of upstream forests.",

This is the case with building retrofits, because the electricity that would be \"saved\" from insulating structures and upgrading appliance efficiencies, would be less carbon intensive. With competitive implementation, the uptake of one solution undermines opportunities for another. For instance, reducing food waste or adopting composting, reduces organic waste streams and therefore shrinks the potential to produce landfill methane. Similarly, limited common resources can lead to competition, as with the competition for land, which is needed to plant trees, build solar farms, and expand mass transit. Fig. 4 identifies notable bilateral competition and synergies. Competitive and synergistic impacts are one of the motivations for economy-wide modeling of emissions strategies. The literature also often deals with co-benefits and competing goals (55) (56) (57) . At the same time, addressing the full range of macroeconomic effects will require general equilibrium models for each solution, the specification and results of which will be highly dependent on how the solution is implemented. While some solutions like mass transit warrant a full-scale macroeconomic analysis before significant investments are made, considering the urgency of the climate crisis, we should also be mindful of \"paralysis by analysis.\"",

This result is consistent with that of Hoarau and Perez (58) who find synergies in the interaction between EVs and solar photovoltaics across the academic literature. A major motivation for EVs is the goal of shifting prime energy resources from liquid hydrocarbon fuels to grid power. With this shift, large-scale solar in Georgia could improve the environmental impact of EVs by reducing the average CO 2 intensity of grid electricity. Three relevant interactions have been modeled: the average reduction of grid CO 2 intensity from solar, the decrease of light-duty vehicle (LDV) CO 2 emissions, and the increase in electricity demand due to LDVs. This interaction was modeled using the following quantities and formula using MATLAB (the code is reproduced in SI Appendix). We conceptualize the relationship based on Eq. 1:",

It should be noted that marginal CO 2 emission rates (e.g., on an hourly basis) can become important, and would be higher than average rates, if EV charging is not managed carefully throughout the day (e.g., solar energy will not directly charge EVs at night, but instead offset other forms of generation). This would erode some of the potential synergies of this interaction. Additional erosion could occur if/when future EV deployments and charging needs surpass a certain threshold wherein electricity generation must be derived from higher CO 2 resources, i.e., if low carbon generation is fully utilized and insufficient to meet additional EV demand, requiring additional fossil generation.",

While these differences are likely the result of disparate assumptions about state, local, and federal responsibilities, as well as assumptions about potential penetration rates of various technologies, it is worth noting that America's Pledge finds three largely similar levers for potential reductions to carbon.

Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, adults in the United States spent an average of 1 h driving every day, and 91% of the workforce commuted in personal vehicles(42). These numbers dropped substantially during the pandemic as many offices adopted telework policies. For the achievable scenario, an additional 5-10% uptake in bike/walk share to replace auto trips in urban environments would result in 45-55% of trips under a one-half mile and 22-32% of trips under 4 miles being taken by walking or cycling by 2030, in line with current figures achieved in some parts of the United States. This increase in walking and cycling is combined with an additional 10 to 20% of telecommuting by workers who have jobs that can be done remotely (roughly 50% of the population) (43) to achieve total emissions reductions of between 1.8 and 3.6 Mt CO 2 -e. Technical potential (21.5 Mt CO 2 -e) is modeled as 45% of all trips taken by alternative transportation and 50% additional telecommuting by 2030. It demonstrates a large potential that is constrained by societal choices around the design of urban and suburban",
