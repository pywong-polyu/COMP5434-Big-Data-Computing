Indeed, the use of these approaches has enormously contributed to a better understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of human diseases. Such studies have been successful in uncovering many aspects of development and differentiation and cellular behavior under various conditions, as well as molecular interactions and networking. The use of animal models further facilitated a higher and complex dimension of understanding and hence tremendous breakthroughs and discoveries have been made using these model systems allowing bench-to-bedside translation and leading to therapeutic interventions in many human diseases. Nevertheless, the vast majority of drugs that were developed in animal models have had limited success in clinical trials. In a large part, this can be attributed to the lack of models that can faithfully phenocopy the unique nature of human biology. Furthermore, animal models used in preclinical research are mostly based on inbred strains harboring genetic homogeneity and lacking the diversity of heterogenous genetics seen in humans.",

            "text": "This has led to the emergence of alternatives that allow precise modeling and drug screening. One such system is the use of human three-dimensional (3D) cell culture approaches [1, 2] . These in vitro 3D cultures, often referred to as organoids, are generated from embryonic or adult stem cells as well as from induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Fig. 1A ). Using particular supplements and small molecules in culture media, organoid cultures were established to model specific organs containing multiple cell types and displaying physiological and cellular traits of the primary modeled organ [3, 4] . Organoids can be maintained and followed for extended time periods due to their self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. Recent years have seen great advancements in establishing multiple different organoid culture protocols that model the various organ systems in the human body (Fig. 1B) . This platform has facilitated unforeseen modeling and studies recapitulating the development of human tissues and diseases. A major advantage is the ability to model patient-specific disorders in a personalized manner and the use of organoids to screen for drugs and possible treatments. The ability of long-term culture of organoids has also enabled the use of highthroughput technologies to address key questions at various levels. Researchers have applied transcriptomics (bulk and single cell), proteomics, and metabolomics to organoid cultures driving novel discoveries and complementing studies in animal models and in 2D cultures. The use of organoids has been applied to the study of human brain disorders, response to infections including the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), malignancies, and more [3, 5, 6] . As such, the use of organoids holds great promise for recapitulating complex pathogenesis thereby expediting personalized medicine applications and drug screening.",

Aqeilan ;,: 1234567890();,: from a group of pioneer scientists who have reviewed and discussed advances and challenges related to the use of organoids in modeling different tissues. The review article by Sidhaye and Knoblich discusses the foremost advances in organoids use to study human brain development and related neurological diseases [8, 9] . The emergence of several methods and protocols modeling the different parts of the brain and disease-associated phenotypes and mechanisms are extensively reviewed. Brain organoid protocols of patterned and unpatterned organization, region-specific, fusion organoids and co-culture with other cell types and tissues are compared in the context of the biological question and the disease of interest to be studied. The authors further reviewed the different neurological diseases that were studied using the different protocols of brain organoids and conclude with a description of the immense potential of brain organoid technologies to reveal disease mechanisms and as a platform for drug screening, therapy and diagnosis. Jay Gopalakrishnan leads a discussion of the use of brain organoids to model and study glioma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. The organoids used to study cancer were either established from a patient tumor biopsy, retained cancer stem cells, or via genetic manipulation, for example using CRISPR/CAS9, of a healthy organoid by modeling a specific mutation [10]. These so called tumoroids or glioblastoma organoids closely mirror the nature of the human disease and is discussed by Mariappan and colleagues from various aspects, including the challenges involved and their significance in closing the gap between studies of 2D cultures and animal models of gliomas.",

As for many tissues, access to the digestive tract tissues and biopsies is limited and hence organoid-derived systems provide an excellent alternate system to model pathologies and study human-specific aspects of disease kinetics and physiology. In addition, this digestive tract platform allows screening and investigating new therapeutic approaches for many diseases related to disorders in the digestive tracts. Funata et al. give examples and describe attempts to study genetic diseases (such as cystic fibrosis, monogenic liver diseases and Hirschsprung's disease), infectious diseases (H. pylori and HBV), inflammatory diseases (steatohepatitis, Wolman disease and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)) and malignant diseases (colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma), all related to the digestive system. Spangers and colleagues elegantly discuss how two key signaling pathways, YAP and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, regulate the dynamic intestinal repair response upon inflammation and injury and the promise of intestinal organoids to model intestinal regeneration. The challenges accompanying the use of digestive tract organoids including optimizing clinical relevance, modeling the complexity of organ interaction, improving reproducibility and quality as well as the standardization of culture to enable highthroughput screening are also discussed.",

In-depth understanding of FRT was lacking due to the limited available tools and systems. Furthermore, the complex nature of FRT and its non-cell autonomous dependence on signals and hormones from other organs (pituitary, ovary or placenta in pregnancy) prompted the use of the 3D organoid system in studying these complicated and highly dynamic organs. Such organoid systems accurately model the morphology and functions of the human organs making them an excellent model to study physiology and related pathologies, including malignancies and fertility. There is definitely much more to uncover and to improve in FRT-related organoids to better improve women's wellbeing and reproductive health.",

Aqeilan ramiaq@mail.huji.ac.il 1 The Concern Foundation Laboratories, The Lautenberg Center for Immunology and Cancer Research, Department of Immunology and Cancer Research-IMRIC, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel from a group of pioneer scientists who have reviewed and discussed advances and challenges related to the use of organoids in modeling different tissues. The review article by Sidhaye and Knoblich discusses the foremost advances in organoids use to study human brain development and related neurological diseases [8, 9] . The emergence of several methods and protocols modeling the different parts of the brain and disease-associated phenotypes and mechanisms are extensively reviewed. Brain organoid protocols of patterned and unpatterned organization, region-specific, fusion organoids and co-culture with other cell types and tissues are compared in the context of the biological question and the disease of interest to be studied. The authors further reviewed the different neurological diseases that were studied using the different protocols of brain organoids and conclude with a description of the immense potential of brain organoid technologies to reveal disease mechanisms and as a platform for drug screening, therapy and diagnosis.",

These so called tumoroids or glioblastoma organoids closely mirror the nature of the human disease and is discussed by Mariappan and colleagues from various aspects, including the challenges involved and their significance in closing the gap between studies of 2D cultures and animal models of gliomas.",

As for many tissues, access to the digestive tract tissues and biopsies is limited and hence organoid-derived systems provide an excellent alternate system to model pathologies and study human-specific aspects of disease kinetics and physiology. In addition, this digestive tract platform allows screening and investigating new therapeutic approaches for many diseases related to disorders in the digestive tracts. Funata et al. give examples and describe attempts to study genetic diseases (such as cystic fibrosis, monogenic liver diseases and Hirschsprung's disease), infectious diseases (H. pylori and HBV), inflammatory diseases (steatohepatitis, Wolman disease and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)) and malignant diseases (colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma), all related to the digestive system. Spangers and colleagues elegantly discuss how two key signaling pathways, YAP and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, regulate the dynamic intestinal repair response upon inflammation and injury and the promise of intestinal organoids to model intestinal regeneration. The challenges accompanying the use of digestive tract organoids including optimizing clinical relevance, modeling the complexity of organ interaction, improving reproducibility and quality as well as the standardization of culture to enable highthroughput screening are also discussed.",

In-depth understanding of FRT was lacking due to the limited available tools and systems. Furthermore, the complex nature of FRT and its non-cell autonomous dependence on signals and hormones from other organs (pituitary, ovary or placenta in pregnancy) prompted the use of the 3D organoid system in studying these complicated and highly dynamic organs. Such organoid systems accurately model the morphology and functions of the human organs making them an excellent model to study physiology and related pathologies, including malignancies and fertility. There is definitely much more to uncover and to improve in FRT-related organoids to better improve women's wellbeing and reproductive health.",
