Importantly, as we learn about the pronounced inequities and disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, largely due to comorbid conditions and socioeconomic and environmental factors [1, 2] , it is important to recognize that disparities in cancer screening, incidence, and mortality also exist among the same vulnerable populations.",

This will likely lead to delayed diagnosis, a shift to later stage disease, and as a result, increase in CRC deaths, further exacerbating existing health disparities. Recent literature based on modeling estimates predicts approximately 4,500 excess CRC deaths between 2020 and 2030 [11, 12] . CHCs are at the vanguard of addressing healthcare disparities. CRC screening is a required, reportable quality metric for federally qualified health centers in the uniform data system. Although progress in improving CRC screening has been steady, the screening rate 5 averaged 44.1% in 2018 across all CHCs in the United States [13] , much lower than the national average of 67% [14] , and substantially lower than the 2018 National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable target of 80% [15] or the Healthy People 2020's goal of 70.5% [16] . Furthermore, guideline appropriate follow-up of abnormal screening tests is a challenge for CHCs, ranging from 18% to 57% [17, 18] .",

We also present a commitment in the form of a call to action to systematically document and address the near-and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on CRC screening in CHCs and the communities they serve. to improve the quality of services offered by health centers, our group was able to collect data on the early impact of the pandemic on CRC screening. Data from interviews, along with team discussions and strategic planning assessments were used to identify COVID-19-related barriers and opportunities, with a goal of developing a preliminary plan to move forward.

Overall, most CHC systems were able to quickly establish effective telehealth services (covered under emergency plan funds). Generally, patients who can be reached and scheduled for a telehealth consultation appointment are adherent, largely eliminating missed appointments.

In our San Diego region, wide variation exists with respect to availability of screening and follow-up colonoscopy services. At least one large gastroenterology group offers full range of colonoscopies, including for screening and diagnostic test follow-up, while others are limiting these to urgent and semi-urgent cases. Novel pre-procedure strategies (such as pre-procedure testing to rule out COVID-19 infection and prioritization of urgent vs. less urgent procedures), intra-procedure strategies (careful consideration of appropriate usage of personal protective equipment), and post-procedure follow-up (to check for absence of infection), both locally developed and with input from national gastroenterology societies are challenging efficient delivery of gastrointestinal procedures, including colonoscopy [21] .",

Our team is part of the ACCSIS consortium, focused on understanding intervention strategies for 6 evidence-based CRC screening, such as mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) outreach. The consortium includes CHC partners across the United States. Drs. Nodora, Gupta, Motadel, Rodriguez, and Schultz, are also part of the FACtS study which seeks to address CRC screening inequity by identifying which CRC screening strategies and related evidence-based interventions are feasible for and likely to be sustained within a CHC setting. Although COVID-19 interrupted usual ACCSIS and FACtS research activities, it afforded a unique opportunity to investigate challenges and potential solutions for conducting COVIDadapted CRC screening. Largely due to our partnership with Health Center Partners of Southern California, a consortium of 16 health center organizations and its subsidiary Health Quality Partners of Southern California, which develops collaborative, innovative programming",

Staffing Staff reductions include: furloughs, layoffs, and reduction in hours. Telehealth services have changed staff routines. Most CHC systems were able to quickly establish effective telehealth services, covered under emergency plan funds. Physical distancing measures impact clinical staff functions. Staff anxious and fear related to contamination has been addressed through education (morning clinical team question and answer sessions), and clear procedures for use of PPE. CRC Screening Practice (workflow) Lab staff are available to process FITs at most CHCs (though CHCs are not ordering FIT tests routinely). Colonoscopies currently performed only for symptomatic/emergency patients. Community gastroenterologists inquiring about restarting CHC referrals. CRC Screening Funding Preventive services (including CRC screening) are considered elective procedures and not performed.Markers of Readiness for Reinitiating In-Person CRC ScreeningMost CMOs shared their support for re-initiating in-person CRC screening, providing the following practices were in place: Adequate PPE supply; Sufficient COVID-19 testing capacity (viral and antibody testing); Lifting stay-at-home order; Permission to do elective procedures; Sufficient staff to handle pre-visit screening and assessments.1 Patient-Level Impact Anticipated Patient Hesitancy for Preventive Services and Clinic VisitsPatients will prioritize immediate concerns over disease prevention. Patients will be hesitant to leave home.Recommended Additions/Modifications to Patient CRC Screening Materials and ProcessRecommended modifications for CRC screening due to COVID include: Use newly created COVID-19 information where applicable; Review and update of existing CRC screening guidelines accounting for COVID-19 impacts.",
