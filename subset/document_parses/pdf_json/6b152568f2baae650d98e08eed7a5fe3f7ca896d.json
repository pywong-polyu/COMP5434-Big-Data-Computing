Method 11 out of the 21 stations of the medical, surgical and orthopaedic clinical examinations needed to be converted to simulated patient (SP)-based or taskbased stations. Cases were developed based on an assessment blueprint, with consideration for SP demographics and availability of equipment. Infection control measures were strictly enforced to avoid transmission of COVID-19. Planning had to include consideration for physical distancing, cohorting and segregation of students and examiners. Student and SP anxiety had to be addressed. Results The examination was executed successfully for 300 medical students. Everyone worked professionally and dealt with the changes and precautions that were required with flexibility. Discussion An infectious disease outbreak can derail plans for major clinical examinations. Factors that facilitated a rapid and effective response included decisive leadership, open communication, willingness to collaborate, mobilising resources, adaptability and flexibility. Our school managed uncertainty by erring on the side of caution. This experience may serve as a reference for others in similar situations, particularly when COVID-19 restrictions start to be lifted.",

A new blueprint of the examination content, with SP cases replacing real patient stations, was made by a small group of stakeholders to minimise the amount of time required to reach a consensus.

We went through the SP requirements for each examination day rigorously to make sure that there was no overrepresentation of a particular demographic to ensure the highest likelihood of success in securing the number of SPs needed. We have a database of 180 SPs, who are casual employees at our institution, containing their contacts and demographic details. We used this resource to rapidly mobilise SPs via email to avail themselves on the examination dates. Once the examination cases were designed and confirmed, we went on to secure the appropriate SPs. All SP participation in this examination, as with all other SP assignments in our institution, was voluntary. SPs also give informed consent when they sign up for our programme.",

Assessment of physical examination skills and the ability to pick up abnormal signs were of concern to the FAC. Cases where abnormal signs could be realistically simulated were considered. This was the first time that we were using simulated abnormal physical signs in the evaluation of students. Successful portrayals were achieved through demonstration of the abnormal signs by the SP trainer, showing of videos and diagrams as well as practice with immediate feedback with the SP trainer and clinical faculty. Standardisation across SPs was ensured by training the SPs in a group so that they could mimic or mirror each other where necessary. Examples of cases designed are listed in table 1.",

Because our SPs are lay people, we needed to reassure them of their safety if they worked at the examination. They were informed of our infection control measures and given strict instructions to declare their own travel history and to be socially responsible in not coming to work when unwell. As the examination spanned over 1 month, increasing travel restrictions imposed by the Singapore government resulted in the need to withdraw some SPs at short notice.
