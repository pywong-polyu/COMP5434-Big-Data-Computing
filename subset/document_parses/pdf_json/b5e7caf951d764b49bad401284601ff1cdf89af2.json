In addition, this study also examines the use of social media as a moderator in the relationship between overall attitude and tourism development. A survey tool has been used to obtain data from the people of Gilgit-Baltistan. Hypotheses were examined using the structural equation method (SEM) on 417 survey responses. The findings indicated community satisfaction and an overall positive attitude to the effects of development, although a negative attitude regarding concerns about community resources. Overall, attitude has a significant impact on tourism development behavior. Additionally, the use of social media strengthens the relationship between overall attitude and behavior that favors tourism development.",

It enhances the flow of tourists and increases business and economic opportunities for the local community. Research has found that the development of road and transport networks not only improves the attractiveness of current tourism sites but also directly affect the construction of new tourist sites in that area (Kanwal et al., 2020b) . Previous studies have demonstrated a strong association between infrastructure development and the flow of visitors in an area (Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2007; Kurihara and Wu, 2016; Nazneen et al., 2019) . For example, Khadaroo and Seetanah (2007) have noted that road and transport services have a major effect on tourism activity. Kurihara and Wu (2016) studied the relationship between tourism activities and high-speed rail and found that the high-speed rail services have greatly increased the movement of visitors to China and Japan. Specifically, better roads and transportation ease travel and facilities the tourist movement within the tourism location. On the other hand, poor roads and transport facilities at the destination, demoralize the visitors and they may not want to visit the location again (Nazneen et al., 2019) .",

Gilgit-Baltistan contains many natural landscapes, including lakes, glaciers, resorts, and the highest mountain range in the world. However, with poor destination road and transportation facilities, this region is not attractive for international tourists. It is predicted that CPEC road and transport will play a significant role in the promotion of tourism activities in the area (Nazneen et al., 2019) . In addition, previous studies have examined the antecedents that influence locals' perceptions of tourism's impact, including community attachment (Gursoy et al., 2002; Moghavvemi et al., 2020) , community development (Nunkoo and Ramkissoon, 2011) , economic impact (Yoon et al., 2001) , community satisfaction (Kanwal et al., 2020b) , and its relationship with the local community; however, the impact of road and transport has received less attention. Therefore, based on the previous literature, this research investigates the relationship between the community dimension and residents' tourism development attitude in the context of road and transport infrastructure development.",

Analysis has demonstrated that projects cannot succeed without the support and commitment of local people (Pappas, 2014; Sun et al., 2020) . It is also necessary to project an optimistic image of the construction project to the local community. Scholars indicate that the use of print media or social media is beneficial in creating a positive image of construction projects among communities and individuals (Pitafi et al., 2018a (Pitafi et al., , 2020c Allauddin et al., 2020) . In addition, previous studies that have investigated the success factors of development projects-including economic benefits (Kanwal et al., 2019b) and business opportunities (Kanwal et al., 2019d; Nazneen et al., 2019) -have ignored the role of social media in constructing a positive image of projects in the mind of a local community. Social media may play a significant role in shaping a community's overall positive attitude toward tourism development. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the role of social media in order to develop a deep understanding of resident's pro-tourism development behavior.",

It also explores social media's moderating role in the relationship between overall attitudes and pro-tourism development, using data collect from the local residents of Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan. On the basis of SET, the behavior of the local population was analyzed in the light of road and transport developments. According to SET, local communities participate in and support infrastructure projects based on an exchange of resources. The outcomes of this study have several theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it contributes to the literature on tourism by investigating the tourism development behavior of local community members in the context of road and transport development. Secondly, we used social media as a moderator in the relationship between overall attitude and pro-tourism development, as research suggests that social media use may create a positive image for CPEC among the local community (Allauddin et al., 2020; Kanwal et al., 2020b) . Thirdly, the findings here can help tourism development authorities as well as CPEC to plan future polices that keep local community perceptions in mind.",

Several scholars have employed SET and investigated local residents' reactions to tourism development (Perdue et al., 1990; Yoon et al., 2001; Kanwal et al., 2020a) . Using SET, Kanwal et al. (2020a) identified a substantial relationship between benefits to the local community and local support in the context of CPEC. Perdue et al. (1995) also employed SET to examine local community support for tourism development. Similarly, Yoon et al. (2001) explored the benefits of tourism and support for further development and found a significant relationship. The key tenet of SET is that people will participate in an interaction if they believe that they are going to gain profit without incurring unacceptable cost. If they believe that the benefits are greater than the costs, they will likely be involved in the exchange and, therefore, promote more development in their communities.",

Scholars of tourism have recognized that economic impacts may change the perception and attitude of community members toward tourism development (Zhang et al., 2020) . Local communities are key stakeholders who actively determine the costs and benefits of tourism for their communities and themselves (Stylidis and Terzidou, 2014; Nunkoo and Gursoy, 2016) . For example, Nunkoo and So (2016) observed that the personal benefits of tourism development could affect community members' perceptions of its costs and benefits.

Social media can help create a significant picture of society, products, and this construction initiative Wei et al., 2020) , strengthening a positive image of tourism development in the mind of the local community. Therefore, we use social media as a moderator in the relationship between residents' overall attitude and pro-tourism behavior. Due to the rapid development of the Chinese economy and the success of their infrastructure projects, CPEC is constantly discussed in national/international media reports; these discussions may continuously shape local residents' overall attitude. While the level of awareness of ordinary people is unknown, social media can provide a picture of tourism development that can be evaluated (Kakar and Khan, 2020) . This research has especially considered some aspects of politics where the image of CPEC is less positive and poses some important concerns in the minds of local residents. The persistence and increased use of social media may change the overall attitude of the local community, cultivating more support for tourism development.",

Local communities are a major stakeholder in the success of tourism development, so it is essential that they develop a positive perception of tourism (Saad et al., 2020) . Lack of coordination and collaboration will lead to further delays and challenges in the implementation of the CPEC development project while the use of social media can enhance its overall support within local communities (Surahio et al., 2022) .

A survey method also aids an understanding of the behavior of constructs. The focus community of this research is the citizens of Gilgit-Baltistan, the CPEC tourism center and gateway. The author used English to prepare the questionnaire because the academic language of Pakistan is English. We aided participants if they had difficulty in interpreting the questions. The survey was divided into two sections. The first consisted of demographic information, along with a cover letter which indicated the overall purpose of the research and the concepts of the measurement items. The second section comprised the items of all the constructions. This research chose educated participants because illiterate people may not have enough knowledge of CPEC. It was a convenient sampling process since the educated population is easily reached by this method. The authors verified the consistency and clarity of the questionnaire in a number of ways. The complete questionnaire was firstly verified by a professor of English for errors in language. The contents of the survey items were then examined by five professors from the School of Economics and Management. Following their suggestions, the authors significantly modified the content of the questionnaire. Finally, ethical committee of university also has approved the objective of this study. In addition, authors has followed the ethical guidelines of Zhejiang Yuexiu University; Shaoxing, Zhejiang China and Hefei University of Technology China. This study has approved by the ethical committee of Zhejiang Yuexiu University; Shaoxing, Zhejiang China and Hefei University of Technology China. The ethical committee also has waved the consent of this study. A pilot study was performed on 51 respondents: the findings were considered satisfactory, with a Cronbach's alpha higher than 0.700 for each construct, which encouraged us to proceed. From August to November 2019, 600 hard-copy questionnaires were distributed across Gilgit-Baltistan. The authors visited educational institutions (schools/colleges/universities), government offices, industry firms, restaurants, and CPEC construction sites for data collection purposes. Over these four months, 500 questionnaires were received with a response rate of 83.33%. 83 responses were omitted from the final dataset because they were incorrectly completed or because several of the entries were blank; the remaining 417 relevant responses were used for the final study. The overall information from the participants is in Table 1 . The participants comprised 270 males (64.70%) and 147 females (35.30%). The age range of the respondents was over 20 years of age, since those below 20 may not be able to accurately forecast the benefits of CPEC infrastructure.",

SPSS is an advanced statistical software tool, and use to analyze data in order to address complicated business and research challenges in a user-friendly environment (Pitafi and Ren, 2021) . In this study, the descriptive statistics were computed using SPSS software. In addition, scholars also suggests AMOS software for obtaining confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and SEM (Nachtigall et al., 2003) . AMOS also has a graphical user interface that allows users to easily compute path diagrams, estimate parameters, and compute model fit values (Byrne, 2013) . The reliability of the research model was analyzed using Cronbach's alpha (CA), composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE). CA is acceptable when it has a value higher than 0.700 (Fornell and Larcker, 1981) . The results in Table 2 confirm that all constructs have CA values ranging from (0.742-0.891), thus higher than 0.700. CR is appropriate if the value is greater than 0.700. Table 2 shows that all constructs have CR values of (0.816-0.916), higher than 0.700. Similarly, AVE is adequate with values higher than 0.500; the table indicates AVE scores which range from (0.566-0.661) (Hinkin, 1998) . Additionally, the convergent validity model was evaluated using standard factor loading. The literature recommends that standard factor loading of all constructs should be higher than 0.600 for the acceptable convergent validity of the research model. Table 2 indicates that all items of all constructs have a loading higher than the minimum threshold value of 0.600, ranging from (0.621-0.946) (Fornell and Larcker, 1981) . Hence, the proposed conceptual model possesses an acceptable level of reliability and convergent validity.",

The literature recommends several strategies to solve potential CMB (Pavlou and El Sawy, 2006; Podsakoff et al., 2012) . Therefore, the author first utilized some technological remedies, including the confidentiality of the responses, to resolve the potential problem of CMB. For example, scholars have suggested that the anonymity of responses could help to solve the potential problem of CMB. The cover letter with the surveys did state that the participants' responses would remain confidential and that their feedback would only be used for research purposes. Secondly, the author applied some statistical methods to address the likelihood of CMB issue in the dataset. For example, Liang et al. (2007) suggested a procedure for analysis of CMB problems. Following this procedure, the results of the analysis indicated that the substantive factor had a score of 65.5% of the variance, whereas the method factor had a score of 1.3% of the variance, which indicates no possibility of a CMB problem in the current study. In addition, the results of Table 3 revealed that all variables had co-relation values of less than 0,600 (Pavlou and El Sawy, 2006) , suggesting that CMB did not occur in the sample. Finally, the author also applied the variance inflation factor (VIF) test; the results revealed that VIF values were below the prescribed value of 3.3 (Pitafi et al., 2020c) . This suggests that CMB does not pose a serious problem to the data set. Together, all the facts indicated that there was no CMB issue in the current data.",

The findings show that community resource concerns a have negative effect on overall attitude (B = \u22120.280, t = \u22125.44, p < 0.001), while community satisfaction (B = 0.212, t = 4.817, p < 0.001) and community development (B = 0.161, t = 3.300, p < 0.001) have a positive effect on overall attitude; these, respectively, support H1a, H1b, and H1c. Similarly, overall attitude has significant effect on tourism development behavior (B = 0.178, t = 4.347, p < 0.001), so H2 is validated. Therefore, H1a, H1b, H1c, and H2 are supported by current data since all observations imply that beta values are in the suggested range, t > 1.64, and p values are less than 0.05. Furthermore, the findings indicate that all the control variables were insignificant.",

In addition, a graphical approach was applied (Aiken et al., 1991) to understand the moderating role of social media use. Figure 3 indicates that social media use heightens the significant relationship between overall attitude and tourism development behavior. As verified in Figure 3 , the moderating influence of social media usage on the link between overall attitude and tourism development was displayed with standard deviation (+ 1SD/\u22121SD) to indicate the influence of a high versus low degree of each.",

By applying SET, we have examined the impact of the community dimension on tourism development behavior through local residents' overall attitude in the context of road and transport construction. CPEC, under construction in Pakistan, connects Gwadar in Baluchistan, Pakistan to Kashgar, China through the Gilgit-Baltistan region in Pakistan. This region is a gateway of CPEC and full of natural scenery (Nazneen et al., 2020) . However, due to poor road and transportation infrastructure and a lack of hospitality facilities, tourism activities in this area are limited . Hence, it is expected that, with the construction of road and transport infrastructure under the CPEC framework, Gilgit Baltistan will become a tourism hub in the near future. The current dataset supports the proposed hypotheses of this study, suggesting that locals in Gilgit Baltistan have a positive attitude toward tourism because the local community's income is dependent on tourism activities. Specifically, the findings indicate that community resource concerns have a negative impact on the local community's overall attitude, supporting H1a. Previous studies indicate that locals are more concerned about their resources, culture, historical places, and living standards . The CPEC project is in its development stage and requires more resources from the local community; this may have a negative impact on locals' overall attitude. Previous studies have also suggested similar results (Pappas, 2014; Kanwal et al., 2019b) ; for example, Nazneen et al. (2020) found that the perceived cost of tourism development has a negative impact on overall support for further development. In Hypothesis 1b, we suggested that local community satisfaction has a significant effect on overall attitude. The conclusions of this hypothesis are confirmed by the present research, which also relates to previous studies (Allauddin et al., 2020; Kanwal et al., 2020a) . Accordingly, Kanwal et al. (2020b) observed that the personal benefit of road and transport projects had a significant impact on satisfaction, which subsequently enhanced the positive attitude of the local population. Results also indicated that community development with the construction of road and transport has a significant impact on overall attitude; H1c is also validated. Prior studies have also suggested similar results (Saad et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . In addition, the study's results also indicated that overall attitude has a significant impact on pro-tourism development behavior, so H2 is validated by the current dataset. Overall, the findings of this study reveal that SET is a reasonable theory for examining the pro-tourism development behavior of local communities.",

Past studies indicate that social media use may convey a positive image of CPEC in Pakistan (Allauddin et al., 2020) . The publicity on social media related to tourism development from CPEC is beneficial for constructing a positive picture of tourism development. For example, social media can highlight several benefits of tourism development, including infrastructure development, business opportunities, community development, health centers, and economic opportunities. These help eliminate the negative attitudes of the local community toward tourism development.",

It is well-known that the construction of mega-projects requires local resources which may be perceived negatively by the local community (Pappas, 2014) . For example, road and transport construction can destroy natural scenery, rivers, and historical sites, and may have a negative impact on local traditions (Kanwal et al., 2020b; Sun et al., 2020) ; therefore, alternative routes should be constructed to avoid damaging local property. Hence, CPEC officials should involve the local community in the construction phase, allocate some specific employment quotas, establish some tourism-specific development institutes, and also provide loan facilities to locals that can enable them to start their own tourism business. For example, a local community may establish some restaurants, travel agencies, and local transportation that helps to construct a positive image of CPEC. Secondly, the results indicate that community satisfaction and development have a significant impact on the local community's overall attitude. These findings confirm that the local community can understand that road and transport construction can benefits them in many ways. For example, it improves the scenic value, business and education in the region (Nazneen et al., 2019) . Additionally, locals assume that the construction of roads and transport enhances the flow of tourists and increases economic opportunities, further leading to an overall positive attitude.",

In the early stage of tourism development, residents may tolerate the costs of tourism (concerns about community resources) to obtain benefits from tourism development. Existing tourism studies related to CPEC focuses on economic sustainability but do not focus on the community dimension. The findings of this study indicate that perceptions of each of the three dimensions of community impact have distinct effects on overall attitude. Drawing on SET, this study concluded that the development of CPEC road and transport networks has a direct impact on the overall attitude of the local population. The findings of this study have validated all the proposed hypotheses, demonstrating that residents have an overall positive attitude toward tourism development. Its results indicate that local community development and satisfaction regarding infrastructure development have a significant impact on overall attitude. However, community resource concerns indicate a negative impact on the local community's overall attitude. Overall attitude also has a positive impact on protourism development behavior. In addition, social media use strengthens the relationship between overall attitude and resident's tourism development behavior. The use of social media has been observed to be a significant enabler, presenting a favorable image of tourism development; it could thus be used to shape the positive image of tourism development. The effect of social media on tourism development is thus important for changing the overall attitude of the local population.",
