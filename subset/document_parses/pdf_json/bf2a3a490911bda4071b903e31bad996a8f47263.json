Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of the pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US, and show that both distributions follow a truncated power-law over five orders of magnitude. We are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual-scale process: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and the small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is determined by the ratio of large-scale to smallscale growth rates. We confirm this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model, describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak. Assessing how well a simple dual-scale model predicts the early spread of epidemics, despite the huge contrasts between countries, could help identify critical temporal and spatial scales of response in which to mitigate future epidemic threats. * blasius@icbm.de; http://staff.uol.de/bernd.blasius",

For these aims spatially explicit models have been developed that leverage information on the topology of transport networks. For example, the global network of cargo ship movements [20] was used to model the dispersal of invasive species [34] . Similarly for infectious diseases, in a pioneering study, the 2003 spread of SARS in the global aviation network [38] was modeled [19] . Based on these approaches, conceptual frameworks have been developed to estimate epidemic arrival times as effective distances [8] . At the same time, these models have been refined to highly detailed simulation frameworks for predicting the spread of disease and are able to include factors such as vaccination, multiple susceptibility classes, seasonal forcing, and the stochastic movement of individual agents [12, 40] . Reacting rapidly to the emergent pandemic, spatial epidemiological models have been developed to describe and anticipate the spread of COVID-19 [2, 9, 15, 30] . These models allow to predict the incidence of the epidemics in a spatial population through time, permitting to study the impact of travel restrictions and other control measures.",

Here, we provide a conceptual dualscale model that explains the emergence of the power-law distribution by the 'superposition' of two concurrent processes: large-scale spread of the virus between countries and smallscale snowballing of case numbers within each country. Assuming exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent is simply determined by the ratio of large-scale to smallscale growth rates. We confirm this theory in numerical simulations in a simple metapopulation model, describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries.",

Additionally, the estimated critical exponents exponents are decaying in time (Fig. 3d inset) , similar to that of the empirical data (Fig. 2b inset) . Thus, the first sign that the outbreak has reached most countries in the network is the reduction in the scaling range and a simultaneous broadening of the case distribution. Eventually, in the limit of large time, when the epidemic has come to an end in every country, scaling is lost and the distribution of cases must converge towards a delta function P (n) = \u03b4(n \u2212 f N pop ), with f the fraction of susceptible out of a population of N pop individuals in a country that will be infected (or it would approach the country size distribution in a meta-population with heterogeneously distributed country sizes). Interestingly, in our numerical simulations, we still obtained power-law distribution when the contact rate \u03b2 was set to a large value, so that the dynamics within a country rapidly reach a stationary state.

This is shown in the Appendix Fig. 7 This inequality can also be measured by the Gini-coefficient G [16] , which ranges between G = 0 for perfect equality, i.e., all countries having the same number of cases, and G = 1, corresponding to maximal inequality, where all cases appear in a single country. For the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases on March 22 (Fig. 1a,b) we obtain a Gini- The emergence of power-law distributions with a small critical exponent and the associated inequality of the distribution, with Gini coefficients close to one is also observed in the developed meta-population model. Consequently, also in the model case numbers are mostly concentrated in a few countries. In the simulations, these epicenters of the pandemic, i.e., the countries with most cases, are always the countries in which the diseases originated or which were first invaded by the virus. In other words, the prevalence rank order among countries remains unchanged during the course of the pandemic. This is akin to the \"rich-get-richer process\" or \"first-mover-advantage\" [28, 35] , a well-studied process to generate power-law distributions.

The estimated distribution roughly follows a straight line on the double-logarithmic plot with equally spaced bins. Note, that even though only 200 random numbers were drawn, the estimated probabilities vary over many orders of magnitude (which is numerically possible since in order to compute the probability distribution, the histogram counts are divided by the variable bin sizes). Log-likelihood estimation of critical exponent (Methods) yields\u03bc = 1.21 \u00b1 0.01 in good agreement with the actually used exponent. In contrast, the estimator for an unbound power-law, Eq. (11), yield\u015d \u00b5 = 1.28 \u00b1 0.01, strongly overestimating the true exponent. The estimation by a regression line, yielding \u00b5 = 1.24, also is slightly too large.

On January 22, the first entry in the database, six countries (China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, US) were already invaded by the virus. From this day, within roughly two months the pandemic spread to nearly every country in the world. Interestingly, the invasion speed was not constant. Instead Fig. 2b clearly indicates two broad modes in the arrival time distribution. A first group of countries was invaded by the disease in the end of January. In the first three weeks of February nearly no new arrivals were reported. Starting from February 24, a second wave of invasions appeared which lasted until end of March, after which the number of new arrivals began to fall again, probably reflecting the fact that the pandemic had reached basically all countries of the world.

Furthermore, most countries were invaded multiple times, leading to different epidemic foci within countries.Neglecting all these observations, for the sake of argument, let us assume an average doubling time of case numbers of T 1/2 = 3.5 d in all countries, yielding an exponential growth rate of r = log(2)/T 1/2 = 0.2 d \u22121 and a maximal case number of n max = e 0.2 * 60 = 1.6 \u00b7 10 5 after 60 days.

Most notably, the small values of the estimated critical power-law exponents are related to the strong inequality of case numbers that was frequently observed all over the world in the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Following a power law distribution means that this pattern prevails even as numbers grew and the scale of infection expanded globally. In particular, during the course of the pandemic, most cases were reported to have occurred in a few countries, sometimes even a single country -the so-called epicenters of the pandemic. The distribution of cases within countries followed a similar pattern. Often COVID-19 was peaking in a few localized foci (local regions or cities), while other parts of the country at the same time had experienced only a moderate number of cases. Our theory provides a mechanistic explanation why this might have been the case.",

Further uncertainties arise because the criteria by which a person is classified as active case (and even more so for being classified as recovered) vary between countries and not uncommonly have been modified during the course of the pandemic within a country.Remarkably, we obtained power-law distributions in the absolute number of cases in each country. At first guess, one might have expected such scaling only after case numbers have been normalized by population sizes. Our preliminary investigations show that such normalized case numbers become even more unequally distributed, with even smaller estimated values of the critical exponent, and the distributed values do not line-up any more so well on a straight line on a double logarithmic plot. Thus 'folding' the distribution of population sizes over the COVID-19 case distribution does not flatten, but rather tends to further increase, the inequality of the resulting distribution. This indicates that absolute (non-normalized) case numbers may be the natural variables to describe the patterns of the pandemic in its initial stage. In all likelihood, the role of country sizes and population numbers will become increasingly important with the further spread of the pandemic.We have shown that a simple conceptual model yields an accurate description of the COVID-19 prevalence distribution in the initial phase of the pandemic. This is remarkable in that many important epidemiological aspects of the spreading process are not captured by the model. Most notably, the model does not neither take into account variability in country sizes, population numbers, or testing rates, heterogeneity of intra-and inter-country connectivity, as well as the corresponding changes due to social distancing, lock-down measures, closing of airline connections and shut-down of borders. These simplifications leave much room for future investigations and model improvements. Obvious model improvements would be to consider a meta-population with heterogeneously distributed country sizes or to make the initial number of infected individuals a random number, as would be a better description of what happened in many countries.",

Suppose a virus that is spreading in an all-to-all, or randomly coupled, network of a number of N \u00b7 N pop individuals. If we would artificially subdivide individuals into a small number N of classes (or countries), at the time point when the disease has spread to all countries, within each country we would still have only a few cases (of the order of N N pop ). Thus, the assumed simultaneous spread on both spatial scales requires a real physical separation in the network structure. It would be an interesting perspective for future research to study the spread in multi-scale hierarchies or in more realistic models of interconnected societies. One important model application would be the simulation of interim COVID-19 lockdown or containment measures, as were introduced in many countries in the world in March and April 2020. Such measures might inhibit the increase of case numbers within local regions (the small-scale part of our theory) but they would not necessarily suppress also the largescale diffusion of infections across regions. Thus, under the guise of suppressed case numbers during the mitigation period there could be a dangerous \"invisible\" homogenization in the spatial distribution of the virus. This would have tremendous implications in a scenario",

            "text": "describe the spatio-temporal evolution of epidemic prevalence during the course of a pandemic we developed a conceptual dual-scale meta-population model. The large-scale model component allows to simulate the spread of the virus in a network of N interconnected countries. The state of a country is given as a Boolean value, being either invaded by the virus or non-invaded. The model starts with a single invaded country. The geographic spread runs in discrete time, each step corresponding to one day of the time-continuous small-scale model. In each time step, every non-invaded country becomes infected by an invaded country with probability p. Thus, if at time t a number of m countries have already been invaded, the probability for a non-invaded country to receive the virus in this time step equals 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) m . As soon as a country has been invaded by the virus in this process, the small-scale model for this country is initiated. Parameter values were taken as follows: number of countries N = 200 and invasion probability p = 6 \u00b7 10 \u22124 . The small-scale model is time-continuous and deterministically describes the epidemic dynamics within a country. The model determines the time course of susceptible S, infected I, recovered R, and dead D from a standard SIR-model [21, 22] S = \u2212\u03b2 S N pop I,\u0130 = \u03b2 S N pop I \u2212 \u03b3I,\u1e58 = (1 \u2212 m)\u03b3I,\u1e0a = m\u03b3I.",

            "text": "In the small-scale model countries are simulated independently from each other and are only coupled by the unique invasion event for each country, which starts the epidemic growth in that country with initial values S(0) = 5 \u00b7 10 7 , I(0) = 1 and R(0) = D(0) = 0. All infection state variables in a country are zero before invasion by the virus, I = R = D = 0. The resulting well-known SIR-dynamics in a single country is shown in the Appendix Fig. 6. With the chosen parameterization, it takes roughly 80 days until the epidemic peak is reached. After this time, the assumption of an exponential increase, Eq. (3), breaks down. Parameter values were taken as follows: country population size N pop = 5 \u00b7 10 7 , case fatality rate m = 0.01, infectious period 1/\u03b3 = 6d, and contact rate \u03b2 = 0.4d \u22121 . This yields a growth rate r = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 = 0.23d \u22121 , corresponding to a doubling time of T 1,2 = log(2)/r = 3d and a basic reproduction number R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3 = 2.4.
