We investigated the psychometric validation of the Arabic version of the PAQ-C in students in Saudi Arabia. The students (n = 327, age = 8-14 years) of six primary schools in the Majmaah region participated in the study. Participants completed the PAQ-C, and their demographics were recorded. The PAQ-C scores satisfied the following factor analysis assumptions: diagonal elements of the anti-image correlation matrix (>0.5), Bartlett's test of sphericity (p < 0.001), determinant (>0.00001), Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test of sampling adequacy (>0.8), and communality (all values > 0.2). Exploratory factor analysis results were inconclusive, with two measures favoring a 2-factor solution (Kaiser's criteria (Eigenvalue \u2265 1), and cumulative variance rule (>40%)); whereas, the scree test and the Monte Carlo parallel analysis favored a 1-factor structure. The confirmatory factor analysis favored a 1-factor solution: highest CFI, lowest RMSEA, non-significant \u03c7 2 statistics, and lowest \u03c7 2 /df. The values of item-total correlation, corrected item-total correlation, and Cronbach's alpha if an item was deleted, ranged from 0.20-0.57, 0.42-0.64, and 0.70-0.75, respectively. The PAQ-C showed a Cronbach's alpha of 0.74. A 1-factor structure of the Arabic version of the PAQ-C had adequate psychometric validity in schoolchildren in Saudi Arabia.

As per a report issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), 60% of the global population is physically inactive; thus, a sedentary lifestyle emerges as a menace to global health (World Health Organization, 2003) . A recent systematic review summarizing 18 articles published between 2007 and 2017, found that physical inactivity was highly prevalent among Saudi adolescents (Alasqah et al., 2021) . Another systematic review summarized that the majority of children and youth in Saudi Arabia did not meet the criteria for moderate to vigorous physical activity. Physical inactivity is more prevalent in Saudi females, and the problem starts in the early school years (Al-Hazzaa, 2018) .",

Regular physical activity in childhood promotes optimal body mass index (BMI), cardiopulmonary fitness, and psychosocial wellbeing (Denton et al., 2013; Tomson et al., 2003; Suter & Hawes, 1993) . A valid and reliable assessment of physical activity is imperative to investigate the efficacy of measures, enhance physical activity, and track the related health benefits (Platat & Jarrar, 2012) . Physical activity can be determined both by objective means, such as indirect calorimetry and accelerometry-based assessments, or subjectively, by using a self-report questionnaire. Indirect calorimetry delivers a precise measure of physical activity, but due to its invasive nature, it is unfeasible for use in field-based studies involving larger populations (Wang et al., 2016) .",

On the other hand, subjective measures, for example, self-reported questionnaires, are inexpensive, easy to administer, and enable the collection of contextual details of physical activities that cannot be obtained through objective measures.

            "text": "Intentions may reveal motivation, and help determine social actions (Terry & O'Leary, 1995) . Constructs based on the self-determination theory (SDT) have been used to measure motivation to perform physical activity in various age groups (Sebire et al., 2013) . Different dimensions of motivation as envisaged in the SDT such as personal, psychosocial, and environmental aspects are relevant for physical activity measurements (Plotnikoff et al., 2013) . Various aspects of autonomous intention including intentions to exercise, and consistency between intentions to exercise are associated with actual exercising during leisure time (Chatzisarantis, Biddle & Meek, 1997) . In summary, dimensions of measures to assess motivation to perform physical activity are determined by SDT theory, many of these autonomous dimensions of motivation are related to physical activity. Children's physical activity is usually irregular and difficult for them to recall in terminologies used in self-reported questionnaires, such as intensity, duration, and frequency (Baquet et al., 2007; Hussey, Bell & Gormley, 2007) . Hence, questionnaires meant to assess children's physical activity should be constructed to reduce the intellectual, recall, and calculation demands to a justifiable level (Kremers et al., 2005) . The availability of a valid and reliable subjective assessment method of physical activity remains a challenge in Saudi Arabia. This is due to the lack of availability of culturally adapted physical activity questionnaires in the Arabic language (Hussey, Bell & Gormley, 2007) . The majority of the physical activity studies involving children in Saudi Arabia either utilized the English questionnaire or translated a general physical activity questionnaire, which is not specific for children (Tomson et al., 2003; Suter & Hawes, 1993; Wang et al., 2016; Corder, Brage & Ekelund, 2007) . Hence, it is crucial to develop a culturally adaptable physical activity questionnaire for children in the Arabic language.",

The PAQ-C employs memory cues to facilitate the participant's recollection of their physical activities, which makes the PAQ-C an apt tool to use with children (Thomas & Upton, 2014) . The psychometric properties of the PAQ-C were investigated among various English populations, including Canadian, British, Euro-American, and African-American children (Thomas & Upton, 2014; Janz et al., 2008; Moore et al., 2007) . The results of these studies reported acceptable to good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, sensitivity to distinguish gender-related variations, convergent validity, and construct validity (Crocker et al., 1997; Kowalski, Crocker & Faulkner, 1997) . Additionally, the investigators reported normal scale distribution and group mean-variance demonstrating the instruments' ability to determine various levels of physical activities (Crocker et al., 1997; Kowalski, Crocker & Faulkner, 1997) .",

Moreover, the factor construct of the PAQ-C was also reported to differ according to the population studied (Thomas & Upton, 2014) . The studies among Italian, United States and Turkish children reported a 2-factor model, whereas, the research among Chinese and Czech children determined a 1-factor model (Wang et al., 2016; Thomas & Upton, 2014; Gobbi et al., 2016; Erdim, Erg\u00fcn & Ku\u011fuo\u011flu, 2019; Cuberek, Jan\u00edkov\u00e1 & Dygrtfytfn, 2021) . Hence, it is crucial to consider factors such as ethnicity, race, culture, and language of the target population before the translation of the PAQ-C. We hypothesized that the Arabic version of the PAQ-C will exhibit adequate reliability, internal homogeneity, and favorable item analysis. Additionally, we hypothesized that the factor structure validated previously in the Asian population may be valid for the Arabic version of the PAQ-C in a sample of Saudi school children. Therefore, we performed an Arabic translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and psychometric validation in a sample of school-aged children in Saudi Arabia.",

We determined the sample size in this study using the criteria given by MacCallum for factor analysis (MacCallum et al., 1999) . As the study published by Wang et al. (2016) is close concerning ethnicities, therefore, we used the factor loading values published in their article to determine the sample size. We used these factor loading values in the Wang et al. (2016) study to calculate communality for all the PAQ-C items using the formula given in Yong, and Pearce's article (Yong & Pearce, 2013) . The average factor loading was 0.56 implying a good level of correlations between measured variables, i.e., item scores, and the factor score (Comrey & Lee, 2013) . However, the calculated value of average communality was lower, i.e., 0.36. Wang et al. (2016) found a 1-factor solution for the PAQ-C in children in Hong Kong, therefore, the number of determinants was high, i.e., nine items for 1 factor. In summary, evidence from a moderate average factor loading, low average communality, and high over-determination (i.e., number of items per factor), a sample size of a little over 100 would be adequate for a study performing either EFA or CFA only. As, we intended to perform both EFA and CFA, as well as taking into account the usual attrition rate, a sample size of a little over 300 was expected to be appropriate (MacCallum et al., 1999; Manzar, Jahrami & Bahammam, 2021) .",

The first item of the PAQ-C consists of 22 common sports and leisure activities for which the participants select the score based on the frequency of the activity performed during the preceding seven days on a five-point rating scale (1 = no activity at all, 2 = 1-2 times, 3 = 3-4 times, 4 = 5-6 times and 5 = 7 times or more), after which a mean composite score was calculated (Kowalski, Crocker & Donen, 2004) . The remaining eight items address physical activities performed during the day, for example, physical education classes, recess time, lunchtime, as well as afterschool activities on weekday evenings and weekends, and finally a summary for all days of the week. The mean score of the first nine items is the summary score of the PAQ-C. The tenth item inquires about any unusual circumstances (e.g., sickness) that affected/prevented the child's physical activity in the seven days preceding the assessment (Kowalski, Crocker & Donen, 2004) .",

Among the activities listed in item 1, the activities that are not typically performed in Arabian countries (e.g., rowing, American football, street hockey, floor hockey, cross-country skiing, and ice hockey) were deleted based on the opinions of the expert panel. Additionally, physical activities such as in-line skating, baseball, soccer, and ice skating were substituted with roller skating, tennis, football, karate, and other martial arts, respectively. As a result of these changes, item 1 of the Arabic version of PAQ-C consists of a list of 16 physical activities instead of 22 activities, as in the original PAQ-C. A sample of 15 school children between the ages of 8 and 14 participated in the pilot study to check the comprehensibility of the Arabic version of the PAQ-C. The bilingual translators, expert panel members, and participants of the pilot study agreed that the words used in the translated version of the PAQ-C were simple and easy to understand for the children of the target age group.",

Participants' characteristics and preliminary item analysis were assessed by measures of descriptive statistics and distribution indices. Internal homogeneity and reliability were determined by Spearman's correlation test and Cronbach's alpha. Factor analysis was performed on two sub-samples. The two sub-samples were split randomly using the coin method (heads and tails). Principal axis factoring was selected in the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) because, in the EFA sub-sample (n = 190), some items were not normally distributed as determined by the criteria of the absolute z-score value of skewness and kurtosis (3.29) (Kim, 2013) . The Promax rotation method was used because factors were expected to be correlated (Erdim, Erg\u00fcn & Ku\u011fuo\u011flu, 2019) . A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was done on a second sub-sample (randomly split) using maximum likelihood extraction. Bollen-Stine bootstrapping was employed to manage deviations from multivariate normality. Inter-factor correlations (IFC), standardized factor loadings, and multiple fit indices from different categories were estimated. A comparative CFA was performed on the factor structures shown by the EFA and those reported in the previous studies (Gobbi et al., 2016; Erdim, Erg\u00fcn & Ku\u011fuo\u011flu, 2019) . A value of 0.90 and above for the comparative fit index (CFI) and goodness of fit index (GFI) indicated adequate validity (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Brewer & Jones, 2002; Butrague\u00f1o & Peinado, 2014; Sim\u00f3n, Fernandez & Contreras, 2017; Otero-Saborido, Gonz\u00e1lez-Jurado & Lluch, 2012; Manzar et al., 2018) . A value of 0.08 or less for the root mean square residual (RMR) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) implied a good fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Manzar et al., 2018) . A non-significant chi-square test and \u03c7 2 /df of less than 3 indicated a good fit as well (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Manzar et al., 2018) .",

The PAQ-C scores in both sub-samples fulfilled the criteria of all six measures, namely, all the diagonal elements in the anti-image correlation matrix were more than 0.5 (in fact, the least observed value was 0.65) (Manzar et al., 2018; Child, 2006) ; the significant values of Bartlett's test of sphericity implied that there was a linear relationship between PAQ-C items, and the absence of inter-item correlation coefficients with the absolute value r = 1 was also noted, which implies an absence of singularity (Manzar et al., 2018; Child, 2006) ; there was no major concern of multicollinearity bias, as established by the determinant's value of more than 0.00001 (Manzar et al., 2018; Child, 2006) ; and there was a meritorious level of shared variance among the PAQ-C item scores, as evidenced by a KMO value of 0.82 and above for both the sub-samples (see Tables 2-3 ) (Manzar et al., 2018; Field, 2013; Child, 2006) .

In this study, for the first factor, the value of the actual Eigenvalue (3.21) was more than the 95 th percentile of the random ordered Eigenvalue (1.46) in PCA principal component analysis (Table 5 , Fig. 1 ) (O'Connor, 2000; Manzar et al., 2018; Brown, 2015; Manzar et al., 2016) .

The average factor loadings in the two sub-samples were 0.52, and 0.60, implying good to very good levels of correlations between measured variables, i.e., item scores, and the factor score (Comrey & Lee, 2013) . Moreover, a unidimensional factor structure of the PAQ-C (Arabic) was found valid, indicating a very high over-determination score (more number of items/indicators for each factor) (MacCallum et al., 1999) . Therefore, combining all the pieces of evidence, and their interpretation regarding adequate sample size, sample sizes of 100 is adequate. Therefore, the sizes of the two sub-samples in this study, which comprised 137, and 190 Arabic-speaking school-aged children were adequate (MacCallum et al., 1999; Manzar, Jahrami & Bahammam, 2021) . A direct comparison with most of the previous studies concerning values of measures that indicate the applicability of factorial validity was not possible because these studies did not report values of many of these measures. Three of the previous studies on the factor analysis of the PAQ-C did not report values of the diagonal element of the anti-image matrix, Bartlett's test of sphericity, determinant, KMO test of sampling adequacy, and communality (Wang et al., 2016; Thomas & Upton, 2014; Gobbi et al., 2016) . A recent systematic review, and meta-analysis on the factorial validity of a widely used questionnaire tool, stressed the importance of verifying sample size adequacy using multiple measures (Manzar, Jahrami & Bahammam, 2021 give statistical evidence about the singularity, multicollinearity, correlations between items, shared variance, and correlations between items and factor scores. Therefore, in the absence of values of these measures, it is practically difficult to draw inferences from the factorial validity outcome of the previous studies (Wang et al., 2016; Thomas & Upton, 2014; Gobbi et al., 2016; Manzar, Jahrami & Bahammam, 2021; Manzar et al., 2018) .",

The inferences derived from EFA in previous studies may contain biases because of procedural issues such as the non-application of a robust measure of factor retention (Wang et al., 2016; Thomas & Upton, 2014; Gobbi et al., 2016; Erdim, Erg\u00fcn & Ku\u011fuo\u011flu, 2019; Cuberek, Jan\u00edkov\u00e1 & Dygrtfytfn, 2021; Manzar et al., 2018; Brown, 2015) . Three previous studies reported a two-factor structure based on two-factor retention criteria, namely, eigenvalue > 1 and cumulative variance rule in EFA (Tomson et al., 2003; Gobbi et al., 2016; Erdim, Erg\u00fcn & Ku\u011fuo\u011flu, 2019) . Interestingly, in this study, a 2-factor structure was favored by two measures (eigenvalue > 1, and cumulative variance rule) of factor retention as well. However, the robust measure of the parallel analysis (Monte Carlo), and the Screen test indicated a 1-factor structure (Manzar et al., 2018; Brown, 2015) . Wang et al. (2016) did not perform EFA, so they did not report values of factor retention measures used in EFA. Moreover, neither they did perform comparative CFA, nor did they justify the selection of a single factor model based on theoretical construct (Wang et al., 2016) . In this study, most of the PAQ-C item scores satisfied the criteria for univariate distribution, but a test of multivariate normality was not performed due to software limitations. Therefore, we used the principal axis factoring extraction method in EFA (Costello & Osborne, 2005) .",

Fit indices of all models examined in the comparative CFA were nearly similar. Therefore, fit indices did not indicate which model has the best fit. To manage the problem of IFC greater than one for the two models with two factors, Bollen-Stine bootstrapping with 1,000 iterations was attempted to smoothen out multivariate non-normality (Gobbi et al., 2016; Erdim, Erg\u00fcn & Ku\u011fuo\u011flu, 2019; Manzar et al., 2016; Bollen & Stine, 1992) . However, AMOS did not yield a solution but indicated an error message that the variances for one of the factors failed to be positive. Therefore, these 2-factor models were deemed inadmissible solutions (Gobbi et al., 2016; Erdim, Erg\u00fcn & Ku\u011fuo\u011flu, 2019) . This left only two prospective solutions: a 1-factor model with all items and a 1-factor model after deleting items with low factor loadings. However, the model with deleted items did not have significantly better fit indices. Moreover, the PAQ-C item measuring activity during physical education classes, i.e., the items with the low factor loading in this study showed optimum values for other measures, such as item-total correlations, corrected-item total correlations, and Cronbach's alpha if item deleted. Taking all these into account, i.e., non-significant improvement in psychometric characteristics, along with the loss of information associated with the deletion of an item, a 1-factor solution with all the items of the original PAQ-C was found to be the most favored solution (Albougami & Manzar, 2019) .",

            "text": "According to Kim (2013) , there are two separate sets of criteria for determining substantial deviations from the normality. As the sample size in this study was more than 300, therefore, either of these, absolute values of skewness (>2), or absolute values of kurtosis (>7) may imply substantial deviations from the normality (Kim, 2013) . However, both, i.e., all the PAQ-C items scores, and the total scores had absolute values of skewness less than 2, and absolute values of kurtosis less than 7 (Nunnally, 1978) . The internal consistency, as determined by Cronbach's alpha, was satisfactory (Nunnally, 1978; George & Mallery, 2003) . According to the widely used rule of thumb criteria by George & Mallery (2003) , a Cronbach's alpha value in the range of 0.7-0.8 is acceptable (Nunnally, 1978; George & Mallery, 2003) . Previous studies have shown similar and slightly higher values of Cronbach's alpha in different populations. Gobbi et al. (2016) reported a Cronbach's alpha of 0.74 in Italian children. Slightly higher values were reported in Turkish (0.77) and Hong Kong children (0.79) (Wang et al., 2016; Erdim, Erg\u00fcn & Ku\u011fuo\u011flu, 2019) . Thomas & Upton (2014) found higher values in English children, with values of 0.84 and 0.82 in two sub-samples. Evidence supported an adequate item discrimination ability for all the item scores of the PAQ-C in this study population based on the classical theory parameters. This was implied by the fact that all values of item-total correlation coefficients, corrected-item total correlation coefficients, and Cronbach's alpha if an item was deleted, were more than 0.2 (Wang et al., 2017) .",

Firstly, a lack of concurrent validation concerning an objective measurement tool such as an accelerometer may limit inference deductions about the PAQ-C's accuracy. Secondly, a test-re-test was not performed since schools were closed due to COVID-19 lockdown; therefore, this may limit temporal reliability interpretations. Future studies using robust measures of item response theory may help in further establishing item-level psychometric parameters of the PAQ-C.",

The original English PAQ-C was developed for the Canadian population living in colder conditions. Despite this, its Arabic version with cultural adaptation was found to be valid among a sample of school-aged children in Saudi Arabia. The findings of this study affirm that the PAQ-C (Arabic) is a suitable tool to determine moderate to vigorous physical activity in children in Arabic countries. Future research addressing the psychometric properties of the PAQ-C in repeated administrations, different seasons, and multi-centric data collection strategies is warranted.",
