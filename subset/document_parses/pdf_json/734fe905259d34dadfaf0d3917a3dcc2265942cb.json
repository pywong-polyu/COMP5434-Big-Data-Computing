            "text": "In recent years, the discharge of contaminants from industrial and agricultural activities and urban wastewater has caused serious contamination of the aqueous system, posing a great potential threat to human health and aquatic life. These contaminants can be divided into three categories: (i) inorganic chemical substances, (ii) organic pollutants and (iii) microorganisms. These substances can cause adverse effects on the environment [1] [2] [3] [4] , for example, the disruption of hormones and the endocrine system and the induction of cytotoxicity and/or genotoxicity and carcinogenesis [5, 6] . The variable composition of pollutants and their location in aqueous environments over time have resulted in increasing focus on new technologies that use cheap and real-time strategies to monitor pollutants. Most of these strategies are based on laboratory platforms, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the detection of heavy metal ions, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for the detection of small organic chemicals or their metabolites, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of nucleic acids and genetic information, which require preprocessing and frequent data sampling, which means that they are both expensive and slow. These aspects highlight the need to develop a new strategy that is more sensitive, portable, and efficient for on-site detection of pollutants composed of multiple substances [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

In polymerases, Phi29 DNA polymerase is most commonly used because of its excellent capability and continuous strand displacement synthesis capability. Phi29 can handle topological constraints, four-way cross connections, and multiple circular DNA template complexes [39, 42, 43] . For RCA primers, both RNA and DNA (usually the \"target\" molecule to be detected) can achieve this goal. Indeed, the target DNA and RNA can be used to connect the first template mediated as a padlock probe (PLP) using RCA reaction circular template cyclizing [44, 45] . The circular DNA template (usually 15-200 nucleotides (NT) in length) is a component that can be enzymatically or chemically synthesized through intramolecular phosphate and hydroxyl end groups.",

The number of primers that one circular template can accommodate depends on the length of the primers and the circle. Another method for exponential amplification of RCA uses a so-called hyperbranched RCA (HRCA) (branched or amplification) method, in which the RCA product used as a template for the second and third groups is further expanded using primers [52] [53] [54] [55] . Note that a primer can be integrated into the hyperbranched RCA method to increase the sensitivity, especially when the target is detected at low abundance [56] . Additionally, restriction enzyme digestion followed by enzymatic ligation template-mediated, linear RCA products may be converted to a variety of cyclic products [57, 58] . A second set of primers may then be used to incorporate these new cyclic products for further amplification. This \"circle to circle amplification\" restriction digestion process, cyclization and amplification may be repeated for additional amplification. Finally, after hybridization with a second set of circles, the RCA product may be treated with nicking enzyme to generate a plurality of primers. The hybridized primer/circular template product obtained from the nickase reaction can be directly used for the next cycle of RCA amplification. ",

Due to the low cost, portability, and ease of operation of the colorimetric method, it has been widely and routinely used for the detection of various targets, such as DNA [108, 109] , proteins [110] , cells [111] [112] [113] , and heavy metal ions [114] . The combination of RCA and colorimetric assays has also been used to analyse heavy metals in aqueous environments. Wang et al. developed an RCA detection method based on a signal enhancement Hg colorimetric aptasensor [78] . As Hg 2+ poses a serious threat to public health and food safety, the technology for sensitive detection of Hg 2+ is constantly innovating. In a previous study, Lim et al. constructed an instant detection chip for the colorimetric detection of inorganic Hg 2+ based on microfluidics that was portable and easy to operate [79] . Manufactured by a three-dimensional printing technique, a disposable chip comprising DNAzyme RCA was generated. A colour change caused by the enzymatic reaction between DNAzymes and the peroxidase substrate 2,2azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was measured using a portable spectrophotometer (Figure 2A ). In the \"turn-off\" type RCA reaction, the interaction of thymine with Hg 2+ prevents the annealing of the T-rich primer that initiates the RCA reaction. Therefore, depending on the Hg 2+ concentration, the number of amplified DNases that cause colour changes is reduced. The colorimetric signal is enhanced by amplifying double-repeat DNAzymes from a circular DNA template. The chip detects Hg 2+ in tap water samples with a high sensitivity of 3.6 \u00b5g L \u22121 . Compared with conventional analytical instruments, it has higher selectivity, precision, and reproducibility. This low-cost, easy-touse platform can reduce the risk of accidental poisoning by Hg 2+ .",

First, the aptamer hybridized with its complementary strand (cDNA 1 ) is fixed on the microtiter plate, and the complementary strand (cDNA 1 ) is connected to the primer at the same time to trigger the RCA reaction of the circular template. A successful RCA process will result in the formation of long ssDNA strands on the microtiter plate, resulting in DNA fragments that hybridize with cDNA 2 from many organisms. The avidin/biotin binding between avi-HRP and bio-cDNA 2 increases the amount of labelled HRP. By adding TMB-H 2 O 2 , HRP catalyses the reaction and generates a light signal. When there is a target, the situation will be completely different. Hg 2+ preferentially binds to the aptamer to form a strong and stable T-Hg 2+ -T complex, resulting in the release of the HRP cDNA 1 cluster. Therefore, the optical signal is reduced. The results show that the limit of detection (LOD) was 1.6 nM, with excellent specificity. Compared with the detection signal of the RCA-free system, the detection signal can be increased up to 18 times.",

For instance, Chen et al. reported a highly sensitive Hg 2+ fluorescent sensor based on hyperbranched RCA [74] , with a detection limit of 0.14 pM. More recently, Zhao et al. established a method that used trifunctional molecular beacon-mediated quadratic amplification for the highly sensitive and rapid detection of Hg 2+ with a tunable dynamic range [76] . Due to its moderate sensitivity and limited dynamic range, it is challenging to analyse targets with low abundance or multiple orders of magnitude changes in concentration. Here, the authors introduced a homogeneous and fast quadratic polynomial amplification strategy by rationally designing three functional molecular beacons. This strategy not only acts as a reporter but also acts as a coupled two-stage amplification module without adding any bridges of reaction components or processes. The Hg 2+ assay as an example and achieved high sensitivity with an LOD of 200 pM within 30 min. To create an adjustable dynamic range, isomorphisms are used to regulate target-specific binding. When the number of metal binding sites changes from one to three, the useful dynamic range (spanning 50-, 25-, and 10-fold) is used to program the signal response accordingly. In addition, the applicability of this method in river water samples has been successfully verified, and it has good recovery and reproducibility, indicating that it has great practicability in complex actual samples.",

Zhao et al. developed a novel perylene derivative with electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and applied it to Hg 2+ detection based on a dual amplification strategy [27] . The cathodic ECL of a new covalently cross-linked perylene derivative (PTC-PEI) composed of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA) in an aqueous system was first studied ( Figure 2B ). Promising novel materials with ECL in PTC-PEI exhibit excellent physical and chemical stability and high ECL intensity, presenting an alternative way to construct an ECL sensor with improved sensitivity. Thus, this sensor was applied to construct a dual amplified \"signal-on\" Hg 2+ sensor by employing nicking endonuclease (NEase)-assisted target recycling and RCA for semaphore amplification. Herein, the process is produced by RCA of a long G-rich sequence to capture large amounts of haem on the electrode surface, and then a significant amplification of ECL signals by a PTC-PEI is obtained. This sensor platform showed a detection limit as low as 33 fM with a wide linear range from 0.1 pM to 0.1 \u00b5M. Based on the dual-signal amplification strategy, the designed sensor was successfully used to directly detect real water samples from lakes using the standard addition method. Electrochemical response signals are fast, inexpensive, and can be miniaturized for use with other portable devices, which enables the use of very few samples by nontechnical personnel to measure a target on the spot; thus, electrochemical methods have attracted increasing attention. Zhao et al. developed a novel perylene derivative with electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and applied it to Hg 2+ detection based on a dual amplification strategy [27] . The cathodic ECL of a new covalently cross-linked perylene derivative (PTC-PEI) composed of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and perylene tetracarboxylic acid Thymine-Hg 2+ -thymine (T-Hg 2+ -T) induces DNA strand replacement and realizes the specific recognition of Hg 2+ . It is a common strategy for Hg 2+ detection in environmental samples. Lv et al. developed an ultrasensitive electrochemical measurement method for Hg 2+ using an efficient target conversion method [77] . First, AuNPs were uniformly coated on polystyrene magnetic microspheres as a magnetic separator, and then ssDNA D1 (rich in thymine) and S1/D2 DNA duplexes (rich in guanine S1) were used as markers. When Hg 2+ and long ssDNA D3 (rich in thymine at the 5 end) are present in the tested sample, a stable T-Hg 2+ -T structure between D2 and D3 is immediately formed, and S1 is changed from the S1/D2 DNA duplex, thus realizing the transformation of S1. At this time, the target Hg 2+ is combined with the output S1. Therefore, the total amount of output S1 is proportional to the amount of input Hg 2+ . After that, the output S1 will be used as a primer to start an RCA reaction to obtain long guanine-rich ssDNA, thus achieving further hybridization with the DNA captured on the electrode surface. Eventually, methylene blue, as an electron mediator, will interact with the ssDNA polymer through electrostatic binding to generate a detection signal. The electrochemical biosensor based on RCA has a wide linear range, good accuracy, and excellent recovery rate. These stable properties are very suitable for water sample detection. It has strong competitiveness and application in detecting Hg 2+ in the environment.",

Since lead ions bioaccumulate and have nonbiodegradable properties, even at low concentrations, lead ions may also cause nervous, reproductive, cardiovascular, and other developmental disorders [115] . Figure 3C demonstrates an ultrasensitive fluorescent assay based on an RCA-assisted multisite-strand-displacement-reaction (SDR) signal-amplification strategy [60] . The proposed strategy is not only to achieve recycling targets but also to introduce RCA by the release of the DNA enzyme. Most importantly, the RCA product is used as an initiator to provide a plurality of SDR sites, which can replace the duplex signal RCA product to effectively prevent the self-quenching probe assembly RCA product signal. Therefore, the amplification efficiency and sensitivity can be significantly improved. Using this strategy for intracellular Pb 2+ detection, a detection limit as low as 0.03 nM and a wide linear range from 0.1 pM to 0.1 \u00b5M were obtained. In addition, the proposed strategy can be extended to determine other goals and provide a new approach for environmental analysis.",

Upon combining with Pb 2+ with high specificity, the random coiled probe changed to a G-quadruplex with a higher charge density, which enhanced the electrostatic interactions between the oligonucleotide and the cationic conjugated polymer; thus, the two fluorophores were in close proximity, leading to a significantly increased fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal.

This method was rapid, highly specific, and sensitive, and common metal ions did not influence the detection of Pb 2+ .

A Pb 2+ -specific DNAzyme immobilized on magnetic beads was coupled to RCA and a pH-metre-based readout. The addition of Pb 2+ ions induced partial cleavage of the DNA enzymes on the magnetic beads. The singlestranded DNA retained on the magnetic beads was used as a primer. With the help of a circular DNA template, polymerase and dNTPs trigger the RCA reaction. This results in the formation of many oligonucleotide repeats on the magnetic beads. Subsequently, these repetitive sequences are hybridized with glucose oxidase-labelled single-stranded DNA (GOx-ssDNA) to form a long coenzyme containing tens to hundreds of GOx-ssDNA tandem repeats ( Figure 3B ). The linked GOx molecules oxidize glucose, which is accompanied by a decrease in local pH. This method has good reproducibility, high specificity, and acceptable accuracy.

Among various organic pollutants, bisphenol A (BPA) is a typical substance that has caused widespread concern. As the scientific understanding of bisphenol A continues to deepen, it is especially discovered that it can cause disorder and damage to the normal physiological processes of the human body. Currently, major cities have strengthened the detection and supervision of bisphenol A (BPA) in terms of food safety and drinking water safety. However, the detection of BPA relies on precision and expensive machines, such as HPLC-ICP-MS. These methods require tedious operations and long analysis times. To reduce the analysis cost and simplify the operation, researchers have developed an RCA method to detect BPA. For instance, Xia et al. creatively constructed a label-free aptamer fluorescence sensing platform based on the RCA/Exo III (Exo III) combined cascade amplification strategy, which has high selectivity and high sensitivity for BPA detection [83] (Figure 4 ). The first step is to design a BPA-resistant aptamer and a DNA double-stranded probe (RP) for the trigger sequence for BPA recognition and signal amplification; next, when BPA appears, it will trigger the probe to be released. On this basis, the initial amplification reaction of RCA was started. When an increasing number of RCA products appear, the RCA products will trigger a second amplification assisted by Exo III with the help of hairpin probes. To date, many G quadruplexes will be enriched in lantern-like structures.",

The target miRNA acts as a primer and can hybridize specifically to the circular DNA template. Then, RCA is initiated by Phi29 DNA polymerase, and a reverse primer complementary to the RCA product is introduced during this process to achieve isothermal BRCA. While consuming a large amount of dNTPs, it produces the same number of pyrophosphate (PPi) molecules. In this study, a simple and cheaply synthesized pyridinebased Zn(II) complex was used as a fluorescent probe for the selective detection of PPi through dNTPs. In this way, the PPi generated during the isothermal amplification process is effectively chelated to the pyridine-Zn(II) complex to form a highly fluorescent complex, pyridine-Zn(II)-PPi, whose fluorescence intensity is only comparable to the original target. The concentration of miRNA is closely related. This strategy not only achieves isothermal amplification but also allows direct monitoring of DNA polymerization byproducts. For the nonlabelled fluorescence detection of miRNA, PPi greatly simplifies the sensor procedure. This noncumbersome sensor provides a sensitive and easy-to-use platform for miRNA quantification.

Zhou et al. designed a new high-throughput method to analyse the methylation pattern of individual DNA molecules [125] . High-throughput assays for methylation pattern analysis of individual DNA clones are important for research on tumour initiation, progression and transfer and chemotherapy. In this study, a new method was developed for methylation pattern analysis based on HRCA cloning and microarray technology. A library of DNA fragments with different methylation statuses was amplified from bisulfitemodified genomic DNA using PCR, and circular PCR products were then formed by ligation with a linker. HRCA was performed on streptavidin-coated beads in water-inoil microemulsions, where the circular products were used as templates with one of the primers immobilized on the beads. Finally, the beads were immobilized on glass slides using polyacrylamide gel and hybridized with specific probes to identify the multiple C g site methylation status of each clone. This method was applied successfully to each clone methylation pattern analysis of the P16 gene promoter in 10 stomach tumour samples and 10 corresponding normal samples. The experiments showed that the method could measure the methylation pattern of each DNA clone with high sensitivity simply by counting the methylation clones.",

The porous hydrogel shell and the hydrophilic protein scaffold are connected to each other to form an opal reverse structure in which the PhC barcode is coated. Opal anti-structure can provide homogeneous water around miRNA target reaction and RCA. The encapsulated PhC core of the barcode can provide stable diffraction peaks to encode different miRNAs and their RCAs during the detection process. In this way, the advantages of the PhC barcode and RCA are integrated.

Through the function of RCA, the DNA template can be replicated to generate a large number of repetitive DNA sequences. At this time, the detection probe will hybridize with the repetitive sequence; therefore, the signal has been significantly improved. Under optimal parameter conditions, the immunosensor proposed by the team has a good linear relationship between the current response in the range of 0.01-50 \u00b5g L \u22121 and the target concentration, and the detection limit is 7.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 \u00b5g L \u22121 . Similarly, the immunosensor has also been proven to be highly specific, and its reusability and stability are commendable. Most importantly, the proposed biosensor is used to detect MC-LR in real water samples and has a good recovery rate, indicating its application prospects in actual environmental monitoring. Hui et al. reported a paper-based multifunctional bio/nanomaterial printed sensor platform, as shown in Figure 5B [89] . The platform is divided into two reaction zones and a connecting bridge. Molecular recognition and signal amplification are realized by printing multifunctional biological/nanomaterials. When the targeted analyte appears in the first area, the fluorescently labelled nucleic acid aptamer will automatically desorb from the printed graphene oxide, thereby quickly generating an initial fluorescent signal. Then, the released aptamer flows with the wave to the second area, where it reacts with the printed reagent to initiate RCA, thereby generating DNA amplicons containing DNAzyme mimicking peroxidase, thereby generating colorimetric readings. No equipment or smartphone is required to interpret the reading. To verify the specificity and sensitivity of the sensor, the author used an adenosine triphosphate RNA aptamer (a bacterial marker) and glutamate dehydrogenase DNA aptamer for verification and successfully passed the test. Moreover, when the target is added to serum or stool samples, it can still be detected, proving the potential of this method in testing clinical samples.",

            "text": "Karenia mikimotoi (K. mikimotoi) is globally distributed, toxic, and harmful, and it easily forms water blooms. It is similar to a single spark, which explodes frequently in the global seas. To avoid endangering seafood and human health, fast, accurate, and sensitive on-site monitoring of this harmful algae is needed. Zhang et al. reported the comparative detection of Carrenella triloba through exponential RCA (E-RCA) and double-linked E-RCA and compared their sensitivity with traditional PCR methods [90] . Part of the large subunit rDNA (D1-D2) of K. mikimotoi was amplified, cloned, and then sequenced. After the obtained sequence was used for specific region comparison analysis, PLP and primers of E-RCA and dlE-RCA were designed. Through the simulation, the parameters of the E-RCA and dlE-RCA systems are optimized. The specificity test showed that both E-RCA and dlE-RCA are specific to K. mikimotoi bacteria. The sensitivity comparison shows that the sensitivity of E-RCA is 10 times higher than that of PCR, while the sensitivity of dlE-RCA is equivalent to that of PCR. Tests on simulated field samples show that the detection limits of the developed E-RCA and dlE-RCA methods are 1 and 10 cells, respectively. By visually observing the colour reaction and adding fluorescent SYBR green I dye to the reaction tube, it can be confirmed that E-RCA and dlE-RCA are positive. Compared with E-RCA, dlE-RCA can avoid the self-cyclization of PLP. The developed E-RCA and dlE-RCA methods are also very effective for field samples with a target cell density in the range of 10-1000 cells mL \u22121 . These results indicate that the established E-RCA and dlE-RCA detection protocols show expectations for future field applications of K. mikimotoi monitoring.",

            "text": "Najafzade has developed a method to accurately identify seven species of aquatic Exophiala species through RCA DNA PLPs [93] . The potential opportunistic species in the black yeast genus Exophiala are relatively high, and these opportunistic species can cause systemic or scattered infections in individuals with strong immune capabilities. Among them, the species that cause systemic diseases can generally grow at 37-40 \u2022 C, while other species lack heat tolerance, and most of them involve diseases of aquatic vertebrates, invertebrates, and most cold-blooded animals. Here, the author introduces a high-efficiency determination method that can identify and identify water-based Exophiala species without sequence restrictions. First, the author completed the sequencing and comparison of the ITS rDNA regions of seven Exophiala species and the closely related Veronaea botryosa. They designed a specific PLP that can be used to detect characteristic single nucleotide polymorphisms. By amplifying the DNA of the target fungus, the amplified product was observed on a 1% agarose gel to confirm the specificity of the probe-template binding and finally realize detection at the species level. During the experiment, the amount of reagents was reduced to prevent false-positive results. Simplicity, sensitivity, durability, and low cost make this PLP analysis (RCA) stand out in the diagnosis of bacterial DNA species. The application of terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in the field of sensing meets the needs of rapid and sensitive bacterial detection to a certain extent. Yang et al. developed an RCA-based THz biosensor for isothermal detection of bacterial DNA [94] . The first step is to hybridize a bacterial-specific, artificially synthesized 16S rDNA sequence with PLP, where the 5 and 3 ends of the PLP contain sequences that are completely complementary to the target sequence. When the target sequence is recognized and ligated, the linear PLP is circularized to form a circular PLP. Then, the capture probe (CP) immobilized on the magnetic beads plays the role of primer, and RCA starts to initialize. In the THz range, the absorbency of DNA molecules is far from that of water molecules, so the RCA product on the surface of the magnetic beads will cause the THz absorbance to decrease significantly. At this time, sensitive THz spectroscopy will detect the difference. The specificity test result is obvious, which is proven by its low signal response to interfering bacteria. The proposed strategy not only proves a new attempt to detect target bacterial DNA isothermally but also provides a general platform for sensitive and specific DNA biosensing using THz spectroscopy technology. Chen et al. used a research and development strategy that took full advantage of the sensitivity of HRCA to quickly detect Amphidinium carterae in environmental samples [97] . For coastal countries, the quality of marine water is decisive for the regional marine ecosystem, marine fisheries, or public health. Unfortunately, many coastal countries and regions are currently threatened by toxic microalgae, and they are becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to establish a largescale water quality analysis and early warning system that can quickly, sensitively, and accurately detect toxin-producing microalgae in water bodies. In this article, the author uses HRCA to quickly detect Amphidinium carterae. First, the large subunit rDNA (LSU D1-D2) of Amphidinium carterae was sequenced to design a species-specific PLP. Then, the PLP combined with two amplification primers was used by HRCA. Of course, the HRCA sensing platform passed the specific detection experiment and passed the test with other algae. The entire operation process was controlled to be completed within 1.5 h. What is even more surprising is that the platform's repeated detection limit is one cell. During the detection process, the fluorescent dye SYBR green I can be added to the amplified product so that the positive result of HRCA can be seen through the colour reaction. HRCA provides a very useful detection tool that can accurately screen large samples of Amphidinium carterae and other toxic species. To further improve the sensitive, Nie et al. applied HRCA and an HRCA-based strip test (HBST) for the detection of Chattonella marina [95] . As mentioned above, the existence of HAB poses a threat to marine ecosystems, fisheries and human health on a global scale. How to quickly and accurately monitor pathogenic algae and seawater quality is the goal. In this research article, the author combines the two methods and proposes the use of HRCA and HBST to rapidly detect Chattonella in the sea. The first is to sequence the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) characteristic region of Candida marinus and design a specific PLP based on the sequencing results. In this way, the entire HRCA reaction covers two amplification primers and another HBST that plays an important role. The detection procedure involves a constant-temperature HRCA reaction, paper-based hybridization, and colour development results judged by the naked eye. Verifying specificity and sensitivity is an indispensable link. After a simple and logical operation, the results show that the detection limit of HBST detection is 1 copy \u00b5L \u22121 of the Pseudomonas marina LSU rDNA plasmid, which is the most prominent. It is one order of magnitude higher than the detection limit of HRCA and three orders of magnitude higher than the detection limit of conventional PCR. Finally, the author also applied the scheme to simulated field samples, and the results obtained are also good. The developed HBST still has higher detection sensitivity than HRCA and traditional PCR methods. In summary, the method proposed in this study is expected to break through the monitoring and early warning dilemma caused by HAB to the global ocean system and realize the on-site, sensitive and specific detection of cryptosporidium from natural samples. At the same time, it also provides good detection cases and models for future detection of other harmful algae. Pearson et al. proposed the view that \"virus recombination leads to fuzzy classification\" [96] . The structural composition and dynamic changes of biological communities are inevitable research fields, especially in the application of agricultural sites. Research on microbial communities with high economic attributes and related maintenance is increasingly being discussed. The wastewater treatment plant is a melting pot with multiple coexistences. First, its sources are relatively wide, including not only domestic wastewater, livestock and poultry breeding wastewater but also various environmental wastewaters with stress factors, making wastewater treatment plants a variety of virus libraries of hosts that can be infected. In addition, the dynamic changes of its internal environment cannot be ignored; that is, the phenomenon of virus recombination cannot be ignored. They used a combination of sucrose gradient size selection and RCA to isolate the full-length genome of the circular ssDNA virus from the wastewater treatment facility and sequenced it on Illumina MSeq to achieve virus collection inspection. However, compared with the relatively large dsDNA viruses that are often studied, single-stranded DNA viruses are the least known microbial pathogens, and they also face technical bottlenecks such as genome bias and difficulty in cultivation.

In the end, the results of the examination of viral DNA collected at the site provided evidence for 83 unique genotype groups. On the one hand, the results show the wide diversity of the community. These groupings are genetically different from known virus types; in addition, although the expression of these genomes is similar to that of known virus families, many differences are so great that they may represent the new taxonomy group. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of this method to isolate bacteria and large viruses from ssDNA viruses and the ability to use this protocol to obtain in-depth analysis of the diversity within the group.",

Whether it is the diagnosis of infectious diseases in biomedicine, the safety control of residents' drinking water or food safety management and other health fields, the rapid, low-cost and easy-to-operate multitarget detection of pathogens has always been our unremitting pursuit. Therefore, we need an increasing number of novel bioassay methods to meet the requirements. Biological detection platforms established by magnetic and optical-magnetic bioassay methods are increasingly playing a role in developing countries due to their unique advantages. A photomagnetic method for the qualitative detection of bacterial DNA sequences has been developed, which can quickly determine whether the DNA sequence of the target bacteria appears in the sample. After two magnetic beads of different sizes are functionalized with nucleic acids, they hybridize with RCA products from two different bacteria to form the sensing platform. Among them, magnetic beads of different sizes are equipped with different oligonucleotide probes, which are only complementary to one of the RCA products. The final test results are also obtained from the same volume of samples. The measurement response is controlled by the modulation frequency of the applied magnetic field of the projected laser, which is an outstanding feature of the magneto-optical sensing platform. It is very suitable for countries and regions with low resources in the world, especially those that urgently need low-cost, large-scale screening for pathogens related to human or veterinary drugs.",

First, DNA walker-based amplification can be instigated by the presence of the target gene, which could hybridize with BN to release DW for further hybridization between DW and TN. DNA walker-based amplification could then be started with the help of Nb. BbvC I. The DNA generated by the DNA walker could open hairpin DNA 1 (H1) to activate the RCA reaction. The long ssDNA produced by RCA could react with hairpin DNA 2 (H2) and hairpin DNA 3 (H3) to start HCR amplification.

The method has an extraordinary sensitivity with 2.6 aM detection limit and the response is linear in the 10-700 aM range.

In general, these methods are similar and utilize the specificity of RCA to recognize the target and the electrochemical effect of the RCA product (many could be indirect products, such as probes immobilized on the long ssDNA generated by the RCA reaction) to transduce the chemical signal into an electrical signal. Taking Yi's study as an example, the conformation of the right probe was changed in the presence of adenosine, forming a hairpin structure. The hairpin structure can be linked to another hairpin structure generated by the left probe to produce circular DNA. Then, the RCA reaction can be triggered with primers and Phi29 polymerase [149] . The RCA product could hybridize with capture probes on the electrode surface which induced an increase in the impedance signal. This device is not only easy to operate but also flexible.

            "text": "Furthermore, based on the synthesis of multivalent ligand binding variable RCA, many other multivalent ligand systems are difficult to achieve, including the number of ligands, density, type, and spatial organization, and they represent a new chemical biology tool in environmental monitoring. Despite the many advantages of the RCA system, there are still some challenges to overcome in practical applications. First, preparing a large number of high-purity circular templates may be an unavoidable challenge. For example, in enzymatic ligation methods, in addition to circular DNA, linear multimer byproducts can sometimes be formed. This problem can be partially solved by using low concentrations of DNA in the ligation reaction. Then, the circular DNA product can be purified from the linear byproduct by gel electrophoresis or exonuclease treatment, which only degrades noncircular linear DNA molecules. In addition, it is known that the enzymatic ligation process is effective for relatively large DNA substrates but may not be suitable for making small DNA loops (~30 nt). This may be due to an insufficient number of enzyme binding sites and/or is caused by the induced strain after restriction enzyme digestion. The closed loop of short oligonucleotides. However, this defect can be solved by chemically circularizing DNA oligonucleotides. This method can generate both small (~14 nt) and large circular templates (415 nt) with very good yields (up to 85%) of circular DNA molecules. In addition, other challenges in the practical application of RCA systems include mass production, purification, and storage because RCA products tend to aggregate for a long time due to non-specific intermolecular and intramolecular cross-linking. In addition, due to the large molecular weight of RCA products, nonspecific binding may occur when used in complex water environments such as wastewater. These problems can be minimized by fine-tuning the parameters, including RCA product length, order, composition, and stiffness. For instance, the authors found that the incorporation of polyT (rather than random sequence) spacers between the aptamer domains of RCA products can reduce nonspecific interactions between the multivalent aptamer system and various targets. Finally, computer-aided methods can be used to design RCA sequences and short chains to construct predictable DNA nanostructures to minimize unwanted nonspecific interactions. The analysis method based on RCA is an innovative approach for the simple and rapid detection of various targets in environmental monitoring and can even be applied to on-site detection. This method will open up a new direction for environmental pollution assessment, drug abuse trend assessment, public health assessment, and other fields. ",
