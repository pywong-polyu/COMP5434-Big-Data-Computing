Multivariable logistic regression was performed, and a mixed-effects logistic regression model was constructed to determine patient-level factors (age, race, body mass index, comorbidities, smoking status, insurance, type of surgery) and provider-level factors (breast surgeon gender, participation in multidisciplinary breast clinic) that influence reconstruction. Results. Overall, 167 patients underwent mastectomy. The reconstruction rate was 35%. In multivariable analysis, increasing age (odds ratio [OR] 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-0.99) and Medicaid insurance (OR 0.18; 95% CI 0.06-0.53) relative to private insurance were negative predictors, whereas bilateral mastectomy was a positive predictor (OR 7.07; 95% CI 2.95-17.9) of reconstruction. After adjustment for patent age, race, insurance, and type of surgery, female breast surgeons had 3.7 times greater odds of operating on patients who had reconstruction than males (95% CI 1.20-11.42).",

[2] [3] [4] More recently, in 2010, New York State passed the Breast Cancer Provider Discussion Law, mandating discussion of insurance coverage for reconstruction and expedient plastic surgery referral. 5 Despite these measures, postmastectomy reconstruction rates remain variable, and postmastectomy reconstruction may be underutilized among certain patient populations. 6 Numerous studies have sought to identify patient-, hospital-, and system-level factors that predict which patients will undergo reconstruction. Patient factors found to influence reconstruction include race, age, insurance, hospital type, type of surgery, geographic location, body mass index, and number of comorbidities. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] In this study, we sought to evaluate trends in postmastectomy breast reconstruction at an urban hospital with a newly established multidisciplinary breast program (MDC) and to identify patient-and provider-level factors that may predict which patients undergo reconstruction.",

The law states that coverage must be provided for all stages of reconstruction, including reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetric appearance, as well as coverage for prostheses and treatment of complications such as lymphedema. However, the law applies only to group health plans and individual health insurance policies. Medicaid coverage is less certain, leaving this as an area that remains in need of further study. 4 Differences were observed in CCI and smoking status between the patients who underwent reconstruction and those who did not. The higher median CCI among the patients not undergoing reconstruction may be reflective of surgeon or patient hesitancy to attempt additional surgery in the presence of multiple comorbidities. A borderline significant difference was observed regarding smoking status, with a smoking history reported by a greater proportion of patients undergoing reconstruction (31% vs 17%; p = 0.052). Although findings have shown smoking be an independent predictor of postoperative complications in breast reconstruction, we did not delineate current versus former smoker. 23 We suspect that this finding may have been because a large subset of our patients listed as smokers were former smokers and not current smokers, leading to less hesitancy by surgeons to proceed with reconstruction.",

Among 456 general surgeons, only 24% referred more than 75% of their patients to plastic surgery. However, this high referral propensity was independently associated with women surgeons (OR 2.3; p = 0.03). 25 Another survey of surgeons in Wisconsin found that 40% of breast surgeons did not refer all mastectomy patients for reconstruction due to concern about cancer recurrence and advanced age. 26 Similar to our findings, in 2015, Iskandar et al. 7 reported factors influencing both the incidence and type of breast reconstruction at an urban multidisciplinary cancer center. In their analysis of 258 mastectomy patients, they found that patients who had a female breast surgeon were more than five times more likely to undergo reconstruction (OR 5.17; 95% CI 3.01-8.89; p = 0.001).
