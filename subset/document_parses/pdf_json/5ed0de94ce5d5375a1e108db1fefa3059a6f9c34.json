In recent years, NLP systems based on large-scale pre-trained language models have shown impressive gains on several linguistic benchmarks (Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019) . However, these same models have been found to struggle at tasks that require higher-level processing (Ettinger, 2020) , including giving advice (Zellers et al., 2020) . This work aims to advance both our understanding of how people give advice, as well as to provide resources for learning to identify advice. First, we construct a dataset of annotations of advice in English from two advice-focused Reddit commu-nities -r/AskParents and r/needadvice, totalling 18456 sentences across 684 posts ( \u00a73). These two subreddits are different in a number of respects. r/needadvice is a general advice forum, while r/AskParents targets a specific audienceparents-who are often active seekers of advice. r/needadvice is more strongly moderated than r/AskParents. In addition, our analysis shows that r/AskParents contains more implicit, narrative advice than r/needadvice ( \u00a74). Through this dataset we provide the first-of-its-kind resources to explore the breadth of advice-giving strategies, and testbeds for modeling advice.",

The dataset only considers sentences that explicitly include suggestions -that is, where one can infer without context that a sentence is a suggestion -while we always give the annotators the wider context of the entire post and question, and ask them to evaluate which sentences are advice based on this wider context. For instance, (2) is advice in the context of the question, but that same narrative could also be support for advice, given a different question. Additionally, suggestions are not synonymous with advice, and can include tips and recommendations (although none of these terms are mutually exclusive).

Secondly, we find the domain of their datasets to be somewhat restricted, and not representative of the wide range of online advice-seeking behavior. We chose to construct datasets based on subreddits devoted to asking for advice related to parenting and general issues, since we want to understand how to model general human advice-seeking interactions. We target parenting as parents frequently seek and give advice online, and express it in linguistically diverse forms.

To keep the task load reasonable for annotators, any posts with a submission title and body exceeding one standard deviation above the average length of posts (421 tokens) were filtered out; we restricted comment-trees to a depth of 2 and constructed HITS to contain at most 5 top-level comments to an advice-seeking post. Each HIT was annotated by 5 annotators for $0.15 per HIT. We perform a final round of preprocessing on our dataset to ensure quality (Cachola et al., 2018) , by removing annotations from workers whose Spearman correlation against the sum of labels within a HIT was below 0.2.

Table 4 reports the percentage of advice sentences that contain personal narratives. We analyzed 213 sentences DS-labelled as advice from 13 posts for whether they contained personal narratives. We observe that r/AskParents has a higher percentage (16.4%) of personal narrative sentences than r/needadvice overall (6.33%), though Mental Health posts in r/needadvice have a high percentage of sentences that expressed personal narratives, at 18.18%. These statistics, as well as the lower agreement statistics for r/AskParents which we report in Table 2 , suggest that r/AskParents is in general a harder dataset to work with. Personal narrative versus other advice-giving strategies demonstrates distinctions in discourse modes of advice. Smith (2003) recognizes 5 different discourse modes -narrative, descriptive, report, information and argumentative -which roughly identify a text's contribution through clusters of linguistic features including temporal progression, stative vs. generic sentences, etc. We found that personal narrative is often expressed in the narrative discourse mode, as shown in example (5) above. For non-personal-narrative advice, the argumentative discourse mode is highly prevalent, as shown in example (7) above.
