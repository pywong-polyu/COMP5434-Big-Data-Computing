To contribute to fill this gap in the literature, we investigated the scores of the Inventory of Problems-29 (IOP-29) generated by various administration formats. More specifically, Study 1 evaluated the equivalence of scores from nonclinical individuals administered the IOP-29 remotely (n = 146) versus in-person via computer (n = 140) versus in-person via paper-and-pencil format (n = 140). Study 2 reviewed published IOP-29 studies conducted using remote/online versus in-person, paper-and-pencil test administrations to determine if remote testing could adversely influence the validity of IOP-29 test results. Taken together, our findings suggest that the effectiveness of the IOP-29 is preserved when alternating between face-to-face and online/remote formats.",

            "text": "The recent COVID-19 pandemic has greatly disrupted the professional routine of clinical psychologists and neuropsychologists who provide assessment services and mental health evaluations. Given the necessity of physical distancing, several major assessment instruments developed guidelines to help in the switch from direct face-to-face interaction to remote assessment (American Psychological Association, 2020; Chenneville & Schwartz-Mette, 2020; Farmer et al., 2020; Pliskin et al., 2020; Wright et al., 2020) . However, while the psychometric equivalence of computerized versus paper-and-pencil administration formats has been documented for some of these measures (e.g., MMPI-2/MMPI-2-RF: Finger & Ones, 1999; Forbey & Ben-Porath, 2007; Menton et al., 2019; Pinsoneault, 1996; Roper et al., 1995;  WISC-V: Daniel et al., 2014 , Daniel & Wahlstrom, 2019 , to date, very few studies have focused on the possible differences between remote and face-to-face administration methods (e.g., personality inventories: Chuah, 2006 ; intelligence and achievement tests: Wright, 2018; neuropsychological tests: Brearly et al., 2017; Marra et al., 2020) . This gap in the literature is even more evident when one considers the validity of computerized and/or remote administration of tests that evaluate the credibility of reported symptoms and response styles (Kois et al., 2020) .",

Indeed, as stated by the Joint Task Force for the Development of Telepsychology Guidelines for Psychologists (2013) \"when a psychological test or other assessment procedure is conducted via telepsychology, psychologists are encouraged to ensure that the integrity of the psychometric properties of the test or assessment procedure (e.g., reliability and validity) and the conditions of administration indicated in the test manual are preserved when adapted for use with such technologies\" (p. 798). Put differently, psychological tests that have yet to be ascertained as reliable and valid in the remote testing context should be established as such before their administration in remote forensic testing. The need for research on these questions should therefore rank high on the research agenda of academics and practitioners alike.",

It is applicable to a wide range of conditions involving depressive, psychotic, neurocognitive, and/or PTSD-related psychological problems. Comprised of 29 items, it is typically completed within < 10 min. Twenty seven of the IOP-29 items are self-report, SVT-like statements or questions that offer three response options: \"True,\" \"False,\" and \"Doesn't make sense.\" The remaining two items are cognitive (e.g., calculation, logic) problems that call for open-ended responses. According to Viglione et al. (2017) , this set of 29 items survived multiple cross-validations throughout a lengthy period of test development in which an initial pool of 245 items addressing 27 feigning strategies were evaluated. This procedure is probably one of the reasons why, despite its brevity, the IOP-29 seems to be a highly effective SVT (Gegner et al., 2021; Giromini et al., 2018; Ilgunaite et al., 2020; Roma et al., 2020; Viglione et al., 2017; Winters et al., 2020) .",

To reach a specificity level of about 90%, which is typically suggested in high-stake assessments (Larrabee, 2003) , a more suitable cutoff would be FDS \u2265 0.65. In contrast, in a screening context, in which sensitivity should be favored over specificity, an optimal cutoff score would be FDS \u2265 0.30 so to reach a sensitivity level of about 90% .

            "text": "Distinctive Features of the IOP-29 Several distinctive features characterize the IOP-29, making it different from all other extant SVTs. Three of the most relevant ones are as follows. First, while the typical SVT mainly (if not only) relies on the rare-symptoms endorsement detection strategy (Rogers & Bender, 2018) , the IOP-29 uses multiple detection strategies, including some derived from interviewing techniques (Viglione et al., 2017) . Thus, rather than exclusively focusing on whether or not a test-taker suffers from a series of uncommon or non-existent symptoms, the IOP-29 also investigates how examinees cope with their problems-if they believe there is anything they can do to lessen the burden their problems generate, if they take any responsibility for their difficulties, and so forth. Second, as noted above, in addition to the classic \"True\" and \"False\" response options, the SVT-like items of the IOP-29 also offer a third option, \"Doesn't make sense.\" In the studies leading up to the final refinements and release of the test, Viglione et al. (2017) found that this third response option psychometrically improved the overall signal detection of almost all IOP-29 items, compared to using the standard True/False dichotomy. Additionally, it also contributed to the assessment of possible resistance to the evaluation and/or feigned cognitive deficiency. Third, the feigning score of the IOP-29 is not based on a single set of normative reference data obtained from healthy volunteers, as is the case for many other SVTs. To allow a more precise determination of the likelihood of a given presentation to be \"valid\" versus \"invalid,\" the IOP-29 FDS indeed compares the test-taker's responses against two different sets of reference values, one coming from bona fide patients, and the other one coming from experimental simulators. This is done by implementing a logistic regression derived, exponential function that generates a probabilistic score reflecting the likelihood of obtaining a given IOP-29 from either one of the two aforementioned sets of reference values. From a practical standpoint, this technical innovation is deemed \"to assist and simplify the decisionmaking process of mental health professionals performing symptom and/or performance validity assessment\" (Viglione & Giromini, 2020, p. 43) .",

            "text": "The fact that the IOP-29 is so different from typical SVTs makes it particularly suitable to be included in a multimethod symptom validity assessment. Indeed, as it does not primarily rely on the rare-symptoms endorsement detection strategy, the IOP-29 likely offers valuable, complementary information (and thereby incremental validity) when used in combination with other useful SVTs such as the F scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-3; Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2020a, b), the Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology (SIMS; Smith & Burger, 1997) , or the Self-Reported Symptom Inventory (SRSI; Merten et al., 2016) . In support of this hypothesis, a recent clinical comparison simulation study focused on depressionrelated complaints found that using the IOP-29 together with the F scales of the MMPI-2 (Butcher et al., 2001) , in fact, provided statistically significant incremental validity over using either instrument alone . Research Foundation As noted by the Editor-in-Chief of Psychological Injury and Law and his colleagues in a recent article aimed at introducing the field of psychological injury and law, the IOP-29 is \"a newer stand-alone SVT that has the required psychometric properties for use in forensic disability and related assessments. Its research profile is accumulating, a hallmark for use in legal settings\" (Young et al., 2020, p. 9) . Although the IOP-29 was published only relatively recently in 2017 (Viglione et al., 2017) , all 12 published studies since then support its validity and effectiveness (Gegner et al., 2021; Giromini et al., 2018 Giromini et al., , 2020a Ilgunaite et al., 2020; Roma et al., 2020; Viglione et al., 2017 Viglione et al., , 2019 Winters et al., 2020) . Specifically, the results of these studies suggest that (a) the validity and classification accuracy of the IOP-29 compares favorably to that of popular measures like the Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology (SIMS; Smith & Burger, 1997) or Rey Fifteen-Item Test (FIT; Lezak, 1995; Rey, 1941) (Gegner et al., 2021) ; (b) the IOP-29 is similarly valid when addressing feigning of different conditions such as depression, neuropsychological impairment, psychosis and/or PTSD (e.g., Giromini et al., 2020b; Ilgunaite et al., 2020; Winters et al., 2020) ; (c) the validity of the IOP-29 is maintained both when adopting a simulation/analogue (e.g., Gegner et al., 2021) and when relying on a known-groups comparison (Roma et al., 2020) research paradigm; (d) the IOP-29 yields incremental validity when used in combination with other SVTs or PVTs (Giromini et al., 2020a) ; (e) the IOP-29 preserves its effectiveness also when used outside the USA, in countries such as Australia (Gegner et al., 2021) , the UK (Winters et al., 2020) , Italy , Portugal (Giromini et al., 2020a) , or Lithuania (Ilgunaite et al., 2020) .",

The latter is available (www. iop-test. com) for both in-person and remote administrations and prevents test-takers accessing the practitioner's IOP-29 account and previous administrations. Nevertheless, so far, the great majority of published IOP-29 studies utilized a classic, in person, paper-andpencil administration format. In fact, out of the 12 currently published IOP-29 studies referenced above, only two (i.e., Gegner et al., 2021; Winters et al., 2020) were conducted using a remote/online administration format. As such, additional research on the comparability and validity of the in-person and remote/online administrations of the IOP-29 would be beneficial.",

Examination of 590 IOP-29 protocols from various ongoing and archival research projects revealed that the mean and standard deviation values generated by the three subsamples, as well as their associated specificity levels, were remarkably similar to each other. Bayesian statistics strongly confirmed this conclusion. Taken together, these findings suggest that administering the IOP-29 in-person or remotely and via paper-and-pencil or computerized format should yield the same or nearly the same results. A few limitations, however, should be pointed out. First, our samples only included non-clinical, Italian individuals, so that the generalizability of our findings to other populations (e.g., different cultures, clinical cases) should be evaluated further. Second, we relied on archival data and convenience sampling and cannot demonstrate that all participants fully complied with the instructions to respond honestly to the IOP-29 items. To overcome this limitation, future studies are recommended to include validity checks or consider adding SVTs or PVTs. Third, the ecological validity is not a strength in that experimental findings might not generalize to high-stakes, real-life evaluations. Fourth, and perhaps more importantly, the fact that the scores generated by a honest community sample taking the IOP-29 via an in-person versus a remote/online formats are equivalent to each other does not necessarily guarantee that the validity of the IOP-29 will be preserved when going from one administration format to another. To that goal, it would be beneficial to also compare the effectiveness, classification accuracy, and validity results observed in other simulation/analogue studies in which the IOP-29 was administered in-person versus remotely.",

One third of the sample (n = 93) was asked to respond honestly and two thirds (n = 182) were instructed to feign mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Results strongly supported the effectiveness and validity of the IOP-29. Winters et al. (2020) also administered the IOP-29 from remote, but the focus of their study was on feigned schizophrenia, instead. More specifically, 151 British volunteers were administered the IOP-29 three times, under three different conditions, i.e., (a) responding honestly, (b) pretending to suffer from schizophrenia, and (c) responding at random. Also, in this case, results strongly supported the applicability and validity of the IOP-29.",

(2020) used healthy, non-clinical volunteers, rather than bona fide patients, as controls, which is known to artificially boost specificity (Rogers & Bender, 2018; van Impelen et al., 2014) . As such, to more fairly compare Gegner et al.'s (2021) and Winters et al.'s (2020) data against previously published studies, one should probably only look at investigations that included healthy volunteers as control groups, in Tables 2 and 3 . Even so, however, the data obtained when administering the IOP-29 remotely versus in-person would still yield remarkably similar results. Second, a limitation of Study 2 is that all studies included in this mini-review used a simulation/ analogue design, which limits ecological validity. Future research using a known-groups comparison paradigm are, therefore, needed to overcome this problem. Third, as we only focused on feigned mTBI and feigned schizophrenia, additional IOP-29 research on the comparability of validity findings obtained when investigating feigned PTSD or feigned depression would be beneficial.

            "text": "With this article, we sought to contribute to the ongoing debate on whether there is a significant departure from standard testing protocols when one performs teleassessment. More specifically, we focused on the IOP-29 and examined whether its average scores and classification accuracy estimates change when one uses a remote/online versus in-person administration format. Study 1 found that non-clinical controls taking the IOP-29 online from remote, in-person via computerized format, or in-person via paper-and-pencil generated virtually identical results. Study 2 further supported the hypothesis that the different administration formats are essentially equivalent to each other, by showing that published studies conducted using a remote/online versus in-person administration of the IOP-29 produced comparable validity findings for certain types of patients and feigners. Taken together, these findings suggest that administering the IOP-29 from remote should likely preserve the integrity of its psychometric properties. A few concluding considerations and overall limitations deserve mention. In real-life, forensic tele-assessments, appropriate precautions should be taken to identify testtakers and their locations, to ensure that the testing session runs smoothly, without notable disruptions, etc. (Drogin, 2020) . Unfortunately, the studies presented in this article did not take these precautions, as research participants in our online studies were simply invited to fill out the IOP-29 from remote and left on their own while delivering their responses. They were not monitored with the aid of a synchronous (live) teleconference applications, nor was an on-site proctor available to supervise the session. Thus, one might question whether our findings generalize to reallife evaluation contexts which use these precautions. On the other hand, inattentive item review or inconsistent effort would likely obscure discrimination of feigners from honest responders (Giromini et al., 2020c) . Indeed, we had no control over the participants, so feigners might have searched the internet for the answers or asked family members and friends how to respond to the items, etc. Successful feigning in this context might be easier compared to feigning in a real-life setting, in which the examinee has to perform continuously in front of the examiner (either in-person or live) during the administration of tests. And yet, the IOP-29 demonstrated similar levels of discrimination in online and in-person conducted samples.",

Prior to our investigation, indeed, tests evaluating response styles and the credibility of presented symptoms had yet to prove their validity and reliability in the context of remote testing. Research on the MMPI instruments, for instance, have only focused, so far, on the equivalence between in-person via paper-and-pencil versus in-person via computer administration formats, and studies addressing a similar research question with other SVTs (e.g., Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms, SIRS-2; Rogers et al., 2010; Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test, M-FAST; Miller, 2001 ; Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology, SIMS; Smith & Burger, 1997; Widows & Smith, 2005 ; Table 3 Validity of the IOP-29 in detecting feigned schizophrenia: comparison between in-person and online administrations a These data refer to Wood's (2008) psychotic subsample described in Study 3 of Viglione et al.'s (2017) article b These data refer to the psychotic subsample described in Giromini et al.'s (2018) article c These data refer to the schizophrenia-related subsample of Giromini et al.'s (2020b) article: this study used a within-subject design, in which participants were asked to take the IOP-29 three times, one time answering honestly, one time faking mental illness, and one time responding with a random-like approach d These data refer to the schizophrenic subsample described in Giromini et al.'s (2020d) article e These data refer to the schizophrenia-related subsample of Winters et al.'s (2020) article: this study used a within-subject design, in which participants were asked to take the IOP-29 three times, one time answering honestly, one time faking schizophrenia, and one time responding with a random-like approach Self-Report Symptom Inventory, SRSI; Merten et al., 2016 ) have yet to be published. With all due caution, our investigation thus provides some initial evidence that the validity of a self-report SVT like the IOP-29 may be expected to be preserved, when switching from a in person to an online/ remote format.",
