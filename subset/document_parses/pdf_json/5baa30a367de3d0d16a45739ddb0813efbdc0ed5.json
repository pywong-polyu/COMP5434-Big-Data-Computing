Besides, calories obtained from fiber-rich foods (e.g., pulses, whole grains, roots) have been decreasing, whereas calories obtained from oils, fats, meat, and sugars have been accelerating rapidly globally. Dietary patterns and nutrient intake are influenced by this nutrition transition, which affects the risk of developing NCDs [6] . On the other hand, physical inactivity, exposure to heavy metals (e.g., cadmium, mercury, lead), tobacco smoke, or the harmful use of alcohol also increase the risk of NCDs [3 ,7] .

            "text": "The benefits of nutrient-dense food-rich diets have been highlighted in terms of longevity, healthy aging, and morbidity [8] . Furthermore, several researchers have attempted to identify the role of diets in NCDs, with the relationships between multiple individual nutrients, fruit, and vegetable intake and NCDs still being controversial. For instance, some studies, for example, have shown that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have beneficial effects on arthritis [9] [10] [11] . However, some studies have found no link between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake and the risk of arthritis [12 ,13] . Our recent study also showed thiamine intake was associated with lower risks of NCDs (e.g., hypertension, myocardial infarction or angina, T2DM, depression, dyslipidemia) [4] . These studies have prompted the search for dietary factors that may aid in the prevention and control of NCDs. We hypothesized that higher intakes of multiple individual nutrients, fruits, or vegetables were linked with a low risk of CVD, T2DM, arthritis, and depression in the Korean population. Thus, data from national population-based surveys were used in this study to identify associations between CVD, T2DM, arthritis, and depression and dietary factors such as multiple individual nutrients, fruit, and vegetable intake. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between dietary factors and NCDs. We also identify the possible interaction of sex in the association of NCDs with total vitamin dietary factors. To visualize the moderating effects of hypertension and T2DM, marginal effects were employed using the results of logistic regression analysis. With our deeper analysis, our findings may partly explain sex differences in the association between dietary factors and CVDs, which was not explored enough. These findings also confirm the previ-ous findings showing the role of dietary factors in the pathology of CVDs. Taken together, this study may partly contribute to gaining a better understanding of the effects of dietary factors on NCDs in women and men.",

            "text": "Our hypothesis that an increased intake of multiple individual nutrients, fruits, or vegetables, was linked with the lower risk of CVC, T2DM, arthritis, and depression in the Korean population was confirmed by this study. Our study found a negative relationship between intakes of multiple individual nutrients, vegetables, and fruits and CVC, T2DM, arthritis, and depression in adults. An increase in daily vitamin (vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, C) and nutrient (potassium, protein, phosphorus, calcium, iron, MUFA, PUFA, n-3 fatty acid, n-6 fatty acid, water) intakes was associated with a lower prevalence of T2DM, hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, arthritis, and osteoarthritis, only in females. High fruit or vegetable consumption was linked with the low risk of cardiovascular diseases, T2DM, arthritis, and depression in both women and men. Diet is the most important modifiable factor in the prevention and management of NCDs. Evidence has reported an inverse association between NCDs (e.g., CVD, T2DM, arthritis, depression) and dietary patterns rich in multiple individual nutrients, fruits, and vegetables. Our study found that an increase in daily multiple individual nutrients, fruit, and vegetable intake was associated with a decrease in CVDs, which was in line with previous studies. Specifically, a Chinese study showed that consuming fresh fruits daily reduced blood glucose levels by 0.5 mmol/L, systolic blood pressure by 4.0 mmHg, which was negatively related to ischemic stroke (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.72-0.79), coronary heart disease (HR: 0.66; 95% CI, 0.58-0.75), and hemorrhagic stroke (HR: 0.64; 95% CI, 0.56-0.74), and the risks of cardiovascular death (HR: 0.60; 95% CI, 0.54-0.67), as compared with subjects who never or rarely consumed fresh fruit [24] . Another cohort study in China also found that higher dietary total fruit and vegetable intake protected against CVD; the HRs for vegetable and fruit intake were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.59-1.50) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.37-1.03), respectively [25] . Additionally, a Japanese study found that regular consumption of citrus fruit may reduce the risk of CVD, especially stroke and cerebral infarction; the HR for al- , monthly household income ( < 2000, \u22652000 and < 4000, \u22654000 and < 6000, \u22656000), physical activity (not regular, regular), BMI ( < 18.5, \u226518.5 and < 25, \u226525 and < 30, and \u226530 kg/m 2 ), high-risk drinking (yes, no), and cotinine, physical activity (not regular, regular), BMI ( < 18.5, \u226518.5 and < 25, \u2265 25 and < 30, and \u226530 kg/m 2 ), high-risk drinking (yes, no), and cotinine-verified smoker (yes, no), smoking status (non/exsmoker, current smoker), occupation (white-collar, blue-collar, none), education levels ( \u2264middle school, high school, \u2265college), energy intake (Kcal).

BMI, body mass index; CVD, cardiovascular disease; FFQ, food frequency questionnaire; MI, myocardial infarction; MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acid; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; Ref, reference value. most daily intake versus infrequent intake of citrus fruit was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.29-0.88) in women and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.33-1.01) in men [26] . Furthermore, 2 cohort studies conducted in England and Australia found that eating fruits decreases the risk of total CVD mortality in women aged 35 to 69 and > 70 years [27 ,28] . In terms of T2DM, our study found that increased intakes of multiple individual nutrients, vegetables, and fruits were linked with the low risk of developing T2DM. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 prospective cohort studies also showed that a higher intake of fruit (relative risk [RR] 0.91; 95% CI, 0.87-0.96), and green leafy vegetables (RR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93), yellow vegetables (RR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57-0.90), cruciferous vegetables (RR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-0.99) is associated with a lower risk of T2DM compared with the lowest intake [29] . Du et al. found consuming fresh fruit daily reduced blood glucose levels by 0.5 mmol/L, compared with subjects who never or rarely consumed fresh fruit [24] . On the other hand, nutrients play an important role in regulating blood pressure and preventing CVD and T2DM. Our study suggested that increased nutrient intake (e.g., potassium, protein, n-3, n-6, MUFA, PUFA, water, vitamins, iron) reduces the risk of CVD (e.g., hypertension, MI or angina, MI, stroke) and T2DM, which concurs with the findings of previous studies. For instance, Ascherio et al. found that increased daily consumption of protein and potassium may have a blood pressure-lowering effect [30] . A recent metaanalysis of prospective cohort studies reported that intake of plant protein was related to a lower risk of all-cause mortality (pooled effect size 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97) and CVD mortality (pooled hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96). Our recent study suggested that increased vitamin B1 and B2 intake can reduce the risk of developing metabolic syndrome, which is the most common cause of NCDs [3 ,4 ,7] . A cohort study and 2 meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials showed potential benefits of a high-MUFA and PUFA diet in improving metabolic factors (e.g., serum lipids, blood pressure, glycemic control) among both healthy individuals and T2DM patients [31] [32] [33] . A recent study also reported that dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake was negatively related to the risk of hypertension in US adults [34] . Sciacqua et al. showed that lower levels of serum phosphorus are associated with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance [35] . In the present study, iron Table 3 intake was negatively associated with the risk of CVDs and T2DM. A literature review showed the association between iron and an increased risk of CVDs and T2DM [36] . Fernandez-Cao et al. also reported that high dietary intake of heme iron was related to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk [37] . A meta-analysis of 11 prospective studies found dietary total iron, non-heme iron, or supplemental iron intakes were not related to the risk of developing T2DM [38] . Thus, further prospective studies with robust evaluations of dietary and supplement sources of iron intake and CVD and T2DM outcomes are required. Arthritis is a public health concern that affects a significant majority of the population and is related to a lower quality of life. Our study found that intakes of multiple individual nutrients, fruits, and vegetables were negatively associated with arthritis. This is supported by a previous cross-sectional study of 6588 subjects aged \u226550 years suggesting that a higher consumption of vegetables and fruits was related to a reduced prevalence of severe knee pain (OR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.48-0.73) compared with a lower consumption of vegetables and fruits [39] . The anti-inflammatory function of B vitamins is directly associated with their pain modulatory role [40] . These findings suggested that increased vitamin B1 and B3 intake could affect pain alleviation and inflammation. Jalal et al. reported that vitamin B1 (150 and 200 mg/kg) may reduce thermal hyperalgesia, paw edema, and serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1 \u03b2 during complete Freund adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats [40] . On the other hand, we found increased intakes of protein, water, and PUFA were negatively related to the risk of developing arthritis and osteoarthritis. PUFA has been shown to provide therapeutic benefits for arthritis patients due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Thomas et al. suggested that increased consumption of long-chain n-3 fatty-acids (oily fish/fish oil supplements) could improve function and pain in osteoarthritis patients [41] . However, a recent study found no links between n-6 PUFA and the consequences of arthritis [42] . Therefore, more prospective studies with robust assessments of dietary and supplement sources of PUFA intake and arthritis consequences are required.",

Of note, Zwart et al. reported lower protein intake was related to lower upper leg muscle strength. However, Nicola et al. found high dietary protein intake could increase the risk of falls in older persons [45 ,46] . These findings show that the role of protein intake in arthritis remains unclear.

Our study found that higher consumption of vitamins, nutrients, and vegetables is associated with a significantly lower risk of depression development, which is consistent with previous studies. A systematic review and metaanalysis of 27 articles including 16 cross-sectional, 9 cohort, and 2 case-control studies on fruit, vegetables, and/or total fruit and vegetable consumption for depression [47] . The results showed that consumption of vegetables was related to a 14% lower risk of depression (overall RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.98) in cohort studies and a 25% lower risk of depression (overall RR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91) in cross-sectional studies. A higher intake of fruits has reduced the risk of depression by 17% (RR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.98) in cohort studies and 24% (RR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.92) in cross-sectional studies [48] . B vitamins are essential in the neurochemical pathways involving dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic systems as well as GABA and glutamate neurotransmitter systems. Our recent study found that increased daily vitamin B1 intake can reduce the prevalence of depression [4] . A literature review also showed B vitamins (e.g., vitamins B1, B3, B6, B9, B12) are vital for neuronal function, and insufficiencies have been related to depression [49] . Although the mechanism underlying depression and vitamins A and C is unclear, it is possible to speculate that it is related to oxidative stress and inflammation. A meta-analysis reported that vitamin C deficiency has been related to cognitive impairment and depression [50] . In the present study, we found increased daily vitamin A intake was negatively related to the risk of depression. Our result supports a previous study, in which low serum levels of carotenoids are related to depressive symptoms and increase the risk of developing new depressive symptoms in older persons [51] .",

Our study found that intakes of multiple individual nutrients were linked with a lower risk of CVDs (e.g., hypertension, stroke, MI, MI or angina), diabetes and dyslipidemia in women, but not in men. It could be explained that multiple individual nutrients, fruits, and vegetables may modulate molecular events and signaling pathways associated with reducing lipid metabolism disorders, correcting endothelial dysfunction, suppressing platelet function, inhibiting thrombosis, antihypertension, alleviating ischemia/reperfusion injury, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting inflammatory responses [51] . Antioxidant vitamins (vitamins C, E, and A), for example, and B vitamins can reduce oxidative stress, which may play a key role in the pathogene-sis of atherosclerosis and CVDs [52] . On the other hand, B vitamins have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects that are related to opioid-like mechanisms and are mediated through the release of nitrite oxide [53] . B vitamins may increase the activity of 5-HT, as well as the effect and/or availability of norepinephrine, which contributes to pain transmission as an inhibitory pain transmitter [54] . Vitamin D can also induce cardioprotective effects and plays an important role in maintenance of cardiovascular health [55] . n-3 and n-6 fatty acids may reduce blood cholesterol and/or triglycerides, esterify cholesterol, reduce blood viscosity, improve blood microcirculation, and reduce platelet aggregation and/or thrombosis [56] . These findings support the current recommendation of increasing multiple individual nutrients, fruit and vegetable intake to lower the risk of NCDs.",

However, our study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional method used prevented the assessment of causality between NCDs and multiple individual nutrients, fruit, and vegetable intakes. Second, because no physiological antioxidant status markers were assessed during KN-HANES, oxidation status and multiple individual nutrient levels in serum and tissue were not evaluated. Several serum vitamins, including vitamin E and vitamin D, were assessed. Third, intakes of multiple individual nutrients were evaluated based on 24-hour recall, and, therefore, may have been under or overestimated. A 24-hour recall, on the other hand, was discovered to be an effective method of evaluating food intake, and all subjects were instructed to maintain their usual dietary habits before the evaluations.
