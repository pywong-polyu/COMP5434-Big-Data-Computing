In two-person technique, when bag-valve-mask ventilation is performed, one paramedic maintaining a two-handed grip on the mask to ensure a tight seal while the other paramedic squeezes the bag [15] . The participant held the facemask of the Ambu1-Bag on the manikin while concurrently a study investigator was activating the Ambu1-Bag ( Fig 1B) . To optimally mimic ventilation in-vivo, we assembled a system that measured tidal volumes during ventilation [17] . A test lung (EasyLung\u2122, compliance 25 ml/mbar, resistance 20 mbar/L/s, maximal volume 1000 ml IMT Medica, Buchs, Switzerland) was placed inside the manikin's chest, replacing the original manikin's lungs and not visible from the outside. The test lung was connected to a flow analyzer (PF-300, IMT Analytics AG, Buchs, Switzerland) which was connected through a sealed tube to the manikin's trachea. The flow analyzer was located on a nearby table and was visible to a second study investigator ( Fig 1B) [17] .

The overall intubation success rates and the success rates on first-attempt were similar for both groups, and were in the range of 70-90 percent. These findings suggest that with proper training, paramedics who are inexperienced with box barrier use, are able to successfully perform tracheal intubation using the box while wearing PPE. These findings are corroborated by similar studies that examined the success rates of anesthesiologists using videolayngoscopy [18, 20] . In one study, eight anesthesiologists wearing PPE performed endotracheal intubation on an airway model using four videolaryngoscopy devices, and a direct laryngoscope. Success rates were 100 percent with each of the laryngoscopes except with the Airtraq1 AVANT videolaryngoscope (85.7 percent) [18] . In another study with 12 anesthesiologists as participants, first-attempt success rates using videolaryngoscopy was 10/10 without the barrier box, and 9/12 and 10/12 with a barrier box [20] . These results are in the range of values reported in our study. We found that intubation time with DL was almost 1.4 times longer with the barrier box compared to no box (37 sec vs 27 sec). Prolonged intubation times with the use of a barrier box were also reported when anesthesiologists and intensivists performed the procedure with videolaryngoscopy. In these studies, the duration of intubation time was 1.1-1.8 longer with the protective box compared to no box [20, 21] .",

Participants of the DL-first group disagreed with the statement that intubation was easy. These findings suggest that participants felt less comfortable with the barrier box despite the training they received prior to the study, a finding that is consistent with the results of a recent study [21] .",

Firstly, given the difficulty in recruiting active paramedics to the study during times of the pandemic, the sample size in this pilot study was relatively small, and a power analysis was not conducted prior to conducting the study. Secondly, we did not examine other types of protective barriers such as tents, hoods, or canopies. Thirdly, this was a simulation study; therefore, the applicability of the data to real-life scenarios is unknown. Fourthly, most data regarding the ability of barrier-enclosure systems such as the box barrier used in our study to contain or limit aerosols, is of low-level evidence [23] .",
