            "text": "Coconut neera is a nutritious natural drink that is rich in amino acids, polyphenols, vitamins, and minerals. Nevertheless, the inherent presence of yeast activates natural fermentation. To prevent the fermentation process, it is necessary to reduce the yeast load in fresh neera, at the earliest possible. In this research, an electrospun polycaprolactone nanofibrous membrane was used for the removal of yeast from coconut neera. Randomly oriented non-woven nanofibers were fabricated using the electrospinning process. The process conditions were optimized at 15 kV applied voltage, 8 cm distance between the spinneret needle and the collector plate, and 1.6 ml/h feed flow rate for the best nanofiber characteristics and high filtration efficiency. The optimized nanofibrous membrane for neera filtration had an average fiber diameter of 942 nm, average porosity of 73.26%, and a mean thickness of 150 \u00b5m. Results confirmed that the porosity of the membrane had a significant effect on the flow rate of permeate. The biochemical characteristics of neera filtrate were investigated. In comparison with fresh neera, the filtered counterpart had significant changes in titratable acidity, pH, and color. While no significant changes were observed in total soluble solids content, slight reductions were noted in the total polyphenolic content and minerals. Importantly, the neera filtrate obtained through the optimized nanofibrous membrane showed a 2 log-reduction in yeast load. The effective reusability of the membrane and stability of the nanofiber morphology at repeated usage was confirmed. This approach shows prospects for neera filtration while retaining nutrient content and can be extended to other natural extract applications.",

Fresh neera is sweet, contains sugars with less percentage of fructose, oyster-white, and translucent in appearance [1] . It is rich in amino acids, minerals, and vitamins. It has a neutral pH, low calorific value, and low glycemic index (around 35) [2, 3] . Neera provides various health benefits; for example, it is known to improve digestion, provides instant energy, prevents damage of cells, lowers blood pressure, reduces cholesterol level, contributes to skin health. It also aids in postoperative care due to the presence of high electrolyte contents [4] . This explains the growing demand for this product and necessitates the requirement for appropriate post-harvest processing and preservation techniques. This is of significant interest as coconut as a crop is specific to certain regions of the world, and value addition/preservation of neera has significant health, technological, and economic benefits [5] .",

Fermented neera is known as 'toddy', an alcoholic beverage [9, 10] . Alternatively, an acetic fermentation process can yield 'coconut vinegar' [11, 12] . Post-harvest processing and preservation techniques hold an indispensable role in the shelf-life of coconut neera. Especially, the removal of yeast from coconut neera is a major concern associated with quality.

            "text": "Electrospinning is an electrohydrodynamic process that involves the fabrication of nanofibrous membranes by the random orientation of non-woven nanofibers under high electrostatic fields at a voltage of around 1-30 kV [16, 17] . Electrospun nanofibers have versatile applications in biomedical (scaffolds, drug delivery, regenerative medicine, medical textile, protective masks), textile (smart fabrics, protective clothing, waterproof textiles), environmental protection, food packaging, sensing, immobilization, catalyst, filtration, membranes, and cosmetic sectors [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Interestingly, nanofibrous membranes have a high surface-area-to-volume ratio which allows permeate flow at a higher rate, and the porosity of the nanofibrous membrane is responsible for filtration efficiency [23] . The applications of the electrospun nanofibrous membrane in food science, beverage, and water filtration/ treatment are well documented [24] [25] [26] [27] . Nanofibrous membranes have been explored for different beverage filtration applications ranging from clarification to removal to selective adsorption of unwanted polyphenols [28] . Interestingly, in certain cases, they can offer a 'one-step' clarification process without the need for filter aids and enzymatic treatments in beverage processing. This work reports the first-of-its-kind study on the filtration of neera using an electrospun nanofibrous membrane. It demonstrates the use of electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibrous membrane for coconut neera filtration. The interconnected porosity of nanofibrous membranes does not allow macromolecules (in this case, yeast with an average size of 4-10 \u00b5m) to penetrate through the membrane. However, it can allow micromolecules, micronutrients, and antioxidants, to flow through the membrane. PCL is a lowcost biodegradable synthetic polymer and exhibits good mechanical and antimicrobial properties. It is a biocompatible material approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [29, 30] . Also, it is authorized as a direct food contact material by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and FDA [31, 32] . Hence, PCL was chosen as the polymeric material for nanofibrous membrane fabrication. The findings of this study will explicit the ability of electrospun nanofibrous membrane in the removal of yeasts from coconut neera.",

The spinneret needle was connected with the power supply at a high voltage, and a potential difference was created between the spinneret needle and the collector plate. The flow rate of feed solution and the work distance between the spinneret needle and the collector plate were varied at fixed a voltage of 15 kV (optimized to form Taylor cone, based on preliminary trials).

The permeate flow rate was found to be 6.73 \u00b1 0.99 L/h, 6.61 \u00b1 0.94 L/h, and 2.94 \u00b1 0.39 L/h for NF01, NF02, and NF03, respectively. Figure 2b shows the permeate flow rate of neera across the nanofibrous membranes. The results expressed that there was no significant difference in porosity between NF01 and NF02 membranes. But both these membranes showed significant differences from the NF03 membrane. Thus, the results demonstrate that the porosity of the nanofibrous membrane has a great impact on the flow rate of permeate. It was observed that the permeate flow rate was increased with an increase in porosity of the membrane. Thus, the permeability of filtrate depends on the porosity of the nanofibrous membranes. Fuenmayor et al., [41] reported that the high porosity (94%) of the electrospun nylon-6 nanofibrous membrane was solely responsible for the increase in permeate flux (1.30 kg/ m 2 h) across the membrane. Adsorption of particles or impurities reduces the porosity of the membrane and leads to a decrease in permeate flux across the membrane. The vacuum can be applied on the downstream side of the membrane to increase the permeate flow rate, thereby enhancing the permeate flux of the membrane. Furthermore, this nanofiber membrane showed better retention of antioxidant activity of apple juice, while selectively removing the bitter phenolic compounds. The nanofiber membrane showed superior performance in removal of color and turbidity compared to the microporous membrane and supported extended stability and shelf-life of beverage products. Bortolassi et al. [42] fabricated a PAN-based composite nanofiber filtration membrane using an electrospinning method and reported mean nanofiber diameters of 292 \u00b1 6 nm, 242 \u00b1 5 nm, and 289 \u00b1 5 nm for Ag/PAN, TiO 2 /PAN, and ZnO/PAN nanofibrous membranes, respectively, which formed mean pore sizes of 1.12 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b5m, 1.45 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b5m, and 2.03 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b5m, respectively. Also, they observed that Ag/PAN electrospun nanofibrous membranes show the highest permeability than other counterparts (TiO 2 /PAN, ZnO/PAN) due to reduced pressure drop (68.13 Pa) across the filter.",

It was determined by the index of refraction using a refractometer, and the values were compared with the control. TSS of the samples was measured in terms of \u00b0Brix, and it was observed to be 16.70 \u00b1 0.17, 16.47 \u00b1 0.47, 15.60 \u00b1 0.72, and 15.07 \u00b1 1.80 for control, NF01, NF02, and NF03, respectively. The results showed that the neera filtrate had slightly lower TSS as compared to the neera control. However, there were no significant differences in TSS content among the neera filtrates filtered across the different nanofibrous membranes as well as with the control. Cassano et al. [43] developed poly(ether ether ketone) and polysulfone membranes by the dry-wet spinning method for pomegranate juice clarification reported that the TSS content (\u00b0Brix) of juice was reduced to 15.4 \u00b1 0.25 and 15.4 \u00b1 0.09 from 16.0 \u00b1 0.10 and 16.0 \u00b1 0.28 while filtration through the poly(ether ether ketone) and polysulfone membranes, respectively. In a different study, Lemma et al. [44] reported the TSS content of beer (5.33 \u00b1 0.05\u00b0Brix) remained constant even after filtration with the electrospun nylon nanofibrous membrane. Najafi et al. [40] used a nanofiber membrane to concentrate the pomegranate juice and reported that the TSS content of 35.7\u00b0Brix was arrived after concentrated with polysulfone/Triton X-100 nanofiber membrane. Battirola et al. [45] observed a significant reduction in TSS contents in fruit juices and whey after filtration with the cellulose acetate/cellulose nanofiber membranes. They reported that the TSS content (\u00b0Brix) of strawberry and raspberry juices were reduced to 1.95 \u00b1 0.49 and 2.55 \u00b1 0.07 from 2.95 \u00b1 0.07 and 2.90 \u00b1 0.00, respectively. Similarly, the TSS content (\u00b0Brix) of whey was reduced to 6.88 \u00b1 0.85 and 6.10 \u00b1 0.00 from 7.40 \u00b1 0.14 and 6.35 \u00b1 0.07 while filtration through the cellulose acetate/cellulose nanofiber membrane in the dead-end cell and tangential modules, respectively. TA indicates the acidity of the neera samples. The acidity of the neera filtrate and fresh neera (control) was measured in terms of the percentage of citric acid. The percentage of TA was found to be 2.77 \u00b1 0.20, 1.98 \u00b1 0.29, 1.88 \u00b1 0.15, and 1.77 \u00b1 0.04 for control, NF01, NF02, and NF03, respectively. The results showed that the nanofiber filtration process efficiently decreased the TA of neera. There was no significant difference in TA among the neera filtrates, but the filtrates showed a significant difference against the control.",

Moreover, NF01 showed significant differences between NF02 and NF03 counterparts. But there was no significant difference between NF02 and NF03. A similar study was reported by Lemma et al. [44] , who developed electrospun nylon nanofibrous membranes with a fiber diameter of 197 \u00b1 31 nm and porosity of ~ 90% and investigated their potential for the removal of bacterial and yeast strains in water and beer. They fortified beer suspensions at different microbial concentrations such as 5. The reusability of the selected nanofiber membrane (NF02) was tested multiple times. At the 5th use, the permeate flow rate was reduced by around 50%. Hence, the yeast count was tested after the 5th usage, and it found that control levels were the same as at the first usage of the membrane. The morphology of the nanofiber membrane just after the 5th usage of filtration (Fig. 3a) shows the deposition of neera on the membrane. However, after the washing step, fouling on the membrane was removed, and only yeast cells were retained on the membrane (Fig. 3b) . It was evident that the nanofiber membrane was stable even after repeated usage, washing, and sterilization processes. This proves the reusability of the prepared membrane and the stability of nanofibers. Comparing the different sterilization techniques for PCL nanofiber membranes, Horakova et al., (2020) proved that soaking in aqueous ethanol (70%) for 30 min and UV irradiation for 30 min does not cause any morphological change [48] . This supports the suitability of the selected sterilization technique for the filtration process and reusability of the membrane.",

But in terms of filtration efficiency, it showed a low permeate flow rate (2.94 \u00b1 0.39 L/h) due to less porosity (69.55%). The NF02 nanofibrous membrane was optimized because of increased porosity (73.26%) and permeate flow rate (6.61 \u00b1 0.94 L/h) while supporting yeast load reduction (2.57 \u00d7 10 4 CFU/ml). Also, it could retain the TPC and showed TSS, TA, pH, and color equivalent to NF03. Hence, the process parameters involved in the fabrication of NF02 membrane are considered as optimized electrospinning parameters. Further, the NF02 nanofibrous membrane showed better retention of minerals and the efficient removal of yeast cells (2 log reduction). Moreover, effective reusability of the nanofibrous membrane was observed for up to 5 usages.

They reported that nylon nanofibrous membranes completely removed yeast (S. cerevisiae) and mixed bacterial cultures (F. johnsoniae and I. fluviatilis); whereas, 3 and 5 log reductions could be achieved in the beer suspensions fortified with I. fluviatilis and F. johnsoniae, respectively. Bortolassi et al.[42] observed the efficient removal of bacterial cells using the composite-based Ag/PAN nanofiber filtration membrane and reported the reduction of the bacterial load from 10 8 CFU/mL to 10 3 CFU/mL while filtration through the Ag/PAN nanofibrous membrane. In another study, Ma et al.[46] developed functionalized PAN electrospun membranes by a surface modification process for the removal of bacteria and viruses. They reported that surface-modified PAN electrospun membrane showed efficient removal of Escherichia coli and MS2 phage at 99.9999% and 99.99%, respectively.",
