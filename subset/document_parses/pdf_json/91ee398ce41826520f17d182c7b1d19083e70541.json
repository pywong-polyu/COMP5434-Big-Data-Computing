Retrospective reviews were performed in adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients during March-May 2020. For cohort 1, we excluded hospital transfers, renal disease and extra-pulmonary infection without isolated pathogen(s). For cohort 2, we further excluded microbiologically confirmed infection, 'do not resuscitate \u00b1 do not intubate' status, and intensive care unit (ICU). For cohort 1, PCT was compared between absent/low-suspicion and proven bacterial co-infections. Factors associated with elevated PCT and sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV of PCT cutoffs for identifying bacterial co-infections were explored. For cohort 2, clinical outcomes including mechanical ventilation within 5 days (MV5) were compared between the antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups stratified by PCT \u2265 0.25 \u00b5g/L. Nine hundred and twenty four non-ICU and 103 ICU patients were included (cohort 1). The median PCT was higher in proven vs. absent/low-suspicion of bacterial co-infection. Elevated PCT was significantly associated with proven bacterial co-infection, ICU status and oxygen requirement. For PCT \u2265 0.25 \u00b5g/L, sensitivity/ specificity/PPV/NPV were 69/65/6.5/98% (non-ICU) and 75/33/8.6/94% (ICU). For cohort 2, 756/1305 (58%) patients were included. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups except PCT \u2265 0.25 \u00b5g/L (antibiotic:non-antibiotic = 59%:24%) and tocilizumab use (antibiotic:non-antibiotic = 5%:2%). 23% (PCT < 0.25 \u00b5g/L) and 58% (PCT \u2265 0.25 \u00b5g/L) received antibiotics. Antibiotic group had significantly higher rates of MV5. COVID-19 severity inferred from ICU status and oxygen requirement as well as the presence of bacterial co-infections were associated with elevated PCT. PCT showed poor PPV and high NPV for proven bacterial co-infections. The use of antibiotics did not show improved clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with PCT \u2265 0.25 \u00b5g/L outside of ICU when bacterial co-infections are of low suspicion.",

A PCT cutoff of 0.25 \u00b5g/L in non-intensive care unit (ICU) and 0.5 \u00b5g/L in ICU patients [5] were commonly used to indicate bacterial infection. Despite PCT's potential role as a tool to guide antibiotic therapy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , early reports of PCT in patients with COVID-19 did not incorporate bacterial co-infection data in their analyses [6, 7] , and used various normal PCT reference ranges from 0.05 \u00b5g/L to 5 \u00b5g/L with minimal information on its distribution [8] [9] [10] [11] . Furthermore, elevated PCT has been reported to be a predictor of severe disease in COVID-19 [6, [12] [13] [14] . While it is unknown to what extent PCT increase is driven by bacterial co-infection or the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 itself [15] , this clouds PCT's potential utility in predicting bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 patients.",

The rates of bacterial co-infections observed in our Cohort 1 were consistent with the results from meta-analyses for COVID-19 patients, which showed overall pooled rates of 7-8% (1-20%) [16, 19] . Multivariable analyses to examine the significant clinical factors associated with elevated PCT values suggested that COVID-19 disease severity as previously reported [3] [4] [5] as well as bacterial co-infection may be contributory to elevated PCTs altogether. Across all three PCT cutoffs, the NPV of PCT < 0.25 \u00b5g/L, < 0.5 \u00b5g/L or < 1 \u00b5g/L for ruling out proven bacterial co-infection was high (94-98%). In contrast to the high PPV of PCT \u2265 1 \u00b5g/L (i.e., 93%) ruling in bacterial co-infection observed in van Berkel's study [20] , our study showed poor PPV across all PCT cutoffs in both non-ICU and ICU populations. Baseline PCT < 0.25 \u00b5g/L drawn within 24 h of hospitalization had high NPV for bacterial co-infection in COVID-19, which suggests that antibiotic discontinuation may be warranted just as randomized controlled trials have shown in community-acquired pneumonia before the pandemic. An exception might be in the ICU population in which the specificity and NPV are decreased. In our Cohort 2 comparing clinical outcomes associated with antibiotic use stratified by PCT levels in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients with absent/low suspicion of bacterial co-infection, antibiotic use was not associated with improved outcomes. Comparison of clinical outcomes of antibiotic use was only done in non-critically ill patients given ICU status affects PCT levels and lack of respiratory samples in non-ICU patients poses challenges to diagnose bacterial coinfection. We also intended to evaluate the clinical outcomes only in patients with absent or low suspicion of bacterial co-infection since they have less obvious reasons to be on antibiotics as compared to those with proven bacterial infection. Cohort 2 showed lower rates of antibiotic prescribing (i.e., 23% in PCT < 0.25 \u00b5g/L and 58% in PCT \u2265 0.25 \u00b5g/L) than other reports published during the initial surge of COVID-19 in early 2020 ranging from 72% to over 90% [8, 9] . This low use in our study is likely from being a focused analysis in non-ICU patients and excluding all proven bacterial co-infections, although bacterial co-infections rates are expected to be low [7, 10, 19] . While we did not reinforce a PCT-guided algorithm during the study period, we also had a PCT-guided antibiotic use algorithm in place since 2019 that discourages antibiotic use when PCT < 0.25 \u00b5g/L [21] . While all of these might have contributed to our lower rates of antibiotic prescribing than other early observational studies in COVID-19 patients, 23% antibiotic use in PCT < 0.25 \u00b5g/L and 58% in PCT \u2265 0.25 \u00b5g/L groups still represent opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship when bacterial co-infections are absent or with low-suspicion.",

Given that baseline oxygen requirement and other characteristics were well balanced between antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups, the higher rates of progression into mechanical ventilation in the antibiotic group may reflect rapid deterioration. Likewise, more patients in the antibiotic group might have received tocilizumab due to worsening clinical status. Our study has limitations. First, this is a single-site study performed during the early phase of the pandemic and may not be generalized to other settings. Second, given the retrospective nature of the study, we cannot conclude any direct effect of antibiotic use on clinical outcomes in the analyses from Cohort 2, but our results reflect what happened in the clinical care of these patients. Third, we did not exclude all patients who might have elevated baseline PCT, such as major burns, severe trauma, and renally impaired, major abdominal or cardiothoracic surgery from Cohort 2 [22] . However, patients with baseline renal disease as well as overall comorbidities were balanced between the antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups. Finally, while more than 55% of our patients were hypoxic on admission from Cohort 2, less than 10% of the patients received systemic corticosteroids or remdesivir which are now considered the standard of therapy in hypoxic COVID-19 patients [23] . It would be interesting to see changes in antibiotic prescribing rate as well as the clinical outcomes with more knowledge about the low likelihood of bacterial co-infection upon hospital admission and with these standard therapies on board.",

            "text": "In this large study reporting PCT levels in COVID-19 patients, median PCT levels were higher in proven bacterial co-infections as compared to the cases with absent or low-suspicion of bacterial co-infections. Also, in COVID-19 patients outside of the ICU with low suspicion for bacterial co-infections, use of antibiotics did not improve clinical outcomes while antibiotic prescribing was more likely when PCT \u2265 0.25 \u00b5g/L than when PCT < 0.25 \u00b5g/L. The bacterial co-infection as well as ICU status and oxygen requirement at emergency department were associated with elevated baseline PCT level \u2265 0.25 \u00b5g/L. Compounded by the severity of illness and given the wide distribution regardless of bacterial co-infection, elevated PCTs in COVID-19 are unlikely to reliably distinguish patients with bacterial co-infections. However, given the low prevalence of bacterial co-infection in patients with PCT < 0.25 \u00b5g/L and high NPV, it is reasonable to discontinue antibiotics for majority of patients based on baseline PCT < 0.25 \u00b5g/L unless other evidence of infection is available. These data do not support antibiotic therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with PCT \u2265 0.25 \u00b5g/L outside of the ICU when bacterial co-infections are of low suspicion. Initial antibiotic decision-making (i.e., whether to withhold or initiate) should not be guided by pro-calcitonin values alone.",
