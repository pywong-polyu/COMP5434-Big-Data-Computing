This virus is a member of the beta-coronavirus family and shares 79.5% sequence homology with SARS CoV-1 [2] , which emerged in Southeast Asia in 2003, causing a limited epidemic [3] [4] [5] . Similar to SARS CoV-1 [6] , SARS CoV-2 enters host cells via its surface spike protein, which binds ACE2 on host cells [7] [8] [9] . SARS CoV-2 spike protein exists as a trimer, with three receptor-binding S1 heads located on top of a trimeric membrane fusion S2 stalk. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit specifically recognizes ACE2. Proteasemediated cleavage of the spike protein at the S1/S2 boundary leads to S1 dissociation and S2-mediated membrane fusion [10, 11] .",

            "text": "During viral infection, host cells recognize the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of the virus. For example, viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is sensed by the pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which include the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs; RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 ) [12, 13] and the toll-like receptors (TLRs) [14] [15] [16] . Recognition of SARS CoV-2 viral RNAs by these PRRs triggers the expression of type I IFN and other proinflammatory cytokines [17, 18] . IFN production during the early phase of viral infection is critical for the host to restrain replication of the virus. During evolution in their natural hosts (bats), coronaviruses have acquired the ability to suppress the early-phase IFN response by multiple mechanisms, including shielding of the dsRNA in double-membrane vesicles, which prevent the sensing by PRRs, inhibiting host protein synthesis, and disrupting essential signal transduction [17, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . While IFN production is blocked in most cell types following coronavirus infection, notable exceptions are plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which sense single-strand RNA via toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) and express high levels of type I IFN in response to coronavirus infection [19] . A delayed IFN response, together with a high load of virus and proinflammatory cytokines, causes an unbalanced immune state, promoting the progression of COVID-19 disease [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Severe COVID-19 patients exhibit high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, lymphopenia, T cell exhaustion and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios, which correlate with poor clinical outcomes.",

            "text": "SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 infect host cells by a similar mechanism [7, 8] . However, the viral shedding pattern and disease progression following infection differ between these two viruses [33] . Also, SARS CoV-2 causes a higher viral load than SARS CoV-1 during the early phase of infection [33] , but the reason for this difference is not clear. Interestingly, SARS CoV-1 spike protein has been reported to induce cytokine responses following its direct binding to ACE2 [34] . Given that SARS CoV-2 spike protein has a higher binding affinity to ACE2 than SARS CoV-1 spike protein [9, 10] , we reasoned that SARS CoV-2 spike protein might induce a more robust cytokine response than SARS CoV-1 in human PBMC. In this study, we report that some commercial lots of SARS CoV-2 spike protein-containing fusion proteins, but not lots of SARS CoV-1 or MERS spike protein-containing fusion proteins, stimulate human PBMC to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Unexpectedly, induction of cytokine production by SARS CoV-2 spike fusion proteins consistently exhibits vendor and batch variability, and cytokine inductions are not blocked by soluble ACE2 or neutralizing anti-spike protein antibody. Instead, we find that commercial spike fusion protein-containing reagents contain variable levels of LPS, which, in turn, correlate with their activities to induce cytokine production. The cytokine-inducing activities of spike fusion protein reagents are blocked by polymyxin B, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibitor. SARS CoV-2 spike protein efficiently captures soluble LPS, rendering it capable of potent pro-inflammatory cytokine induction. Collectively, these findings indicate that co-purifying LPS, but not spike protein itself, induces proinflammatory cytokine responses in human PBMC. These findings not only highlight the need to monitor LPS levels during in vitro and in vivo studies involving recombinant SARS CoV-2 spike protein, but they suggest a potential role for this interaction in virally infected tissues that harbor commensal bacteria.",

            "text": "To investigate the capability of SARS CoV-2 spike protein to directly induce a cytokine response, we cultured human PBMC from two healthy donors with a commercial SARS CoV-2 S1-Fc fusion protein (Vendor #1, lot 24056-2002-2). Following a 48 h stimulation, levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF\u03b1 were assessed by flow cytometry using a human inflammatory cytometric bead array (CBA) kit. Because IL-8 levels in some samples were too high to be accurately measured by the CBA assay, they were determined by ELISA. IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF\u03b1 were detected in the supernatants of SARS CoV-2 S1-Fc-treated PBMC from both donors, and this induction occurred in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1 ). We next directly compared the cytokine-inducing capabilities of MERS S1-Fc and SARS CoV-1 S1-Fc (Vendor #2), as well as SARS CoV-2 S1-Fc and RBD-Fc proteins from two commercial sources (Vendor #1 and Vendor #2). SARS CoV-2 S1-Fc from Vendor #2 and SARS CoV-2 RBD-Fc from Vendor #1 induced robust cytokine responses following 24 h culture, whereas the other fusion protein reagents or an IgG1 monoclonal antibody control (raxibacumab) did not ( Figure 2A and Table S1 ). Although cytokines were induced by two of the SARS CoV-2 reagents, there was no clear pattern between the manufacturer and/or fusion construct with respect to cytokine induction activity. It was also surprising that SARS CoV-1 S1-Fc fusion protein did not induce the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1, which is contradictory to a previous report (34) . In addition, to exclude a potential impact of FcR crosslinking by the Fc fusion proteins on the cytokine response, we performed experiments using biotinylated S1 and RBD proteins together with plate-bound streptavidin to stimulate human PBMC. As observed with S1 and RBD fusion protein reagents without biotin (Vendor #2), crosslinked S1-biotin but not RBD-biotin induced a robust cytokine response in human PBMC, suggesting that FcR crosslinking did not play a role ( Figure 2B and Table S2 ). Rested PBMC were cultured with or without 2.0 \u00b5g/mL of raxibacumab (human anti-anthrax PA IgG used as a negative control), MERS S1-Fc, SARS CoV-1 S1-Fc, SARS CoV-2 S1-Fc from Vendor #2 (V#2 S1-Fc) and Vendor #1 (lot 24529-2003, V#1 S1-Fc 2003), and RBD-Fc from Vendor #2 (V#2 RBD-Fc) and Vendor #1 (lot 24530-2003, V#1 RBD-Fc 2003) for 24 h. (B) Rested PBMC were cultured with or without plate-bound streptavidin (STAV) together with or without S1-biotin and RBD-biotin purchased from Vendor #2. The levels of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 were measured using the CBA human inflammatory cytokine kit and flow cytometric analysis. IL-8 levels were measured using an ELISA kit. The concentrations of the cytokines were calculated based on the standard curves, and the induction of cytokines were presented as cytokine induction (fold) calculated using cytokine concentrations and the formula: cytokine concentration of treated PBMC/cytokine concentration of untreated PBMC.

In contrast, JNK1/2 inhibition reduced the induction of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1; p38 inhibition reduced the induction of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1; and Erk1/2 inhibition reduced TNF\u03b1 induction ( Figure 3 and Table S1 ).",

In addition, batch variability in PBMC cytokine induction capacity was observed between S1-Fc and RBD-Fc protein lots purchased from Vendor #1 ( Figure S2 ). We reasoned that these inconsistencies could be due to product quality differences affecting spike protein binding to ACE2. To test this hypothesis, we developed an ELISA to measure the binding affinities of spike fusion protein constructs with ACE2. In this assay, ACE2 was coated on a plate, exposed to spike protein-containing test reagents, followed by incubation with HRP-labelled anti-human IgG Fc antibody and substrate development ( Figure S3 ). Absorbance values at 450 nm correlated linearly with the concentrations of S1-Fc protein ( Figure S3 ). Using this ELISA, we observed that SARS CoV-2 S1-Fc and RBD-Fc from both Vendor #1 and Vendor #2, as well as SARS CoV-1 S1-Fc, showed dose-dependent binding to ACE2, which did not correlate with their abilities to induce cytokine production ( Figure 4A ). Moreover, blockade of S1-Fc binding to ACE2 by soluble ACE2 and an anti-S1 neutralizing antibody did not block S1-induced production of IL-6, IL-8 or TNF\u03b1, despite blocking binding of the fusion proteins to ACE2 ( Figure  4B ,C and Figure S4 ). Of note, low levels of IL-8 production were observed in PBMC cultured with soluble ACE2 ( Figure 4C ) or anti-S1 antibody alone ( Figure S4 ). Taken together, our results suggest that the induction of key pro-inflammatory cytokines in human PBMC by certain commercial S1-Fc-fusion proteins occurs independent of ACE2 binding. Figure 3 .

In contrast, the commercial SARS CoV-1 S1-Fc fusion protein had a low level of LPS, in line with its inability to induce a cytokine response ( Figure 2) . Interestingly, LPS in these SARS CoV-2 S1-Fc protein preparations was not efficiently reduced following treatment of endotoxin removal using Pierce\u2122 high-capacity endotoxin removal spin columns ( Figure 5B ).

A time-course study showed that a strong cytokine response was induced as early as 3 h following S1-Fc protein stimulation ( Figure 5C ), consistent with the hypothesis that the induced cytokine responses were due to the presence of LPS. We next obtained additional spike proteins from Vendor #3, which has a 10-fold tighter control for the levels of endotoxin (<0.1 EU/\u00b5g protein). The low endotoxin levels in these proteins were confirmed using the LAL chromogenic endotoxin quantitation kit ( Figure S6A ). Consistent with a role for LPS, these protein preparations did not induce a robust cytokine response in human PBMC following 3 h and 24 h stimulations ( Figure S6B ). To further confirm that co-purifying LPS allows spike proteins to induce cytokine production, we cultured human PBMC with Vendor #2 S1-Fc for 3 h together with or without polymyxin B, an LPS inhibitor. S1-Fc-induced production of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1 was inhibited in the presence of polymyxin B ( Figure 5D ,E and Table S3 ). Taken together, these results indicate that co-purifying LPS, but not the spike protein itself, is responsible for the proinflammatory cytokine production in human PBMC.",

However, a small proportion of patients with COVID-19 progress to a severe disease [41, 42] . Severe disease is associated with an imbalanced immune response marked by delayed type I interferon responses to SARS CoV-2 and late-stage overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .

However, a small proportion of patients with COVID-19 progress to a severe disease [41, 42] . Severe disease is associated with an imbalanced immune response marked by delayed type I interferon responses to SARS CoV-2 and late-stage overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . SARS CoV-1 spike protein is reported to activate immune cells by direct binding to ACE to produce proinflammatory cytokines [34] . As SARS CoV-2 spike protein has a higher binding affinity to ACE2 than SARS CoV-1 spike protein [9] , this led to our original hypothesis that SARS CoV-2 spike protein might directly induce a robust cytokine response via its interaction with ACE2. Investigation of this potential mechanism was warranted, because SARS CoV-2 spike protein is the target antigen for SARS CoV-2 vaccines and for neutralizing antibody therapies [7, 8] . Moreover, investigation of cytokine induction by engagement of SARS CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2 had the potential to be the basis for a cell-based assay to evaluate the potency of FDA-regulated antibodies targeting SARS CoV-2 spike protein for COVID-19 therapies.",

Surprisingly, results from LAL assays revealed that the capability of the commercial S1 fusion proteins to induce cytokines directly correlated with their levels of LPS, and the pattern and time course of cytokine induction by these reagents closely matched that of LPS [40] . More convincing evidence supporting the role of the LPS pathway was the observation that S1-Fc-induced cytokine production was blocked by the LPS inhibitor, polymyxin B. In addition, blockade of MAPK signaling pathways, but not the NF-\u03baB pathway, inhibited cytokine induction by S1-Fc. These findings are consistent with a previous report that p38 and JNK1/2 pathways are central to LPS-induced cytokine responses [43] . Interestingly, SARS CoV-1 spike protein-induced IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 in murine RAW264.7 cells were reported to be mediated by the NF-\u03baB pathway by the She group [34] , suggesting that a different mechanism might be involved.",

For example, Hsu et al. reported that SARS CoV-2 spike protein promotes hyper-inflammatory response in human bronchial epithelial cells via ACE2-triggered MAP kinases-NF-\u03baB signaling pathways [36] , a result that contrasts with our findings. Although we cannot exclude a role for cell-specific effects, their source for S1-His and RBD-His was Vendor #2, whose controls on endotoxin levels (1 EU/\u00b5g protein) allow cytokine-inducing levels of LPS to be present in experimental conditions. Instead, our conclusions regarding a pro-inflammatory role for co-purifying LPS in commercial SARS CoV-2 spike protein preparations are consistent with Petruk et al., who reported that LPS binds to both SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 spike proteins with high affinity, rendering complexes capable of inducing cytokines, independent of the NF-\u03baB pathway [36] . However, we did not observe the synergistic effect between S1-Fc and LPS reported by Petruk et al., perhaps due to the different spike protein preparations and spike protein:LPS ratios employed in our experiments. Our results also are consistent with the report from the Shirato group, who reported that the SARS CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit induces pro-inflammatory responses via toll-like receptor 4 signaling in murine and human macrophages, the signaling pathway downstream of LPS recognition [44] . We note that the SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 spike proteins used in the studies of the She group and the Shirato group, respectively, were prepared using E. coli expression systems, where high-affinity binding to LPS would be very likely [34, 44] .",

In addition, polymyxin B completely blocks S1-Fc-induced IL-6 and TNF\u03b1, but not IL-8. These observations may suggest a potential role for S protein-ACE2 interactions in driving IL-8 induction. However, PBMC cultured with soluble ACE2 ( Figure 4C ) or anti-S1 antibodies alone ( Figure S4 ) also produce low levels of IL-8. Moreover, PBMC cultured with 0.35 mEU/mL of LPS for 24 h or 1.76 mEU/mL of LPS for 3 h results in low-level production of IL-8 ( Figure S8 ).

Careful monitoring of SARS CoV-2 spike protein reagents for LPS contamination is needed when these reagents are used for in vitro and in vivo studies. The strong binding activity of the spike protein with LPS enables the spike protein to function as a scaffold to capture LPS in vitro and, presumably, in vivo in virally infected mucosal tissues with abundant commensal bacteria. Moreover, as patients with certain COVID-19 risk factors such as diabetes and obesity are characterized by increased levels of Gram-negative commensal bacteria in potential sites of infection such as the lung [48] , this interaction could underlie a potential pathogenic mechanism intensifying damaging inflammation in susceptible patient groups.",
