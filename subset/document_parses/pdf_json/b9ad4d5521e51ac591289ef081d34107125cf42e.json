Butyrate is a critical product of beneficial microbes in the colon, which exerts extraordinary anti-cancer activities. In particular, butyrate shows biased inhibitory effects on the cell growth of cancerous colonocytes, whereas it is the major energy source for normal colonocytes. Besides its roles as the histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor and the ligand for G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 109a, the influence of butyrate on the glucose metabolism of cancerous colonocytes and the underlying molecular mechanism are not fully understood. Here, we show that butyrate markedly inhibited glucose transport and glycolysis of colorectal cancer cells, through reducing the abundance of membrane GLUT1 and cytoplasmic G6PD, which was regulated by the GPR109a-AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, butyrate significantly promoted the chemotherapeutical efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on cancerous colonocytes, with exacerbated impairment of DNA synthesis efficiency. Our findings provide useful information to better understand the molecular basis for the impact of butyrate on the glucose metabolism of colorectal cancer cells, which would promote the development of beneficial metabolites of gut microbiota as therapeutical or adjuvant anticancer drugs.",

Increased glucose uptake and enhanced glycolysis has been identified as a hallmark of cancer cells, with upregulated levels of transporters and enzymes involved in glucose metabolism (Liberti and Locasale, 2016) . The accelerated glucose metabolism of cancer cells provides sufficient metabolite precursors and energy to sustain fast cell growth (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011; Al-Shammari et al., 2019) , and the dependence on such metabolic alteration of cancer cells provides a reliable target to specifically eliminate or suppress tumor growth by inhibition of glycolysis . Exploration of more glycolysis inhibitors as potential anticancer drugs is significant to promote the development of anticancer therapy, which is especially important during the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 , since tumor management of immunotherapy and surgery was observed to increase the severity of infectious outcome of some patients with both COVID-19 and cancer (Finley et al., 2020) .",

A plenty of studies have been performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism for the anticancer effects of butyrate. Through inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs), butyrate could inactivate several oncogenic signaling pathways in cancerous cells (Wan et al., 2017) , e.g., mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) signaling pathway which inhibits apoptosis and promote rapid proliferation of cancer cells , and small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (SMAD3) signaling pathway, one of the key activators in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Wawruszak et al., 2019) . Butyrate has also been identified as a ligand for G protein-coupled receptor 109a (GPR109a) in cancerous cells, which regulates tumor growth by activating the downstream signal cascade of GPR109a (Thangaraju et al., 2009) . The WNT signaling pathway, which is able to modulate the expression of various oncogenes, could be suppressed by the activation of GPR109a by butyrate, leading to the impairment of tumor growth . Notably, butyrate has been shown to preferentially inhibit the proliferation of cancerous colonocytes, whereas supply energy source for normal colonocytes (Liu et al., 2018) . Besides revealing its role in activating the GPR109a mediated signaling pathway and acting as the HDACs inhibitor (Koh et al., 2016) , its influence on the glucose metabolism of cancerous colonocytes and the underlying molecular mechanism are not fully explored.",

In the two colorectal cancer cell lines, around 70% decrease in GLUT1 expression resulting from butyrate addition was consistently observed, indicating a prominent role of butyrate in inhibiting glucose metabolism of colorectal cancer cells by reducing the expression level of GLUT1 ( Figures 1B,D) . And butyrate also regulates the mRNA level of GLUT1 in HT29 and HCT8 cells, suggesting that the regulation of GLUT1 in colorectal cancer cells is a common phenomenon (Supplementary Figure S1) . The impact of butyrate on the abundance and distribution of GLUT1 at the protein level was further studied by measuring the total and membrane protein amount of GLUT1 ( Figure 1C ). The total content of GLUT1 in HCT116 and LoVo cells was significantly reduced by 15 and 24%, while the membrane fraction in HCT116 and LoVo cells was significantly reduced by 60 and 40% in response to butyrate treatment, respectively ( Figure 1C) .

After incubation with 2 mM butyrate or PBS for 24 h, the total protein amount of AKT in HCT116 and LoVo cells was found to be constant w/o butyrate treatment, while the phosphorylation level of AKT was significantly decreased by butyrate in both cell lines (Figure 2A) .

Furthermore, DNA synthesis efficiencies of HCT116 and LoVo cells being treated by 2 mM butyrate were promoted by SC79, indicated by the increase of OD value in BrdU incorporation assay from 1.37 to 1.64 and from 1.41 to 1.67, respectively ( Figure 4C ). These results indicated that AKT signaling pathway was closely involved in regulating G6PD content and DNA synthesis efficiency as well as membrane abundance of GLUT1 and glucose uptake rate of colorectal cancer cells.",

            "text": "AKT signaling pathway has been reported to be highly related to the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to chemotherapy (Radisavljevic, 2015) . Therefore, it is speculated that butyrate might affect the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to the chemotherapeutical drug 5-FU via modulating the AKT signaling pathway. The apoptosis activities of HCT116 cells under various growth conditions were analyzed, which were treated with PBS vehicle, 2 mM butyrate, 1.92 \u03bcM 5-FU, or the combination of 2 mM butyrate and 1.92 \u03bcM 5-FU. In comparison to HCT116 cells added with PBS vehicle, butyrate induced apoptosis in 9% of HCT116 cells, probably resulting from its inhibitory effects on the glucose metabolism and DNA synthesis of colorectal cancer cells ( Figure 5A) . A high level of apoptosis of HCT116 cells was elicited by 5-FU, which was further enhanced from 13 to 22% by the combined treatment of butyrate and 5-FU, suggesting that butyrate markedly enhances the chemotherapeutical efficacy of 5-FU on colorectal cancer cells. Extra 10.96 \u03bcM SC79 was added into the culture medium of HCT116 cells under those treating conditions, while the apoptosis effects of butyrate, and a combination of butyrate and 5-Fu were observed to be abolished by SC79, with decreased ratios of apoptotic cells from 9 to 2.5% and from 22 to 9%, respectively. These results indicate that AKT signaling pathway is essential for butyrate to enhance the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to the chemotherapeutical drug 5-FU. The apoptosis behaviors of HCT116 cells under various treating condition were measured using flow cytometry. In the first row (marked as \"Con\" on the left side), the apoptosis activities of HCT116 cells under four growth conditions were shown, which were treated with PBS vehicle (labeled as \"Con\" on the top side), 2 mM butyrate (labeled as \"NaB\"), 1.92 \u03bcM 5-FU (labeled as \"5-FU\"), or the combination of 2 mM butyrate and 1.92 \u03bcM 5-FU (labeled as \"NaB+5FU\"). In the second row, the apoptosis activities of HCT116 cells under various growth conditions as well as extra addition of 10.96 \u03bcM SC79 were displayed (marked as \"SC79\" on the left side).

            "text": "In the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), clinical treatment of cancer patients is more challenging. Cancer patients including gastrointestinal cancers are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Liang et al., 2020) , and are at remarkably higher risk of getting severe outcomes after invaded by SARS-CoV-2 (Dai et al., 2020) . However, several treating approaches for tumor management showed exacerbated progress of COVID-19 disease in some circumstances. Among 105 COVID-19 patients with cancer, tumor management including immunotherapy and surgery within 40 days before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms led to enhanced frequency of critical COVID-19 outcomes (Dai et al., 2020) . Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were observed to be one predictor for severe syndromes in another cohort of 423 patients with COVID-19 and cancer (Robilotti et al., 2020) . Therefore, it should be more cautious to choose appropriate therapeutical drugs for optimal management of tumors, with minimal adverse effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection. In previous studies, it is demonstrated that butyrate could improve the antivirus capacity of humans and experimental animals by maintaining the hemostasis of gut microbiota, improving the barrier functionality of mucosa, and orchestrating the innate and adaptive immune responses (Trompette et al., 2018) . The inhibiting capacity of butyrate on the glucose metabolism of cancerous colonocytes as well as its beneficial effects in modulating antivirus responses reported in previous studies, make it a superior medicine or adjuvant drug in treating colorectal cancer patients in the COVID-19 pandemic.",
