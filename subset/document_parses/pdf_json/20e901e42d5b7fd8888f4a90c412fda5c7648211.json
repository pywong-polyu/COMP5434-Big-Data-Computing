However, due to the low viral titers in clinical samples, certain amplification steps are required for viral genome sequencing. At present, there are no universal primers available for alphacoronaviruses and that, since these viruses have diverse strains, new primers specific to the target strain must be continuously developed for sequencing. Thus, in this study, we aimed to develop a universal primer set valid for all human alphacoronaviruses and applicable to samples containing trace amounts of the virus. To this aim, we designed overlapping primer pairs capable of amplifying the entire genome of all known human alphacoronaviruses. The selected primers, named the AC primer set, were composed of 10 primer pairs stretching over the entire genome of alphacoronaviruses, and produced PCR products of the expected size (3-5 kb) from both the HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 strains. After genome amplification, an evaluation using various sequencing platforms was carried out. The amplicon library sequencing data were assembled into complete genome sequences in all sequencing strategies examined in this study. The sequencing accuracy varied depending on the sequencing technology, but all sequencing methods showed a sequencing error of less than 0.01%. In the mock clinical specimen, the detection limit was 10 \u22123 PFU/ml (10 2 copies/ml). The AC primer set and experimental procedure optimized in this study may enable the fast diagnosis of mutant alphacoronaviruses in future epidemics.",

Alphacoronaviruses are diagnosed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). ORF1a and b (van der Hoek et al., 2005) , and nucleocapsid genes (Bergner et al., 2020; Morehouse et al., 2020) are used as diagnostic markers. However, false-negative results may occur when there is a mutation in the marker gene region (Kevadiya et al., 2021) . Moreover, any viral variant located beside the short marker gene region cannot be determined through the conventional standard rRT-PCR. Thus, whole-genome sequencing is essential to determine whether a virus is a mutant strain (Gilchrist et al., 2015; World Health Organization, 2020) . The use of whole genome sequencing to identify SARS-CoV-2 mutants is a good example Zhou et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021) .",

In the case of alphacoronaviruses, various genome sequencing methods have been developed to overcome this issue; however, current methods amplify a genome fragment using a strain-specific primer set. Since these viruses have diverse strains, new primers specific to the target strain must be continuously developed. In contrast, universal primers are applicable to a wide range of variants within a viral species or a viral genus and have been developed for other viral groups. Here, we sought to develop a primer set and a sequencing method that can be universally applied to all human-infecting alphacoronaviruses. In pursuing this aim, we designed a universal primer set and developed an optimal protocol that allows genome amplification and sequencing of all human alphacoronaviruses from a minimum viral concentration of 10 2 copies/ml. The primer set was shown to be highly specific for human alphacoronaviruses and universal for the HCoV-like clade.",

Contigs 100% identical to the reference sequence were obtained only after checking the sequencing chromatogram and performing manual curation. In this process, the following limitations using Sanger sequencingbased primer walking for viral genome sequencing were confirmed again. First, a large number of primers are required to cover the entire nucleotide sequence, as amplicons over 2 kb cannot be sequenced simultaneously. Second, the error rate is high because of insufficient sequencing depth. Third, since it requires a larger amount of RNA template compared to those of the other high-throughput sequencing platforms, it cannot be directly applied to clinical samples. FIGURE 3 | Spike protein amino acid sequence tree of alphacoronaviruses. The maximum-likelihood tree was inferred using the sequences at the 20,572-24,090 nt positions of the spike protein subunit1 (S1). The ingroups are the 28 representative sequences of 14 subgenera of alphacoronaviruses, and HCoV-OC43, a betacoronavirus, was used as an outgroup. To amplify the full viral genome, methods such as sequenceindependent single-primer amplification (SISPA), VIDISCA, and random primer RT-PCR are used. These methods are advantageous as they do not require group-specific primers and can randomly amplify various viral sequences (Sridhar et al., 2015) . However, obtaining uniform sequencing coverage and depth across the entire genome by using the random amplification process is difficult (Karlsson et al., 2013) . Additionally, since it is impossible to avoid amplification of host and viral nucleic acids together in the random amplification process, its application to clinical samples is difficult. Thus, to amplify and sequence the genome of human alphacoronaviruses, it is best to use universal primers that are specific to this group and cover all variants of this group.",

Since this method does not require primers, it is advantageous as it enables the identification and genome analysis of novel or highly mutated viruses. However, such kind of shotgun sequencing is not applicable to individual clinical samples. Unlike in environmental or animal samples, the viral titer in individual clinical samples is limited; therefore, it is not easy to assemble with sufficient coverage a viral genome through shotgun metagenome sequencing of clinical samples.",

However, in a study on SARS-CoV-2, for which our research team is currently preparing a manuscript (data not shown), the universal primer-based amplification method was effective in clinical specimens and showed the same level of performance as in vitro. In addition, according to the amplicon-based sequencing protocol for the HCoV-OC43 strain, the primer panel worked successfully for clinical samples infected with the target virus (Nutho et al., 2020). The detection limit of the current method in mock clinical samples was as low as 10 2 copies/ml which is similar to the known values reported in other studies of ampliconbased sequencing of clinical samples (Xiao et al., 2020; de Mello Malta et al., 2021) .

Thus, phylogenetic analyses of coronaviruses mainly use the S protein, although low accuracy emerges as an issue when phylogenetic analysis is performed using a single gene with a large mutation rate . When we compared the S protein tree and genome tree, the topologies varied greatly depending on the trees. Remarkably, NL63-related bat coronavirus BtKYNL63-9b was placed within the Non-HCoV group in the S protein amino acid tree but is positioned within the HCoV-like group in the genome tree.
