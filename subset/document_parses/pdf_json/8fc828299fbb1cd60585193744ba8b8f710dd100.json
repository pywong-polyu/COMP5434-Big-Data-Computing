            "text": "Purpose The Coronavirus Disease pandemic resulted in dramatic changes to avoid virus spread. In Canada, following provincial legislation the Workers' Compensation Board of Alberta (WCB-Alberta) stopped in-person rehabilitation services on March 23, 2020. On April 1, training began on remote service delivery using videoconferencing or telerehabilitation, which started April 3. We studied WCB-Alberta's transition to remote rehabilitation service delivery. Methods A population-based descriptive study was conducted, with data extracted from the WCB-Alberta database. This included clinical data from rehabilitation providers. We included workers completing services between January 1 and May 31, 2020. We statistically examined differences before and after the transition to remote services. Results The dataset included 4,516 individuals with work-related injuries. The mean number of work assessments per week pre-COVID was 244.6 (SD 83.5), which reduced to 135.9 (SD 74.5). Workers undergoing remote assessments were significantly more likely to work in health care or trades, did not require an interpreter, and were less likely to be working or judged as ready to return to work. Number of completed rehabilitation programs also reduced from 125.6 to 40.8 per week, with most (67.1%) remote programs being functional restoration. Few adverse effects were observed. Conclusions We describe the transition to completely remote delivery of occupational rehabilitation due to COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions in one Canadian compensation jurisdiction. It appears the use of remote services was successful but proceeded cautiously, with fewer complex cases being referred for assessment or rehabilitation. Further research examining longer-term work outcomes and stakeholder perceptions is needed.",

Many jurisdictions transitioned to remote delivery of services using telehealth or videoconferencing technology [3] . Preliminary evidence has shown that telehealth/ telerehabilitation and videoconferencing as used by physical therapists has promise for treating individuals with musculoskeletal conditions [4, 5] . However, little is known about these services in the context of occupational rehabilitation where physical in-person testing and participation in work-related functional activities are the norm. As physical distancing restrictions may last for several months or until a vaccine is available, sharing experiences with remote service delivery could inform other jurisdictions considering this option.",

We compared differences between workers completing assessment or rehabilitation before and after the transition to remote services using independent t-tests for continous variables and chi square test for categorical variables.

Worker characteristics according to the type of work assessment undertaken are shown in Table 1 . The majority of workers were employed (81.3%) and working in trades and transport occupations (42.1%) (See Table 1 ). Average age was 45.9 years and median injury duration was 112 days. Figure 1 shows the number of work assessments completed within the jurisdiction over the timeframe of the study. The mean number of assessments per week conducted before the lock-down of March 23 was 244.6 (SD 83.5), while the mean number after transitioning to the FIT was 135.9 (SD 74.5) per week. Of note are the very limited number of comprehensive work assessments conducted after the transition to remote assessments, indicative of less complicated cases undergoing assessment. The mean number of workers completing rehabilitation programs per week before March 23 was 125.6 (SD 45.1), while the mean number after transitioning to remote rehabilitation was 45.1 (SD 22.3). Table 1 provides a detailed comparison between workers assessed before and after the transition to remote work assessments. After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, very few (n = 18, 1.5%) comprehensive assessments were conducted. Workers assessed using remote assessments were significantly more likely to work in Health (12.3% versus 9.9%) or Trades and Transport (44.1% versus 41.4%) and less likely to work in Sales and Service (16.5% versus 19.7%) or Business, Finance or Administration (4.7% versus 6.7%) industries. They also had significantly higher paying jobs (mean annual salary of $51,500CDN versus $48,000CDN), and were less likely to require an interpreter during assessment (1.6% versus 2.8%).",

It appears that widescale remote occupational rehabilitation services in this Canadian compensation context has been successful, with few adverse effects or complaints reported despite hundreds of injured workers undergoing work assessment and rehabilitation. However, the jurisdiction appears to have taken a cautious approach with few complex cases referred for comprehensive work assessment or rehabilitation. Overall work assessment and rehabilitation program volumes also reduced after the switch to remote services. These findings provide important understanding of remote services for injured workers and inform global efforts to continue offering rehabilitation services while remaining physically distant due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to follow these workers for a longer duration, ideally at least one year. While a previous trial using the FIT protocol found little difference in long-term outcomes when compared to traditional performance-based assessment, the trial was still conducted with interviews done in a face-to-face setting. Conducting work assessment or rehabilitation over videoconferencing or telephone is entirely different, and warrants longterm evaluation. Potentially, return to work determinations made using remote technology are not as accurate and lead to delayed or less sustainable work outcomes. Our findings indicate that clinicians conducting remote work assessments made more cautious recommendations, with fewer recommendations for immediate return to preaccident work and a higher percentage of workers given permanent work restrictions. This appeared to cause concern for some case managers, with at least one worker having a permanent job offer compromised because work ability levels determined using the FIT were lower than earlier FCE results. Previous research has indicated that self-reported functional levels are often lower than results of performance-based functional tests, which may explain the observation of fewer recommendations for immediate return to work. However, we did not have access to raw data on individual items within the functional tests conducted to explore this further.",

We observed that more workers referred for remote work assessment (post-COVID) were unemployed, not currently working, and did not have modified work available.
