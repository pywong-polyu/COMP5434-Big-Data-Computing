            "text": "is study evaluated the potential for chrysotile asbestos exposure during maintenance and operation of older, nonautomated heavy equipment with chrysotile-containing brake and clutch linings. Recent reports indicate that such equipment may be in current use in the U.S. and other locations, including developing countries, due to its lower cost and ease of maintenance compared to newer equipment. Personal and area airborne fiber concentrations were measured for cranes with draglines during brake and clutch repair, equipment operation, shop cleanup, and clothes handling of the mechanic's coveralls over a period of three days. e range of airborne chrysotile concentrations during the complete friction band replacement process, including band removal from the equipment, friction lining replacement, and reinstallation, ranged from 0.0053 to 0.0273 f/cc (phase contrast microscopy-equivalent or PCME) over 3.3 to 6.2 hours. Additional bench work tasks, including electric wire brushing, hand sanding, riveting, and compressed air use were also performed. Full shift airborne chrysotile concentrations (6.1-8.5 hours) for all combined maintenance activities were 0.0093, 0.0414, and 0.0445 f/cc (PCME), on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Personal short-term samples (14-36 minutes) for lining removal, installation, wire brushing, hand sanding, and compressed air use ranged from nondetect (ND) to 0.238 f/cc (PCME), below the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) 30-minute excursion limit of 1 f/cc. Short-term samples during crane operation, shop cleanup, and simulated laundry activities with the mechanic's coveralls ranged from ND to 0.01 f/cc (PCME; 15-36 minutes). e results indicated that full-shift measured airborne chrysotile concentrations during the brake and clutch maintenance activities evaluated remained below the U.S. 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) for asbestos of 0.1 f/cc. e results are likely to be relevant to farmers, construction workers, and vehicle maintenance workers historically, as well as today for those who choose to continue using and maintaining such equipment.",

            "text": "Chrysotile is one of six asbestos mineral fiber types identified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the U.S. [12] . Chrysotile is a hydrated magnesium silicate in the serpentine mineral class that forms soft and flexible fibers, whereas the other primary class of asbestos minerals identified by OSHA, the amphiboles (such as crocidolite or amosite), generally contains iron and forms rigid fibers [13, 14] . Over a number of decades, evidence has accumulated in the published literature demonstrating that there are significant differences in cancer potency according to the different mineral fiber types, with chrysotile being the least potent of the common industrial fiber types for both lung cancer and mesothelioma induction (if chrysotile is capable of inducing mesothelioma at all), and crocidolite typically being the most potent of the mineral fiber types that have been used commercially [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Chrysotile has been reported to be ubiquitous in the background or ambient environment [21] . Measurements of ambient asbestos concentrations in recent decades have ranged from nondetectable to 0.0047 f/cc (outdoors) and nondetectable to 0.012 f/cc (indoors) for fibers at least 5 \u03bcm in length in longterm samples of up to approximately 13 hours or more [22, 23] .",

Few studies have evaluated the potential for exposure during work with or around heavy equipment, which compared to passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses, may have unique designs and uses. Specifically, the current study evaluated potential exposures from chrysotile-containing brakes and clutches during operation and maintenance of nonautomated cranes with draglines manufactured in the 1950s and 1960s. Such equipment has been used for a variety of applications including earth moving, highway construction, and mining. Furthermore, recent news reports in the U.S. have pointed to the increasing use of nonautomated heavy equipment that is 40 years old or older because of its less complicated machinery, ease of repair in the field, and lower costs associated with maintenance and repair [47, 48] . erefore, characterization of potential chrysotile exposures associated with operation and repair of this nonautomated heavy equipment remains relevant today, not only in the U.S. but also in developing countries where farmers, construction workers, and small business owners may still be routinely using such equipment.",

First, some older studies reported measurements based only on phase-contract microscopy (PCM), which is not specific to asbestos fibers [4, 24, 49] . PCM is a straightforward and cost-effective method that counts all fibers meeting the size criteria of at least 5 \u00b5m in length and 0.25 \u03bcm in width with a 3 : 1 aspect ratio, regardless of whether the fibers are asbestos or not [50] . Due to pressure and heat generated during the braking process, an extremely large fraction of the fibers in the friction wear debris are reported to be nonasbestos, such as forsterite, a degradation product of chrysotile [10, 41, [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] .",

Sampling for less than a full work shift (typically 8 hours) precludes direct comparison against important benchmarks such as the OSHA 8-hour TWA PEL without additional consideration of exposure potential during the time outside of the recorded sample duration. For example, peak exposures over a several-minute period are not directly comparable or relevant to a worker's exposure potential over the full task or workday [45, 69] . e omission of sampling duration, or the use of partial-shift or peak sampling duration alone, limits the ability to interpret airborne fiber concentration measurements with respect to occupational exposure standards or other risk assessment benchmarks [70, 71] . While task-based exposures can be valuable to characterize specific activities, they are most helpful when considered in the context of full-shift measurements.",

For example, separate task-based samples were collected during electric wire brush cleaning of heavy equipment friction linings, during hand sanding of linings, and during the isolated compressed air blow-off of linings. Additionally, the cranes evaluated had brakes and clutches that were open to the air and adjacent to the equipment operator (Figure 1) , a configuration not previously evaluated for operator exposure potential. e full-shift measurements collected during this study also covered the duration of all brake and clutch maintenance activities that were evaluated, enabling direct comparison to the OSHA 8-hour TWA PEL. Both the PCM and TEM (PCME) methods were used, facilitating comparisons between asbestos and nonasbestos airborne fiber concentrations. Overall, this study contains a number of measurements that add substantially to the relatively limited body of research related to chrysotile exposure potential during heavy equipment repair and operation. While these data are relevant for understanding the historic potential for asbestos exposure during the use of such equipment, the results remain relevant today due to the continued use of some older, nonautomated heavy equipment that can have greater simplicity of use and lower cost of repair compared to newer models.",

Following U.S. EPA guidance [60] for risk assessments involving airborne asbestos measurements, we substituted a value of zero for ND when calculating average airborne concentrations. Alternative approaches including substitution of the detection limit or 1/2 the detection limit would not have impacted the finding in this study that exposures were consistently below the 8-hour TWA OSHA PEL and 30-minute excursion limit. Furthermore, all raw data collected during the study are presented in Tables 2  and 3 , or the Discussion section, and therefore, such alternate treatments of the study data points which were below the LOD could be calculated by the reader if desired. e SEM analysis of airborne fibers collected during the study demonstrated that, similar to previous brake and clutch studies, there was debris attached to airborne chrysotile fibers collected during the study ( Figure 6 ) [9, 55] . Previous research has indicated that the rate of particle removal from the air can be substantially affected by the dimensions and weight of the individual particles. For example, heavier particles such as fibers with attached binder material are likely to be removed from the air more rapidly than lighter particles such as unattached chrysotile fibers, thereby reducing the potential for airborne exposure [76] . e airborne concentration data collected for the chrysotile-containing products used during the brake and clutch work in this study appear to meet the criteria in the exemption language specified by OSHA for labeling of encapsulated materials containing asbestos [12, 59, 77] . In 1972, OSHA first required that \"[c]aution labels shall be affixed to all . . . products containing asbestos fibers, or to their containers, except that no label is required where asbestos fibers have been modified by a bonding agent, coating, binder, or other material so that during any reasonably foreseeable use . . . no airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers in excess of the exposure limits . . . will be released\" [77] .

            "text": "e results of this study indicated that airborne chrysotile concentrations during routine friction lining maintenance work on nonautomated crane equipment had a mean range of 0.0053 to 0.0273 f/cc (PCME) over 3.3 to 6.2 hours. Furthermore, full-shift maintenance work on brakes and clutches on this equipment, including bench work such as compressed air use exceeding two minutes per lining, electric wire brush cleaning or hand sanding of chrysotile-containing linings followed by compressed air cleaning, as well as riveting and countersinking of woven brake linings that were not predrilled, collectively resulted in full-shift average airborne chrysotile concentrations of 0.0414 to 0.0445 f/cc (PCME) over 6.4 to 8.5 hours, which was below the current 8-hour TWA OSHA PEL. Personal short-term samples (14-36 minutes) for lining removal, installation, wire brushing, hand sanding, and compressed air use ranged from ND to 0.238 f/cc (PCM and PCME), which was below OSHA's 30-minute excursion limit of 1 f/cc. In addition, personal short-term airborne concentrations during the operation of the crane equipment were between ND and 0.01 f/cc (mean 0.005 f/cc) (PCME), and 30-minute personal samples during clothes handling following crane maintenance work were between ND and 0.0022 f/cc (mean 0.0011 f/cc) (PCME). ese data add to the limited information in the literature evaluating the potential for asbestos exposure during the operation and maintenance of nonautomated crane equipment, including data for tasks not previously evaluated. e results are likely to be useful for evaluating asbestos exposure potential during both the historic and present-day use of nonautomated heavy equipment. e data will also be useful for farmers, construction workers, and vehicle maintenance workers who choose to continue to use and maintain such equipment due to its lower cost and simplicity of maintenance in certain scenarios. Overall, the results indicated that full-shift measured airborne chrysotile concentrations during the brake and clutch maintenance activities evaluated here remained below the OSHA 8-hour TWA PEL for asbestos of 0.1 f/cc. For those who continue to use older equipment with chrysotile-containing friction linings, exposures can further be reduced by using wet methods, local exhaust ventilation (LEV), and HEPA vacuums for dust collection and control. Local regulations regarding control measures should always be consulted and followed.",
