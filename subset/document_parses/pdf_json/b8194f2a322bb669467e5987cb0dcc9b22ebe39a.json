ACS usually develops in 10 to 20% of patients hospitalized for a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), after 2.5 days of hospitalization. The syndrome is characterized by a complex pathophysiology that may involve lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), alveolar hypoventilation and atelectasis, bone infarcts-driven fat embolism, and in situ pulmonary artery thrombosis. The clinical diagnosis of ACS includes the combination of clinical symptoms or signs, e.g. chest pain, fever, or dyspnea usually characterized by a rapid shallow breathing, with a new pulmonary infiltrate, typically lower lobe consolidation in adult patients 3 .",

            "text": "One of the most challenging issues for the physicians in charge of SCD adult patients with ACS is to diagnose LRTI as the cause of ACS. As a consequence, most patients with ACS are receiving antimicrobial treatment, especially when admitted to the ICU, and current practice includes routine administration of antibiotics for 7 to 10 days. However, this strategy has been rarely evaluated in adult patients 4 . In the study of Vichinsky et al. involving 671 episodes of ACS in 538 children and adults with SCD, a microbiological documentation was obtained in 38% of the cases, using conventional diagnostic tests. Chlamydia pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumonia (30% of cases), and to a lesser degree Staphylococcus aureus (5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4%) were the most frequently identified microorganisms in adult patients 5 . Syndromic respiratory multiplex PCR systems (mPCR) have been recently developed to identify targeted microorganisms involved in major respiratory infectious syndromes, using novel rapid nucleic acid amplification techniques. The usefulness of respiratory mPCR has been assessed in a paediatric cohort of sickle-cell young children experiencing ACS in whom a low rate of www.nature.com/scientificreports/ intracellular microorganisms was reported 6 , suggesting that a better knowledge of the microbial epidemiology was necessary, especially regarding the respective role of pyogenic bacteria, intracellular bacteria, and viruses. We hypothesize that the optimization of the microbiological documentation of ACS might improve the use of antimicrobial drugs in sickle-cell adult patients. The objectives of this pilot study were to describe the microbial spectrum and antibiotic use in sickle-cell adult patients with ACS admitted to the ICU, using molecular diagnostic testing.",

            "text": "The 37% incidence rate of microbial aetiologies of ACS is in accordance with that reported in previous studies 5, 10 . However, the microbial spectrum differed from that described in a large series of adult and paediatric SCD patients with ACS, which reported a high proportion of intracellular bacteria, with low rates of S. aureus and www.nature.com/scientificreports/ S. pneumoniae (5% each) 5 . Our studied population (only adult patients), as well as the use of a sensitive diagnostic tool, may explain this discrepancy. A recent paediatric French cohort, using a similar approach, also suggested that M. pneumoniae was rarely involved in young children with SCD experiencing ACS 6 . Altogether, those findings raise the questions of the role of intracellular bacteria and the relevance of macrolid treatment in ACS. In our study, the initial antimicrobial therapy was systematically narrowed in the patients diagnosed with a bacterial infection, and in two-thirds of patients with non-bacterial ACS. Of note, the initial broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, combining a third-generation cephalosporin and spiramycin, was maintained in 7 (37%) non-bacterial ACS patients during 8 days, which may suggest that physicians were reluctant to narrow the spectrum of antimicrobial therapy in non-bacterial ACS patients, despite the absence of bacterial species identification integrating the negative results of sputum examination (for identifying pyogenic bacteria), urinary antigen tests and mPCR (for identifying intracellular bacteria). We observed a 19% incidence rate of viral infection, with a seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses. Our findings suggest that mPCR may substantially add to the knowledge of viral and bacterial aetiologies of ACS in sickle cell adult patients. Moreover, mPCR may provide rapid results that should improve the therapeutic management of patients, by reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure, and indicating isolation measures when respiratory viruses are identified. However, the etiologic role of a respiratory virus identified with mPCR to the contribution to a symptomatic disease in patients clinically suspected of LRTI may vary by age group and specific virus, particularly parainfluenza, coronaviruses, rhinovirus, and adenovirus in children 11, 12 . In our study, we acknowledge that the asymptomatic carriage of rhinovirus may not be ruled out.",

Limitations. Limitations of the study are related to (i) the sample size of the population; and (ii) the probable underestimation of bacterial infection rate, due to the incompleteness of the conventional microbiological investigations in all patients, and the non-extended panel of the mPCR that did not include pyogenic bacteria.",

To summarize, a LRTI was observed in more than one-third of ACS patients who had a thorough microbiological workup, using both conventional and molecular diagnostic tests. S. aureus and respiratory viruses were the main microorganisms identified. No infection involving intracellular bacteria was identified. The overall duration of antimicrobial therapy did not differ according to the microbiological documentation of ACS. However, a bacterial infection led to the systematic adjustment of antimicrobial therapy. Future randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of a pathogen-directed strategy using an extended respiratory panel mPCR, and a conventional strategy in SCD adult patients hospitalized for ACS are needed. A randomized trial www.nature.com/scientificreports/ combining the use of a respiratory broad panel multiplex PCR and procalcitonin to reduce antibiotics exposure in hospitalized sickle-cell adults with ACS is currently in progress (NCT03919266).",
