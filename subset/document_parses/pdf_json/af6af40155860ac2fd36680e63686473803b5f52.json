Deep learning is the leading AI method for a wide range of tasks including medical imaging problems. It is the state of the art for several computer vision tasks and has been used for medical imaging tasks like the classification of Alzheimer's [1] , lung cancer detection [2] , retinal disease detection [3, 4] , etc. Despite achieving remarkable results in the medical domain, AI-based methods have not achieved a significant deployment in the clinics. This is due to the underlying black-box nature of the deep learning algorithms along with other reasons like computational costs. It arises from the fact that despite having the underlying statistical principles, there is a lack of ability to explicitly represent the knowledge for a given task performed by a deep neural network. Simpler AI methods like linear regression and decision trees are self-explanatory as the decision boundary used for classification can be visualized in a few dimensions using the model parameters. But these lack the complexity required for tasks such as classification of 3D and most 2D medical images. The lack of tools to inspect the behavior of black-box models affects the use of deep learning in all domains including finance and autonomous driving where explainability and reliability are the key elements for trust by the end-user. A medical diagnosis system needs to be transparent, understandable, and explainable to gain the trust of physicians, regulators as well as the patients. Ideally, it should be able to explain the complete logic of making a certain decision to all the parties involved. Newer regulations like the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are making it harder for the use of black-box models in all businesses including healthcare because retraceability of the decisions is now a requirement [5] . An AI system to complement medical professionals should have a certain amount of explainability and allow the human expert to retrace the decisions and use their judgment. Some researchers also emphasize that even humans are not always able to or even willing to explain their decisions [5] . Explainability is the key to safe, ethical, fair, and trust-able use of AI and a key enabler for its deployment in the real world. Breaking myths about AI by showing what a model looked at while making the decision can inculcate trust among the end-users. It is even more important to show the domain-specific features used in the decision for non-deep learning users like most medical professionals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 412, "end": 415, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 440, "end": 443, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 472, "end": 475, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 476, "end": 478, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1991, "end": 1994, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2284, "end": 2287, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The terms explainability and interpretability are often used interchangeably in the literature.

A related term to this concept is the uncertainty associated with the decision of a model. Deep learning classifiers are usually not able to say \"I don't know\" in situations with ambiguity and instead return the class with the highest probability, even if by a narrow margin. Lately, uncertainty has been analyzed along with the problem of explainability in many studies to highlight the cases where a model is unsure and in turn make the models more acceptable to non-deep learning users. Deep learning models are considered as non-transparent as the weights of the neurons can't be understood as knowledge directly.

The methods used for the former are discussed in this section with applications provided in 4.1 while the latter are discussed along with their applications in section 4.2. The problem of assigning an attribution value or contribution or relevance to each input feature of a network led to the development of several attribution methods. The goal of an attribution method is to determine the contribution of an input feature to the target neuron which is usually the output neuron of the correct class for a classification problem. The arrangement of the attributions of all the input features in the shape of the input sample forms heatmaps known as the attribution maps. Some examples of attribution maps for different images are shown in Figure 2 . The features with a positive contribution to the activation of the target neuron are typically marked in red while those negatively affecting the activation are marked in blue. These are the features or pixels in case of images providing positive and negative evidence of different magnitudes respectively. Attributions of VGG-16 with images from Imagenet using the methods implemented in [15] The commonly used attribution methods are discussed in this section and the applications in the next section. It must be noted that some of the approaches like DeepTaylor [16] provide only positive evidence and can be useful for a certain set of tasks.The attribution methods can be applied on a black box convolutional neural network (CNN) without any modification to the underlying architecture making them a convenient yet powerful Explainable AI (XAI) tool.

It is computationally expensive as a forward pass needs to be run after perturbing each group of features of the input.

With an image model and a language model in it, the method used attention mechanisms to visualize the detection process. Using that attention mechanism, the language model found predominant and discriminatory features to learn the mapping between images and the diagnostic reports. This was the first work which exploited the attention mechanism to get insightful information from medical image dataset. In [54] an interpretable version of U-Net [55] called SAUNet was proposed.
