Paper masks are worn by health professionals and the general public to avoid the transmission of respiratory infections, such as COVID-19, but there appear to be differences in health beliefs of nurses within and between countries regarding these.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Methods: This qualitative descriptive study used content analysis with a framework approach. Findings: There were major differences in nurse participants' beliefs between and within countries, including how nurses use paper masks and their understanding of their efficacy.

Conclusion: Nurses from different working environments, countries and areas of practice hold a variety of health beliefs about mask wearing at the personal and professional level. Implications for nursing policy and health policy: The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked much discussion about the critical importance of masks for the safety of health professionals, and there has been considerable discussion and disagreement about health policies regarding mask use by the general public. Improper use of masks may have a role in creating mask shortages or transmitting infections. An evidence-based global policy on mask use for respiratory illnesses for health professionals, including nurses, and the general public needs to be adopted and supported by a wide-reaching education campaign.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, a minister of health in an Asian country criticised Western visitors for not accepting face masks when he was distributing them to tourists to tackle the threat against novel coronavirus (Ng 2020) and in China people without masks in public were scolded and humiliated on social media (Yu & Keane 2020) .

(Chinese academic,Yenli) Did people think [a mask] could completely protect them from infection? If you want to protect, you have to wear N95 mask. (Japanese academic, Mitsuko) DurationWell, my understanding is that paper masks only last for about, you know, 30 seconds or something and once the water vapour comes through, then they're not effective anymore. (Australian academic, Gracie) In theory, they will [be effective] for one minute. (Australian clinician, Anne) Masks do work but the effect is very short-lived. No point in wearing them for a whole day. Watching people on TV walking around in masks all day. (Australian academic, Zola) The cellosilk in paper mask may prevent virus, but it cannot work when it gets wet, so we promote to change masks every four hours. (Chinese clinician, Changchang) ManagementWill depend on how you manage it. Do you touch the mask? Is it wet? How well is it fitted? . . . Never a perfect seal on a mask. (Australian clinician, Anne) . . . if it's an airborne disease like influenza then it's probably going to be less effective, and if you're not wearing it effectively it's obviously going to be less effective. (Australian academic, Josh) The mask packet shows its block-out percentage, and of course how you wear a mask is important. . . (Japanese academic, Aya) Maybe because I wear a cheap mask, it hurts my ears and I touch the mask, so germs might stick to my hands and eventually infect others. In the meantime, germs from outside can be shut out.

(Japanese clinician,Kayo) Given the type of the mask and that its material is cellular, I think there is no evidence of protecting oneself from infection. If it is a special mask, it would be different, but our daily-use surgical mask, around here. (Japanese academic, Kimi) Literature, books I saw this in books. It (mask) has some effects.

(Japanese academic, Norisuke) I learnt this from on the job learning, seeing it in the frontline. We are visual tactile learners.
