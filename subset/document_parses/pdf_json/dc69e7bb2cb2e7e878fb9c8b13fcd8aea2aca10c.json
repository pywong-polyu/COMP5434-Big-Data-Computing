[9] Further, there is increasing evidence that viral infections such as COVID-19 (i.e., with neuroinvasive potential leading to a pro-inflammatory state) can trigger MS exacerbations. [1, 6] Here, we report a 33-year-old female who underwent lumbar surgery (anterior lumbar interbody fusion [ALIF] ) and subsequently had COVID-19. Her postoperative symptoms/signs led to a revision of her lumbar spinal surgery, but were ultimately attributed to MS. disc replacement (1 year prior for myelopathy), presented with 2 years of low back pain/radiculopathy. On examination, she exhibited significant isolated weakness in her right lower extremity without sensory or reflex abnormalities [ Table 1 ]. Lumbar X-rays and an MRI showed moderate degenerative disc disease at the L5-S1 level, a 3 mm minimal degenerative retrolisthesis, and a right paracentral L5-S1 disc protrusion causing moderate lateral recess narrowing [ Figures 1 and 2 ]. She underwent an L5-S1 ALIF without complication [ Figure 3 ].",
