The proportion of adults with controlled blood pressure (BP), has declined in recent years, with <44% of adults achieving this goal [3] . Poor BP control continues to be a persistent public health challenge because of the high prevalence of obesity, insufficient access to lifestyle counseling, difficulty adopting lifestyle change, medication adherence, therapeutic inertia owing to clinical uncertainty about BP data accuracy, and lack of provider access to adjust medications when needed [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

HTN self-management is an obvious fit for digital health solutions, and the results of this pilot study add to the growing body of evidence that human-supported digital self-management programs can improve outcomes for those with chronic conditions [29] . With proper design, the essential features of supported HTN self-management, including comprehensive counseling for lifestyle changes, HMBP with actionable feedback, and medication taking support, can be effectively translated to a digital format and result in strong program engagement, improved activation, and desirable clinical outcomes for people with HTN. Future research on this program will focus on the sustainability of the clinical outcomes, the robustness of the clinical benefit under increasingly rigorous testing conditions, and research among more diverse populations to promote health equity from new digital health solutions.",
