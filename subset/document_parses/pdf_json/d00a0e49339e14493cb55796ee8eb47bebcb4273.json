When analyzing the evolution of CT finding of all patients by time, the 12 present study found that most patients recovering from COVID-19 showed an initial radiographic deterioration to a peak (mean time, 2 nd week) followed by radiographic improvement in the 3 rd and 4 th week. Nevertheless, there was remarkable resolution of fever and improvement in oxygen saturation and heart rate, lymphocyte, CRP and ESR within the first two weeks. Accordingly, we may conclude that the progression course of CT pattern was later than the clinical parameters within the first two weeks. This may result from inflammatory reaction occurring earlier than the morphological changes of lung. Thereafter, the radiologic findings and clinical parameter showed a synchronization of improvement at 4 th week. Although, the four patients had a static radiographic course, the CT score remained low (\uff1c4) in those cases. Therefore, evolution course type 1, 2 or 3 with a consistent low CT score may be associated with a favorable outcome. present study. The crazy paving reached the highest frequency in the 2 nd week (76.5%), but was not seen in the 4 th week. This phenomenon suggests that the presence of crazy paving may be associated with an early period of disease. Pleural effusion appeared from the 2 nd week (11.8%) and peaked at the 3 rd week (23.5%). This feature is different from SARS-CoV [17] [18] [19] and other recent publications on COVID-19 [13] [14] [15] , which barely present with pleural effusion. Previous studies showed that the presence of pleural effusion in patients infected with MERS-CoV or Avian flu (H5N1) was a poor prognostic factor [20, 29] . Nevertheless, in three patients, pleural effusion was totally absorbed on follow-up CT scans.",

They found 15 (62%) of SARS patients to have evidence of fibrosis on CT after discharge.

Meanwhile, consolidation and mixed pattern (47.0%) were noted in the 2 nd week. Thereafter, the frequency of GGO increased in 3 rd week (76.5%) and 4 th week (71.4%) due to dissolution of consolidation into GGO. Furthermore, GGO plus interlobular septal thickening were the main pattern in 3 rd week, while GGO plus irregular linear opacities were the main pattern in the 4 th week (60%). Consolidation pattern was not observed in the 4 th week, while the mixed pattern reached highest proportions. This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that consolidations generally either resolved completely or regressed to small areas of irregular linear opacities. Opacities were mainly located in the peripheral, subpleural zones of the lungs as focal or multifocal lesions in the 1 st week, and disease quickly evolved to a more extensive and diffuse picture in the 2 nd week, then improved in the 3 rd and 4 th weeks.
