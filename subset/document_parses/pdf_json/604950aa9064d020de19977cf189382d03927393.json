            "text": "Most of the ongoing projects aimed at the development of specific therapies and vaccines against COVID-19 use the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein as the main target [1][2][3] . The binding of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor (ACE2) of the host cell constitutes the first and key step for virus entry. During this process, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein plays an essential role, since it contains the receptor binding motif (RBM), responsible for the docking to the receptor. So far, mostly biochemical methods are being tested in order to prevent binding of the virus to ACE2 4 . Here we show, with the help of atomistic simulations, that external electric fields of easily achievable and moderate strengths can dramatically destabilise the S protein, inducing long-lasting structural damage. One striking field-induced conformational change occurs at the level of the recognition loop L3 of the RBD where two parallel beta sheets, believed to be responsible for a high affinity to ACE2 5 , undergo a change into an unstructured coil, which exhibits almost no binding possibilities to the ACE2 receptor (Figure 1a) . Remarkably, while the structural flexibility of S allows the virus to improve its probability of entering the cell, it is also the origin of the surprising vulnerability of S upon application of electric fields of strengths at least two orders of magnitude smaller than those required for damaging most proteins. Our findings suggest the existence of a clean physical method to weaken the SARS-CoV-2 virus without further biochemical processing. Moreover, the effect could be used for infection prevention purposes and also to develop technologies for in-vitro structural manipulation of S. Since the method is largely unspecific, it can be suitable for application to mutations in S, to other proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and in general to membrane proteins of other virus types.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19, is an enveloped virus that utilises its surface glycoprotein spike (S) to bind to the host cell membrane through an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor 6, 7 . Most of the efforts to develop therapies and vaccines against COVID- 19 8-11 aim at either decreasing the stability or exploiting some of the structural features of the S protein, since it triggers immune responses and plays an essential role in the virus ability to infect the host 12, 13 . The S protein is a homotrimer whose protomers are composed of two functional subunits, S1 and S2, which are responsible for the correct receptor binding/fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, respectively. The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which has been found to switch stochastically between a closed (\"down\") state, in which the receptor binding motif (RBM) is hidden, and an open (\"up\") state that exposes the RBM thus enabling the interaction and binding with the peptidase domain of ACE2 6, 14 . Greater preponderance of the up conformations on mutated S proteins have been linked to higher infectivity, but at the expense of more vulnerability to neutralising antibodies 15 . Distal mutations from the binding region have also been found to affect structural stability of the S protein and its affinity to ACE2, which indicates that a correct spatial arrangement of the RBM residues participating in the binding to the receptor is crucial 16 . In addition to this, abundant N-linked glycans decorating the S protein have been found to be involved in both the stability/folding of the protein in its prefusion conformation and also in controlling the access of host proteases and antibodies, which provides the virus with support in bypassing the host's immune response 17 . Activation of the membrane fusion is achieved by cleaving the S protein by host proteases at the specific sites located at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits. This cleavage triggers a rearrangement from the metastable prefusion state into the post-fusion conformation, and the interruption of this process has been shown to prevent viral fusion [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Altogether, the structure and dynamics of the S protein have been suggested to be the result of a finely tuned balance of affinity to ACE2, stability, and exposure of the RBM 6, 7, 15, 23, 24 . Thus, finding new ways to disrupt this balance might result in an additional set of tools to control the virus and therefore the pandemic.",

            "text": "It has been theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated that static and timedependent electric fields (EFs) are capable of inducing conformational changes [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] or even irreversible damage in proteins [31] [32] [33] . The fact that extremely intense EFs of strengths larger than 1Volt per nanometre (10 9 V m\u207b\u00b9) can denature entire proteins and even break chemical bonds is trivial and of little biological relevance. However, the effect of moderate fields is subtler and can be understood in terms of the interactions of the EFs with the permanent dipoles located in the backbone structure and with the additional flexible dipoles on the protein side chains (see Figure 1d ). For instance, under the action of an EF, the electric dipole moments can be reoriented along the field direction in order to minimise the electrostatic energy. On the other hand, a rearrangement of the dipoles can cost conformational energy due to the loss of hydrogen bonds. As a result of the balance between conformational and electrostatic energies along with entropic contributions, the protein can undergo a significant conformational change. In this work, we show, via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, that EFs of moderate intensities cause damage on the S protein that affects its interaction with ACE2, potentially making SARS-Cov-2 less infectious. These results pave the way to a range of possible applications of EFs to control structural changes in virions with SARS-CoV-2 being one of the multiple targets.",

We first considered a representative selected segment of S from a protomer in conformation \"up\" between residues 319 and 686. This segment corresponds to a part of the S1 subunit and includes the whole RBD, the subdomains SD1 and SD2, and the interface between S1 and S2 ( Figure 1b) . Previous computational [34] [35] [36] and experimental 37,38 works on the isolated S protein and also on the related S protein in SARS-CoV-1 have shown that a standalone segment comprising the RBD and its neighbouring subsequence preserves the local structure and therefore the dynamical and biochemical properties that it shows in the entire protein complex. Based on this knowledge we simulated a restricted spatial domain without loss of generality (see also Methods). To construct the initial protein conformation for the simulations, we used the cryo-EM structure PDB ID 6VSB obtained from the Protein Data Bank 6 and completed the missing residues (see Methods). The first production run was aimed at thermalising the system in the absence of EF (no-EF run) in order to bring the protein to thermodynamic equilibrium at 30 degree Celsius. An estimate of the free energy profile (see Methods) reveals that motion during the thermalisation run was confined to a single free energy basin ( Figure 2b ). This result indicates that the initial conformation fetched from the experimentally obtained segment was close to a stable equilibrium folding state, and the thermalisation run merely helped to relax the remaining structural stress.",

We performed different runs (EFon runs) corresponding to different EF intensities. The field intensities were selected to span a range between 10\u2074 V m\u207b\u00b9 and 10 7 V m\u207b\u00b9 in order to cover both low and moderate intensities that are not incompatible with living organisms and can even exist inside cells 39,40. Only for the sake of comparison, we also performed a short simulation for an unrealistically high intensity (10 9 V m\u207b\u00b9). In all cases, trajectories display an elongation of the protein as a result of the alignment of permanent local dipoles and displacement of charges parallel to the EF (Figure 2 ). For the extreme case of EF=10\u2079 V m\u207b\u00b9, the structural changes are so dramatic that a complete loss of the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein occurs within few ns (see Extended Data, Fig.1 ). In contrast, for low to moderate intensities (EF < 10\u2077 V m\u207b\u00b9), the field-induced structural changes in the S protein are characterised by a transition to a new stable conformation within a few hundreds of nanoseconds (Figure 2a , EF-off). For EF= 10\u2077 V m\u207b\u00b9, the protein structure undergoes, besides the above-mentioned transition, an additional structural change in the region between the SD1 and SD2 subdomains, as shown in Figures 2a and 2d and discussed below. The conformational changes of S upon EF application are reflected in the time evolution of the root mean square displacements (RMSD) of the protein backbone relative to the starting structures (Figure 2a) . A transition from a conformation exhibiting stable RMSD-values below ~0.5 nm to a new stable structure showing small RMSD-oscillations around a larger value occurs within the first 200 ns. For EF=10\u2077 V m\u207b\u00b9 the unfolding between SD1 and SD2 completes only after 500 ns showing a shift to higher values of RMSD around ~1.9 nm. Taken together, these results suggest that EFs modify the free energy balance enabling the protein to overcome barriers which in turn results in a shifted conformational ensemble.",

Typically, not more than 200 ns were needed for each EF-off run, since for all EF intensities the protein displayed a restricted motion around the structure left after the field application, as revealed by the RMSD plots. For instance, the unfolding of the region between SD1 and SD2 observed under EF=10\u2077 V m\u207b\u00b9 remains unaltered after switching off the EF. For all studied EF intensities, estimated free energy plots (see Figure 2b and Extended Data Fig.2) confirmed the existence of a new stable minimum and interestingly, they also show that an energy barrier prevents a transition back to the original conformation (Extended Data Fig.  2 ). To visualise the relevant conformational changes, we conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) on the trajectories of the EF-on runs. We considered a subspace spanned by the two most relevant principal components for the run at EF=10 7 V m\u207b\u00b9 (see Methods). Then, we projected the trajectories for all EF-off runs onto that plane (Figure 2d ). Under the action of EFs of different intensities the protein goes through different paths in the phase space. The final conformation after each EF-on run depends on the field intensity. After EF switch-off and during the EF-off runs the protein structure remains around the EF induced new conformations. No return to the initial structures was observed. This can be clearly seen in Figure 2d , where points corresponding to the trajectories cluster around the final states with almost non-overlapping regions in the reduced phase space (Figure 2d ). The qualitative difference of the states explored by the protein during transient and relaxation driven by static EFs only differing in magnitude suggests the possibility of designing EFs to achieve a predetermined structural change. Altogether, these results provide further evidence that the EF induced conformational changes in the S protein are long lasting and do not reverse upon removal of EF.",

We quantified the influence of EF on the unfolding process observed in the region between SD1 and SD2 (see Figure 1b ) by the angle formed between the vectors that connect the centroids of RBD, SD1 and SD2 (Figure 2e ). The difference \u2206 between the average values before and after EF application increases monotonously with the EF intensity. The shapes of the distributions during the EF-off runs (Figure 2c ) are clearly clustered with partial overlaps. It is, however, important to point out at this stage, that the angle-shifts for increasing EF do not merely mean quantitatively different versions of the same structural change. Instead, the average value of and its distributions (see Figure 2e ) are determined by different EF induced tertiary structure rearrangements on other parts of the protein not captured by the coordinate \u2206 . This means that, for each EF, the accessible angles are constrained by barriers of different origin. This confirms our previous observation that conformational changes for different intensities are qualitatively different in the PCA space and not just amplified versions of the motions at lower intensities ( Figure 2c ). Note, that this effect is similar to that induced by mutations. It was, for instance, reported that certain mutations are able to change the statistics of accessed states at distal sites, namely favouring \"up\" conformations of RBD by mutation of residue 614 38, 43 . These results show the potential of EF of different strengths to induce changes in S that do not only affect the overall configuration, but also reshape local interactions. 6, 20 ) .

NC is maximal for native S protein. Very strong electric fields (10 9 V/m) disable the protein by largely deforming its shape, leaving a structure which is unrecognised by ACE2 (NC = 0). Moderate electric fields, which can be induced by available industrial or laboratory devices 63 , strongly reduce NC and are therefore candidates to decrease the affinity of S to ACE2 and, consequently, the infectivity of the virus. d, Changes in the structural conformation of proteins under EF are driven by reorientation of electric dipoles.",

We first conducted thermalisation simulations under EF = 0 V m\u207b\u00b9 (no-EF), which showed that the tertiary structure is preserved compared to the initial crystal structure (see Figure 3 ). Previous studies 43, 44 have shown that the RBD can be described as being formed by a core and the RBM. The loop 3 (L3), between residues Tyr470 and Pro491, is one of the four loops comprising the RBM, and has been demonstrated to play a key role in the interaction of S with ACE2 20 . The presence of two small -strands in the fragments Cys488-Tyr489 and Tyr473-Gln474 of L3 was shown to be one of the reasons for the enhanced affinity of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2, which is 15 to 20 times larger than the affinity of SARS-CoV-1, whose S protein exhibits a L3-loop without -sheets 6, 41 . The larger affinity to ACE2 makes SARS-CoV-2 much more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 5,45 . The above-mentioned beta-strands in L3 remained intact along the thermalisation simulations, in agreement with previous studies showing that the greater rigidity of the -sheets increases the stability of L3 in SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the unstructured L3 in SARS-CoV-1 5,45-49 . Furthermore, the rest of the secondary structure of the RBD was observed to be stable during the thermalisation run (Figure 3a , left structure). These results are consistent with current studies providing evidence for the stability of the secondary structure of the RBD, and set a baseline for a comparison with the RBD structures affected by EFs.",

During the EF-on simulations, the secondary structure of the RBD was disrupted at multiple segments. Particularly, L3 undergoes a transition from the close structure with the two beta-sheets to an open and completely unstructured coil, reminiscent of L3 in SARS-CoV-1 5,50 (figure 3a, right structure for EF=10 7 V m\u207b\u00b9). We evaluated the time evolution of the secondary structure of L3 (see Figure 3b for E=10 6 V m\u207b\u00b9 as example), which shows that beta-sheets gradually shrink during the first 200 ns of the simulation, until they finally deconstruct as turns or random coils before 1 s. This indicates that the stretching of the protein by an external electric field leads to a destabilisation of the initial conformation. In the subsequent EF-off simulation, beta-sheets do not recover and L3 remains stable in its open unstructured state (Figure 3b ). Coil or loop structures in proteins were previously described to have higher flexibility than highly ordered secondary structures such as -sheets and helices 51 . We quantified the changes in flexibility of RBD by computing the root-mean-square-fluctuations (RMSF) of the RBD (Figure 3c ). RMSF plots reveal that the EF modifies the flexibility of RBD inhomogeneously, with particular emphasis in the L3 loop and the RBM, in general. These results provide evidence that application of EF changes the secondary structure enduringly in segments that are critical for the interaction of the RBD with ACE2, and disrupts the spatial atomic organisation of the backbone and side-chain in key residues.",

We particularly analysed the residues that were previously described as participating in stabilisation of the RBM and in the interaction of the RBD with ACE2, since they contribute to the formation of a network of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions [52] [53] . For instance, pairwise interactions between residues Cys488-Gly485 and Gln474-Gly476 have been pointed out as responsible for the stabilisation of L3 5 . In the no-EF simulation, the corresponding distances between residues were observed to remain within values around 4-5 \u00c5 that enable those interactions 54 (Extended Data, Fig 3) . During EF-on, the same distances increase up to values between 8 \u00c5 and 10 \u00c5, which causes a weakening of the inter-residue interaction. Another important set of residues of the RBM involved in hydrophobic contacts with the central region of the N-terminal helix of ACE2 are localised at the L2 and L3 loops, mainly comprising the aligned amino acids Leu 455, Phe456, Tyr473 and Tyr 489. In the original crystal structure 6M0J and in no-EF simulations, the aromatic residue from Phe456 is in close contact (less than 6 \u00c5) with Tyr473 and the amino group of Lys 417, which leads to a very important stabilising internal -cation interaction 53 . Application of an EF causes the following structural reorganisation of this set of residues: the increased mobility of L3 leads to a break of the Phe456 close-contact interactions, which reorders and misaligns this sequence of hydrophobic contacts (Extended Data, Fig.4, Fig.5 ).",

This interaction consists of astacking of Phe486 with Tyr83 and two intermolecular contacts with the side chains of Leu79 and Met82 of ACE2, which contribute to L3 stability and the enhanced receptor binding. Figure 3d shows the RBM from the PDB structure 6M0J, from a representative conformation at EF=0 and after the EF-off run for EF=10 6 V m\u207b\u00b9. Notice that Phe486 is exposed in the \u03b2turn of L3 in the absence of field, while the structure reorganisation by EF hides this residue in a persistent \u03b2-coil making it sterically inaccessible for the hydrophobic patch of ACE2. The above presented findings suggest that an EF induces disorder at sub-nanometre level that leads to unfavourable positions and orientations of important residues involved in the stabilisation of the RBM and the interaction with ACE2.",

Electrostatic interactions have been intensively studied due to their importance in biomolecules recognition and binding 55, 56 . We computed \u03d5 by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equations for continuum electrostatics using the APBS package 57, 58 . Figure 3e reveals, exemplifying for EF= 10\u2077 V m\u207b\u00b9, that the spatial distribution of \u03d5 on the RBM is severely distorted upon EF application. In particular, the surface charge distribution in the L3 region is strongly affected. Notice that in the crystal structure (PDB ID 6MJ0) the binding surface on the ACE2 side exhibits a positive patch in the central region (blue area, contributed by residue Lys 31) that matches with the corresponding negative area on the RBD, bounded by a set of polar and acid residues including Glu471, Thr478, Glu484 and Gln493) 45 . These matching areas contribute to the strong electrostatic complementarity at the binding interface. After thermalisation (no-EF run) no significant changes occur in this region. However, upon rearrangement of L3, and especially the charged residues Glu471 and Glu484, due to EF application (EF-off run), the negative region in the RBD shifts and faces the negative part of ACE2, generating a repulsive force. At the same time, the region of the RBD opposite to Lys31 of ACE2 exposes non-polar residues. The same change in charge distributions is observed for other EF intensities (data not shown). These calculated electrostatic properties indicate that surface charge distribution in the RBM is strongly modified by EF and therefore the electrostatic complementarity between the S protein and ACE2, and therefore bonding between the RBD and ACE2 is disrupted (see Figure 3e as example for EF= 10\u2077 V m\u207b\u00b9). Docking tests (see below) verified that these contacts are lost.",

We first listed the native-like contacts between RBD and ACE2 5,45,52 in the 6M0J crystal structure (using a cutoff of 7 \u00c5, see Methods and table in Extended data Fig.6 ). Then, we computed the remaining contacts from the above list in the best docked structures after EF and in absence of EF (including the final no-EF-and the 6M0J structures). We selected the cases with the highest number of preserved contacts (see Methods and Extended data Fig.6 ), which are shown in Figure 1c . The number of preserved contacts in the selected structures are taken as an estimate of how well the resulting structure of RBD can dock to the residues of ACE2, and therefore as a guess of how likely the RBD of S can bind to ACE2. The number of preserved contacts significantly decreases for increasing EF intensity (Figure 1c ) up to the limit where all native contacts disappear for extremely high intensities. These estimates of docking efficiency further support our findings that EFs induce conformational changes disturbing the interaction of the RBD with ACE2 by spatially reorganising amino-acid dipoles and charges.",

In this work we showed that the application of relatively low to moderate static EFs can persistently change both the secondary and tertiary structures of S by rearranging and reorienting residues, thus disordering originally ordered segments through breaking and rebuilding of hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges. This results in reshaped local interactions and relative displacements between domains. Disruption of the secondary structure of S, particularly at the RBM, occurs under notoriously weaker EFs than those needed to produce significant changes in other proteins 26, 28, 32 . This suggests a possible causal link between structural vulnerability and affinity to ACE2. The structural features of S allowing the virus to avoid the immune response are in turn those ones particularly unprotected to EFs. It is important to stress that EF of most of the intensities described here are achievable in practice in diverse contexts. For instance, EF strengths between 10 6 V m\u207b\u00b9 and 10 7 V m\u207b\u00b9, being well below the dielectric-breakdown threshold of water 62 , are commonly used in industrial food processing to inactivate pathogens 63 . The immediate availability of cheap ways to produce EFs along with the basic skills required to manipulate them in both lab and industrial environments indicate that the effects described in this paper could spark the development of multiple solutions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, exposure of infectious microdroplets (aerosols) 64 or samples to EFs for timescales greater than a microsecond can generate inactivated or attenuated virions, and thereby cancel a mode of transmission that has been pointed out as the dominant for COVID-19 64 .",

Recent works on exposure of mice to EF near to 10 4 V m\u207b\u00b9 for several weeks as a treatment for diabetes reported no adverse side effects 65 . In the previous Section we showed that EFs disturb both the shape and charge complementarity to ACE2 and cause the exposure/hiding of key RBM-residues, leading to a dramatic reduction or suppression of the docking possibilities of S to the host cell. Owing to the same principle, the EF-induced motion of residues could be exploited to either favour or prevent the interaction of S with other molecules. For instance, cryptic epitopes (sequences that are inaccessible in the prefusion state) could be exposed under EFs, allowing for the binding of antibodies or ligands, as an alternative method to mutationbased techniques available in recombinant protein technology 66 . For instance, ligands acting as blockers can attach to regions of S and lock RBD up-down transitions 66 . Application of EF under the presence of blockers could yield to both disruption of functional motifs and locking dysfunctional conformations. The complete and ultrafast protein denaturation of the studied segment of S obtained under extremely high strengths (10\u2079 V m\u207b\u00b9, see Extended Data, Fig1) after less than 1 nanosecond suggests that intense EF pulses can cause analogous effects as antibodies that inactivate SARS-CoV-2 by premature conversion of S from pre-fusion to post fusion 21 . Although denaturation of S can also be achieved by raising temperature or changing the pH, the process is not controllable, in contrast to the nonthermal barrier-crossing occurring under EFs 67 .",

There is preliminary evidence that the combination of these amino acid substitutions increases the transmissibility and confers resistance to several monoclonal antibodies, as well as resistance to neutralisation when using plasma from convalescent patients 69 . Consequently, these variants may increase the risk of infection or recently developed vaccines may be less effective. It is interesting to note that some of these multiple S protein mutations involve electric charge changes (from neutral to negative in A570D, from neutral to positive in P681H, from negative to positive in E484K and D1118H).

Since there are some evidences that immunological memory due to infection with seasonal human coronaviruses (hCoVs) may generate cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2 70-74 , the EF-modified long-lasting states of the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 might still provoke a certain immune response to the wildtype virus.",

The missing hydrogen atoms and residues were added by using the CHARMM software (v. 43a1) 76 and CHARMM-GUI 77 with the CHARMM36 force field parameters [78] [79] [80] for A, and the tool Modeller 81 for E. Residues were protonated to fulfil pH 7 conditions and histidine (His) residues were treated as protonated on ND1 state (HSD). N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminide (NAG) glycans were kept as in the original crystal structures and were modelled with the parameters of 2-acetyl-2-deoxy--D-glucosamine, with CONH fully charged atoms, using the same CHARMM36 force field.",

This transformation from dihedral space to a linear metric space with a well-defined Euclidean distance, has been shown to preserve a unique representation while avoiding artifacts arising from the periodicity of angles 94 . Next, we found the reduced space by performing PCA over the above-mentioned metric coordinates and selected the first two components (corresponding to the highest eigenvalues) as the representative directions defining the reduced 2dimensional space. PCA finds the directions of correlated motion by diagonalising the covariance matrix, with eigenvectors representing the directions of collective motion and eigenvalues ranked in descending order representing their amplitudes. We performed PCA using the scikit-learn Python library 95 . Then, we projected each trajectory onto the reduced PCA-space. Although we used the components corresponding the trajectory under EF = 10\u2077 V m\u207b\u00b9 to project all results, similar plots arise if principal components corresponding to runs of other EF intensity are used. Therefore, the conclusions are independent of this choice. Different residues and atomic distances (e.g. for disulfide bond and key amino acids) were calculated using customised Python scripts and the MDAnalysis library. Centroids of subdomains (for angle calculations) were computed as the arithmetic mean of the positions of the set of \u0251-carbons of the corresponding residues. Using \u0251-carbons speeds up calculations and yields negligible differences in the position of centroids with respect to the case where all atoms are considered. For distance between individual residues to analyse interaction, we computed the mean distance between all the atoms of each residue. The changes on the secondary structure of the RBD over time with no-EF, EF-on and EFoff were estimated by the STRIDE algorithm implemented in the VMD software package version 1.9.4a38 (2019). The stride algorithm relies on hydrogen bond energy together with statistically derived backbone torsion angle data for the secondary structure characterisation in trajectories previously obtained by GROMACS.",

We approached docking by first selecting the positions and orientations that optimise shape complementarity, followed by a rescoring based on electrostatic, van der Waals and desolvation energies 59 . The first 100 top-scoring structure complexes with the lowest total energy conformations were analysed to evaluate the binding interactions. This docking procedure was applied to the final structure after EF-off in each of the EF intensities evaluated in the shorter sequence. To quantify the likelihood of the docking, we first computed the contacts (as pairs of residues) between the RBD and ACE2 extracted from the 6M0J crystal structure of the RBD-ACE2 complex using a cutoff of 7 \u00c5, measured as arithmetic mean of the atomic distances. We called these contacts native contacts, as they were described elsewhere to be essential for the binding between RBD and ACE2 5, 45, 52 . From the resulting 100 best docked complexes for each input described above, we extracted the contacts following the same rule as for the native contacts, and selected the six structures that preserve the highest number of the native contacts. We accounted only for the first six structures to yield a comparable distribution of achieved preserved contacts between the different cases, since most of the 100 docked structures in each case showed zero preserved contacts and, therefore, would bias the distribution towards zero if they were included, leaving still recognisable tales but difficult to compare. Since we are interested in the likelihood of a correct binding to exist between a structure under scrutiny and ACE2, discarding the bulk of unmatched cases after the best ones is unlikely to lead to loss of important information about each of the specific structures under comparison. To validate the approach, we repeated the procedure consisting in docking, contacts computation and selection of the best contact preserving structures, for the RBD structures from 6M0J (separated from ACE2 and docked again) and the resulting after thermalisation. As shown above in the main text and Fig. 1 , the computational docking of the structures taken from the 6M0J structure almost recover the exact position that was obtained experimentally in two of the cases. The case after thermalisation leads to less contacts than the case of experimental structure, but still around half of the contacts are found more than once, indicating an overall alignment between pairs of residues that are known to form bonds, and making a clear difference with respect to the analysed cases of structures that were exposed to EF.",

Severe denaturation with complete loss of the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein within the first 1 ns takes place.Extended data. Fig. 2 . Estimated free energy profiles for no EF (top), EF-on (middle) and EF-off (bottom) corresponding to 10 4 Vm\u207b\u00b9, 10 5 Vm\u207b\u00b9, 10 6 Vm\u207b\u00b9, 10 7 Vm\u207b\u00b9. For all the EF strengths, the same qualitative landscape is observed, in which the protein state evolves until a new stable minimum is found and its basin is able to confine its further evolution. They also show that an energy barrier prevents a transition back to original conformation.Extended data. Fig. 3 . Time evolution of the mean distance between residues 485-488 and 474-476 under EFs for different strengths (no-EF and EF-on runs). Application of an external electric field has a significant effect on residues distance. In no-EF simulations, the corresponding distances between residues were observed to remain within values around 4-5 \u00c5 that enable these interactions. During EF-on, the same distances increase up to values between 8 \u00c5 and 10 \u00c5, which causes a weakening of the inter-residue interaction.Extended data. Fig. 4 . Snapshots of the RBM region for PDB ID 6M0J, EF=0 and EF=10 6 V m\u207b\u00b9 showing the contact interaction Phe456-Tyr473 and \u03c0-cation interaction between residue Phe456 and the side chain of Lys417. Application of an EF increased mobility of L3 leads to a break of these Phe456 close-contact interactions.Extended data. Fig. 5 .
