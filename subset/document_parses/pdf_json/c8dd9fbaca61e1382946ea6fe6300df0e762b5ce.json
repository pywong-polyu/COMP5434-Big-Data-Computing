However, the evolving structural complexity in contemporary biotherapeutics creates a need for on-going innovation in assay designs for reliable detection of anti-drug antibodies, especially for biotherapeutics that may not be wellsuited for testing by a bridging assay. We, therefore, initiated systematic optimization of the direct binding assay to adapt it for routine use in regulatory-compliant assays of serum anti-drug antibodies. Accordingly, we first prepared a SULFO-TAG labeled conjugate of recombinant Protein-A/G to create a sensitive electrochemiluminescent secondary detection reagent with broad reactivity to antibodies across many species. Secondly, we evaluated candidate blocker-diluents to identify ones producing the highest signal-to-noise response ratios. Lastly, we introduced use of the ratio of signal responses in biotherapeutic-coated and uncoated wells as a data transformation strategy to identify biological outliers. This alternative data normalization approach improved normality, reduced skewness, and facilitated application of a parametric screening cut point. We believe the optimized direct binding assay design employing SULFO-TAG labeled Protein-A/G represents a useful analytical design for detecting serum ADA to biotherapeutics that lack an immunoglobulin Fc domain.",

In addition much progress has been made over the past two decades in devising a harmonized testing strategy for detection and characterization of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to support investigations of unwanted immunogenicity 5-7 . This collaborative effort has culminated in a multi-tiered testing paradigm that is described widely in publications 5, 6, 8, 9 and guidance documents from global regulatory agencies 10-12 . Yet, despite having a consensus approach and availability of multiple assay design options 13-15 , anti-drug antibody testing remains a challenging endeavor owing to the increasing diversity and structural complexity in modern biotherapeutics.",

            "text": "www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Over the last decade monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have comprised a high percentage of the biotherapeutics undergoing development and achieved notable clinical successes across multiple disease categories, including autoimmune disorders 16, 17 and cancer [18] [19] [20] . Because of the widespread interest in therapeutic mAbs much attention has focused on refining the analytical methodology for detection and characterization of unwanted ADA to this class of drugs 5, 8, 9, 21 . Accordingly, for multiple reasons, including appreciable homology with unrelated serum immunoglobulins, ADA testing of mAbs relies heavily on the 'bridging' assay design 5, 8, 9, 22 . This assay design takes advantage of paratope-specific interactions between a bivalent serum ADA and labeled versions of the monoclonal antibody therapeutic (i.e., often a biotinylated version for solid-phase capture reagent and a different labeled form for detection) to form a bridging complex in which the resultant signal response is proportional to the concentration of ADA in the serum test sample. Notwithstanding the commonly encountered technical challenges of drug tolerance 22, 23 and/or target interference 24 , bridging assays possess numerous attributes that make them appealing for use in ADA detection. These include low nonspecific background, good assay sensitivity, indifference to detection of surrogate antibodies from different mammalian species, efficient detection of immunoglobulin isotypes and operational ease for high throughput [13] [14] [15] . Hence, the bridging assay is at present the predominant analytical design used for detecting unwanted ADA during clinical evaluation of many candidate biotherapeutic drugs.",

However, despite being conceptually straightforward and easy to execute for high sample throughput, the direct binding assay has several characteristics that heretofore have rendered it less desirable as an assay design for supporting clinical ADA testing [13] [14] [15] . These include a tendency for having high serum background responses that result in unsatisfactory sensitivity, being prone to increased inter-subject variability that can result in high assay cut points, and most notably being cumbersome to perform because of the need for using multiple species-specific detection reagents. Consequently, these issues have tended to discourage use of this assay design in clinical drug development and have relegated it to being a back-up strategy when other ADA assay designs prove unsuccessful. Accordingly, we undertook optimization of the direct binding assay design to overcome its perceived limitations and to adapt it for routine use in detecting unwanted ADA.",

We offer a versatile assay design strategy that is sensitive, useful for supporting clinical testing, and amenable for application with a wide range of contemporary biotherapeutics that lack an immunoglobulin Fc domain. In brief, we developed and validated a direct binding assay design in which the biotherapeutic-of-interest is first coated on a MSD plate and functions to capture reactive antibodies in diluted serum test samples. After capture SULFO-TAG labeled Protein-A/G is used a single multi-species reagent for detecting bound immunoglobulins. The labeled reagent offers excellent sensitivity for immunoglobulin detection by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) electrochemiluminescence technology 22, 25 , while MSD plate blocking and sample dilution with an optimal reagent, such as ChonBlock 26, 27 , Assay Diluent or Blocker casein, reduces serum background signal responses that enhance specific binding (signal-to-noise). In addition, we implemented the use of biotherapeutic-coated and uncoated MSD plate wells as a novel strategy for improved normalization of test sample signal responses. In assays employing detection with SULFO-TAG labeled Protein-A/G this data transformation reduces inter-subject variability and increases distributional normality which facilitates application of parametric ADA screening cut points. In combination, these innovations culminated in a versatile direct binding assay design that is sensitive, easy to execute and well-suited to support regulatory-compliant detection of ADA in clinical evaluations of unwanted immunogenicity for biotherapeutics that lack an immunoglobulin Fc domain.",

As shown in Fig. 2 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (ThermoFisher) were also quite effective. The least efficient blocker-diluents were PBS/TBS buffers supplemented with BSA or HSA which produced response ratios about 15-times lower than ChonBlock.

Upon establishing the rank order for the effectiveness of candidate blocker-diluents, the optimal ones were evaluated further for their ability to detect serum ADA at the clinically meaningful concentration of 100 ng/ mL 10 . Accordingly, Fig. 3 shows the concentration-response relationship for a serum standard curve of surrogate antibody diluted in the various blockers.

Accordingly, we hypothesized the outliers were samples that had a high level of non-specific binding due to inter-subject differences in immunoglobulin concentrations or immune complexes which can adhere avidly to plastic surfaces and subsequently react with labeled Protein-A/G. To help mitigate this issue, we implemented use of the ratio of signal responses from biotherapeutic-coated and uncoated MSD wells, as an alternative to the commonly used data transformation approach of the ratio of sample signal response to a serum NC pool for calculating a screening cut point 30, 31 . As reported in Table 1 , data transformation with the Log of the ratio of signal responses from biotherapeutic-coated to uncoated wells yielded superior results in comparison to the conventional approach with improved normality (Shapiro-Wilk p-value) and reduced outliers that yield decreased right tail skewness. For each biotherapeutic the alternate normalization approach resulted in a normal distribution after only 1 round of outlier removal which permitted use of a model-based parametric cut point. In contrast, the standard normalization approach of Log (S/NC) yielded normality for only one of the three candidate biotherapeutics with all displaying higher skewness and data distributions having reduced central tendency that are better suited for application of a nonparametric screening cut point.",

Of note, design options are needed to enable detection of serum ADA for candidate biotherapeutics that are not well-suited for testing by the widely used bridging assay design. Some examples include small peptide therapeutics, toxinbased therapeutics 34, 35 , and fusion proteins, particularly those that are conjugated to a repeating polymer, such as polyethylene glycol 36, 37 . The monomeric structural units within polyethylene glycol are known to favor formation of intra-molecular bridging and makes it as a poor candidate for ADA detection by a bridging assay 38 . To address this bioanalytical need, we initiated systematic refinement of the direct binding assay to adapt it for routine use in clinical testing to detect serum ADA to biotherapeutics lacking an immunoglobulin Fc domain. As such our aim for this manuscript is to report findings that establish the suitability of the direct binding assay Figure 5 .

For all three surrogate antibodies, the response ratios were appreciably greater when SULFO-TAG labeled Protein-A/G was used as the detection reagent with 2-times background responses occurring at about 1, 3, and 20 ng/mL, respectively. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ using SULFO-TAG labeled Protein-A/G as one more design option that researchers can employ as part of their overall analytical armamentarium for ADA detection. We intend to report detailed results from pre-study method validation and in-study sample analysis for specific biotherapeutics by the direct binding assay design outlined herein in future manuscripts. Even though the direct binding assay design has appeal for use in supporting clinical ADA testing because of its simplicity and potential for high throughput, it is characterized by some attributes that complicate its routine use for regulatory-compliant detection of ADA 5, 8, 9 . Chief among these are high matrix background signal responses that limit sensitivity, being prone to having false positives and, most notably, the requirement for using multiple species-specific immunoglobulin detection reagents, one for human and one for the animal surrogate positive control. Accordingly, we systematically optimized the direct binding assay with the aim of establishing a versatile design that would be suitable to accommodate today's biotherapeutic diversity. First, we implemented SULFO-TAG labeled recombinant Protein-A/G as a sensitive detection reagent having broad reactivity to both human and other mammalian antibodies. Secondly, we identified several optimal blocker-diluents that maximize assay sensitivity by limiting the degree of non-specific binding. Lastly, we introduced a data transformation strategy involving biotherapeutic-coated and uncoated MSD wells that offers robust outlier identification, reduced skewness, and better normality that aids application of model-based parametric cut points for assigning plate specific screening cut points.",

            "text": "One practical operational issue that limits the appeal of the direct binding assay design is the requirement for using multiple species-specific secondary detection reagents 5, [7] [8] [9] . This is because clinical ADA testing typically employs surrogate antibodies from animal species, such as rabbit or mouse, to support method development and validation, as well as in test sample analysis for run acceptance. To overcome this limitation, we adapted a Even though recombinant Protein-A/G has demonstrably higher reactivity towards IgG 31 , it reacts satisfactorily with other isotypes, including IgM and IgA, to allow its use as a broad-specificity detection reagent to support clinical ADA testing (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, the specificity of labeled Protein-A/G is beneficial, as it will enable efficient transitioning of ADA assays from nonclinical toxicology to Phase I testing with minimal need for assay reoptimization. SULFO-TAG labeled reagents are used widely today in bridging assays for detection of ADA 8, 9, 22, 23 . In addition, numerous publications have reported using Protein-A/G combined with other detection labels, such as horseradish peroxidase, for antibody detection in serology assays 39, 40 . However, we believe our study is the first one to report the use of a SULFO-TAG labeled conjugate of recombinant Protein-A/G as the secondary detection reagent in a direct binding assay that is intended for supporting clinical ADA testing. In addition to offering excellent sensitivity to meet regulatory requirement for ADA detection, use of SULFO-TAG labeled Protein-A/G is convenient from a clinical lab testing workflow perspective because it eliminates the need for multiple species-specific detection reagents and uses the same electrochemiluminescence reader instrumentation that is used widely today in bridging ADA assays. Furthermore, in our experience when formulated with 0.2% BSA (w/v) as a carrier protein, SULFO-TAG labeled Protein-A/G demonstrates excellent long-term frozen stability at \u2212 80 \u00b0C which is appealing for consistency in longitudinal testing of ADA. Despite its utility as a secondary detection reagent, SULFO-TAG labeled Protein-A/G suffers from one obvious cross-reactivity limitation. It is not suitable as a detection reagent if the biotherapeutic-of-interest possesses a Fc structural domain. Heretofore, one factor that has complicated the application of SULFO-TAG labeled Protein-A/G as an ADA secondary detection reagent is the high-level of non-specific binding resulting from interference caused by the high concentration of unrelated serum immunoglobulins 29, 41 . To solve this problem, we evaluated numerous different blocker-diluents to identify ones that yielded optimal assay signal-to-noise (i.e., ratio in the signal responses for biotherapeutic-coated wells / uncoated wells). In comparison to other blocker-diluents, we found ChonBlock to be particularly effective at limiting serum matrix non-specificity resulting from the avid binding of immunoglobulins and soluble immunoglobulin complexes to plastic surfaces 29, 29, [41] [42] [43] [44] . When combined with an optimal blocker-diluent, such as ChonBlock, Assay Diluent or Blocker casein (Fig. 2) , SULFO-TAG labeled Protein-A/G provides assay sensitivity that is suitable for routine detection of unwanted ADA at the clinically meaningful level of 100 ng/mL (Fig. 3) 10 . While the blocker-diluents recommended herein are typically the optimal ones, we have found that they can vary case-by-case depending on the structural attributes of the target therapeutic. For this reason, we recommend that a simple experiment be performed during method development to select the optimal blocker-diluent to use for a given therapeutic.",

            "text": "Today's widely used multi-tiered ADA testing paradigm typically involves the use of a well-characterized negative control (NC) (i.e., serum pool from presumptive ADA negative samples) as the standard data transformation strategy in tier 1 screening assays 10 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ relative to a common NC serum pool to reduce variability and aids computation of a plate specific cut point for reliable classification of test samples with a 5% false positive error rate [10] [11] [12] . However during this investigation, we noted an appreciable lack of normality and skewness from false positives (i.e., samples with extreme signal responses in the right tail relative to overall distribution, but lacking reactive antibodies). Upon further evaluation we determined that differences in inter-subject non-specific binding (i.e., binding response in uncoated MSD wells) was the principal cause for the observed outliers. Notably, previous studies have reported that inter-subject differences in non-specific binding of immunoglobulins and immune complexes to ELISA plastic surfaces can result in inaccuracy in reported results [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . We resolved the increased inter-subject variability by implementing a modified data transformation approach for normalizing RLU signal responses. Similar to the one that is used in serology testing of infectious agents [41] [42] [43] [44] , including SARS-CoV-2 46,47 , we implemented use of uncoated wells for each subject to control for the extent of non-specific binding. Accordingly, we adopted a normalization strategy in which the ratio of each test sample's signal responses is determined after incubation in biotherapeutic-coated and uncoated MSD wells. The assay's screening cut point is computed subsequently using the Log (coated wells/ uncoated wells) data transformation. Unlike the common ADA testing practice used today in which results for test samples are evaluated by a plate specific cut point (i.e., cut point factor x mean negative control response), the modified approach described herein results in consistent assay cut point that is applied at the overall run level. We believe this alternative approach offers more reliable identification of biological outliers and, as reported in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 4 , yields improved distributional normality and decreased skewness. Both attributes are desirable statistically for application of a parametric screening cut point. In contrast, a nonparametric cut point needs a much larger sample size to obtain reliable estimates at the 95th and 99th percentiles 33 .",

Accordingly, they were designated as either Low Salt (VWR TBST, 25 mM Tris, 3 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, and 1.0% Tween 20, pH 7,4.) or High Salt (40 mM NaPO 4 , 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The high salt wash buffer was prepared as a custom reagent by Boston BioProducts (Ashland, MA). Decisions about which wash buffer version to use were based upon the degree of stringency needed for efficient blank reduction. While low salt wash buffer is convenient operationally, high salt buffer yields higher signal-to-noise performance for some coated antigens.",

After about 2 h, the reaction was quenched by adding a small volume of amine-containing buffer, followed by gentle mixing for an additional 20 min. The SULFO-TAG labelled Protein A/G was purified by size exclusion chromatography using a HiPrep\u2122 26/40 column packed with Sephadex G-50 (fine) (GE, cat # 17-0042-01) and a mobile phase consisting of PBS supplemented with 5% sucrose and 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.4. Detailed characterization of the purified conjugated product included concentration measurement by BCA Protein Assay, purity assessment by analytical HPLC-SEC and SULFO-TAG label molar incorporation ratio determination by Abs measurement at 455 nm.

On the day prior to sample analysis, 96-well MSD plates were coated by passive adsorption with the biotherapeutic-of-interest at a concentration of about 2 \u00b5g/ mL in PBS, sealed with Whatman Uniseal plate covers and incubated overnight in a common lab refrigerator at around 4 \u00b0C. Alternatively, biotinylated versions of the biotherapeutic were coated on a streptavidin-coated MSD plate for about 30-60 min at ambient temperature prior to use. On the next day, the plates were washed using Scientific Reports | (2021) 11:15467 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95055-x www.nature.com/scientificreports/ a BioTek 405 automated plate washer for three cycles with 300 \u00b5L/well of wash buffer with the liquid aspirated completely after the last cycle. The MSD plates were then blocked by adding 200-250 \u00b5L of ChonBlock. At this point all subsequent incubations were conducted at ambient temperature with plate shaking at approximately 700 rpm. After incubation for 1-3 h the MSD plates were washed again with another 3 cycles of wash buffer (300 \u00b5L/well). Prior to pipetting on MSD plates, test samples and quality control (QC) specimens underwent a MRD (minimal required dilution) ranging from 1:50 to 1:100. For example, specimens can be initially diluted 1:25 in ChonBlock or blocker casein, followed by a 1:2 dilution (equal vol.) into either ChonBlock (screening assays) or ChonBlock containing a 2X concentration of the biotherapeutic-of-interest (confirmatory testing). For confirmatory assays, samples were pre-incubated in a polypropylene 96-well plate to achieve competitive inhibition for approximately 1 h at ambient temperature. Aliquots (50 \u00b5L) of the diluted test samples and controls were added to duplicate MSD plate wells, sealed with Whatman Uniseal\u2122 plate covers, and incubated for about 1 h. Following another round of plate washing, as described above, 50 \u00b5L of the SULFO-TAG labeled protein A/G detection reagent (diluted to 0.1 \u00b5g/ mL in Low Cross Buffer (or Blocker casein) was added to each well followed by incubation for approximately 30 min.

On day 1 the MSD plate was coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 2 \u00b5g/mL of a representative biotherapeutic. On day 2, the plate was washed and blocked with the various candidate blocker-diluents. A standard curve of a surrogate specific rabbit antibody was prepared in human serum and then diluted 1/100 in the various buffers. The assay was performed, as described in the \"Materials and methods\" section, using detection with 0.1 \u00b5g/mL of SULFO-TAG labeled Protein-A/G diluted in LowCross Buffer. The reported response ratio is the RLU of the surrogate antibody serum calibrators/RLU from the NC (i.e., human serum pool not supplemented with surrogate antibody).",
