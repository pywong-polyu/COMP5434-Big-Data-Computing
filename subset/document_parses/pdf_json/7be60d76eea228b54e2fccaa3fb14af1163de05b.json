However, they should not be used in isolation but associated with other measures such as social distancing and hand hygiene. 4 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasises the need to adopt measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, such as avoiding touching eyes, nose with unwashed hands, coughs and sneezing etiquette, keeping the touched surfaces cleaned and disinfected. 5 Public health programmes require behavioural change in many domains to effectively help people maintain health and reduce disease risks. 6 The practice of preventive behaviour by the population is one of the most effective ways of preventing disease and promoting health. 7 8 With the support of public policies, these preventative health individual behaviours can translate significant prevention efforts at the populational level. 9 However, low degree of agreement between a population's behaviour with the recommended health actions implies clinical, health and psychosocial consequences. It is valid to consider the existence of a complex relationship among knowledge, awareness of the need to change, intention to change and a real change of health behaviour. This change is a process, not an event and maintaining behavioural change requires different strategies. 6 A previous systematic review summarised the current evidence related to existing barriers and facilitators to healthcare workers' adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. The authors concluded that several factors, such as workplace culture, training and access to protective equipment, influence healthcare workers' ability and willingness to follow the IPC guidelines. 10 Currently, vaccines are not yet available, and the world is facing the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic trying to recover the economy and social life, including work and study environments. Thus, there is an urgent need to promote adherence to measures that prevent and control COVID-19 and other prevalent respiratory infectious diseases among the general population. Therefore, this rapid qualitative evidence synthesis aims to summarise research evidence on barriers and facilitators to population adherence to COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases prevention and control measures.",

This model has often been applied for health preventionrelated and asymptomatic concerns where beliefs are as relevant or more relevant than evident symptoms. 6 In the BCW the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation system are the components which interact to generate behaviour. 17 After data extraction, two reviewer authors will reread the findings of the included studies and will apply the framework across the themes. New themes may be generated from evidence not captured by the a priori framework.
