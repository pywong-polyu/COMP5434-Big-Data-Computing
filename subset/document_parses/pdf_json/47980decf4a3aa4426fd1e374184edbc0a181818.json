Ensuring the trustworthiness of these models is essential. Especially bias, defined as a disparity in the model's predictive performance across different subgroups, may cause unfairness against specific subgroups, which is an undesired phenomenon for trustworthy ML models. In this research, we address the question to which extent bias occurs in medical FL and how to prevent excessive bias through reward systems. We first evaluate how to measure the contributions of institutions toward predictive performance and bias in cross-silo medical FL with a Shapley value approximation method. In a second step, we design different reward systems incentivizing contributions toward high predictive performance or low bias. We then propose a combined reward system that incentivizes contributions toward both. We evaluate our work using multiple medical chest X-ray datasets focusing on patient subgroups defined by patient sex and age. Our results show that we can successfully measure contributions toward bias, and an integrated reward system successfully incentivizes contributions toward a well-performing model with low bias. While the partitioning of scans only slightly influences the overall bias, institutions with data predominantly from one subgroup introduce a favorable bias for this subgroup. Our results indicate that reward systems, which focus on predictive performance only, can transfer model bias against patients to an institutional level. Our work helps researchers and practitioners design reward systems for FL with well-aligned incentives for trustworthy ML.",

To compensate institutions for the efforts and risks in participating in FL, considerations for reward systems are emerging [1] . These reward systems also aim to attract high-quality gradient contributions by institutions [9] , as the quality of an FL model depends on the quality of the contributions by institutions over multiple communication rounds [10] . In healthcare, the quality of an ML model is multifaceted. A high-quality ML model must have not only a high predictive performance to provide optimal health outcomes to patients but also a low bias, which is essential for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare [11, 12] . Especially ML-based chest X-ray classifiers are often biased, meaning their predictive performance is higher for some subgroups (e.g., with regard to sex, age, race, or socioeconomic status) [13, 14] . This bias can lead to unfair treatment of disadvantaged subgroups and ultimately cause medical professionals and patients to lack trust in AI and hinder its deployment [11] . Beholding bias is particularly important in FL scenarios: inhomogeneous data distributions are traditionally challenging for FL algorithms [1] , and research is concerned that FL can potentially amplify bias in these settings [7, 15] .",

For example, it should allocate a high reward to an institution contributing strongly or the same reward to two institutions contributing the same. Thus, to enable such reward systems in practice, we first need to quantify contributions toward performance and model bias. For this, extant research uses the Shapley value (SV), which uniquely fulfills desirable properties of collaboration fairness [10] . However, computing SVs is computationally complex. Therefore, prior research developed efficient approximations [16] [17] [18] . So far, the focus of these approximations has been on quantifying contributions toward predictive performance and it remains unclear how to quantify contributions toward bias in a medical FL scenario. As a first step, we aim to quantify the contributions of FL institutions toward bias using the SV. To design a reward system, we then need to translate these quantifications into a reward (e.g., monetary units). Contrary to contributions toward predictive performance, small or negative-valued contributions by institutions can be desired to achieve a low absolute bias. This demands more research on the development of practically viable reward distribution strategies. In a second step, we thus aim to develop reward schemes for FL that incentivize both, a high predictive performance, and a small absolute bias.",

First, group rationality, meaning the entire value gain of the FL consortium is completely distributed among all participating institutions (2) . However, the computation of SVs requires the training and testing of 2 FL coalitions of institutions, which presents a very high computational and network burden for practical use cases. Therefore, efficiently approximating SVs is an active field of research with different streams of research. An essential work in this direction proposes two approximations [17] . With one approximation algorithm, only the largest FL coalition is trained. Approximated FL models from all other coalitions are then computed by adding the gradients of the participating institutions from the largest coalition, over all communication rounds from training the largest coalition. The performance metric of the resulting models is then obtained from the test datasets. Based on the results, the SVs can be computed. The other, alternative approximation algorithm can value contributions of participants in every single round. However, it is more computationally complex and provides less accurate approximations of SVs.",

Rewards can take different forms, for example, monetary value [1, 10] , or reputation [27] . The fair distribution of rewards depends on a fair quantification of the contributions. The general goal of reward systems in FL is to compensate institutions for the effort in participating in FL [1] , as well as to attract high-quality gradient contributions by institutions [9] . Beyond these factors, further unique challenges in FL demand for reward systems. Most contemporary FL systems give all participants access to the model, independent of their gradient contributions. Thus, these FL systems lack incentives for institutions to participate actively in the learning process. In view of potential privacy risks when publishing gradients in FL [8] , there can be even benefits to not contribute actively to FL. This is also referred to as the free-rider problem [10] , which is relevant in medical data sharing scenarios [28] .",

On the other hand, counterpartying institutions with predominantly disfavored patient subgroups (male patients, old patients) have lower contributions toward predictive performance, and receive less rewards as well. These results indicate that a model bias affecting patients can also convey to an institutional level: institutions with advantaged patients receive higher rewards than institutions with disadvantaged patients. For reward systems in practice, this can economically handicap institutions of disadvantaged patients, and thus, reinforce back to the patients (e.g., through worsened equipment in the financially disadvantaged institution). We address this issue by developing a reward system which incentivizes contributions toward a reduction of the absolute bias. Analogously, the rewards are allocated in proportion to the utiliy of the coalition. We evaluate it for contributions toward sex bias and age bias. We then combine the reward system incentivizing predictive performance, and the ones incenvitizing a rediction in bias.

The results show that institutions with a higher share of scans sampled from one subgroup introduce a stronger bias favoring this subgroup, compared with institutions sampling the other subgroup from the same dataset. In this regard, FL behaves similar to centralized ML, where prior research found this tendency with regard to sex bias [14] . Furthermore, the results suggest that in their 'as is' split, the NIH and CXR dataset institutions tend to introduce a favorable bias for female patients and young patients, whereas the CXP dataset institutions tend to introduce a favorable bias for male patients and old patients.",

For research, our results show the necessity that FL institutions require means to better understand and control the bias they introduce to a FL consortium [7, 37, 38] . This may help institutions in receiving higher rewards, and ultimately, reduce the bias of the global FL model. Furthermore, our results ask for more economic research on reward systems for medical FL. This includes the question of the importance of bias for different subgroups in healthcare [13] , and the relative importance of a low absolute bias compared to a high predictive performance in FL, as this would influence the distribution of different reward pools. Further research may also deploy reward systems in healthcare practice and investigate the practical benefits and challenges. Thereby, it can also aim to find out more about the readiness of institutions in adopting reward systems. Finally, a further interesting avenue for research is the design of reward systems in decentralized swarm learning scenarios. Thereby, a blockchain-based system orchestrates the FL process with promising applications for healthcare [19, 39] . Future research may aim to further integrate reward systems into automated, smart contract-based data marketplaces [19] .",

As a result, it is difficult for institutions to estimate whether they will reduce the overall bias, or amplify it, which has a strong implication for their received rewards.
