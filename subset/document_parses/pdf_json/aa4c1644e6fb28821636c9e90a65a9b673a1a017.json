Extensive numerical analysis based on transfer matrix theory as well as finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique has been performed to characterize the sensor response considering sensitivity, full width at half maxima, and minimum reflection. About 7.6 times enhanced sensitivity has been obtained using the proposed architecture for SARS-CoV-2 detection, compared to the basic Kretschmann configuration. Notably, the structure provides consistent enhancement over other competitive SPR structures for both angular and wavelength interrogations with a figure-of-merit of 692.28. Additionally, we repeated simulations for various ligate-ligand pairs to assess the range of applicability and robust performance improvement has been observed. As a result, the proposed sensor design provides a suitable configuration for highly sensitive, rapid, noninvasive biosensing which can be useful if adopted in experimental sensing protocols.",

Since its emergence in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, the devastating rapid transmission and havoc caused by this virus has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) classifying this outbreak as a pandemic on March 12, 2020 [2] . As per the report on Aug 6, 2020, number of confirmed cases has soared upto 18,614,177, with a death toll of 702,642 [3] . With no proven medication or vaccines in sight still for COVID-19, significant research endeavors have focused on early diagnosis and management to control the damage [4] . The laboratory standard detection scheme is reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), which attempts to identify the presence of nucleic acid-based genetic sequence of this virus [4] . However, RT-qPCR takes at least 3 h and requires sophisticated testing facilities [5] in addition to suffering from false positives. To cope with the rapid spread of COVID-19, highly sensitive diagnostic methods without requiring extensive lab setup is of utmost importance. Another promising diagnostic method is computed tomography (CT) scan where multiple chest X-rays are captured across different angles to obtain three-dimensional (3D) images. But the challenge using such technique lies in being able to differentiate symptoms from other lung disorders, failure in doing so results in rather low specificity of around 25% [6] in practice. Apart from these, other methods include biochemical tests targeting the viral protein or the antibodies and contact tracing [1] . Recently, Seo et al. proposed a field-effect transistor-based sensor topology for SARS-CoV-2 detection from human nasopharyngeal swabs [5] . While such sensing mechanisms are being explored, there is still an urgent demand for ultrasensitive, real-time, point-of-care diagnostic methods to further aid the practitioners in fighting against To that end, one potential domain is the usage of biosensors [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . They are preferable due to high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid response time, cost-effectiveness, and multiplexing capabilities.",

            "text": "In terms of optical biosensors, plasmonics is an attractive field with real-time and label-free detection features. Plasmon is the combined oscillation of the free electron in metal with respect to the restoring force of the positive nucleus. Surface plasmons (SP) are confined to the surface of the metal and they are generated at the interface of the metal having negative permittivity and a dielectric material with the interaction of electromagnetic waves such as light. When they are excited, most of the light energy is absorbed by the plasmons, and thus reflection becomes the lowest. The surface plasmon wave (SPW) propagation was first demonstrated by Otto [21] . To generate SPW, the energy or momentum of the photons of light must match with the energy or momentum of the SPs which cannot be obtained when light is incident on the metal from air as a medium. Thus, a momentum enhancing configuration is needed, and it was solved by attaching a silver metal layer to a glass substrate by Kretschmann et al. [22] . Now, this configuration is known as the basic Kretschmann configuration where light is incident on the metal layer through a glass prism, and the angle of incident is changed beyond the critical angle to excite SPW on the opposite surface of the metal. Over the years, such SPR sensor setup has undergone various modifications and been utilized in various applications. Commercially available surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensors have been used for disease [23] as well as viral strains detection such as SARS, MERS, and influenza [1] . Taking into account the promise of plasmonic sensors for detection purposes, Qiu et al. [24] have developed a biosensor combining plasmonic photothermal (PPT) effect and LSPR for COVID-19 diagnosis. They utilize DNA receptors which selectively bond with RNA sequences from the SARS-CoV2 through nucleic acid hybridization. One of the key challenges of accurate detection using such plasmonic sensors is ensuring ultra-sensitive performance with excellent limit of detection. Along those lines, SPR sensing is the most mature and established technology providing very good resolution of detection. However, it is pivotal to numerically analyze the suitability of deploying such SPR sensors for detecting SARS-CoV2 and a proper sensor configuration is required to achieve desired level of performance. This motivates our study in this paper where we propose an SPR sensor configuration aiming toward SARS-CoV2 detection with high sensitivity and figure-of-merit. To enhance the overall sensor performance, we integrate layers of Si and BaTiO 3 on top of the metal layer (Ag). Thiol-tethered DNA has been used as receptor for sensing. The proposed sensing pipeline assumes collection of samples from human nasopharyngeal swabs and passing them through the sensing channel in a liquid solution, while the sensor is illuminated from different angles. When the binding occurs between immobilized receptor on sensor surface and target biomolecules from the flowing sample, a shift in SPR angle is observed the extent of which determines the sensitivity. Our transfer matrixbased analysis corroborated with finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) simulation shows that the proposed sensor architecture is able to obtain very high sensitivity with low minimum reflection (Rmin) and improved figure-of-merit (FOM) compared to other reported results. Furthermore, we verified the robustness of the sensor design through analyzing its performance for other ligand-ligate combinations.",

This novel hetero structure, as shown in the figure, is composed of 5 different layers. We use BK7 glass as a coupling prism followed by a Ag layer. Ag has been proven to demonstrate better sensitivity as a substrate layer due to higher SPR ratio [25] . However, one of the major drawbacks of using Ag is its lesser chemical stability due to oxidation while interacting with bio molecules [25, 26] . In our proposed design, we overcome this problem by employing 3 layers comprising of Si, BaTiO 3 and thiol-tethered DNA, respectively, on top of Ag. Such configuration also aids in sensitivity enhancement. In recent research, Si has shown good promise in improving sensitivity [27] . Si's ability to enhance the electric field intensity of excitation light plays major role behind this sensitivity increment [28, 29] . BaTiO 3 also has desirable effects on sensitivity due to its high dielectric constant. Together with low dielectric loss, it has potential to contribute significantly to enhance sensitivity of our proposed structure [30] . Thiol-tethered DNA is used as a ligand layer for sensing medium as it has shown excellent properties as a receptor of SARS-Cov-2 [24, 31] . Having decided on the composition of various layers of our sensor design, the next step is to model them properly to simulate their response. We model each layer as a homogeneous continuous medium upto the next layer interface wherein the layer is represented by its refractive index. Hence, the next subsection focuses on modeling the refractive indices of the layers under consideration.",

Sensitivity and optical non linearity both are proportionally varied with frequency (inversely proportional to wavelength) [25] . Optical Kerr effect becomes prominent if the frequency of operation is increased such that the beam intensity is on the order of 1 GW cm \u22122 and exerts significant variations in refractive index [42] . We select operating wavelength as 633 nm such that sensitivity is enhanced with minimum possible Kerr effect [25, 42] . We employ ppolarized light in attenuated total internal reflection (ATR) configuration in our analysis. In this case, the incident angle must be greater than the critical angle c of glass-silver interface, where c = n Ag n Air . If we assume energy loss other than material absorption to be zero, then according to principle of energy conservation, the total of absorption(A), transmission (T) and reflection(R) must be equal to 1 (i.e., A+T+R = 1). Again, since transmission is zero under ATR, absorption reduces to A = 1-R. When surface plasmons (SPs) are excited, reflection becomes minimum. As a result, this leads to the maximum transfer of light energy to the evanescent wave. With the structural and illumination setup discussed above, next it is important to formulate a theoretical framework to numerically evaluate the sensor performance, this leads to our following section on numerical modeling.",

Initially, we set the thickness of Si, BaTiO 3 , Thiol layers at some arbitrary values and optimize Ag layer thickness to get minimum Rmin and maximum sensitivity. Then the same process is repeated for other layers as well based on sensitivity and Rmin. After that, we optimize the Ag thickness again with optimized thickness of Si, BaTiO 3 and thiol thickness. This optimization process is continued in an iterative manner until we get the most optimized structure possible. In Fig. 3(a) , we show dependence of Rmin and sensitivity of the sensor against the thickness variation of Ag. Rmin gradually decreases with increasing thickness up to a certain thickness and then it starts increasing. Similar trend holds true for sensitivity as well but in opposite direction. We see that optimum thicknesses for minimum Rmin and maximum sensitivity are very close. Based on the obtained results, we select 50 nm as Ag thickness for our structure. Notably, our numerically optimized metal thickness matches well with theoretically obtained optimized value for metal layer as described in [48] . Figure 3 (b), (c) and (d) shows the effect of Si, BaTiO 3 , and thiol layer thickness variations on Rmin and sensitivity, respectively. For Si, the variation pattern follows more or less same fashion as Ag. After 8 nm there is a drastic increase in Rmin. So, we choose 8 nm for Si thickness which gives maximum sensitivity with minimal Rmin. For BaTiO 3 , we select 11 nm as thickness for the same reason. Thiol optimization curve is quite different. Rmin was very low and fairly constant until 3 nm of thiol thickness, after which it starts increasing exponentially. However, the sensitivity peaks just before 4 nm. As a result, we opt for 4 nm as thiol thickness to attain the best compromise between low Rmin and high sensitivity in our proposed structure. In this thickness the refractive index is 1.4 [36] .",

The narrower the curve and hence lower FWHM, the better the resolution is. On the other hand, sensing accuracy depends on Rmin and sensitivity of the device. In Fig. 4(a) we show the SPR curve for two different refractive index of the sensing layer. We see that for a slight increase of refractive index, there is a noticeable variation in the resonance angle. This gives a sensitivity as high as 130.3 deg/RIU which is 7.6 times higher than the conventional Kretschmann configuration. In Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c) , we plot the coupled power and coupled fields versus incident angle, respectively. We see that both the coupled electric and magnetic field are maximum at the resonance angle. Same thing happens to the couple power as well which confirms the SPR occurrence at that particular incident angle. This clearly indicates the creation of evanescent wave at this specific angle and consequently we get a sharp dip in resonance curve. When light is incident at the resonance angle, maximum power transfer occurs from the source to the evanescent wave. Electric and magnetic field profiles are shown in Fig. 4(d) along the direction of penetration of evanescent wave inside the sensing layer. Both the E-and H-fields follow almost the same pattern. Field intensity peaks sharply at the vicinity of metal-dielectric interface and penetrates through the dielectric layers. As it passes through the dielectric layers, it dies out exponentially. Essentially, field strength is very strong within a very small distance where the analyte bonds with the ligand. This indicates a very narrow range of detectable distance. In our case, analyte bonding starts after 23 nm from the interface. We see that fields are very strong in this region which provides the enhanced sensitivity.",
