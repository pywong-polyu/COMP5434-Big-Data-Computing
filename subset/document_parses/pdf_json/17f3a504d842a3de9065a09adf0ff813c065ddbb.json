Viability of probiotics in the food matrix and further in the digestive system is still a challenge for the food industry. Different approaches were used to enhance the viability of probiotics including microencapsulation and layer-by-layer cell coating. The of aim of this study was to evaluate the viability of coated Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus using a layer-by-layer (LbL) technique with black seed protein (BSP) extracted from Nigella sativa defatted seeds cakes (NsDSC), as a coating material, with alginate, inulin, or glucomannan, separately, and the final number of coating layers was 3. The viable cell counts of the plain and coated L. rhamnosus were determined under sequential simulated gastric fluid (SGF) for 120 min and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) for 180 min. Additionally, the viability after exposure to 37, 45, and 55 \u2022 C for 30 min was also determined. Generally, the survivability of coated L. rhamnosus showed significant (p \u2264 0.05) improvement (<4, 3, and 1.5 logs reduction for glucomannan, alginate and inulin, respectively) compared with plain cells (\u223c6.7 log reduction) under sequential exposure to SGF and SIF. Moreover, the cells coated with BSP and inulin showed the best protection for L. rhamnosus under high temperatures. Edible films prepared with pectin with LbL-coated cells showed significantly higher values in their tensile strength (TS) of 50% and elongation at the break (EB) of 32.5% than pectin without LbL-coated cells. The LbL technique showed a significant protection of probiotic cells and potential use in food application.",

Probiotics promote health status and play an essential role against colonization of pathogenic microbes in the intestine by the production of antimicrobial compounds, increase gut integrity by stimulating mucus production, improve enzyme formation, regulate the composition of (GI) microbiota, and act as immunity modulators. Nowadays, the investigations about the importance of GI microbiota are widely and intensively increased. It was reported that probiotics and GI microbiota composition demonstrate a major role in the progression of many diseases and disorders, such as obesity, allergies, diabetes, inflammations, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), cancer, infectious diseases, and even neurodegenerative diseases (Kechagia et al., 2013) . Therefore, the food industry has never missed the chance to increase its profits by producing novel probiotics. From the economic point of view, the global probiotics market is expected to reach USD 77.09 billion by 2025 (Grand View Research, 2021) . Moreover, economic analysts have expected an increase in the demand for functional food especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been demonstrated that certain probiotics, such as lactic acid bacteria, produce bioactive peptides, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, which may help manage COVID-19 Bhattacharya et al., 2021) .",

Nevertheless, choosing the right probiotics for specific health conditions is still a challenge for some reasons, such as variations in the mode of action of different probiotics, differences in manufacturing processes, quality control of the products, and differences in the international regulatory requirements of minimum effective dose (Sniffen et al., 2018) .",
