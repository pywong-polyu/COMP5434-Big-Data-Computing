Most studies on neutralization susceptibility were conducted using specimens from adult COVID-19 patients or vaccine recipients. However, since the paediatric population has an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that is distinct from the adult population, it is critical to assess the neutralization susceptibility of pediatric serum specimens. This study compared the neutralization susceptibility of serum specimens collected from 49 individuals of <18 years old, including 34 adolescent BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine recipients, and 15 recovered COVID-19 patients aged between 2 and 17. We demonstrated that only 38.2% of BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 26.7% of recovered COVID-19 patients had their serum neutralization titre at or above the detection threshold in our live virus microneutralization assay. Furthermore, the neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron variant was substantially lower than those against the ancestral virus or the Beta variant. Our results suggest that vaccine recipients and COVID-19 patients in the pediatric age group will likely be more susceptible to vaccine breakthrough infections or reinfections due to the Omicron variant than previous variants.",

            "text": "Transmission from children to their adult household members has been shown to result in their hospitalization [6] . Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic also negatively impacted the psychosocial wellbeing of children and their families, particularly those with special education needs and lower socio-economical status [7] . COVID-19 vaccines are very effective, especially against severe diseases. These vaccines are largely safe in children [8, 9] , and are effective in reducing the transmission and complications against infection from the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), such as the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants [10, 11] . Recently, a new VOC, B.1.1.529, was identified in Botswana and South Africa in early November 2021 and was designated as the Omicron variant by the World Health Organization soon afterwards. The Omicron variant exhibits higher transmissibility when compared with the Delta variant [12] . Several studies, including our own study, have recently shown that serum specimens collected from vaccine recipients failed to neutralize the Omicron variant [13, 14] . However, antibody response in children is distinct from those of adults [15] . Pediatric patients with prior COVID-19 infection had reduced neutralizing antibody response when compared with adults [15, 16] , whereas adolescents have a more robust neutralizing antibody response than adults in clinical trials of BNT162b2 and Coronavac [17, 18] . Hence, it is critical to specifically assess whether the immune sera from children can neutralize the Omicron variant. This study aimed to determine the susceptibility of the Omicron variant to serum antibodies from children who recovered from COVID-19 infection or those who have received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccines.",

Since the Omicron variant carries several spike mutations that are known to confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies, many studies have been conducted rapidly to assess the degree of resistance associated with this novel variant. However, these studies were conducted either in adults, or the age group was not specified [13, 14, [23] [24] [25] . Our previous study showed that adult BNT162b2 vaccine recipients had a 36-40fold reduction in MN titer against the Omicron variant [13] . However, results from the current adolescent postvaccination cohort showed only a 20.9 fold reduction in GMT, or a median of 16-fold reduction. This can be related to the difference in the quality of antibody response between adolescents and adults. A previous study found that antibody in the pediatric age group are mainly targeting the S protein, while antibody from adults target both S and N protein [15] . This study has several limitations. First, as many patients had a MN titer of <10, their fold reduction may have been underestimated. Second, this study did not assess cross-reactive T cell immunity against the Omicron variant. Third, since COVID-19 vaccine was not yet recommended for children aged 11 or younger in Hong Kong at the time of writing this manuscript, we were not able to assess the effect of Omicron variant in this age group. Fourth, this study only included BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. Data is required for other vaccine types. Finally, vaccine recipients in this cohort may have a dysregulated humoral immune response. However, none of the patients received immunosuppressants, such as steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, or biologics [19] .",

Our results suggest that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines may be reduced for the Omicron variant in the paediatric age group. In order to achieve a better protection against the Omicron variant, adolescents who have received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines may require a third dose, and recovered pediatric COVID-19 patients should receive COVID-19 vaccines. However, since mRNA vaccines are associated with an increased risk of myocarditis in adolescents [19, 28] , there must be a careful balance between adverse events and vaccine effectiveness when choosing the type of vaccine for the third dose for this age group.",

Hence, the antibody levels of majority of the paediatric COVID-19 patients would have dropped to a very low level, if not undetectable, beyond 8 months after infection. Further studies are required to determine whether vaccination after prior COVID-19 infection in children would provide added protection against re-infection and breakthrough infection by the Omicron variant.",
