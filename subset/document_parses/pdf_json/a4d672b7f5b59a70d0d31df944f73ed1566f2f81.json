To investigate these behaviour changes, an online survey was conducted with 1 \u2032 028 individuals (51% female) in Switzerland between June and July 2020. The questions referred in particular to the lockdown in spring 2020. We put specific focus on the pandemic's impact on health-related behaviour, which includes food choice, physical activity and body weight management. For instance, participants reported whether and how their consumption of different foods changed during the lockdown. As a measure of healthy food choice, we chose consumption of vegetables and salad and in contrast, sweet snacks and alcohol consumption was used as a measure for unhealthy food choice. For physical activity and body weight, participants indicated whether it decreased, increased or did not change during the lockdown as compared before. In a next step, we investigated the influence of various predictors on healthrelated behaviour using multinomial logistic regression models. We find that the possibility to work remotely led to healthier food choices, that is, a reported increase in vegetable consumption and decrease in sweet snack consumption, but also to more unhealthy food choices and lifestyles, that is, a reported increase in alcohol consumption as well as an increase in sweet snack consumption. For weight change, the data indicated that individuals who worked remotely were more likely to gain or lose weight than individuals working from the office. Our findings demonstrate how individuals are affected differently by the pandemic and how complex the whole picture is. Further, these results are crucial in developing health recommendations for possible future lockdowns or health crises in general.",

All aspects of the population's daily life were affected by the policy measures to contain the pandemic and its effects on food and health systems, in particular health-related behaviour such as dietary habits and lifestyle factors (Molina-Montes et al., 2021) but also people's wellbeing and mental health (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020; Serafini et al., 2020; Usher et al., 2020) . Following the recommendations of the World Health Organisation that proposed various measures such as physical distancing to contain the spread of the virus (World Health Organization, 2020b), national and regional governments pronounced containment measures such as remote work or curfews at national or regional level. These measures can ultimately cause anxiety, depression and stress (Rajkumar, 2020) . In terms of behaviour, panic buying (e.g., Kassas & Nayga, 2021) , stockpiling (Ritzel et al., manuscript submitted) and a sharp increase in online grocery shopping were observed (Leatherby & Gelles, 2020) . People changed their individual health-related behaviour, including food and beverage consumption as well as changes in physical activity and body weight management. It is important for policy makers to draw the right conclusions from this pandemic to develop targeted measures to improve society's resilience to pandemics in the future.",

On the one hand, alcohol is often consumed as part of a social setting or \"social drinking\" in bars or restaurants (Scarmozzino & Visioli, 2020) . On the other hand, it can be seen as possible coping mechanism in stressful times. This makes it an interesting aspect to look at during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most studies reported a decrease in alcohol consumption during the pandemic (Ammar et al., 2020; Di Renzo et al., 2020; Espinoza-Ortega et al., 2021; Scarmozzino & Visioli, 2020) , which was probably due to the closing of restaurants and bars. However, the picture is more complex than that. Scarmozzino and Visioli (2020) found that while 37% reported a decrease, 10% reported an increase in alcohol consumption during the pandemic in Italy. It further seems that increases in alcohol consumption were mostly found among individuals with high levels of stress (Callinan et al., 2021) .",

However, those who did exercise before tended to increase their physical activity during the lockdown (Di Renzo et al., 2020 ). An international study reported a general decrease in physical activity (Ammar et al., 2020) , whereas data from Australia suggest that individuals changed their behaviour both to the better and the worse. Specifically, 35% of the general population reported more exercise and 43% reported less (Phillipou et al., 2020) . In terms of sociodemographic predictors, it seems that women and individuals from younger age groups exercised more during the lockdown than before (Robertson et al., 2021) .",

Besides identifying these changes, our work looks into sociodemographic and individual predictors of behaviour change. As described above, the evidence suggests that age and education are important predictors to follow up on. This enables us to identify population groups that were affected by the pandemic the most, which ultimately allows recommendations to be derived for policy measures that can help to protect these particularly vulnerable population groups from the negative effects of a pandemic.",

The present research aims to contribute to this understanding by investigating how various factors (e.g., being able to work remotely) contribute to individuals' health-related behaviour. With that, our study is among few which investigates the combined impact of environmental, sociodemographic and psychological factors on individuals' health-related behaviours during the lockdown.

Firstly, the results add to the evidence of how policy measures to contain the spread of the virus, such as remote work, have affected the health-related behaviours. Secondly, we identify how different population groups were affected differently, which can ultimately help adapt future crisis management and communication to protect groups that are most vulnerable (e.g., those with less access to healthy diets or those more prone to snacking in stressful situations). Thirdly, we provide recommendations for the development of policies that contribute to population resilience to pandemics that are directly related to food systems and health. Finally, our analyses provide insights on consumption changes on selected product categories, which can help food producers adapt their offer according to the needs of the public during a health crisis.",

The items used are \"During that period, I was worried about not having enough money to feed myself properly\", \"\u2026, I was worried about not having enough money for healthy food\", \"\u2026, I was concerned about not being able to find certain foods\", and \"\u2026, I was worried about not having enough money for healthy food\", \"\u2026, I was concerned about not being able to find certain foods for a healthy diet\".

First of all, we were interested in food categories where substantial changes were reported (e.g. >20% reported an increase/decrease in consumption). Next, we chose categories that are critical for healthy or unhealthy diets. Following nutrition reports, most Swiss individuals do not consume the recommended amount of vegetables (Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, 2019). Therefore, we consider an increase in vegetable consumption as an indicator for a change towards a more healthy diet, that is, change in vegetable consumption was used as dependent variable to investigate the predictors of healthy food choice. On the basis that more than 50% of Swiss men and women consume more than 10% of total energy intake through sugar (the World Health Organization recommends max. 10%, Chatelan et al., 2019) , sweet snack consumption was used as dependent variable to investigate the predictors of unhealthy food choice. Finally, we used alcohol consumption as dependent variable to investigate the predictors of unhealthy lifestyle choices because alcohol can have severe health effects.",

An interesting behaviour change identified in our sample is the reported increase in consumption of homemade bread. It was reasoned that the well-documented increase of homemade bread is simply the result of more leisure time (Easterbrook-Smith, 2020) or can be seen as a safety element (Bracale & Vaccaro, 2020) . Building on the second, it was argued that bread-making is symbolic in that it connotes a person's ability to produce food and support their family and loved ones. Overall, there is a tendency to cook more during the pandemic as compared before (Ammann & Casagrande, 2021) , which may also be related to individuals spending more time at home due to contact restrictions, closure of shops, or remote work.

Consequently, it appears that the possibility to work remotely served as a catalyst for individual behaviour change with a tendency towards positive changes. In line with other researchers (Grunert et al., 2021; Grunert et al., 2022) , who suggested that those affected most by the pandemic were more likely to change their behaviour, the shift from working in the office to working at home can be seen as major change in individuals' everyday lives.",

Employers and policy makers should focus on how they can help their employees or population, respectively, to follow healthy behaviour patterns including healthy food choice and physical activity when working from home and to socially exchange with their environment while limiting physical contacts. For instance, knowing that home confinement can negatively influence individuals' physical activity (Ammar et al., 2020) , companies could actively integrate physical activity or active breaks in their work routines. Health supporting measures for employees are of crucial importance as it can be expected that the proportion of employees working remotely will be higher after the pandemic than it was before. As a political measure, information campaigns could help individuals to find and follow more healthy routines, such as for instance taking specific breaks from sedentary work for people working at home.",

Income is correlated with educational degree and households with lower incomes were less likely to be able to work from home . Furthermore, it has been argued that education in general is a proxy for socioeconomic status (Pellegrini et al., 2020) . This in turn means that better educated individuals not only were less exposed to the virus but were also able to spend more money on nutritious food and more time cooking a healthy meal (e.g., for lunch). It is important to ensure that all workers do have access to a healthy and affordable meal. Possible solutions would be subsidised canteens or restaurant vouchers, which could make healthy meals more affordable and easier available for all workers independent of income.",

            "text": "Indications for inequality can also be found when looking at psychological predictors of behaviour change. For this, we investigated individuals' worries about the availability and affordability of food and find that age, BMI and education were important predictors for individuals' degree of availability worries. Given the relationship between education and income (Boshara et al., 2015) , we reason that individuals with higher education faced fewer monetary difficulties during the pandemic, which ultimately led to fewer worries about the availability and affordability of food. Individuals' worries were also a significant predictor for all tested health-related behaviours (healthy and unhealthy food choice, alcohol consumption, physical activity and weight change) investigated herein with a tendency to negative changes. It has been established that stress impacts alcohol consumption and the tendency is that stress increases drinking but the interactions are clearly more complex than that (Anthenelli & Grandison, 2012) . Similarly, increased stress can lead to more snacking (Elshurbjy & Ellulu, 2017) , which can be seen as a means to soothe the nerves. These are important findings that again highlight the need for policy measures that address specific population groups, which are identified as the most vulnerable in crises such as the current pandemic. These policy measures should focus on the most vulnerable and make sure that they have access to healthy and nutritious food during the pandemic and thereby provide support where needed most in challenging times. It is, however, important to notice that worries about the availability and affordability of food also led to positive changes. Again, we conclude that the pandemic and the worries that come with it serve as a catalyst for change, both for the better and the worse, depending on the individual. It is important to take these individual differences into account, for instance when designing information campaigns, to ensure that the campaigns appeal to the target group in the best possible way.",

Depending on an individuals' environment, the pandemic can have different effects on behaviour. In the case of farmers and consumers, it appears that they have sought each other out during the pandemic (Yousefian et al., 2021) . Our data, with city dwellers more likely to decrease vegetable and salad consumption, suggests that it might be harder for city dwellers to buy fresh food from local farmers than for individuals living in the countryside. Policy efforts such as information campaigns and food distribution schemes can help increase the availability of fresh produce in cities and to overcome the \"last mile\" problem, which means that transporting food into the cities is very expensive, and thereby contribute to more resilience in the food supply chain.",

Another aspect to mention is that our study focuses on behaviour, perceptions and behaviour change but we did not ask participants for their motives. Future studies should therefore aim to put these findings into context by considering individuals' motives and psychological traits. Furthermore, it would be interesting to compare our findings from the first wave to results that were collected at later stages of the pandemic. Our results contribute to the understanding of the complex interaction various factors. However, they also lead to the conclusion that it is not trivial to conclude whether the pandemic or its consequences such as remote work overall led to more healthy or unhealthy behavioural changes. Clearly, further research is needed to identify different consumer clusters and how the pandemic impacted them.",

With that, this study is one of few which investigate the combined impact of environmental, sociodemographic and psychological factors on individuals' health-related behaviour during the lockdown and look at multiple health-related behaviours. This is an important contribution as the inclusion of various aspects allows for a more complete picture of individuals' health-related behaviours during the lockdown. We find that the interactions are complex with changes in individuals' health-related behaviour being both to the better and the worse, depending on the individuals, their circumstances and sociodemographic profiles. For policy measures, this means that they should be specifically tailored to population groups in order to have the best possible impact. We find tendencies for positive behaviour changes for remote workers and tendencies towards negative behaviour changes for individuals who worried more. This implies that the possibility to work remotely should be encouraged. Further, we find that individuals with lower education levels and higher BMI values are affected more severely by the pandemic and the measures taken to contain the spread of the virus. When designing policy measures, care should be taken to protect these population groups. Overall, our findings are important for employers and policy makers alike to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and help protect the most vulnerable in our society.",
