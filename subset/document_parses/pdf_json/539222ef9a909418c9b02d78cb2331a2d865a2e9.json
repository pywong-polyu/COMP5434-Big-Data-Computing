However, the molecular mechanism of action of IVM on A. simplex s.s. remains unknown. Herein, tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and extensive liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis were used to identify the effect of IVM on the proteome of A. simplex s.s. in vitro. During the study, 3433 proteins, of which 1247 had at least two protein unique peptides, were identified. Comparative proteomics analysis revealed that 59 proteins were differentially regulated (DRPs) in IVM-treated larvae, of which 14 proteins were upregulated and 38 were downregulated after 12 h of culture, but after 24 h, 12 proteins were upregulated and 22 were downregulated. The transcription level of five randomly selected DRPs was determined by real-time PCR as a supplement to the proteomic data. The functional enrichment analysis showed that most of the DRPs were involved in oxidoreductase activity, immunogenicity, protein degradation, and other biological processes. This study has, for the first time, provided comprehensive proteomics data on A. simplex s.s. response to IVM and might deliver new insight into the molecular mechanism by which IVM acts on invasive larvae of A. simplex s.s.",

Intermediate and/or paratenic hosts of the larvae are crustaceans, cephalopods, and fish [1] . Humans are an accidental host of this parasitic nematode. Infection occurs upon consumption of raw or undercooked marine fish and crustaceans contaminated with the third-stage larvae of A. simplex [2] . Infected dishes of raw fish, such as sushi and sashimi, as well as the consumption of marinated or raw fish in European countries such as Italy and Spain, are significant sources of the infection [3] . Greater awareness of Anisakis infection has resulted in an increase in the frequency of reported anisakiasis cases in many more countries, besides the expected ones (Italy, Spain, Japan), e.g., in Poland the first case of this disease was described in 2020 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

IVM is the most studied member of this family and has been considered one of the most successful discoveries in the fight against infections caused by parasitic roundworms. IVM is highly hydrophobic and deeply inserts itself into the subunit interfaces of transmembrane domains of Cys-loop receptor family members [14] . Ivermectin's primary targets are glutamate-gated chloride channels, although it is also active against other invertebrate neurotransmitter receptors, including GABA, histamine-gated chloride channels, pH-gated chloride channels [15] [16] [17] , glycine receptors, and \u03b17-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) [18, 19] . A deciding factor in the combined lethality in nematodes and safety in mammalian hosts is the differential potency with which ivermectin activates these receptors. For example, a glutamate-gated chloride channel receptor is typically activated by low nanomolar (<20 nM) concentrations [20, 21] , whereas GABA A R and the glycine receptor chloride channel require concentrations in the low micromolar (1-10 \u00b5M) range [18] . At several other receptors, ivermectin activates no response but modulates the responses to the neurotransmitter agonist. These include some invertebrate GABA A R and the human \u03b1-7 nAChR [14] .",

Immunomodulatory agents often display fewer side effects than drugs, as well as producing less opportunity for the creation of resistance in target microorganisms, which helps explain the absence of drug resistance in humans [25] .

            "text": "One approach that is being used to characterize the proteins expressed by the parasites (proteome) is quantitative proteomics. Significant progress has been made in overcoming the technical hurdles faced when characterizing the parasite proteins. The challenges are now to use this information to investigate the parasite attributes such as virulence, antigenicity, and drug resistance and to translate the findings from these studies to produce human and animal health benefits. Proteomic studies not only give insight into the description of particular pathology but have the potential to precisely identify drug targets, which is necessary because strains resistant to anthelmintic drugs have already been described [28] [29] [30] . As already mentioned, the main control strategy for both human and animal parasitic nematodes is antiparasitic drugs [31] . Nonetheless, reliance on a limited number of anthelmintic drugs to control humans' helminthiases is not ideal, and additional complementary drugs and control strategies are required. In addition, there is a need for a detailed understanding of the mode of action of the drugs currently available in order to maximize their effective lifetime. Proteomic studies have begun to describe the action of these drugs as well as to identify potential new drug targets [32] . The availability of multiple parasite genomes for comparative analysis and the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies to classical genetic and proteomic approaches may provide answers to these questions soon. Comparative proteomics studies have increased our understanding of the action of proteins taking part in drug metabolism. Proteome studies of A. simplex s.s. L3 and L4 larvae carried out previously showed the possibility of using high-throughput techniques for targeted analyses [33] .",

Volcano plot representations of DRPs are shown in Figure 2B -D. In all the presented volcano plots, the most upregulated proteins were towards the right, the most downregulated proteins were towards the left, and out of them the most statistically significant proteins were towards the top. Presented volcano plots suggested more differences between the control and IVM treatment for 12 and 24 h ( Figure 2B ,C) and less evident differences between 24 and 12 h of IVM treatment ( Figure 2D ). After 12 and 24 h of IVM treatment of A. simplex s.s., we can assume that the response of the parasite to the drug was similar and the differences concerned only the number of proteins. Comparative proteomics analysis indicated that 59 proteins were differentially regulated (DRPs) in IVM-treated larvae, of which 14 were upregulated and 38 were downregulated after 12 h of in vitro culture, whereas 12 proteins were significantly upregulated and 22 were significantly downregulated after 24 h of IVM treatment (FC = 1.5; p-value \u2264 0.05) ( Figure 2B-D; File S2) . In this cohort, examples of the downregulated proteins, comparing 12 and 24 h of culture to the control, were aminopeptidase (A0A0M3J667), carboxypeptidase (A0A0M3K8V4), serine proteases (A0A0M3J5K2, A0A0M3IYC1, A0A0M3J9R7), metalloendopeptidase (A0A0M3KF57), cuticle collagen dpy-5 (A0A0M3KAW0), and cuticulin-1 (A0A0M3K3M2) (Figure 2B-D; File S2 ).

Additionally, Fasciola hepatica's susceptibility to the anthelminthic drug triclabendazole, characterized by lethal activity, was indicated by the presence of actin, also one of the motor proteins. Moreover, the interaction of filamentous actin with myosin forms the basis of muscle contraction, which, when disrupted or taken over by antiparasitic drugs, might be the cause of parasite death [45, 46] . According to the literature data mentioned previously, anthelmintics influence the motor proteins and thus reduce parasite motility, causing death; however, in our case, IVM did not affect the motility and survival of A. simplex s.s., even though the protein level of myosin was modulated. We believe that this may be due to the parasite's defense mechanisms in the early hours of the antiparasitic treatment.",

Moreover, in transcriptomic studies, up to 40% of transcripts identified in the pharynx of A. simplex s.s., compared to transcripts present in the pharynx of Hysterothylacium aduncum, a nonpathogenic nematode, were upregulated; most of them are from protein families linked to enzymatic activity of peptidases, like zinc metalloproteinase nas-13, and others such as lipases and serine/threonine-protein kinases [47] . In addition, carboxypeptidase is necessary for new cuticle generation and body morphogenesis in free-living and parasitic nematodes; it is located at the hypodermis and interacts with other collagen-modifying enzymes [48] . We found that some collagen proteins (A0A0M3JZ29, A0A0M3K3M2, A0A0M3KAW0) were downregulated after 12 h of culture with IVM, and some cuticle collagen proteins like collagen cuticle N domain-containing protein (A0A0M3J3V0) were expressed only after 24 h of the IVM treatment. Our study showed that cuticlin abundance was reduced after 24 h of IVM treatment compared to 12 h. However, after 12 or 24 h of treatment, compared to the control, the protein abundance of cuticlin was decreased ( Figure 3B ). In addition, our study showed that collagen's abundance was decreased compared to the control. This may be due to the parasite's first line of defense, which is the cuticle. The drug diffusion is probably related to the morphological/functional properties of the parasite's external surfaces. The direct effect of IVM on cuticle proteins was not described previously, but our results may be the first evidence of the effect of antiparasitic drugs on the parasite cuticle.",

Additionally, Kunitz inhibitor protease, trypsin inhibitor-like protein (TIL), and ShKT domain-containing protein could play important roles in the immunomodulation of host antiparasitic immunological responses. The Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor (Ani s1) has an antigenic role among excretory-secretory products [55, 56] . The ShKT domain, which has also been called a nematode six-cysteine (NC6) domain [57] and ion channel regulator (ICR) [58] in venomous creatures, has likely been modified to give rise to potent ion channel blockers. The incorporation of this domain by roundworms into prolyl hydroxylases, astacin-like metalloproteases, and trypsin-like serine proteases could produce enzymes with potential channel-modulatory activity, which would be important in pathogenicity in the case of parasitic nematodes [59] .",

To summarize, the present study shows the list of proteins of the L3 larval stage of A. simplex s.s. modulated by IVM. Interestingly, xenobiotic-metabolizing proteins were not identified as significantly modulated when comparing IVM-treated vs. control samples. Our results are the first to give extensive proteomic information on the response of A. simplex s.s. to IVM. A total of 59 differentially regulated A. simplex s.s. proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. Some of the proteins are primarily involved in cuticle synthesis, maintenance, remodeling, and degradation, as well as in hormonal regulation of molting and intracellular trafficking of molecular compounds and regulators. IVM does not have an impact on A. simplex s.s. motility and survival but, in our estimation, suppresses the parasite's ability to evade the host's natural immune defense mechanisms, which was confirmed by the list of differentially regulated proteins.",
