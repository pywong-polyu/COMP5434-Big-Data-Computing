            "text": "Effective clinician-patient communication is particularly important in ophthalmology where long-term adherence to treatment is often required. However, in the context of increasingly pressurised clinics, there is a tendency to resort to written information leaflets not suited to patients with visual impairment, non-English speakers or those with low levels of literacy. Video-based media could be harnessed to enhance clinician-patient communication. This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy of using video-based media for patient education in ophthalmology. A pre-defined search strategy was used by two independent researchers to systematically review the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases. Eligible articles included peer-reviewed studies involving ophthalmology patients, who received a solely video-based educational intervention to assess for improvement in patient knowledge, behaviour and overall health-related outcomes. The search yielded 481 studies of which 31 passed initial screening. Following full-text analysis, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which seven studies (58.3%) were randomised controlled trials. The majority of studies (58.3%) reported outcomes on patient comprehension with 5/7 (71%) showing statistically significant improvement after video intervention. Four studies (33.3%) reported on patient performance in a task (e.g. drop application method) or overall health-related outcome with 2/4 (50%) showing statistically significant improvement after intervention. Though more evidence is needed, the use of videobased media appears to be effective in improving patient understanding and in certain cases may ameliorate overall outcome. There is a paucity of well-designed studies and future research is required to fully examine the role of video-based media in patient education. * Reem Farwana r.farwana@nhs.net 1 Ashford and St Peter's Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,",

Clinicians therefore have a unique opportunity to ameliorate ophthalmic health simply by effective education of their patients. Furthermore, clear and effective education has been found to be imperative in reducing preoperative anxiety in patients about to undergo surgical procedures [4] . However, this can be a challenge in the context of increasingly overburdened outpatient clinics, with the nine million appointments currently made in ophthalmology each year set to continue to rise [5] . Clinicians currently rely heavily on verbal information, of which as much as 40-80% is forgotten by patients after a traditional consultation; moreover, almost 50% of the information patients do recall is incorrect [6, 7] . Written patient education media are a helpful adjunct; however, these are not ideal for those who are sight impaired, non-English speakers or those with low levels of literacy.",

There has been some work to suggest that video-based media can also be harnessed as an effective method of patient education [9] . This has potentially numerous advantages when compared with existing forms of education. In particular, short videos using visual representation and audio components could overcome hurdles related to limited literacy and hearing impairment, respectively. More recently, we have reported on the potential of 'video blogging' or 'vlogging' as a possible patient education tool; the use of popular social media figures to convey information in the form of a video blog could help to draw a wider audience and help to raise greater awareness of ophthalmic conditions in patients and the wider population [10] .",

The studies presented, though small in number, did assess these areas but with mixed results. Rosenthal et al.'s [18] intervention involved a 6-min videotape on primary open-angle glaucoma showed improved patient knowledge on the condition which was sustained even 6 months after the intervention (p < 0.01) [18] . Similarly, Mednick et al. [19] demonstrated better patient understanding of fundus fluorescein angiography with their narrated white board animation (p < 0.05).",

Firstly, the impact of videobased patient education in the ophthalmic population is difficult to assess due to the limited literature and validated tools. Outcome measures used across the studies included change in a knowledge score [22] , or simple pre-and posttest questionnaires [18, 20] . It can be difficult to measure outcomes objectively even with questionnaires due to the limitations they pose. Although they are commonly used and demonstrate good results, they also hold several biases, with researcher, recall and social desirability bias all playing a role in the outcome [23] . One way in which to overcome this is by agreeing on validated questionnaire tools with a core outcome set that is universal. This will allow comparisons to be drawn between studies and improvements to then be made over time.",

For a more representative and externally valid data set, future work will need to focus on expanding to larger multicentre randomised control trials with a wide demographic base. Wide demographic bases will also help to identify specific patient groups which can be targeted for more specialised educational intervention. This is important as patient characteristics may be just as important as the video intervention in determining outcome behaviour [24] . Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has been using patient education videos in their waiting rooms, as outlined in the Annual Reports and Accounts 2018/19 (Annual Report 2019) [25] . However, in this digital age there could be benefit of moving towards posting videos on trust websites or on YouTube and monitor their usage by patients. Furthermore, there needs to be sustainable change moving forward, which would require regular updated content by ophthalmologists. Specialists in the field would best be able to judge patient education videos to maintain accuracy and quality of content. This would of course demand more cost, however can be implemented over the coming years [26] .",

There appears to be potential, in particular in areas around patient understanding, satisfaction and drop technique; however, these are likely to be best suited as an adjunct and not as a replacement for the clinician. Face-to-face consultations are invaluable, however due to time constraints in the NHS, it is not always possible to satisfy every patient. Videos could therefore help to bridge that gap.",

Access for patients to these interventions will also require some thought; in particular those who are elderly or from low-income households, where electronic devices and internet access may not always be readily available. Finally, any change must be sustainable. Pilot studies trialling video-based media as an educational tool should start as early as possible, so that results can guide regular developments and updates as the field of medical innovation and technology grows and lessens the time and cost needed to generate video content. Whilst this systematic review has found limited available evidence, video-based media has shown some promise as an educational tool in ophthalmology and offers an exciting and innovative way in which patients can feel more empowered and involved in their care in a digital age.",
