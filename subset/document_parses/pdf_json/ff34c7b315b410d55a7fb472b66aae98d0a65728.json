This can sometimes cause redundancy in the patients' diagnostic workup. Ultimately, their proposed treatment may not be optimized for their particular disease process. [3, 4] . This lack of consensus for diagnostic evaluation and treatment between specialists due to siloed care negatively impacts patient satisfaction, quality of life and drives up healthcare costs [3] . The increasingly-recognized importance of multidisciplinary collaboration when diagnosing and treating complex diseases has led to advances in the organization and delivery of healthcare [4] . Multidisciplinary clinics (MDC) have proven to be beneficial in overall patient satisfaction and outcomes in a variety of settings. For example, MDCs have shown reduced mortality rates in cancer patients and improved quality of life and control levels among asthmatic patients with a reduced number of exacerbations [5, 6] . Several clinics in the USA have created Complex Airway MDCs. These centers have multiple subspecialists in their staff including Rhinologists and Allergist/Immunologists that facilitate holistic care for complex airway patients through a single, coordinated team [7, 8] .",

However, Rhinologists often lack the specialized training required to provide certain therapeutic interventions such as aspirin desensitization therapy, immunomodulatory therapy or asthma management. Therefore, these patients are often neglected from such therapies, or are not referred to the appropriate Respirologist/Allergist in a timely manner due to the need for referral to a specialist at a separate clinic. These limitations place a cap on the ability of clinicians to optimize the care provided to complex airway patients in Canada. The purpose of our study is to identify the current state of treatment of complex airway patients in Canada, as well as understand the barriers and challenges to establishing complex airway MDCs in Canada.

For example, CRS with polyps has a Type II inflammatory pattern characterized by eosinophilia and elevated IL-4, 5 and 13 cytokines [9] . Lower respiratory tract manifestations are characterized by a similar systemic inflammatory response [10] . Approximately 60% of patients with CRS with polyps have lower airway disease including co-existing asthma [9] . Treatment of the upper airway can modify the severity of lower airway disease and vice versa, and early treatment may also help prevent further progression of the patient's airway disease [10] . However, to achieve this, sub-specialists are required to collaborate in the diagnosis and management of these complex airway diseases to provide appropriate specialized treatments. Establishing a MDC will facilitate this interaction, allow patients to receive proper diagnostic workup and tailored treatments from the relevant sub-specialists on the team. While it is true that multidisciplinary meetings such as case conferences provide avenues for similar collaborative care, we believe that gathering providers in a physical MDC space provides value both for patients, who can attend one appointment instead of many, and for providers, who can share diagnostic findings such as endoscopic examinations in real time.",

In our current system, sub-specialists operate independently and practice through a blend of personal experience and evidence-based medicine. Challenging this status quo and asking practitioners to forego some degree of independence to optimize patient care through evidence-based medicine may initially be difficult. There is a similar barrier with regards to the preferred location of the MDC. Finally, to maintain both research and clinical pillars, the MDC would require a steady stream of funding. Any loss in income flow because of lower patient volumes in a MDC may disincentivize clinicians from participating, as well as restrict research resource availability.",

            "text": "To address these barriers, we have identified a roadmap to the development of a Complex Airway MDC in Canada. First, is the creation of a team of subspeciality leaders from Rhinology, Respirology and Allergy. Each specialty must identify a lead individual to represent their interests in putting the MDC together. This is particularly important in larger centres where they may have multiple (Figs. 1 and 2) . Moreover, for the MDC to be successful, the leads of the MDC must define the resources required and what resources are already available. Rather than requesting resources from the health authority/hospital, re-allocation of already available resources was more economical. Common resources used by Respirologists are asthma educators/technicians who provide education, pulmonary function testing, and allergy testing. Re-allocation of this role into the MDC provides a lot of value to the patients (Fig. 3) . Another important resource is the clinical coordinator to coordinate the administrative steps between initial referral, timing specialist assessment in clinic and education. A sample patient clinic schedule has been provided to outline the logistical coordination involved (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, individual administrative assistants and coordinators at other MDCs in the hospital could also be reallocated for assistant in clinic logistics. Another possibility is the combination of a clinical/ research coordinator role, as the nature of the MDC lends itself well to providing opportunities for research. At UBC, the MDC is viewed as a research clinic and reallocation of research funds between the three specialties to pay for a research coordinator has been a successful strategy. This helps to manage the clinic and optimize research productivity, which is an effective strategy to circumvent the lack of funding from the health authority and/or hospital to financially support the clinic. Furthermore, with a focus on the research pillar of the clinic, the complex airway MDC also acts as a center for excellence for the development of predictive medicine, markers, and cutting-edge evidence-based treatment strategies.",

However, at UBC, we have found that the biggest issue is the capital required to support rhinology equipment, which includes endoscopes, video towers and the support staff required to clean the scopes. Given that the infrastructure is already in place in Rhinology clinics, the MDC was brought to the Rhinology clinic at our institution. In this setup, portable pulmonary function testing and allergy kits were easier to implement into the Rhinology clinic than creating more expensive alternative arrangements. In addition, given the rapid advancement and adoption of telemedicine technology during the COVID-19 pandemic, adding teleconsult and videoconferencing capabilities to MDCs could allow for more versatile inclusion of asthma educators and consulting providers who do not need to conduct any additional in-person diagnostic testing. This could help the establishment of MDCs in community and more rural areas outside of tertiary care academic centers as long as the necessary rhinology, pulmonary, and allergy equipment are available when needed.",

However, our results and thematic analysis are consistent with existing literature highlighting the barriers to effectively providing multidisciplinary care in the setting of complex diseases (11, 12) .
