These cross-sectional measurements aim to understand the general psychological reactions to this public emergency event for both community and medical staff involved in epidemic conditions (Joob & Wiwanitkit 2020 , Li et al 2020 . After few weeks, some subjects are asked to finish the inventories for follow-up measurements to obtain longitudinal trajectory of mental state in the population.
