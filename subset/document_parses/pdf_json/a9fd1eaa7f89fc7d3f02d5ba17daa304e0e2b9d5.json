It should also be noted that several business models will be needed to optimize their efficiency and overlap as the system evolves over its lifetime. The business model of the circular economy is based on the principle of \"value creation\" of the conventional economy. In this study, we interviewed 67 managers from the steel industry in Thailand. Statistically, 71.2% of respondents felt that steel consumers would be able to pay a higher price for clean goods. Also, 87% believe that governments must contribute to the development of the circular economy. They said that their group also organizes training activities for educating the workforce. Moreover, 80.1% indicated that their organization must inform management and workers of the value of the circular economy. Accordingly, 64.7% of respondents stated that there is no government funding for scrap metal recycling. Overall, 36.3% of people felt there was a shortage of scrap metal work.",

[1] assumed that 28% of the material savings would be achieved by the use of steel and aluminum additives in the manufacture of transport components, precision instruments, and machinery and electrical equipment. In the absence of information on the potential penetration of competition, one believes that the whole production would benefit from the multiplication of the industrial revolution via using mechanical engineering [2] . On the other hand, the socio-economic indicators have slightly decreased while actions to minimize losses in yields often suggest some environmental benefits [3] . This method was based on the assumption that a combined 35% of the production of steel and aluminum from semimanufactured goods was transferred to other uses [4] . Although the socio-economic indicators are also declining, the expert's analysis shows that this is mainly due to changes in the way we travel-i.e., increased occupancy, utilization, and delivery of machinery across industries [5] . Finally, due to the low availability of scrap, we see a moderate reduction in environmental factors in the implementation of scrap disposal. For example, while steel and aluminum waste can be reversed by 90% in the construction sector [6] , scrap available for this use is only 7%, for example, in the manufacturing sector [6] . This leads us to believe that, although this intervention may be good practice and beneficial to manufacturing companies, its benefits may be limited on a global scale [1] .",

In the case of the steel mill with melting facilities in Thailand, there are fewer domestic upstream steelworks, a steel manufacturer's industrial plants due to a combination of concerns about potential environmental and health impacts in nearby communities, as well as high investment costs, which make it even more difficult to break down [10] . However, most Thai manufacturers usually produce long-term products made from their own steel production from scrap metal to rolled products (Melt Shop), and also alloys are used as inputs. This helps to reduce the cost of raw materials, which is 47.1% of all costs to those furnace-equipped manufacturers. Instead, those without a furnace need to buy their raw material [11] and this results in significantly higher raw material costs (Table 1) . Source: Mahattanalai [12] Production costs increased in 2018 (66% share of total production costs) and the prices of scrap metal and imported raw material inputs increased. Most Thai steel mills use scrap metal as their main source of steel (Table 2) .",

At the end of the day, rebar prices and billet prices are likely to rise if scrap prices rise. China's excess production would struggle to find a global home, because many countries, such as Vietnam, do not allow rebar imports [14] . China imported iron ore from a wide range of sources in Q2 and Q3 in 2020 as if it helped to restrict supplies-or to retaliate for political discourse with Australia [15] . Increasing imports of scrap could ease the demand for iron ore. Analysts expect iron ore prices to remain high for the rest of the years 2020 and 2021 [16] .",

There is nothing in place to regulate the generation of steel shredding processes and to handle the entire waste stream of steel shredding. Pre-consumer steel shredding products are not the responsibility of producers and importers. As a result, scrap steel shredding is often thrown away and mixed with household waste and is finally disposed of [17, 18] . Approximately 57% of local waste collection and disposal organizations have spent only 7.88 million tons, i.e., air pollution control incinerators or built waste disposal facilities, or 53% of the total amount of waste collected [19] . A total of 466 waste sites operated by the public and private sectors have been transferred to waste disposal sites. On the other hand, approximately 47% of the total waste collected, or 6.93 million tons, has been disposed of by open dumping. For the remaining 43% of local authorities that do not provide waste services, 6.53 million tons of waste have been disposed of annually, or 13.5 million tons of waste illegally disposed of each year [20] .

The circular economy is becoming a new vision for resource management, energy, value creation, and entrepreneurship. It is also explained that several business models may be needed to maximize their usefulness and overlap at different stages of the product or asset life cycle. Linder & Williander [25] defines a circular business model as the \"business model in which the conceptual principle of value creation is based on the use of economical values retained in products following use in new products' production.\" Mentink [26] describes the CE as \"an economic system with shut down material loops\" and the CE \"as a justification for creating, providing, and capturing value within and with a shutdown material loop.\"",

Sixty-two percent of the interviewees have strongly indicated that their quality and efficiency of delivery bring back lean production. Seventy percent of the companies received ISO certification for the system. Half of the respondents find it difficult to sort scrap metal for recycling. Thirty-three percent believe that their company's financial capacity to manage scrap is sufficient. 22% believe that their company's financial ability to manage scrap is not sufficient. 94% are willing to develop some cost-reduction strategies. 94% believe that a circular economy is a worthwhile practice. 86.8% care that they are very concerned about the environment. They have long-term environmental concerns in 88.2% of cases. 95.6% of the interviewees believe that the circular economy provides the steel industry with business opportunities. 92.6% believe that the circular economy gives their company the opportunity to participate in facilitating the production of recycled steel products. 87% said that their environmental success was appreciated by the media (awards and public relations). 79.4% of the total stated that they wanted the government to obtain an award for successful environmental results.",
