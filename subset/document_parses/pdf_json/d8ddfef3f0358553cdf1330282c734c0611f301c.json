[17] [18] [19] Our study is consistent with these prior findings, but demonstrates that such differences exist even when all participants work not just in the same field, but for the same organization. Such a finding may indicate that community and non-work related environmental factors are likely playing a significant role in the spread of Covid-19 among certain minority populations. Even after controlling for a medical diagnosis of Covid-19, African American race and Hispanic ethnicity remained risk factors for antibody positivity. The persistence of thse racial and ethnic disparities may represent structural barriers to care or societally mediated risk. Geographic clustering by race and ethnicity in housing, shopping and social gatherings may be one such factor, while socioeconomic status and ability to self-isolate outside of work likely also contribute. [20] [21] [22] No self-reported pre-existing medical conditions were significantly associated with antibody positivity, indicating that infection itself is agnostic to baseline health. In fact, asthma was negatively associated with the presence of antibodies, or at least antibody levels above the current threshold we use for positivity. While reactive airway disease is unlikely a protective factor against Covid-19, participants with such conditions may be more likely to deligently follow social distancing guidelines and practice better adherence to hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment. Hypertension was the only medical condition associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.

[23] [24] [25] Interestingly, neither dyspnea nor diarrhea, two commonly cited symptoms, demonstrated a significant association in multivariable analysis. 26, 27 This is likely related to the non-specific nature of these symptoms, which are common to multiple viral and non-viral etiologies. Importantly, dyspnea was associated with a higher antibody level among those with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, suggesting that dyspnea related to Covid-19 may drive a more robust humoral immune response, potentially related to more severe infection. These findings are concordant with the known phenomenon of proportionate adaptive immune response to higher doses of antigenic stress. 28 The extent to which the generation of measurably higher antibody levels could confer immunity to a larger degree or for a longer duration of time remains unknown. Interestingly, prior studies have demonstrated lower antibody levels among exposed, asymptomatic individuals, a phenomena which may be attributable to a highly efficient cell mediated immune response. 29 It has be suggested that higher T-cell levels, whether virus specific or otherwise, may play a role in this finding, however, further research is required. 30, 31 Further expanding from prior studies, we investigated and observed several factors that appeared notably unassociated with seroprevalence. In particular, we found that recent travel, type of home, and number of people living in the home were not associated with an antibodybased measure of SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
