The dependent variable was return on equity as a proxy for financial performance. The independent variables were the debt to equity, total debt to total assets, asset turnover ratios, sales growth, taxation, and export growth, while the firm size was taken as a control variable. The panel regression estimation technique was employed for analysis purposes, and both cross-sectional and timeseries data were collected for this study. This study used the random-effect regression estimation model based on the Hausman diagnostic test statistics. The results indicate that the capital structure debt to equity variable has a negative and significant relationship with financial performance while the asset turnover ratio and firm performance showed a negative and statistically insignificant relationship. Export growth and sales growth have a considerable positive connection with financial performance; however, firm size has a negative and significant impact on firm performance, in favour of our alternative research hypothesis. The remaining variables include tax payable and the total debt to total assets ratio, which have an insignificant connection with financial performance (ROE) and validate the agency theory.

Therefore, the financial manager's irrational financing decisions could affect the business's stability and survival. Pinto et al.

The textile sector of Pakistan is one of the largest sectors and contributes 67% of exports, 10.2% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and 46% of the total manufacturing, and it employs 40% of the labour force. Hence, it is the best growing industry in Pakistan, which makes exploring this industry essential. Regarding quantity, the Pakistani textile sector exports achieved a positive trend of 13.08% in terms of value at the end of FY-2018 while it was 12.83% in FY-2017 (Safeer et al., 2019) .

Safeer et al.'s (2019) study only focused on the challenges facing the textile sector and the potential solutions for improving export competitiveness. Ahmed and Siddiqui (2019) studied the impact of debt financing on performance and variables, including political uncertainty, capital expenditure (debt to total assets), and financial performance through the ROA from 2010 to 2015. The relationship of firms' financing choice based on the capital structure, export growth, taxation, and financial performance (ROE) is a new variable in this particular study based on the textile sector. In the last decade, many textile firms have closed in Pakistan as a result of financial issues. However, in the past year, Pakistan's textile industry has attracted increased attention. It is imperative to study the capital structure as debt has become a burden during the crisis. In this situation, the inclusion of taxation and export variables in the traditional role of the capital structure in financial performance makes this a novel study.

A proper capital structure is an essential part of the decision making for any business. The common contention was provided by Modigliani and Miller (1958) initially by expressing that an ideal structure of capital aims to adjust the bankruptcy risk with the obligation of saving tax.

The other segments are incorporated into the capital structure, such as preference shares, common stockholder equity, profitability, leverage, gearing, return on investment, and return on assets (Abor, 2007; Hull and Dawar, 2014) .

The relationship between capital structure and firm performance was investigated by Salim and Yadav (2012), and their findings describe a negative relationship between firm performance and leverage. An examination in India by Goyal (2013) uncovered a positive relationship between a transient obligation and its benefit, while on the contrary it found a connection between gainfulness and long-haul necessity. Seyed and Pejman (2013) reported on the capital structure link with firm performance on the Tehran Stock Exchange and established a positive relationship between the two. Pinto et al. (2017) expressed the relationship between capital structure and firm performance from 2011 to 2015 in India by using regression analysis. The measurement variables were the debt to total assets and debt to equity leverage ratios and the return on capital employed (ROCE). They found a significant relationship between capital structure and firm performance. Sheikh and Wang (2010) examined the financing behaviour of textile companies in Pakistan. The regression model was used to analyse the data of 75 textile companies listed from 2002 to 2007, and the results indicate a negative impact of debt on profitability in the capital structure. A primary survey conducted in the building division of Pakistan reported that the ROE is adversely influenced by the obligations at all levels (Khan, 2012) . Mirza and Javed (2013) examined the determinants of money-related outcomes in Pakistan. The examination of the settled impacts was connected to the information on 60 organizations from 2007 to 2011, and the outcomes demonstrated that the execution of the organization (RE) is decidedly influenced by the debt to equity ratio and contrarily influenced by the short term debt to total assets (STDTA) divided by long term debt to total assets (LTDTA). Hijazi and Tariq (2006) described the capital structure determinants of Pakistan's real business. The result demonstrates that the benefit and the measure of the board have a negative link with leverage, while there is a noteworthy association with incarnations, development, and exploitations. The overview by Amara and Aziz (2014) expressed concerns about the spread of the converse relationship with the return on equity by the level of obligation of the capital structure in the sustenance segment of Pakistan. The volume of debt in the capital structure of organizations has a reverse association with their performance (Hasan et al., 2014) . In the Pakistani textile sector, Ullah et al. (2017) found a positive relationship between the ratio of debt to equity (DE) and the ROE at the 10% confidence interval while the asset turnover ratio is inversely associated with the ROE. Moreover, there is a negative relationship between firm size and ROE. Rahman et al. (2019) explored the effect of the capital structure on the profitability of publicly traded manufacturing firms in Bangladesh. They took a sample of 50 observations of 10 selected manufacturing companies listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange from 2013 to 2017. The fixed-effect regression technique was applied to the data to determine the correlation between the independent variables (debt ratio, equity ratio, and debt to equity ratio) and the dependent variable (the ROE). The results showed that the debt ratio and equity ratio have a significant positive effect. The equity ratio has a significant positive relationship with the ROE, but the debt to equity ratio has a significant negative impact on the ROE. Chang et al. (2019) conducted a study to identify the impact of the capital structure on profitability. This study was conducted on four Asian economies, and the researchers applied correlation and regression analysis to the data from 2013 to 2016. The study found that leverage and profitability have a significant negative relationship, whereas there are significant positive relationships between growth and leverage in Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Further, the study identified a significantly positive relationship between size and leverage in each country. Nguyen and Nguyen (2020) examined the relationship between the capital structure and the profitability of non-financial companies listed on the Vietnam Stock Exchange. Panel data on 488 listed companies were employed, and the data were taken from 2013 to 2018. The capital structure was represented by the ratios of short-and long-term liabilities, total liabilities to total assets, and profitability measured by the ROE. The generalized least square technique was applied, and the results suggest that the capital structure of Vietnamese listed non-financial companies is negatively related to their performance. Moreover, Vu et al. (2020) examined the impact of the capital structure on the performance of construction companies listed on the Vietnam Stock Exchange. The sample consisted of 59 listed companies, and data were taken from 3 years (177 observations). A linear regression model and correlation analysis were applied, and the results show that debt/equity has a robust positive effect on the ROE. The factor of total fixed assets to total assets yielded a positive and significant effect on the ROE. Putri and Rahyuda (2020) examined the impact of the capital structure on the debt to equity ratio proxy, sales growth with sales growth proxy, and profitability. The sample consisted of annual reports of 51 industrial consumer goods companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, and the data set was from 2013 to 2018. The results show that the debt to equity ratio proxy has a significant negative impact on profitability. Sales growth has a significant positive impact on profitability. Chen et al. (2006) investigated the effect of tax rebates and export performance in China for the period of 1985-2002 and concluded that, when the rate of an export rebate is raised by the government, it leads to a decrease in the output and profitability of foreign competitors and an increase in the output of finished goods and profitability of domestic firms. A comparison study of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh was conducted by Ahmad (2015) on the value of export incentives for 2001-2011. The comparative analysis findings indicate that, due to having the highest export incentives, Bangladesh's textile sector is more export oriented than those of India and Pakistan. Chung et al.
