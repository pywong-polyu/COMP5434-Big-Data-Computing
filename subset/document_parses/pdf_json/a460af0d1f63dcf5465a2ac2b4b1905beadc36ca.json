            "text": "Several regulated health insurance markets include the option for consumers to choose a voluntary deductible. An important motive for this option is to reduce moral hazard. In return for a voluntary deductible, consumers receive a premium rebate, which is typically community rated. Under community rating, voluntary deductibles are particularly attractive for low-risk consumers. Since these people use relatively little medical care, the total moral hazard reduction might be relatively small compared to the total healthcare spending. This paper examines the potential moral hazard reduction under risk-rated premiums. We use Chile as a case study due to institutional features that make it a valid benchmark for other countries. Our simulations show that in the presence of self-selection and under a uniform percentage moral hazard reduction across risk types, the absolute moral hazard reduction from a voluntary deductible is indeed expected to be larger in a system with risk-rated premiums than in a system with community-rated premiums. Nevertheless, sensitivity checks show that this conclusion might no longer hold as the percentage moral hazard reduction is lower for high-risk individuals compared to low-risk individuals.",

A primary motivation for this cost-sharing option is to mitigate moral hazard (MH) (Cutler and Zeckhauser 2000) . Examples include the mandatory health insurance schemes in the Netherlands and Switzerland, and the marketplaces in the U.S. . In the Netherlands, premiums (and premium rebates) are community rated per health plan, meaning that all consumers with the same plan pay the same premium. In Switzerland, premiums can be differentiated according to age (to a limited extent) and canton. In the U.S. marketplaces, premiums can be differentiated according to age, tobacco use and geography, and so can the premium rebates for voluntary deductibles. In this paper we show how the premium structure in a health insurance market can influence the MH reduction (MHR) from voluntary deductibles.",

Under risk-rated premiums, on the other hand, voluntary deductibles are particularly attractive for applicants with relatively low expected spending within their premium-risk group. Thus, compared to community-rated premiums, risk-rated premiums are likely to increase take-up of voluntary deductibles among people with moderate or higher risk. Given the differences in expected spending between high and low-risk individuals, this outcome is particularly relevant from a policy perspective to reduce MH. The primary objective of this paper is to simulate and compare the potential MHR from voluntary deductibles under risk-rated and community-rated premiums. To do so, we construct three scenarios that vary by the degree of self-selection in the market: 'perfect self-selection', 'imperfect self-selection' and 'no self-selection'. Each of these scenarios makes an assumption about the sorting of risk types between a deductible and a non-deductible plan. Next, we calculate for each scenario the MHR due to the voluntary deductible.",

            "text": "Our simulations are carried out on data from Chile. The Chilean health system is characterised by a public/private mix in the insurance and provision of healthcare, where the private sector (i.e. Isapres market) is ruled under some principles of social insurance. The Isapres market combines premium regulations composed by a community-rated premium for GES services (GES premium) 1 and a regulated riskrated part (currently, only age) for duplicative and additional services covered by the offered health plans, no open enrollment and a simple risk equalisation system. The Isapres market is an example of how potentially effective regulatory tools, if poorly implemented, exacerbate the inefficiencies of the market (Velasco et al. 2018) . These structural features of the market have led to a proliferation of plans 2 that differ in many ways, such as benefits, cost-sharing and provider networks creating market segmentation (Velasco et al. 2018) . Consumers face an overwhelming choice set that increases their transaction costs, ultimately hindering competition (Enthoven 1986 ). This dynamic also undermines the efficiency of sorting across plans (consumers do not enroll in the plan with the highest net value over cost) , lowering the effectiveness of cost-sharing to counteract MH. To solve these problems, the country in the current presidential cycle (2018) (2019) (2020) (2021) pushed for reform proposals with the goal of increasing the fairness and efficiency of the private market. In recent proposals, both the premium setting, the option of a voluntary deductible and the improvement of the risk equalisation system have been proposed (Ministerio de Salud 2019) . Understanding the interaction between the (MHR from) voluntary deductible and the premium structure is then of great interest from both an empirical perspective and a policy point of view. In the light of this reform proposal, this paper simulates whether the MHR from a voluntary deductible can indeed be expected to be larger under risk-rated premiums than under communityrated premiums.",

            "text": "Yet another system feature that can impact (the MHR from) voluntary deductibles is 'risk equalisation', i.e. a system that compensates insurers for predictable variation in medical spending in order to mitigate incentives for insurers to engage in risk selection. Risk equalisation can be found in many social health insurance markets, including the mandatory health insurance schemes in the Netherlands and Switzerland and the ACA marketplaces in the U.S., and is part of the Chilean reform proposals as well. With risk equalisation, it is not straightforward for insurers to offer attractive premium rebates for voluntary deductibles (van Kleef et al. 2008) . The simple reason is that risk equalisation compensates insurers for predictable differences in spending between people who are likely to choose a deductible and those who are not. As risk equalisation 'better' compensates for this difference in spending between the two types of contracts, the difference in premiums between the two contracts will be smaller. In our empirical analyses we examine whether, in the presence of risk equalisation, insurers will still be able to offer attractive premium rebates in the different self-selection scenarios. More specifically, we calculate the difference in mean spending (from the insurers' perspective) between a deductible plan and a non-deductible plan, taking into account the risk equalisation system.",

Indeed, the regulatory tools discussed in the paper are commonly implemented in insurance markets to balance efficiency and fairness : voluntary deductibles can help counteract moral hazard; premium rate restrictions (i.e. community rating (CR)) can improve fairness (but also introduce selection incentives); and risk equalisation mitigates incentives for risk selection by insurers. The findings in this paper imply that these three features should not be considered in isolation. A better understanding of the interactions among these tools can enhance healthcare system design.",

The RAND Health Insurance Experiment was the first randomised control trial (RCT) on health insurance, designed to identify the effect of consumer cost-sharing on medical spending and health (Manning et al. 1987 ) (Newhouse 1993 . The study found that the average arc price elasticity (how much medical spending changed when cost-sharing was varied) among the different costsharing options was around \u2212 0.2 (Keeler and Rolph 1988) . A second and more recent study was the Oregon health insurance experiment. This project investigated the impact of expanding public health insurance (Medicaid) to a sample of lowincome people. The previous findings were confirmed with different outcomes: the increase of health insurance coverage (free health insurance in this case) increased health care utilisation (Baicker and Finkelstein 2011) .",

(2015) analysed the Swiss health insurance market and found a 27% reduction of use for individuals enrolled in high deductible plans. In the U.S., Stockley (2016) found that a USD 10 increase in monthly out-of-pocket (OOP) costs due to deductibles reduces total spending by 1.1%. Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017) ran a natural experiment exploiting the mandatory switch for all the employees of a self-insured firm from an insurance plan that provided free healthcare to a non-linear, high-deductible plan. The authors found a spending reduction of between 11.8% and 13.8%. Klein et al. (2018) focused on the mandatory deductible in the Dutch market, restricting the analysis to individuals without voluntary deductibles. They found that, on average, individuals spent 36% less before the deductible's threshold than in the months where they exceeded it. Concerning MHR due to the introduction of voluntary deductibles, several studies have been applied to the Swiss health insurance market. Van Kleef et al. (2007) found a 7.1% average reduction in the Swiss health insurance market. The magnitude of MHR varied widely across the different deductible levels. For example, the reduction detected for the CHF 600 3 deductible was around 15.1%, while that of the CHF 1200 deductible was 12.9%. These findings confirm the prior estimation made by Gardiol et al. (2005) , where the CHF 600 deductible produced a reduction of 16.1% and the CHF 1200 only 5%. Trottman et al. (2012) confirmed the reduction in the Swiss system, finding a higher average reduction of 23% due to the introduction of voluntary deductibles. Overall, the effect of the deductible is consistently smaller for inpatient spending, suggesting that consumers are less price sensitive when they face more serious medical episodes (Aron-Dine et al. 2013 ).",

The literature does not provide a unique answer. A first assumption is that consumers should respond to their expected endof-year price, i.e. the expected (OOP) price on the last dollar of healthcare spending, given current information (Ellis 1987) . According to this assumption, consumers are fully forward-looking. A second assumption is that consumers are myopic to some extent, as they respond to the actual (realised) end-of-year price (Eichner 1998; Kowalski 2009; Marsh 2012) . Lastly, some studies found that consumers are fully myopic, responding heavily to the 'spot price' of healthcare, i.e. the OOP price of the next dollar of healthcare spending (Ellis et al. 2017; Brot-Goldberg et al. 2017; Dalton 2014) . Aaron-Dine et al. (2015) found mixed evidence. In their specific setting, consumers did appear to take into account the non-linear budget set, revealing forward-looking behaviours, but they were also responsive to the 'spot price' of healthcare, revealing some degree of myopia.",

This reduction has two components: (1) a shift of spending from the insurer to the consumer (i.e. the OOP payment due to the deductible) and (2) the reduction in MH. Assuming that consumers are more interested in opting for a deductible as the premium rebate exceeds their expected OOP spending, the magnitude of MHR is crucial for the attractiveness of a deductible in this theoretical setting.

This premium setting implies that individuals who opt for the same insurance policy and deductible level face the same premium (rebate), independent of his or her risk. In a real-world scenario, the premium rebate offered by the insurer does not have two, but three components: (1) the OOP payment due to the deductible, (2) the MHR and (3) the selection effect. 4 Self-selection is a concept used to describe the tendency of high-risk individuals to buy more coverage than low-risk individuals in the same premium-risk group in a way that is similar to the dynamics described in the seminal work of Akerlof (1970) . Referring to premium rebates, we use the term self-selection to describe the greater incentive of healthy insureds to opt for a deductible compared to unhealthy individuals, given a premium rebate level. The community-rated feature makes the voluntary deductibles particularly attractive for applicants with relatively low risk in the total population (van Kleef et al. 2006 ). In the presence of self-selection, the premium rebate for a voluntary deductible (which is based on the difference of the insurer's cost between the deductible and non-deductible plan) is not only affected by OOP spending and MHR, but also by the fact that people choosing a deductible are healthier than those not choosing a deductible.",

This instrument aims to reduce selection incentives by compensating insurers for differences in predicted expenditure between low-risk and high-risk indi-viduals (Ellis et al. 2018) . Risk equalisation, however, also reduces the potential premium rebate for a voluntary deductible. The simple reason is that risk equalisation compensates insurers for the difference in healthcare spending between the relatively healthy people who opt for a deductible and the relatively unhealthy people who do not. When risk equalisation perfectly compensates for the difference in expected spending between these groups, the premium rebate will not be influenced by selfselection. Instead, the premium rebate can only consist of the MHR and OOP spending in the deductible plan compared to the non-deductible plan. When risk equalisation imperfectly compensates for the difference in expected spending between people who choose a deductible and those who do not, the premium will be influenced by self-selection (van Winssen et al. 2016) .",

Given the fragmentation among insurance plans offered by the insurers in the Chilean health insurance market, the nominal cost-sharing design varies significantly (Velasco et al. 2018 ). The available data provides the nominal share of the cost born by the enrollees for ambulatory and hospital care, respectively (see Table 1 ). For ambulatory care the cost-sharing is significant since 42% of the sample chose a 30% coinsurance rate, while 38% and 11% of the sample opted for a 20% and 10% coinsurance rate, respectively. Regarding hospital care, the risk assumed decreased since 46% of the sample chose the full coverage (0% coinsurance), while 45% opted for a 10% coinsurance rate, with 6% of the population having a coinsurance rate of 20%. On average, 86% of the population has a coinsurance rate that varies between 10 and 20%. Only 3% of the sample has full coverage (0% coinsurance rate). The remaining share of enrollees faces a coinsurance rate above 30%. This variation does not match the simpler insurance cost-sharing schedule examined in our estimations, i.e. a deductible versus a non-deductible plan. We corrected for the existing variation in consumer cost-sharing by 'reintroducing' the MH reduction from the current cost-sharing arrangements. In absence of information on the actual MH reduction, we relied on the outcomes of the RAND experiment. For comparable coinsurance rates, the RAND experiment found a 17% spending reduction compared to the free care plan (Keeler and Rolph 1988; Zweifel and Maninng 2000) . To compute the corrected healthcare expenditure, we then amplify the expenses of all enrollees that chose a contract with some coinsurance rate in 2017 by 1.17. Throughout the paper we will use the corrected spending for our estimations.",

The financial gain arises when the expected OOP is lower than the premium rebate offered by the insurer. Ideally, we might want to compare these two variables in order to simulate the sorting of individuals toward the deductible. A challenge here, however, is that the premium rebate is endogenous: a change in premium rebate is expected to result in a change of the population opting for a deductible, which leads to a different rebate and so on. To overcome this challenge, we follow an alternative approach which is to simply assume three 'sorting scenarios' with different degrees of self-selection.",

First, we subtract the MHR, which is calculated as a percentage (15%) of the spending in a group. For groups without a voluntary deductible plan, the MHR equals zero (step 3 above). In the second stage, we subtract the OOP due to the deductible. To compute the OOP, as mentioned, we assume a USD 500 deductible.

Looking at the Chilean private health insurance market and controlling by the age of the enrollees, Duarte (2012) did not find any significant difference between young and old consumers. To overcome the lack of empirical evidence, we look at two alternative scenarios: one in which the percentage MHR (relative to mean spending) is lower for older groups than for younger groups, and one in which the percentage MHR (relative to mean spending) is higher for older than for younger groups. For simplicity, we assume a 15% and 5% MHR. To split our sample, we take as the reference the age groups reported in Table 1 . Consumers between 18 and 59 years old are considered in the young group, whilst those above 60 years old are considered to be in the old group. If the MHR as a percentage of mean spending is lower (higher) for older age groups than for younger age groups, the conclusions of our analysis might change. If it is lower, then CR might result in a higher MHR than RR. If it is higher, then the increase of the MHR from RR compared to CR will be even bigger than suggested in our main analysis.",

When enrollees with relatively higher expenditure in the insurer's pool opt for the deductible plan it is reasonable to expect a larger MHR, ceteris paribus. Recalling our assumption that the MHR is simply a percentage (15%) of the average spending of those enrolled in the deductible plan, when the average spending increases, the MHR increases accordingly. In Fig. 2 the bars represent the mean spending of enrollees assigned to the deductible plan in the CR and the RR settings, for all three scenarios. We decomposed each bar into two components: (1) (2) the remaining average spending. We focus only on the deductible plans since we assumed no MHR for those in the full coverage plan. Two main results come from Fig. 2 , which directly affect the MHR. The first is that the mean spending of the enrollees who are predicted to opt for the plan with the deductible varies in the three selection scenarios assumed. Specifically, the spending in the deductible plan increases as the self-selection decreases. The MHR increases accordingly. The second is that in the case of (imperfect) selection, the RR setting leads to people with somewhat higher spending opting for a deductible compared to CR. This dynamic is in line with our theoretical consideration. Accordingly, under the assumptions made in the simulation, the former premium setting provides a larger average MHR. This applies in all three scenarios with a decreasing trend as the self-selection lowers. Indeed, the two premium settings provide similar average spending (USD 1573 and USD 1577) when self-selection is absent. The potential MHR will be similar accordingly. Overall, the difference in the MHR is not large when comparing the average (CR) and the weighted average of MHR (RR), as reported in Fig. 2 . However, observing the potential average MHR per risk group in the RR setting, we report quite large values for older groups as reported in Table 2 and Table 5 in the Appendix. Considering the imperfect self-selection scenario, the average MHR for the 60-79 and 80+ age groups is, respectively, USD 213 and USD 341.",

In this scenario the potential premium rebate is estimated to be USD 450, USD 50 below the deductible amount. In all other scenarios, the potential premium rebates computed far exceed the deductible amount for each age group considered. The gap between the potential premium of the two groups increases with age. The result is intuitive because the spending variation in high-risk groups (highage groups in this case) is larger than in the lower-risk groups. Accordingly, the MHR and the OOP reduction are larger for these groups. All these components lead the premium rebates to be larger for the oldest groups with respect to the youngest ones. Figure 3 reports the comparison of potential risk-rated premium rebates before and after the risk equalisation for the four age groups considered in the three scenarios (see the Appendix for the equivalent of Table 2 ). The bars represent the potential premium rebates for each group and are subdivided into the three components of the premium rebate: (1) MHR, (2) OOP due to the deductible, and (3) the selection effect. The premium rebates decrease when moving from perfect selection to no selfselection, ceteris paribus. This is because the selection effect represents the largest component of the premium rebate. As for the CR, when the self-selection lowers, the gap between the average spending of the two plan options decreases. For example, the premium rebate for the age group 40-59 in the perfect selection scenario without REP is USD 2175, it decreases to USD 1906 in the imperfect self-selection scenario and it is reduced to USD 567 in the no self-selection scenario. The selection component is also the only one affected by the introduction of the REPs. The risk equalisation leads to a significant reduction of this component when selfselection holds in the market. This is true especially for the riskiest groups, which see their premium rebates largely reduced. Taking into consideration the 80+ age group in the perfect selection scenario (panel g)), the premium rebate decreases by USD 1452 (USD 4652-USD 3200) after the REP.",

We tested this assumption with data from Chile. The outcomes of our empirical simulation show that in the presence of self-selection, RR premiums can lead to a higher MHR. The direction of the results is therefore in line with our expectations. Nevertheless, the result will likely depend on the assumptions set in the simulation and what will occur in practice, as well as the characteristics of the data being used.

            "text": "The estimations rely on a series of assumptions related to the sorting of the population in the market, the MHR and the level of the premiums. The first refers to the share of the population choosing the deductible plan. A risk-averse utility maximising consumer is supposed to opt for a voluntary deductible when he faces a gain in expected utility, that is, the expected OOP is lower than the premium rebate offered by the insurer (van Kleef et al. 2006 ). The endogenous relationship between premiums and deductibles represented a challenge in our analysis: a change in premium rebate is expected to result in a change in the population opting for a deductible, which leads to a different premium rebate and so on. We implemented a pragmatic approach to overcome this limitation by 'simply' defining a series of 'sorting scenarios' with different degrees of self-selection. In an ideal world, we might want to compare all the parameters listed in the conceptual framework under behavioural factors in order to take into consideration all the dimensions which affect the choice of the insureds. A second assumption concerns the level of the MHR. A significant variation surrounds the effect (magnitude) of deductibles on individuals' spending, enhancing the uncertainty in the literature. To be as close as possible to the literature, we made a simple assumption considering a percentage MHR that reflects the average effects of voluntary deductibles at the group level, in line with similar papers from other insurance settings. Specifically, we assumed a 15% MHR of the mean spending of people that opt for the deductible based on previous studies (van Kleef et al. 2006; Gardiol et al. 2005 ) that share similar features with our estimation. The estimations are not aimed at detecting the exact magnitude of the MHR, rather, they aim to shed light on which premium setting might be more efficient; any rate of MHR can be used by the reader without altering the conclusion displayed in the analysis. For future research, it might be interesting to refine this assumption and simulate the MHR at the individual level. However, it is challenging as researchers will need much more information about the differences in this response across consumers that is not available in the literature yet. For example, researchers need to know whether consumers are myopic or forwardlooking and if there are any differences in forward-looking or myopic consumers among risk types (e.g. healthy vs high-risk consumers, young vs old consumers, well educated vs poorly educated consumers, etc.) or among medical episodes.",

It is well-known that some RR can help overcome risk selection by consumers and insurers (van Kleef et al. 2006 (van Kleef et al. , 2008 Kifmann 2002) . We provide another potential benefit from allowing (some) RR in social health insurance systems: in systems with a voluntary deductible, RR can lead higher risk enrollees to opt for a deductible resulting in a larger MHR than under community-rated premiums. Our findings imply that regulators should consider voluntary deductibles, premium regulation and risk equalisation in combination, rather than in isolation.",
