The proposed model can be easily implemented with daily updated data sets of the pandemic publicly available by distinct online sources. It has only two adjustable parameters and it predicts the evolution of the total number of infected people in a country for the next 14 days if parameters do not change during the analyzed period. The model incorporates the main aspects of the disease such as the fact that there are asymptomatic and symptomatic phases (both capable of propagating the virus), and that these phases take almost two weeks before the infected person status evolves to the next (asymptomatic becomes symptomatic or symptomatic becomes either recovered or dead). A striking advantage of the model for its implementation by the health sector is that it gives directly the number of total infected people in each day (in thousands, tens of thousands or hundred of thousands). Here, the model is tested with data from Brazil, UK and South Korea, presenting low error rates on the prediction of the evolution of the disease in all analyzed countries. We hope this model may be a useful tool to estimate the propagation of the disease.",

Named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, or SARS-CoV-2, and causing the respiratory syndrome known as Covid-19, it joins a group coronaviruses which originated from animals and resulted in human diseases, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). However, while these diseases share to some extent similar clinical symptoms, including fever, dry cough and dyspnoea [3] , the Covid-19 outbreak quickly spread worldwide and became a global public health crisis. In 30 January 2020 WHO declared Covid-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [4] , and soon thereafter, on 11 March 2020 it was declared a global pandemic. Notably, while on 30 January 2020 there were 8.324 confirmed cases worldwide, on 28 May 2020 this number increased to almost 6 million [5] . Economically, it is expected that the Covid-19 pandemic a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 results in a recession at least as severe as the 2009 crisis [6] . As such, to reduce the social and economic burden caused by the pandemic, the development of reliable models to forecast its propagation is a promising strategy to assist public policies aiming at controlling further dissemination of the disease.",

These are powerful models, as they are relatively simple and perform well on distinct infectious diseases. However, these models are in general based on differential equations and their implementation with available data are rather challenging, what makes them difficult to be widely understood and implemented. Notably, for Covid-19 the accessible data set is extensive and updated in a daily basis, including number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered people per country. This increases the relevance of simple models that can be easily implemented and fed with daily updated data from the pandemic, facilitating tracking of its propagation and assessment of the efficacy of public policies aiming to control it in a daily basis. Moreover, the recent history of infectious diseases have demonstrated that emergence of outbreaks are relatively frequent, to a point that such events are being included in scientific [12, 13] and political [14] discussions on preparedness for future outbreaks. Therefore, as current (in case of and future, yet unknown, infectious diseases will continue to impact us, the development of simple but efficient models to track pandemics evolution based on daily updated data may be valuable not only for Covid-19 but also for potential future outbreaks to come.",

These sources commonly present small differences in their data sets, but as common characteristics all present daily updated data and, among other quantities, the total number of confirmed cases of infected people and the total number of deaths per country. Here, we present a model that can easily incorporate these available data sets and is based on discrete-time equations to forecast the number of confirmed cases by Covid-19 in any given country for the next 14 days. Among its strengths, the presented model: (i) presents low relative error rates, as tested in data from Brazil, South Korea and UK; (ii) provides easily interpretable results, specifically the predicted number of infected people in the next 14 days; (iii) presents results that are directly comparable across countries; and (iv) incorporates the average time related to the disease incubation period (asymptomatic phase) and the average time related to the symptomatic phase, both parameters adjustable according to the pandemics' characteristics.",

I commonly vary from few days to two weeks (according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA [17] ) and we will take, for simplicity, T = 14 days. The time interval going from I ! R can also vary from 10 to more than 20 days and again, for simplicity, we will take the same value T = 14 days. Clearly, this is a crude simplification since these time intervals can significantly vary per individual. For example, in patients where lungs are severely affected the recovery period is expected to take considerably longer than for patients presenting symptoms of a mild flu only. Therefore, putting an average value T = 14 for both phases A and I is a simplification that can only be supported by fitting with the real data set: if the fitting produces a reasonably accurate forecast, then this average value can be kept. Otherwise, the value for T may be fine-tuned by more sophisticated generalizations of the model. Nevertheless, in all cases we have studied, the average error rate of tested predicted values were lower than 5%.",

For countries with large population, e.g., several tens (or even more than a hundred) million habitants, we can further simplify the model described in Eqs (1)- (4) assuming that the number of susceptible people is practically constant in time, S(t) ' S, where S is a constant, so there is no time evolution for S. This can be assumed for countries with large populations as the difference between infected (asymptomatic A + symptomatic I, which theoretically may reach up to few hundred thousand people in a given country) and susceptible people S (depending on the country reaching over a hundred million people) is still so huge that the decrease in the sample of susceptible people S may be negligible. As such, calling 1 + aS \ufffd \u03b1 and bS \ufffd \u03b2, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are positive constants, the equations for Covid-19 for largepopulation countries can be written as:",

From the time series of {I Kor (t)}, and using Eqs (11) and (12), we can build the time series for the asymptomatic people, fA Kor \u00f0t\u00deg ",

The model has only two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, what facilitates its implementation by health sector personnel and interested people in general. It is possible to use the daily updated data set of total confirmed cases of infected people to choose values for these parameters and predict how this number of infected people changes in the next 14 days if the parameters are kept constant. The model gives the effective numbers of total infected people, in tens ",

Also, the model incorporates the average time-delay asymptomatic people take to become symptomatic (incubation period) and the average time-delay the symptomatic infected people take to recover or, eventually, die. Here, the model has been implemented in three countries (Brazil, UK and South Korea), and the predicted values generated by the model from May 29th until June 11th, based on the real data set until day May 28th, agrees very well with the real numbers of total infected people during this period. The maximum daily error for these three cases, each one with a period of 14 days, is around 5%. As such, we have found that the model is able to provide a reliable estimate of the status of the disease at least two weeks ahead of analysis time. Remarkably, this is achieved with a rather simple algorithm, based only on fitting two parameters and on publicly available data [5, 15, 16] . Altogether, we believe these characteristics facilitate its implementation by public sector, and may be a useful tool to track disease propagation and efficacy of public policies aiming to control it.",

For instance, it has been reported that the coronavirus can still be detected in throat swabs from recovered patients up to 13 days after they present no symptoms of the disease (as evaluated by clinical assessments), indicating that even people considered to be recovered from Covid-19 may still potentially infect others [19] . Furthermore, it has been speculated the possibility of reinfection for patients who recovered from Covid-19 (in this regard, preliminary data from primates support the hypothesis of immunization and protection against reinfection [20] ). In fact, we are aware that the model does not cover extensively the possible complexities related to disease propagation, but it focuses on the main course of propagation instead. As the model indicates a small error rate in its prediction, we considered it to fulfil its purpose adequately, exchanging complexity for simplicity in its comprehension and implementation while maintaining satisfactory predictive power (accuracy). These, in our understanding, are core principles for its assimilation by public health sector.",

For instance, some patients may develop from asymptomatic phase A to recovered phase R without undergoing the symptomatic phase I, a situation not included in the model. Here, a challenge for modelling those cases is that not only the number of Covid-19 testing varies dramatically between countries but also the infectious status of the tested population may vary significantly between countries. For example, it is expected that countries testing the population more extensively are detecting more asymptomatic subjects (including those in the above-mentioned scenario), while countries with less testing are prioritizing diagnosing symptomatic patients, what risks biasing the model towards countries with more data available. Still, having discussed the challenges related to reliably assessing these cases, one could evaluate their effects in our model by adding a new parameter \u03b3 in Eqs (2) and (3), and modifying them into the equations:",

It should be emphasized, though, that to explicitly include these cases into the model comes at the cost of (a) increasing the complexity of the model by introducing another parameter, \u03b3, (b) risking accuracy, as this information is challenging to reliably assess in any country (unless massive testing is implemented in the population in a narrow time window), and (c) potentially impacting the comparability across countries, as the assessment of this population may be largely different between countries, as discussed above. In the simplified model (i.e., without parameter \u03b3), we assume that this parameter is integrated in the parameter \u03b1, decreasing its value, and consequently reducing the number of infected people without increasing the number of parameters. Considering the good predictive power presented by the simplified model, we believe that its simplistic approach based on the main course of the pandemic has the advantages of being easier to implement, and providing more standardized, interpretable and comparable results across countries. We would like to remark that the prediction for the total number of infected people is restricted to 14 days because of the definition given in Eq (10), where we want to use the real data for the total number of infected people. If we relax this requirement to use real data, we can get points for the whole future, keeping the parameters constant. Certainly, this is not expected and this prediction for a long time is likely not reliable. It only gives an estimate of how will the disease propagate in the future if a given country does not change the value of the parameters. In fact, in practically all tested cases the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 decreased on time, likely reflecting measures against the propagation of the disease. For this reason, predictions provided by the model here presented are expected to decrease its accuracy for longer periods.",
