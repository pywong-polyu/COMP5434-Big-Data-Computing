Few studies have focused on the changes of NK, T-and B-cell subsets, inflammatory cytokines and virus-specific antibodies in patients with moderate COVID-19. A total of 11 RT-PCR-confirmed convalescent patients with COVID-19 and 11 patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (control patients) were enrolled in this study. NK, CD8 + T, CD4 + T, Tfh-like and B-cell subsets were analysed using flow cytometry. Cytokines and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were analysed using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. NK cell counts were significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 than in control patients (P = 0.017). Effector memory CD8 + T-cell counts significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 during a convalescent period of 1 week (P = 0.041). TIM-3 + Tfh-like cell and CD226 + Tfh-like cell counts significantly increased (P = 0.027) and decreased (P = 0.022), respectively, during the same period. Moreover, ICOS + Tfh-like cell counts tended to decrease (P = 0.074). No abnormal increase in cytokine levels was observed. The high expression of NK cells is important in innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2. The increase in effector memory CD8 + T-cell counts, the upregulation of inhibitory molecules and the down-regulation of active molecules on CD4 + T cells and Tfh-like cells in patients with COVID-19 would benefit the maintenance of balanced cellular and humoural immune responses, may prevent the development of severe cases and contribute to the recovery of patients with COVID-19.

NK cells participate in the elimination of virus-infected cells without viral antigen presentation. 9 Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), an activated subset of CD8 + T cells, can kill virus-infected cells by releasing perforin. 10 CD4 + T cells, particularly T follicular help (Tfh) cells, can promote the production of virus-specific antibodies by activating Tfh-dependent B cells. 11 Moreover, peripheral Tfh-like cells were defined as CXCR5 + CD4 + T cells. 12 After viral infection, the activated immune system would not only directly induce antiviral cellular and humoural immune responses but also develop memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets as a preparation for secondary infection. 13 B cells differentiate from na\u00efve or transitional to mature cells and finally differentiate into plasma cells, which produce virus-specific antibodies. In addition to the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for the diagnosis of COVID- 19, 14 these specific antibodies may neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we analysed other biomolecules, including inhibitory cell surface molecules: T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin 3 (TIM-3), programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), and active cell surface molecules: inducible costimulatory molecule (ICOS) and CD226, which could bind to CD155 on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and compete with TIGIT. 15, 16 The serum inflammatory cytokine levels in patients with severe COVID-19 were observed to be abnormally increased and were used to predict the risk of cytokine storm. 17, 18 Furthermore, serum interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were analysed to determine the variability of lymphocyte subsets in the present study.",

IL-8 and INF-\u03b1 levels significantly increased (<5.0 pg/mL [<5.0-8.7 pg/mL] vs 28.7 pg/mL [8.1-356.0 pg/mL], P = 0.005), (4.3 pg/mL [<4.0-11.2 pg/ mL] vs 6.7 pg/mL [<4.0-10.6 pg/mL], P = 0.021). Moreover, an increase in IL-1\u03b2 levels was observed (<5.0 pg/mL [<5.0-6.0 pg/mL] vs <5.0 pg/mL [<5.0-10.6 pg/mL], P = 0.068). IL-10 levels remained at a low level (<5.0 pg/mL). All these data are shown in Figure 6. In summary, the level of most cytokines and inflammatory factors either decreased or remained at a low level in patients with COVID-19, during the convalescent period.",

(A) TIM-3 + Tfh-like cells (B) CD226 + Tfh-like cells (C) PD-1 + Tfh-like cells in patients with COVID-19 during convalescent period. Data were analysed using a paired nonparametric test. 1st: first phenotyping test on 17 February 2020; 2nd: second phenotyping test on 25 February 2020 (Figure 2A); the same was observed in the number of CD4 + T, CD8 + T and B cells (Figure 2C-E). These results indicate that patients with moderate COVID-19 exhibited an antiviral immune response similar to that in patients infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or other common pathogens. CD4 + T cells contribute to the infiltration of macrophages and CD8 + T cells into infected tissues by secreting cytokines and chemokines; they also promote the development of virus-specific B cells and plasma cells, 10 which emphasize the important role of T cell subsets in the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection. 10 In addition, an increase in the number of NK, CD4 + T and CD8 + T cells was observed in most patients with moderate COVID-19 during convalescent period (Figure 3). Hence, effective therapy can be considered to be accompanied by the enhancement of both innate and acquired immune responses. 23 NK cells usually inhibit proliferation of viruses by stimulating the development of dendritic cells and CD8 + T cells via the secretion of IFN-\u03b3.24 Compared with the control patients, patients with moderate COVID-19 had a higher number of NK cells, thereby suggesting that the activity of the innate immunity against SARS-CoV-2 might be stronger than other pathogens.In a recent study, the percentages of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells and memory CD4 + T cells were reportedly increased and decreased, respectively, in severe COVID-19 cases. 2 In a study byChen et al, no    difference in the percentage of CD45RA + CD4 + or CD45RO + CD4 + T cells was found between moderate and severe cases of COVID-19.25 The present study focused on na\u00efve and memory CD8 + T cells in patients with COVID-19. An increased number of effector memoryCD8 + T cells (CD45RO + CCR7 \u2212 CD8 + T cells) was observed in moderate cases during convalescent period (Figure 4A). This result indicates that the formation of memory CD8 + T cells may contribute to the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 and improvement of clinical symptoms, but would cause neither excessive cytotoxicity nor cytokine storms. The above changes indicate that patients with moderate COVID-19 had gradually established an antiviral immune response against secondary infection. NK, T and B cells play a vital role in balancing the elimination of viral infection and the risk of overwhelming inflammation. 26 Most patients with severe COVID-19 were observed to have elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines that are observed in cytokine release syndrome (CRS). 2,17,18 Uncontrolled inflammatory responses may lead to local and systemic tissue damage in patients with severe COVID-19 but not those with mild COVID-19. 14 During the convalescent period of moderate COVID-19, decreased or stably low levels of most serum cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1) or inflammatory factors (CRP) were observed (Figure 6). IL-6 may promote CTL differentiation and enhance virus-killing function. IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 may up-regulate the expression of vascular endothelial adhesion molecules and chemoattract neutrophils to the site of inflammation. IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, is involved in the negative regulation of inflammatory response. In the present study, the low levels of serum cytokines indicated a low risk of cytokine storm or excessive immune response in moderate cases, thereby implying a good convalescent response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the same period, no marked change in the number of lymphocyte subsets was observed; this was consistent with the changes in the level of cytokines. In addition, the absolute number of TIM-3 + CD4 + T cells was significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 during convalescent period (Figure 4B). CD4 + T cells are involved in antiviral responses and secrete inflammatory cytokines. Increased TIM-3 + CD4 + T cell counts may inhibit the excessive activation of CTL and NK cells, reduce the secretion of cytokines by CD4 + T cells and regulate immune response. 27-29 This indicated the important role of TIM-3 in the treatment period of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The increased expression of TIM-3 + T cells within a certain range may help inflammatory reactions remain at a low level and prevent the occurrence of severe conditions. In a recent study, the expression of exhaustion marker NKG2A in NK cells and CD8 + T cells was reportedly up-regulated in patients with COVID-19. Upon patient recovery, the exhaustion markers on cytotoxic lymphocytes decreased. 23 Changes in immune cell function towards memory and exhaustion of symptoms. 30 An increase in the number of TIM-3 + Tfh-like cells in patients with COVID-19 was observed during the convalescent period (Figure 4C). This indicated that TIM-3 might inhibit Tfh cell function in helping B cell activation and specific antibody production. The absolute number of B cells and B-cell subsets did not change significantly in patients with COVID-19 during convalescent period. The inhibition of Tfh cells may contribute to the control of B cells and B-cell subsets in patients with moderate COVID-19. This may prevent the overproduction of specific antibodies. In previous studies, high titres of total antibodies were associated with poor outcomes of COVID-19, 31,32 but it was unknown whether antibody responses somehow contributed to pulmonary pathology. 30 For patients with moderate COVID-19 and specific antibodies, an increase in the number of peripheral TIM-3 + Tfh-like cells may be a signal of the alleviation of symptoms during the treatment period and may indicate an appropriate humoural immune response. No significant difference in the number of TIGIT + or PD-1 + Tfh-like cells was observed in patients with COVID-19 during convalescent period, whereas the number of CD226 + Tfh-like cells was observed to significantly decrease during the same period (Figure 4D,E,G). This result suggests that during recovery, the ability of dendritic cells to activate Tfh cells through the CD226induced signalling pathway might have been weakened. CD226 may competitively inhibit the interaction between CD155 and TIGIT. 15 The down-regulation of CD226 may ultimately enhance TIGIT function and further inhibit Tfh cell function. Moreover, a downward trend in the activating molecule, ICOS in Tfh-like cells, was observed (Figure 4F); this was consistent with the observation that Tfh cells shift from the activation phase to the inhibition phase during antibody production.",

            "text": "the function of Tfh-like cells in patients with moderate COVID-19 was inhibited during the third week after the onset of COVID-19. As viral load began to decrease, the development of Tfh-like cells was inhibited by the up-regulation of TIM-3 and TIGIT (relatively) and the down-regulation of ICOS; these processes may be correlated with therapeutic effects and stable antibody production. The number of PD-1 + Tfh-like cells did not significantly change during the convalescent period; therefore, the decrease in the percentage of PD-1 + Tfh-like cells (Figure 5C) might have resulted from the increased expression of TIM-3 in Tfh-like cells. During the recovery of patients with COVID-19, the expression of PD-1 was more stable COVID-19 were hospitalized in West China Hospital when the present study was conducted; this resulted in some limitations. First, there was a lack of analysis of patients with severe cases. Second, there was a lack of analysis during the serological conversion phase, as all patients had positive virus-specific antibodies. Third, there was a lack of data on other CD4 + T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th7 and Tregs) owing to lack of timely reagent supplies. In conclusion, a high number of NK cells are important in anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response. The increase in the number of effector memory CD8 + T cells, the up-regulation of inhibitory molecules and the down-regulation of active molecules on CD4 + T cells and Tfh-like cells would maintain balanced inflammatory responses and prevent the development of severe cases. The balanced innate, cellular and humoural immune antiviral responses and the appropriate production of antiviral antibodies are the key factors that ensure the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. These dynamic characteristics of immune response in patients with COVID-19 during convalescent period may provide a scientific basis for immune response monitoring and clinical treatment strategies.
