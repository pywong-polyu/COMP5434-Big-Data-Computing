Previous work mainly predicted exchange rates solely based on market indicators and therefore achieved unsatisfactory results. In response to such an issue, this study develops an inventive multimodal fusion-based long short-term memory (MF-LSTM) model to forecast the USD/CNY exchange rate. Our model consists of two parallel LSTM modules that extract abstract features from each modality of information and a shared representation layer that fuses these features. In terms of the text modality, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is applied to conduct a sentiment analysis on social media microblogs. Compared to previous studies, we incorporate not only market indicators but also investor sentiments into consideration, treating the two types of data differently to match their exclusive characteristics. In addition, we apply the multimodal fusion technique and contrive a deep coupled model rather than a shallow and simple model to reflect the couplings between the two modalities. As a consequence, the experimental results obtained over a 15month period exhibit the superiority of the proposed approach over nine baseline algorithms. The purpose of our study is to demonstrate that it is practicable and effective to incorporate multimodal fusion into financial time series forecasting.",

However, with the rapid increase in the size of the market in recent decades, the risk of foreign exchange has also been greatly accentuated. After the debacle of the Bretton Woods system, more flexible policies regarding exchange rates were adopted by most central banks, contributing to the volatile nature of the Forex market. These unanticipated fluctuations impose threats to not only the profits of multinational corporations but also the stability of financial systems. For illustration, the devaluation plan for the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar implemented in 1994 triggered an unexpected plunge Wei Cao weicao@hfut.edu.cn Edmure Windsor edmurewindsor@mail.hfut.edu.cn 1 School of Economics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China in the Mexican Peso Index, which eventually led to a severe recession in the Mexican economy, with a 6.2% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) over the following year 1 . Consequently, the exigency of forecasting the directions and extents of these fluctuations began to rise. In addition, the internationalization of CNY has profoundly influenced the global market. In 2020, US$2.591 trillion worth of goods and services were exported by China, accounting for 13.8% of overall global exports 2 . In addition, China brought in US$ 163 billion of inflows in 2020, surpassing the United States as the largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) 3 . Nevertheless, trade conflicts with the United States and the COVID-19 pandemic have also brought risks to China's economy. In terms of such magnitude, correspondingly, any exchange rate fluctuation might incur an enormous aftershock. Therefore, forecasting exchange rates with accuracy and robustness is crucial for international trade practitioners, global investors, and policy makers.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, there is still no panacea to address this issue. Such a predicament can be ascribed to three main reasons. First, an exchange rate is determined by an intricate system with complicated coupled relationships [2] , as shown in the left part of Fig. 1 . Factors comprising stock market movements and macroeconomic policies not only possess distinctive conduction mechanisms and impose various effects on the Forex market but also interact with each other. In addition, the factors that belong to each country's markets are also related. Second, Forex market participants do not make decisions solely based on the numerical market indicator data. Investor sentiments aroused by new information can also exert coupled effects among themselves concerning markets and countries, as displayed in the right part of Fig. 1 , eventually affecting the corresponding exchange rates [3] . Two theories can expound on this phenomenon. On the one hand, according to the effective market hypothesis (EMH), the stock market is capable of making rapid adjustments to new information [4, 5] . This hypothesis was further applied to the Forex market in [6] . That is, new information in different markets and regions, including financial news and social media texts, can be absorbed by Forex market participants through investor sentiments. Ergo, market expectations and exchange rates will change accordingly. On the other hand, behavioral finance theory argues that some agents are not fully rational [7] . When facing new information, irrationality such as herd behavior, thought contagion, and risk aversion affects market movement [8] . Additionally, these irrationalities within a single market can be conveyed far beyond the original sphere. For example, when encountering unpredictable calamities in the British stock market, panic may disseminate and compel practitioners to make overreact. These investor sentiments may even be transmitted to the USD/CNY Forex market and trigger fluctuations. Even though the above two theories have disparate perception with regard to how market movements reflect all sorts of new information, a consensus regarding the effect of new information can be derived -information related to each market is capable of generating investor sentiments, ultimately affecting the exchange rate. Third, there are also deep couplings between market indicators and investor sentiments, as shown in the middle of Fig. 1 . Since the mechanism that determines an exchange rate has three types of couplings with exclusive characteristics and the two forms of information are distinctive in modality, any attempt that considers only a single modality of information, whether that be numerical market indicator data or text data regarding investor sentiments, tends to fail in terms of obtaining accurate forecasts. Thus, to cope with the above problems, it is logical that a qualified forecasting methodology should capture both the inherent interactions among the market indicators and investor sentiments within these markets, as well as the couplings between the two modalities of new information.",

            "text": "When confronting such a challenge, however, it is arduous for existing methods to represent sophisticated coupled structures while incorporating various modalities of information. Traditionally, economists have applied econometric methods (e.g., the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach [9] ) for financial time series forecasting. Nonetheless, the processed time series are assumed to be rigidly linear and stationary [10] . As a result, these methods are rendered feeble when facing nonlinear hidden patterns within exchange rates and the impacts of various information. In addition, although machine learning techniques (e.g., decision trees [11] and support vector machines (SVMs) [12] ) are capable of incorporating diverse factors without such stringent restrictions, these shallow structures may ignore the distinctive conduction mechanisms of the market, as well as coupled effects. Furthermore, different modalities of data owns distinctive characteristics. It is logical that any approaches should treat them separately. Therefore, using a single and shallow structure to process multiple types of data actually ignores the differences between them, which is likely to generate unfavorable results. Nevertheless, in recent years, two methods have exhibited the potential to resolve these difficulties. The first is the long short-term memory (LSTM) approach proposed by Fig. 1 Hidden mechanisms beneath the exchange rate Schmidhuber and Hochreiter. Through its memory cells and gates, LSTM fixes the exploding and vanishing gradient problems formerly exhibited by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [13] . Such a merit contributes to the excellent performance of LSTM in learning both long-term and shortterm dependencies [14] . Hence, the LSTM model was later applied to numerous time series forecasting tasks, and achieved excellent results [15] [16] [17] . Another candidate method is multimodal fusion (MF), in which multiple types of media, their related features, or the intermediate decisions are incorporated to complete an analysis task [18] . In particular, since a hierarchical architecture can be automatically learned for each modality via deep learning, deep multimodal learning achieves undeniable success in domains such as object recognition tasks [19] , medical applications [20] , and autonomous systems [21] . It is noteworthy that this ability is consistent with the elaborate nature of the Forex market -different modalities of information exert distinctive impacts on exchange rates. However, to our knowledge, this method has not been applied to forecast foreign exchange rates. It is still an issue to formulate a deep learning model that is able to reflect the effects of factors within each type of information as well as the couplings of multiple modalities for the complex currency market.",

For example, if the value is 0, all information are forgotten and will not affect later states. (4)-(6) constitute the next steps. Through another sigmoid function, the input gate i t decides how much current information in C t should be stored. For example, if the value is 1, all information are preserved for future operations.Then a tanh function generates a candidate vector C and the cell state C t is updated according to (5) and (6) . Finally, (7) and (8) depict the output process: hidden state or current output h t is obtained through the output gate o t .

Two LSTM models are embedded at the first layer, where the first one depicts the couplings of social media sentiments in the text modality and the second one represents the couplings of market indicators in the numerical modality, so as to learn from disparate modalities separately. Suppose the window length is n, features of the two modalities from time t \u2212 n + 1 to time t are served as the input of the first layer.

Consequently, inspired by the concept of transfer learning, we leverage two BERT-based models, the robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa) and BERT with whole-word masking (BERT-wwm), for the sentiment analysis task. Since the invention of BERT, several improved models have been presented. For illustration, Cui et al. [27] proposed the BERT-wwm model. Compared to BERT, it takes the syntax difference between Mandarin and English into account, using the whole-word masking technique to improve the model performance on common NLP tasks with Chinese text. Additionally, Liu et al. [28] proposed RoBERTa, which is also based on BERT. In addition to applying more training data, the authors adopted a dynamic masking method to optimize the obtained results. The two models above are selected for our sentiment analysis task. Since BERT-derived models are capable of effectively capturing the deep relationships among words and sentences, only the parameters of the output layer need to be fine-tuned. Therefore, for Sina microblogs, we train the BERT-wwm model on an appropriate dataset 4 . For English tweets, the Twitter-RoBERTa-base sentiment model is imported from Hugging Face. Since this model has already been fine-tuned on approximately 58 million tweets, there is no need to conduct further training [29] .",

Such a result may imply that the Forex market can swiftly absorb the new information from both the text and numerical modalities and make corresponding adjustments. Table 6 displays the forecasting performance of the ten models in terms of the MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics with a six-month window length. Note that we also list the results of two scenarios (MF-LSTM-US and MF-LSTM-CN), in which the market indicators and social media sentiments belonging to each country are exclusively applied to the MF-LSTM model, to determine which side exerts more influence on the USD/CNY exchange rate. Apparently, it can be concluded that the proposed MF-LSTM model exceeds all baseline algorithms regarding the technical indicators. In addition, three observations can be obtained. First, the LSTM-derived models generally outperform the ARIMA, SVR, BPNN, ELM, and CNN approaches. Second, the MAE values of MF-LSTM are 15.9%, 36.1%, and 47.8% lower than those of LSTM-single, LSTM-sentiment, LSTM-market, and LSTM-all. Third, the LSTM-market model is superior to LSTM-sentiment when a six-month window length is utilized. Last, MF-LSTM-US holds an advantage over MF-LSTM-CN, with a lower RMSE value (0.0252). Figure 4 shows the forecasting accuracies and errors of the ten approaches for the period from 1/1/2020 to 4/1/2021. For a clearer view, Fig. 4c and d are extractions (Mar. 2020) from Fig. 4a and b , respectively. It can be observed from Fig. 4a that the MF-LSTM arguably fits the historical USD/CNY rate well. Moreover, the forecasting performance discrepancy is clearer in Fig. 4b . Furthermore, Fig. 5 depicts the forecasting RMSE of of different algorithms in 5 seasons. Notably, the USD/CNY exchange Six-month window length rate fluctuated severely in 2020Q1 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, our MF-LSTM model still significantly outperforms all other algorithms, exhibiting great resilience and robustness. Overall, our approach has the smallest forecasting errors throughout the whole period, especially on days with very high volatility. (Table 7) 3.",

            "text": "Interestingly, four findings can be derived from the previous section. First, it can be easily observed from Tables 6 and 9 that the LSTM-derived models outperform the ARIMA, SVR, BPNN, ELM, and CNN models. In accordance with [2] and [15] , this observation confirms the capability of LSTM in depicting both long-term and short-term dependencies in time series analysis. That is, the LSTMderived models are good at differentiating and capturing the effects of disparate influencing factors within each modality of information. Second, the MF-LSTM model exhibits an overwhelming advantage over the LSTMbased benchmarks regarding forecasting accuracy and error. This is further confirmed in the statistical tests. Here we present our reasoning and explanation. Initially, compared to LSTM-single, the LSTM-sentiment and the LSTMmarket performs better, indicating the necessity of including any modalities of data (market indicators and investor sentiments). Additionally, compared to LSTM-sentiment and LSTM-market, the LSTM-all and the MF-LSTM show superiority, revealing the merits of fusing the modalities. Furthermore, between the two fusing methods, the MF-LSTM is better than the LSTM-all, which implies that a deep multimodal fusion structure is more effective than a straightforward fusion. Therefore, we believe it is safe to accredit such improvement of forecasting accuracy to MF-LSTM's unique property -it takes two modalities of data into account, treats their exclusive characteristics separately, and fuses the hidden abstract features learned from different modalities. As a result, the proposed model is rendered not only capable of capturing couplings within each type of information, it is also adept at reflecting the interaction between different modalities of information. Third, the LSTM-market model is superior to LSTM-sentiment under the six-month window setting. In consideration of the similar findings concluded in [35] , we ascribe this phenomenon to the fact that the impact of information obtained from social media is exerted mainly in the short term. This implies that although extreme sentiments can spread quickly on social media platforms, market indicators and exchange rates may not always fluctuate accordingly. Thus, it might not be an excellent idea to forecast Forex rates purely based on social media sentiments. Finally, the advantage that MF-LSTM-US possesses over MF-LSTM-CN implies that the features obtained from the U.S. side might impact the exchange rate more than those derived from the Chinese side. Here, we give two possible explanations for this finding: On the one hand, the U.S. economy is larger and more liquid, and such In addition to these findings, we believe that two main contributions of our work should be emphasized. Initially, we apply the deep MF method to exchange rate forecasting for the first time, and it is demonstrated to be effective. On the one hand, although previous works used various methods (e.g., the ARIMA technique and SVR), they achieved considerably less promising results because of the overgeneralization of various influencing factors, as well as the neglect of the interactions among different modalities of information. On the other hand, although the MF method has achieved success on certain tasks such as disease diagnosis [37] , we have not seen any practical applications of MF in the intricate foreign exchange market. Additionally, we adopt BERT for the sentiment analysis task to obtain sentiment time series, which reflect the text modality. Previous studies usually applied lexicon-based [38] or traditional machine learning-based [39] methods to conduct sentiment analysis on social media text. There is no reason not to utilize the BERT model, which has already been recognized as a state-of-the-art tool for NLP tasks, to execute sentiment classification for microblogs related to the financial market. However, limitations still exist in our study. Considering data availability, we only select microblogs from two social media platforms with respect to the text modality. In addition, only two Mandarin keywords remain after preprocessing. Such data might not be sufficient to reflect the text modality comprehensively. Therefore, in the future, we plan to include more types of social media text, such as news and posts on forums. By building upon this research, future studies can be conducted from three facets. First, further work may investigate different fusion strategies (e.g., gradual fusion and hybrid fusion), optimization techniques, and model structures to achieve better performance. Although the use of a shared representation layer for intermediate fusion is indeed flexible, easy to operate, and efficacious, other strategies still possess certain merits. For example, late fusion (or decision fusion) is another favorable choice since the errors obtained from multiple classifiers are uncorrelated, and the method itself is feature-independent. In addition, reinforcement learning and other approaches can be leveraged to optimize the fusion structure. Furthermore, the possible structures are not confined to LSTM-derived models. We have noticed that some new models (e.g., the temporal convolutional network (TCN) [40] and LSTM with a transformation mechanism [41] ) perform remarkably well in tasks such as time series prediction. Second, in terms of the modalities, image data can also be incorporated into exchange rate forecasting. For illustration, a CNN has demonstrated applicability in extracting abstract features (e.g., Bolinger bands) from stock charts [42] . This modality may also be employed to explore exchange rate charts and generate interesting results when used along with other modalities. Moreover, as recent studies have demonstrated the great potential of multimodal sentiment analysis [43, 44] , future studies can conduct sentiment analysis on different modalities of data to improve the effectiveness of sentiment classification. Third, extra engineering tasks may be required before applying the findings of our work to the industry. Since current Chinese NLP corpora are still insufficient relative to the English corpora, we strongly recommend the construction of comprehensive corpora with higher quality, especially for informal social media text. If BERT-based models can be fine-tuned on such corpora in advance and exhibit robustness when encountering different types of text, plenty of practitioner effort can be saved.",

In this study, we introduce the MF technique with the aim of addressing this issue. We first apply BERT to 1,323,956 pieces of social media text and obtain sentiment time series for 16 keywords to represent the text modality. Along with the market indicator data, which reflect the numerical modality, the data are fed into a novel MF-LSTM model, where two parallel LSTM modules in the first layer learn from each modality of information and a shared representation layer fuses the abstract features acquired from the previous layer. Then evaluations from the technical perspective (the MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics) and the statistical perspective (the PT test and DM test) are leveraged to compare the prediction performance of our proposed model with that of nine baseline algorithms. The experimental results show the superiority of MF-LSTM in terms of both forecasting accuracy and error, demonstrating that it is feasible and effective to introduce MF into financial time series forecasting. Future studies can be conducted on various fusion strategies, optimization techniques, modal structures, modality selections, etc. We hope that our work may provide practical value for international trade practitioners, Forex market investors, and policy makers.",

Therefore, Twitter and Sina Weibo are elected as the data sources of our text modality. Twitter is an American microblogging platform. It provides some-tomany microblogging services that are more suitable for our study. Sina Weibo is the largest Chinese microblogging website. The original unprocessed dataset applied in this work contains 419,228 English tweets with 7 keywords and 912,363 Chinese microblogs collected from 1/1/2015 to 4/1/2021 via the official application programming interfaces (APIs) of these websites. The 9 total keywords are listed inTable 1(Mandarin keywords are translated into English in this table) Unfortunately, tradeoffs are made during the selection of keywords. For example, when searching \"USD/CNY\" on Twitter, we find too few results to reflect user opinions on each day. As a result, this word is replaced with \"Dollar Index\". Additionally, the search results of other keywords on Sina Weibo teem with noise (e.g., advertisements). Thus, after conducting data processing, only 2 keywords are preserved for our study. Nevertheless, these remaining keywords are all in accordance with the selection of market indicators.",
