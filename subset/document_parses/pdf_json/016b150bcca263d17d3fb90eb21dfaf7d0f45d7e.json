            "text": "Nothing encapsulates the drama, tension and acrimony of junior cycle reform more than the debate about proposed changes in assessment. Even before the change was formally introduced in Minister Quinn's Framework for Junior Cycle (DES 2012), long-standing positions were evident that did not bode well for a smooth implementation. That there was need to reform the curriculum and assessment was not in serious dispute. Concern about the form and function of assessment at junior cycle emerged in almost every review of curriculum since its introduction in 1989 and there was widespread criticism of the negative influence of assessment methods on curriculum, teaching and learning (CEB 1984a; OECD 1991; Government of Ireland 1992; NCCA 1999; Smyth et al. 2007 ). The changes proposed by the Department of Education and Skills (DES) in 2012 sought to rebalance that examinations system and give D. Murchan (*) School of Education, Trinity College Dublin, the University of Dublin, Dublin, Ireland e-mail: damian.murchan@tcd.ie teachers the opportunity to take more control over how their students are assessed, through introduction of some elements of school-based assessment (SBA) for certification purposes. Analysis of why teachers preferred to continue with external, centralised forms of assessment reveals assumptions and challenges underlying trends in many countries for greater teacher involvement in high-stakes assessment and for the need to ensure that policy takes adequate regard of local situational contexts and cultures, both educationally and socially.",

            "text": "Debate about assessment in Ireland is not new. Ireland has a long history of public education stretching back to 1831 in the case of primary schooling. Public secondary education came later, as did evaluation and certification, initially accompanied by a payment-by-results incentive system for primary and secondary teachers that did little to foster childcentred educational experiences for learners. Soon after establishment of the independent Irish state in 1922, the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate exams were introduced, without the payment-by-results. The Primary Certificate Examination was introduced in 1929, followed by the Group Certificate in 1947, at the end of two years vocational education. These and later iterations of the exams were to form the template for certification at second level right up to the present day. Over the decades, there were several changes in curriculum, but relatively little change in assessment. A study of the Leaving Certificate by Madaus and Macnamara (1970) queried the suitability of the exam on a number of grounds, including the reliability of results and over-emphasis on student memorisation of knowledge. One study of the Intermediate Certificate (Heywood et al. 1980) found similar issues and proposed the inclusion of more varied forms of assessment, including SBA. The recommendations were largely ignored but the report, authored by academics in the School of Education, Trinity College, reflected many of the proposals made decades later by the DES in 2012 and 2015. Despite consistent reservations amongst the research community about the suitability of existing assessment arrangements at secondary level, the system remained relatively unchanged until the emergency temporary arrangements for assessment put in place for junior and senior cycle in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (Murchan 2020a) .",

            "text": "Successful curriculum change needs to be systemic, accompanied by changes in teaching, learning, resources and assessment. Education systems are shaped by how society prioritises aims, purposes and methods at given points in time. Much of the current assessment architecture was developed to align with behaviourist views of learning and teaching prevalent in the mid-twentieth century. Newer sociocultural interpretations of learning and teaching require corresponding adjustments to assessment, without which there remains a disjoint between what and how students learn and how they are assessed (Shepard 2000) , a concern likely to apply equally to curriculum reforms in Ireland. Modern interpretations of assessment place it as an integral part of teaching and learning (Lysaght et al. 2019) . There was relative agreement on this in relation to junior cycle, where the concept of \"classroom assessment\" proved far less contentious than assessment as part of certification processes, the latter traditionally developed, administered and scored by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) rather than by teachers. As the debate about assessment of junior cycle achievement evolved, a key issue became the role of the SEC in externally grading students' work, or looked at another way, the role of teachers in assessment for certification. This suggests the need to take a sociocultural perspective that considers issues from the perspectives of different stakeholders, including teachers. Black and Wiliam (2005) highlight the influences of political, societal and cultural factors on assessment practice across different jurisdictions, influences that resonate with the junior cycle reform process in Ireland.",

This reform was well conceptualised, planned and research-led and seemed, at the outset, to enjoy widespread support. It was an ambitious agenda developed by people keen to see it succeed and included a commitment to large-scale professional development for teachers. And yet it became mired in controversy in relation to proposed changes in assessment, resulting in delay and significant change to the original plans. The initiative provides an interesting glimpse of scaled-up educational reform in practice, illustrating the complexity of reform and the ways in which policy proceeds through layers of scrutiny and amendments before emerging as embedded practice in schools and classrooms.",

For most examinees, it was a terminal exam marking the end of their formal education as they moved on to employment. A century later, enrolment patterns have changed dramatically, with almost the entire cohort completing junior cycle, consistent with an average enrolment of 95% in lower secondary education across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2019). Furthermore, over 90% of students in Ireland remain in school beyond junior cycle to complete the Leaving Certificate Examination (DES 2015b).",

            "text": "Some, but not all, education systems assess student performance towards or at the end of lower secondary education. Around the age of 16, students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for example, take the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE). This qualification offers students a range of subjects and recent reforms in England mean that much of the assessment is in the form of terminal exams scored by the awarding bodies on a scale from nine (the highest score) to one (the lowest). In France, students finishing lower secondary education may elect to be awarded the Diplome National du Brevet (DNB) at age 15. This qualification is based on performance in a number of subjects with grades coming from a combination of continuous assessment throughout Year 9 and some terminal examinations. However, as in Ireland, given the proportion of students proceeding beyond lower secondary education, \"the Brevet may be regarded as approaching obsolescence\" (Cros 2009, p. 16) . Salokangas et al. (Chap. 11, this volume) highlight practices in Finland and Sweden where assessment of student achievement in lower secondary education is conducted either entirely by teachers themselves or through teacher grading of state-developed national curriculum tests. Students in Singapore receive GCSE qualifications in the form of the Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level (GCE O-Level), an exam that largely mirrors the GCSE offered by Cambridge Assessment in the UK, with some greater local control by the Singapore Ministry of Education (SEAB 2020). Overall, internationally, there is varied practice in relation to the certification of student achievement at lower secondary level. Some systems such as Ireland and parts of Britain are quite centralised, either through national or approved awarding bodies, favouring externally marked examinations. Other systems leave such assessment and certification in lower secondary education to teachers and schools.",

Later that decade, a series of reports from the Public Examinations Evaluation Project (PEEP) recommended introduction of SBA by teachers as part of student certification (Heywood et al. 1980 ), but the reports, presented to the Minister, came to nothing in the prevailing educational policymaking of the time. Consultative reports from the fledgling Curriculum and Examinations Board (CEB 1984b (CEB , 1986 highlighted possible radical changes to assessment, but these did not survive the morphing of the CEB into the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) in 1987.

The revised junior cycle includes eight key skills, drawing on twenty-first-century competency models developed by the OECD (2001) and the European Union (2006) and on practices in a number of other countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand (Halbert 2011) . Despite much policy enthusiasm, widespread illustration of cross-curricular competencies in practice is difficult to find (Voogt and Roblin 2012) and the assessment of such learning \"remains the single biggest barrier to international efforts to integrate 21st century competences into school curricula\" (Lysaght et al., 2019, p. 20) . Assessing cross-curricular competencies using terminal, external exams poses particular conceptual, technical and logistical challenges. Another international influence was the relatively poor performance by Irish student on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2009, especially in Reading and Mathematics. This issue entered the policy and public debate just as the junior cycle review was reaching a crucial stage. Of the Irish sample in 2009, almost six in ten students were in 3rd Year (Perkins et al. 2010) , placing considerable spotlight on junior cycle. These results generated significant impact, prompting introduction of a national literacy and numeracy strategy (DES 2011) and informed decision-making in relation to junior cycle reform at the highest levels within the DES (Murchan 2018) . Part of the solution, according to the policymakers, lay in greater use of SBA in schools, in keeping with practice in a number of education systems that performed well in PISA. Systems such as Finland (ranked 3rd in Reading achievement in 2009 amongst all countries participating), Hong Kong (4th), New Zealand (7th) and Queensland (Australia 9th) were significantly above Ireland's ranking of 21 (OECD 2010) and were highlighted as systems where SBA played a positive role.",

Similarly, the term summative assessment is used for assessment of learning. Formative assessment is primarily focused at the individual student level and has as its primary function the improvement of student learning. Thus, the strategies that teachers typically use in class to check on students' understanding of a topic and help them in their work constitute formative assessment. So too do the increasing number of digital assessments that accompany learning materials, with a view to helping students achieve mastery of concepts. Such approaches aim to \"identify gaps between student understanding and intended learning outcomes and to adapt teaching and learning so as to close any gaps\" (Looney 2018, p. 129) . Research indicates that formative assessment benefits student learning, motivation, behaviour and ownership by students of their own learning with evidence of particular gains for low-achieving students (Black and Wiliam 1998; Wiliam 2011; Faragher 2014) . Additionally, assessment-rich classrooms foster more positive, dynamic and collaborative teacher-student interactions, lower levels of disruption in class and greater levels of teacher autonomy in relation to their own professional practice.",

Though summative assessment is frequently interpreted as based on exams, tests or other \"performance\" undertaken by students, it also includes teacher judgments of students' work based on indicators of quality relating to a wide range of student engagement and learning (e.g. homework, portfolio, project, group/class participation, etc.). Summative assessments have as their primary function the identification of students' present level of understanding, skill, performance and competence in relation to intended learning outcomes. Results of such assessments are frequently communicated in the form of marks, grades or descriptors, which when clearly understood by the relevant audience, provide succinct description of students' achievement, frequently in relation to the achievement of other students or groups of students. Benefits attributed to summative assessment include offering a fair and efficient method for grading students and providing motivation to students to engage with learning (Brown and Hattie 2012; Morris 2011) . In a review of 670 studies, Phelps (2012) found positive effects in relation to student motivation, active engagement with information, capacity to remember information, teaching strategies and alignment of teaching with curriculum specifications. He concluded that one hundred years' evidence suggests that testing increases achievement \u2026 [and that] ... studies finding positive effects on achievement exist in robust number, greatly outnumber those finding negative effects, and date back a hundred years. (pp. 39-40) In a similar vein, the OECD (2013) highlights four potentials of summative assessment:",

Outcomes from school-leaving exams with gatekeeping functions to college and employment are critical to students' life chances and to the reputation of schools in which they are enrolled (Isaacs 2018) . Therefore, despite the evidence that formative assessment promotes learning and the existence of policy initiatives to embed formative assessment in educational systems (OECD 2013) there is frequent tension between the formative and summative purposes of assessment in school (Harlen 2005; Looney 2011 ) with teachers frequently under pressure to ensure that students do well on high-stakes exams. Ratnam-Lim and Tan (2015) highlight the pervasive influence of high-stakes examinations in Singapore and the challenges faced by policymakers and teachers trying to introduce greater levels of formative assessment in classrooms. Similarly, policymakers in Hong Kong, another system with a high-stakes assessment culture, have struggled to promote formative assessment practices in schools (Berry 2011) . There are frequent complaints from teachers and students that the pressure of terminal exams and other summative assessments dominate curriculum, teaching, learning and assessment. This reflects concerns expressed about students' experience of junior cycle where pressure of the exam gradually led to a \"reduction in more engaging student-centred\" teaching and learning in favour of more didactic methods based on teaching-to-the-test (Smyth and Banks 2012, p. 300) . This was exactly the type of challenge underpinning Irish policymakers' view that \"unless the examination changes, nothing else will\" (NCCA 2011, p. 5).",

There were some elements of externally assessed orals, coursework and projects in some subjects, as outlined in Fig. 9 .2. Whereas projects and coursework were part of subjects, such as Religious Education (20% weighting) and Science (35%), concerns were expressed about the extent to which these reflected genuine engagement by students with learning outcomes as opposed to memorisation of procedures to include in project notebooks and reports. Given the perceived dominance of summative assessment, policymakers sought to make dedicated space for formative assessment in the revised programme. Initially termed classroom assessment (DES 2012, p. 20) , further revision introduced the nomenclature of an ongoing assessment (DES 2015a, p. 36) , with a focus on providing feedback to students, planning next steps in teaching and learning and improving teaching and learning. The proposals for formative assessment were generally welcomed, alongside calls for appropriate CPD for teachers. What generated more interest and controversy were proposals intended to provide evidence for certifying student achievement at junior cycle and reporting to parents. The 2012 proposals placed responsibility on schools themselves to assess and certify students, after a brief transition period where the SEC would be involved. Key aspects relating to assessment are included in Fig. 9 .3. Overall, the DES policy of 2012 differed in small but ultimately important ways from the proposals one year earlier from the NCCA (2011). The key points of difference were around (1) the exam component (externally set and marked under the NCCA proposals) and (2) moderation of the SBA (externally by SEC in the NCCA proposal). Over subsequent months and years, these changes became key to negotiation and acceptance of the reforms, especially by representatives of teachers, who argued that the changes were \"educationally unsound\" (TUI 2014) and that teachers \"cannot be advocate and judge\" for students and thus should not be responsible for assessing their own students (ASTI 2013, p. 24) . Several arguments were advanced by teachers, the most enduring of which centred on the need to retain public and parental confidence in the integrity of marks from junior cycle assessment and maintain existing relationships between teachers, students and parents. Overall, representatives of teachers queried the extent to which pubic trust in the impartiality of teachers could be maintained in a school-based assessment system used for junior cycle certification. Just as viewpoints differed across Introduction of standardised tests for Year 2 students in reading, mathematics and science Use of Classroom Based Assessment (CBA) (40%) to certify student achievement, internally moderated within school.",

This resulted in some closures of schools due to industrial action in 2016. Further negotiations and concessions, including the granting of 22 hours non-teaching time to teachers annually to enable them, in part, to engage with the SLAR process, eventually resulted in agreement just before students were to sit the first (English) exam under the revised junior cycle in June 2017.",

It was also planned to offer CPD to teachers and school leaders in advance of and during implementation (see Chap. 12 in this volume for details). With the final set of subjects introduced in September 2019, the first cohort of students to complete the full junior cycle, including assessment elements, will graduate in June 2022. As new subjects are examined for the first time, issues emerge. For example, based on sample papers provided by the SEC during 2019 teachers questioned the suitability of the Irish exam paper planned for administration to students in June 2020, an external exam that was cancelled, in any event, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Teachers also expressed reservations about junior cycle assessment that they believed focuses more on literature than the previous version where 40% of marks were awarded for an oral examination (\u00d3 Caollai 2019).",

            "text": "This chapter addressed the most contested aspect of junior cycle reform, analysing a dispute around assessment that threatened to derail the entire reform initiative. Topics in the chapter focused on a number of themes that relate assessment reform in Ireland to global trends in assessment. Assessment practices at lower secondary level in several education systems were reviewed, highlighting a diversity of practice. The case for reform of junior cycle assessment was analysed in relation to national and international influences. These included concerns articulated and sustained over a two-decade period that highlighted the adverse impact of the extant assessment system in terms of narrowing of teaching, learning and the curriculum itself. International influences were also reviewed, including the impact of Ireland's version of PISA shock in relation to the 2009 survey results in reading and mathematics and a perception that some education systems regarded as \"high performing\" incorporated elements of school-based assessment. The chapter also focused on the tensions that exist between formative and summative assessment and how this played out in the Irish context where disagreement about how student achievement would be certified side-lined serious discussion about the potential for assessment to facilitate students' learning. Contrasting views also emerged amongst different stakeholders on the appropriateness of school-based assessment for state certification purposes, an argument that teachers won. The story of reforming assessment at junior cycle has implications for reform at senior cycle, where the stakes are genuinely high for students, teachers and the system as a whole. Teachers are demanding that a full evaluation of the effectiveness of change at junior cycle be undertaken prior to any changes at senior cycle. Whereas it is difficult to predict the shape of eventual proposals at senior cycle, the lessons from the junior cycle and from the implementation of calculated grades to replace the 2020 Leaving Certificate exam due to COVID-19 (Murchan 2020b) suggest that they may be less ambitious. What this will mean for students as they negotiate their way towards the end of second-level schooling and on to higher education and/or employment remains to be seen.",
