            "text": "Background. Exosomes are defined as small membranous vesicles. After RNA content was discovered in exosomes, they emerged as a novel approach for the treatment and diagnosis of cancer. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), a kind of specific RNA transcript, have been reported to function as tumor growth, metastasis, invasion, and prognosis by regulating the tumor microenvironment in exosomes. This study aims at exploring the potential diagnostic of exosomal lncRNA in solid tumors. Methods. A meta-analysis conducted from January 2000 to October 2019 identified publications in the English language. We searched all relevant English literature from the Web of Science, EMBASE, and PubMed databases through October 1, 2019. The articles were strictly screened by our criteria and critiqued using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results. There were 28 studies with 19 articles (4017 patients) identified, including studies on gastric cancer, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer. A meta-analysis showed that the combined value of sensitivity in 29 studies was 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-0.78), and the combined value of specificity in the studies was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.78-0.83). This suggests the high diagnostic efficacy of liquid exosomes in cancer patients. It is statistically insignificant in terms of sex, ethnicity, and year. The diagnostic power of urinary system tumors was found to be higher than that of digestive system tumors by several subgroup analyses. Conclusions. We performed a meta-analysis and literature review of 28 studies that included 4017 patients with 10 malignant cancer types. Mechanistically, our study demonstrated that lncRNAs in exosomes could be a promising bioindicator for the diagnosis and prognosis of solid tumors. INPLASY Registration Number: INPLASY202060083.",

During the past century, there has been a dramatic development in cancer treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy [2] . However, the overall survival of malignant tumor patients is still unsatisfactory, and the diagnostic efficiency remains lower than desired, especially for advanced tumor patients. With the development of early diagnosis and treatment of cancer, we observed that an ideal biomarker could play a pivotal role [3, 4] . Thus, it is our primary goal to explore a new effective biomarker for early diagnosis, prediction of prognosis, and ideal therapeutic target for cancer patients.",

After RNA content was discovered in exosomes in 2007, they emerged as a novel approach for the treatment and diagnosis of cancer [7] . During the past 2 decades, many researchers have demonstrated that exosomes could contain various kinds of RNAs, including messenger RNAs (mRNA) [8] , microRNAs (miRNA) [9] , long noncoding RNAs [10] , and circular RNAs (circRNA) [11] . Exosomes in tumor cells have been found to activate specific tumor resistance responses and promote the occurrence and development of tumors [12] . Despite that, a large number of studies have reported that exosomes are involved in angiogenesis and metastasis, drug resistance, immune related, cytokines secretion, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and oncogenic cell transformation [13] . According to an investigation by Mudgapalli et al., exosomes could act as a messenger between the microenvironment and tumor cells that support leukemia growth, inducing oncogenic factors such as c-Myc [14] . In addition, serum-derived exosomes in primary prostate or prostate metastasis increase a high level of PKM2 expression, suggesting that exosomes could be a potential clinical biomarker in prostate cancer [15] .",

However, it was later found that ncRNAs play a functional role in carcinogenesis, tumor regulation, and gene expression [17] . Furthermore, lncRNA expression always demonstrates poor prognosis in several cancers, including lung cancer [18] , osteosarcoma [19] , bladder cancer [20] , ovarian cancer [21] , liver cancer [22] , gastric cancer [23] , hepatocellular carcinoma [24] , and breast cancer [25] . In these studies, there is an obvious connection between high-level expression of lncRNA and worse clinicopathological outcome, such as distant metastasis, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and drug resistance. For instance, high SNHG11 expression promotes metastasis and proliferation in colorectal cancer by targeting the Hippo pathway [26] . A study by Fang et al. reported that miR-223 could be mediated, as silencing by DLX6-AS1 promotes the progression of bladder cancer through the upregulation of HSP90B1 [27] . In another study, Xu et al. examined lncRNA PVT1, an oncogene that has been found to result in a poor overall survival in esophageal adenocarcinoma though high-level expression [28] . In addition, in our precious research, we demonstrated that the expression of lncRNA SNHG1 was significantly associated with worse clinical outcome [29] . Mechanistically, it has been reported to function as tumor growth, metastasis, invasion, and prognosis by regulating the tumor microenvironment.",

Most of the available literature on these biomarkers was focused mainly on ncRNAs in blood. In addition to these primary data, systematic studies on the prognosis biomarkers are still needed for further exploration. Now that researchers are aware of the significance of ncRNA in exosomes, the function of circRNAs in exosomes has already been reported as a suitable diagnostic biomarker for tumors, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma [30] .

The sample types were plasma in 5 studies, urine in 10 studies, and serum in 14 studies. In addition, there were 10 types of cancer, including bladder cancer ( BioMed Research International cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer. We also collected the information of exosomes that were included in the studies in Table 2 . This included the isolation method, exosome content, content number, exosomes diameter range (nm), median diameter (nm), evaluation (TEM and NET), and exosome proteins. Figure 1 , the outcomes of the QUADAS-2 study quality assessment indicated that the quality of the included studies was convincing. The QUADAS score is shown in Table 1 . The titles of all included documents are provided in Table 3 . We assumed that a score greater than 4 indicated a high-quality study and a score lower than 4 indicated a study with low quality. We included 8 poor quality studies and 20 better quality studies. Figure S2 . Most of the research fell in the middle, but 4 studies were outside, which also indicated that there may be heterogeneity between the included studies. Furthermore, we assessed the concordance between diagnosis on exosomal lncRNA and clinical histopathology by using the kappa statistic. The kappa statistic of all studies was 0.513, which shows that exosomal lncRNA is moderately accurate to diagnose solid tumors. Moreover, to further explore the concordance between diagnosis on exosomal lncRNA and clinical histopathology, we analyzed the kappa statistic in different types of solid tumors and different sample types. The concordance of blood samples (kappa statistic, 0.523) was better than that of urine samples (kappa statistic, 0.494). The concordance of digestive system tumors (kappa statistic, 0.542) was better than that of urinary system tumors (kappa statistic, 0.511).",

            "text": "BioMed Research International epithelial ovarian cancer-derived exomes in the coculture system, by transferring lncRNAs, restored the migration of endothelial cells which had been inhibited by TAM-derived exosomes through targeting the miR-146b-5p/TRAF6/NF-\u03baB/MMP2 pathway, which suggests that exosomal lncRNAs play a powerful role in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment [62] . Moreover, some studies have reported that exosomal lncRNA can regulate the tumor microenvironment to influence the invasion, growth, metastasis, and prognosis of tumors [63, 64] . Other research has also found that exosomal lncRNA can induce angiogenesis in cancer cells and affect tumor prognosis, growth, and invasion [65, 66] . Pan et al. also found that exosomal lncRNA was additionally related to lymphatic metastasis in gastric cancer patients [67] , which showed that tumors can indirectly enhance cellular migration and invasion abilities through exosomal lncRNA. Moreover, some studies have revealed that exosomal lncRNA plays a key role in the acquired drug resistance in some cancers [68, 69] . Takahashi et al. found that LINC-ROR, derived from tumor cells, was enriched in the extracellular vesicles, which can lead to an increased level of chemoresistance in hepatocellular cancer cells. This suggests that hepatocellular cancer cells may use exosomal lncRNA to improve chemoresistance [70] . The potential biological mechanisms of exosomal lncRNA are summarized in Figure 9 . Moreover, one of the most significant previous findings in exosomes for our report is that exosomes demonstrated a cargo biological function to deliver a number of molecules, such as drug, ncRNAs, and mRNAs [61] . Therefore, this special biological feature has led to many questions and a need for further investigation. Further work needs to be done to establish whether exosomes are involved in malignant tumor invasion as well as migration. Moreover, because of the specificity [71] , stability [72] , and accessibility [73] , we can not only use exosomes to diagnose solid tumors but we can also apply them to gene therapy.",
