However, the policymakers have been working hard to mobilize the movement of essential goods and services considering its importance in containing the pandemic. It signifies how important the establishment and maintenance of logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) operations are, both during the containment and the successive periods. Motivated with the paramount importance of LSCM operations during the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) across the globe, this paper critically reviews the existing literature closely related to it. The main aim is to identify and enhance the understanding of the logistical characteristics that play a vital role during pandemics. The selection of the literature was done using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology. The classification of the selected literature was done using a tripartite framework. Results show that researchers have focused mostly on \"Post-event\" (48.24%) management of logistical operations followed by the \"Pre-event\" (31.76%) and least in the \"Integrated\" (20%.) approaches. Furthermore, the analysis of the results provided useful insights that are discussed in detail. Also, twelve key areas have been identified that need due attention to improve the overall efficiency of the LSCM operations. We believe that the findings from this paper would be useful to the decision-makers and other stakeholders, as far as, maintaining efficient LSCM operations during as well after the pandemics are concerned.",

            "text": "On 31 December 2019, a novel viral disease called coronavirus caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in the capital of Hubei province, the most populous city of Central China, Wuhan (WHO 2020a). In a couple of months, COVID-19 spread to a growing number of countries (mainly Europe and the United States) outside China. This spread was so rapid and massive that on 12 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a pandemic (WHO 2020b). As of 12 October 2020, Johns Hopkins University's dashboard (CSSE 2020) update showed that the total number of reported and confirmed cases across more than 212 countries, territories, and international conveyances (WHO 2020c) have crossed 37,481,821 taking the death toll to 1,076,818. The increased urbanization and population densities could act as a catalyst to the spread of COVID-19. In response to these challenges in the prevailing situations, most of the countries declared nation-wide lockdowns, banning the foreign, domestic, as well as local travels. Compared to the initial phase of COVID-19, when the focus was primarily on medical aspects, the attention has now shifted towards the social, economic, and sustainability impacts (Gautam and Hens 2020) .",

To contain such diseases, it is important to respond promptly by the deployment of manpower at a hierarchical level and ensure the smooth flow involving transportation as well as the distribution of essential commodities that include medicines, other medical supplies, groceries, etc. The efficiency of all the logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) operations especially during pandemics, therefore, has a crucial role to play (Arinaminpathy and McLean 2009; Jennings et al. 2008) . The importance of maintaining efficient LSCM has also been recognized by the world's leading organizations like WHO. In the Activity Report by WHO (2012) , the importance of logistical issues have been addressed in the following manner: \u2026to provide operational assistance in the ongoing management of logistics required for epidemic and pandemic preparedness and response and the rapid deployment of medical and laboratory supplies, transport, communications as well as the rapid deployment of outbreak response teams.",

In this research, SCOPUS and PubMed databases were used to search the literature using \"Advanced Search Options\" recommended in TR-Circular E-C194 (Avni et al. 2015) . It is worth mentioning that the research related to control of the epidemic/pandemic is quite vast; therefore, it was necessary to set out some boundaries in the first place. Considering this, the research focused on those areas of LSCM operations that incorporated the decision-making processes in one way or the other. In Stage-2, the titles and abstracts of the documents collected in the previous stage were screened. Further, in Stage-3 the documents found relevant in Stage-2 were checked in detail for relevance and appropriateness. Finally, in Stage-4, the final set of documents were finalized which were critically reviewed.",

This classification is based on context-specific characteristics such as bioterrorism, natural outbreaks, and disease repercussions. It is noteworthy that in some of the selected literature, although the LSCM related to the epidemic/pandemic was addressed, there was no specific mention regarding the context. That literature was grouped into the \"assorted\" category. Finally, in Level-3, tertiary classification is applied which is based on the methodologies and attributes of LSCM operations towards the optimization (solution) approaches. Figure 2 shows the distribution of finalized documents according to the tripartite framework.

            "text": "Many decision-making issues related to LSCM arise during the containment period of an epidemic/pandemic. These issues are primarily related to facilities, their location and capacities, selection and deployment of transportation as well as distribution modes, and replenishing the stock capacities across the whole supply chain. Several research works have addressed these issues. Beeler et al. (2011) developed a discrete-event simulation model while considering various factors like crowdedness, staffing levels, and the percentage of infectious individuals entering the health care facilities. Huang et al. (2010) and Jia et al. (2007a, b) proposed several solutions related to facility locations. The solutions provided in their research were based on the models like P-median and P-centre, various heuristic, and dynamic programming approaches. Berman and Gavious (2007) formulated the problem as a game between the state and the terrorist which they solved using a combination of mathematical programming and game theory. They, in their research, considered the cost incurred in setting up the system and cost incurred in taking the required preventive measures. Murali et al. (2012) solved the problem based on the maximal covering location using loss function and locate-allocate heuristics by considering the distancesensitive demand and uncertainty in the demand. A stochastic programming model, based on a multi-objective approach, was utilized by Wang et al. (2009) to scrutinize the issues of stockpiling and dispensing activities. The solution of the model was generated through an algorithm that was based on Monte-Carlo simulations. Similarly, Ke and Zhao (2008) and E. K. Lee et al. (2009b) used dynamic programming and simulation models to solve the issues related to the distribution of essential supplies to the affected population. In these studies, various logistical constraints and issues concerned with transshipment between the dispensing points were taken into consideration, respectively. Herrmann et al. (2009) presented a delivery volume improvement technique that aids in formulating solutions considering routing and scheduling parameters. Liu and Zhao (2009) also provided a numerical simulation-based solution to the distribution of essential commodities during emergencies considering the length of route and time window as the objective functions. Liu et al. (2011) introduced a distribution model focussing on the delivery style and the delivery network of dispensing personnel, the optimization (solution) to which was obtained employing a genetic algorithm. Likewise, some researchers have worked towards solving the vehicle routing issues that arise during emergencies. For example, Shen et al. (2009) divided the vehicle routing issues into 2 stages-planning stage and operational stage. It is equally important to reduce the radius of emergency response during bioterrorist attacks and considering the replenishment policies have proved useful (Zhao and Sun 2008) . Hu and Zhao (2011) studied the dynamic approaches related to the replenishment policies that arise within LSCM operations during bioterrorist attacks.",

            "text": "Stockpiling of essential commodities during the epidemic/pandemic is a logistical constraint (Arinaminpathy and McLean 2008) and therefore needs to be accounted for in the LSCM models. Stockpiling at central levels is less efficient during emergencies if not integrated with stockpiling at the local levels (Harrington and Hsu 2010) . Cinti et al. (2005) have provided a strategic action plan for stockpiling medicines at local levels such as hospitals. Stockpiling of essential medical supplies is considered to be a cost-effective strategy in the case of pandemics (Dhankhar et al. 2009 (Dhankhar et al. , 2010 . For example, V. J. Lee et al. (2006a, b) and Lugn\u00e9r and Postma (2009) used cost-effective approaches for stockpiling the essential medical supplies like antiviral drugs that are required during the pandemic outbreaks. A promising cost-benefit ratio can be attained if stockpiling is managed either as a therapeutic measure or as short-term preventive healthcare for exposed contacts (Balicer et al. 2005) . The stockpiling decisions of an organization are not only dependent on the uncertainties in the system but also on the coordination with other partner organizations (DeLaurentis et al. 2009 ). Reducing the procurement costs and increasing the shortage penalty optimizes the stockpiling requirements in emergencies (Adida et al. 2011; DeLaurentis et al. 2008 ). Siddiqui and Edmunds (2008) proposed a decision analytical model to solve stockpiling issues related to drugs and near-patient testing for the United Kingdom. Liu (2007) developed a mathematical model to estimate the stocks required in case of an emergency like an epidemic outbreak. Likewise, Tebbens et al. (2010) considered various constraints, for example, those linked with capacity, associated risks, and filling the stockpile. They, in their research, proposed a mathematical framework that optimizes the stockpiling activities. Apart from these works, some studies have estimated the capacities of health-care centers (Radonovich et al. 2009 ), while others have estimated the number of personal protection kits (PPKs) required in case the pandemic outbreak occurs (Hashikura and Kizu 2009; Rebmann et al. 2011) .",

            "text": "During the control phase of the epidemic/pandemic, logistical concerns comprise the configuration of the premises chosen to act as additional surrogate dispensing centers, patient flow management, and capacity preparation. A suite of strategies considering a reasonable level of effectiveness, time frame and resource constraints are useful in forming the robust planning framework for decision-makers (Miller et al. 2006 ). Contrary to this, poor control phase planning during emergencies may lead to frail decisions which, in turn, cause confusion and delayed responses (Aaby et al. 2006 ). This reduces the overall efficiency of the system and increases the potential number of fatalities. The simulation tools are quite beneficial in determining the optimum staff requirements for initial screening, triage operations, medical evaluation, and drug dispensing stations during the control phase (Hupert et al. 2002) . Simulation tools are also useful in estimating the total time that patient stays in the system and the requirement of resources during emergencies (Patvivatsiri et al. 2007 ). These tools have been successfully applied to simulate other transmission diseases, for example, Porco et al. (2004) developed a continuous-time stochastic simulation model for smallpox transmission. Similarly, Whitworth (2006) utilized discrete-event simulation to strategize a response plan regarding traffic management, dispensing points, and staff scheduling intending to counter the anthrax attack. Hui (2010) developed a queuing model that was based on the time taken in the distribution of the essential supplies. To compare the emergency response during the outbreak of an epidemic/pandemic, Wein et al. (2003) proposed a mathematical modeling approach. They, in their study, considered a 2-stage queuing structure that consisted of transportation and dispensing of essential supplies and hospital care. A set of differential equations such as spatially distributed tandem queues were analyzed by Craft et al. (2005) . The primary concern of their analysis was to shed light on the distribution of medical supplies and health care facilities. Giovachino et al. (2005) used various computer modeling techniques to optimize the capacity of dispensing points Kaplan et al. (2003) . proposed a capacity planning tool by assessing the then-prevailing and alternate proposals for emergency responses. It has been observed that decision support systems and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) have also proven successful and have been utilized by some researchers (E. K. . For example, Richter and Khan (2009) utilized MCDA to evaluate the trade-offs between various dispensing strategies during an epidemic/pandemic outbreak.",

Here, \"qualitative\" refers to those studies which primarily focused on the LSCM operations concerned with the time during which quarantine or isolation programs are implemented (Barbera et al. 2001 ). While as, the \"quantitative\", refers to those studies that have developed comparatively more integrated frameworks to solve the issues of LSCM during epidemics/pandemics. For example, Y. M. Lee et al. (2009) proposed various modeling and computational tools that aid in providing robust LSCM operational planning during emergencies like a pandemic. Bravata et al. (2006) and Brandeau et al. (2008) evaluated the integrated response strategies during the bioterrorist attack using cost-benefit analysis. A dynamic compartmental model was developed by Zaric et al. (2008) to evaluate the logistical and supply chain management issues concerned with transportation and distribution of essential commodities from national to local level, stockpiling capacities, and final dispensing to local populations. Likewise, some factors affecting LSCM operations during the epidemic/pandemic were studied by Hessel and EVM-Group (2009) . They, in their research, studied emergency healthcare infrastructure requirements, stockpiling aspects, and agreements between stakeholders concerning procurement and distribution of essential medical items. Apart from the factors studied in the aforementioned research works, other factors also affect the efficiency of the LSCM during the epidemics/pandemics (Collin and de Radigu\u00e8s 2009). For example Adu et al. (1996) , evaluated the efficiency of a cold supply chain for handling and storage factors. Similarly Moore et al. (1990) , studied the logistical barriers that arise in the displaced populations and migrants. Whereas, Hadler (2005) studied the ethical issues that are linked with LSCM operations.",

They are: (1) to reduce the rate at which vulnerable population gets infected, (2) to minimize the mortality rate of the infected population, and (3) to enhance the immunization of the population. To achieve these objectives, decision-makers and health policy-makers need to make some big decisions which include, but are not limited to, organizing quarantine programs, setting up isolation wards, launching vaccination camps, and partial/complete lockdown of a specific geographic region. For example, on 24 March 2020, the Prime Minister of India announced the nation-wide lockdown for 21 days (Economic Times 2020a) which was further extended (Economic Times 2020b) to 9 May 2020. Besides maintaining adequate sanitation facilities and law and order, the success of control measures, like these, demands equally efficient LSCM operations ensuring the smooth flow of essential commodities. This becomes an enormous challenge for authorities owing to the diversity of the entire hierarchy of stakeholders which include manufacturers, police, health departments, decision-makers, municipalities, etc. During the pandemic, it, therefore, becomes extremely important to work in coordination and come up with real-time solutions. Failing to do so, may crash the entire management system and may result in losing a huge number of precious lives (Brandeau et al. 2007 ).",

The nature of similarities between the two could be exploited by utilizing the knowledge and methods applied by the commercial supply chains in emergency supply chains.

Stage-1 (preparedness) aims at maintaining the reserve stocks of both medical as well as other essential commodities. It also aims at setting up emergency organizations and programs. For example, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was established in 2005 to spearhead and implement a holistic and integrated approach to Disaster Management in India. In recent research, Porter et al. (2020) found that setting up the emergency programs enhance the pandemic preparedness. Researchers have also developed several preparedness plans in case of an epidemic/pandemic outbreaks (Manley and Bravata 2009; Rebmann et al. 2007 ). Since 1999, WHO has also been regularly updating the preparedness plans for epidemic/pandemic outbreaks.

(2004) reviewed various surveillance systems that were used in the USA to detect and report the data during an outbreak. They demonstrated that the explicit understanding between the organizations involved is valuable in analyzing the complexity of the outbreaks. Lombardo et al.

Likewise, Krause et al. (2007) utilized an electronic surveillance system called SurvNet to capture the impact of outbreaks in Germany. The outbreak investigation stage is difficult to handle in case of pandemics. However, it is worth mentioning that focusing on contextspecific characteristics like target population, resource availability, etc. could be useful on practical ground.

Most of the research was found to be related to bioterrorist attacks and natural disasters. The possible reason for most of the research focused on bioterrorist attacks could be the anthrax attack in the USA that took place in the year 2001. Nevertheless, during a declared epidemic/pandemic most of the organizations come to halt but LSCM operations need to be more active than during normal times. Transportation and distribution of essential commodities from sourcing to end-users is the lifeblood during such times of crisis. The spread of epidemic as disaster repercussions remains a controversial issue and is possibly the reason for the lack of research in this area.",

The time frames in which the essential commodities need to be transported and delivered may also vary (Lee 2008) . Moreover, the facilities, equipment, and capacities required may not be the same. During COVID-19, for example, it is vital that the medical staff is provided with personal protection kits (PPKs) of the highest quality. This would not be the case of other non-contagious outbreaks. Hupert et al. (2004) categorize the mass prophylaxis due to the outbreak of epidemic/pandemic into the following 2 categories: (1) push approach, and (2) pull approach. In the \"push\" approach, the treatment is to be delivered at doorsteps or local facilities while as, in the \"pull\" approach, the infected population must be treated in hospitals. Therefore, tailoring the frameworks considering the nature of the outbreaks is essential. Moreover, to deal with mass prophylaxis, models based on multi-objective location-allocation problems integrating both, strategic as well as operational components are highly recommended (Pouraliakbarimamaghani et al. 2017) .",

Similarly, the elements like picking, packing, in-door handling, maintenance, and transshipment precautions call for equal importance. Also, the replenishment and trade-off policies should be given due consideration as the stock capacities are limited and could be a major issue in case the epidemic/pandemic extends for a longer period.

Containment strategies involve the public as well as private organizations, pharmaceutical as well as nonpharmaceutical personnel, law enforcement as well as transportation and LSCM departments, researchers as well as practitioners, among many others. These need to come under one roof and work in coordination (Manley and Bravata 2009) . It is further validated by the fact that decision in one sector affects the execution part in the other and vice-versa. The coordination of the public is equally important for the success of containment efforts. It has been observed that lack of coordination is seen more in situations like epidemic/pandemic outbreak, owing to uncertainty, and this results in poor execution works.

Framing the LSCM network system without considering the replenishment parameters makes it weak, and therefore, these parameters are essential to be incorporated.

(7) Developing indicators: continuous evaluation and assessment of LSCM operations are necessary as it keeps a track of the implemented plans. Developing indicators or indices could simplify things and aid in otherwise complicated tasks.
