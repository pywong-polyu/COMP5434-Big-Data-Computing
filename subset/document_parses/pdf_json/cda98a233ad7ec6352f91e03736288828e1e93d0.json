Scholars and policymakers worldwide are working to lessen the impact of climate change [1] [2] [3] . In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, the scientific community revealed that greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) have escalated over the past few decades in spite of an increasing number of efforts to solve this issue [4] . The numerous harmful effects of climate change include the melting of ice sheets, increasing sea levels, and dangerous weather events as a result of severe heat waves. Similarly, land degradation, water scarcity and pollution, pose threats to future generations in terms of hunger and food security; thus, urgent attention should be demanded [1, 4] .",

One significant example is the substantial impact of food choices and consumption patterns on climate change [2, 5, 6] . Prior studies have shown that dietary choices have a substantial effect on the environment [7] and are considered a key strategy to mitigate climate change [4, 8] . In particular, food consumption accounts for a significant amount of GHGEs [3] . Prior studies have also found that food production processes contribute to GHGEs by 20-30% [5, 9] . Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that minimizing meat consumption by substituting organic and vegetarian food has decreased the GHGEs in Sweden and China [9, 10] . This is because meat generates higher emissions per unit of energy due to the energy lost at each trophic level compared with plant-based foods [7] . Hence, the relationship between food intake and climate change are evidenced in prior studies, e.g., [1, 2, 4, 5, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Information explaining the study objectives and the target population was included on the first page of the questionnaire. The first page of the questionnaire also confirmed voluntary and confidential participation in the study. Signed online consent forms were obtained from all participants prior to data collection. The survey was anonymous, there was no collection of sensitive information, and the participants were able to leave at any point if they felt uncomfortable. The questionnaire was composed of three sections: sociodemographic characteristics of the participants (that is, sex, age, nationality, marital status, education level, occupation, and household monthly income), understanding of, and concern over climate change, and dietary choices.",

Five options were provided: (1) \"an increase in sunspot activity and solar radiation,\" (2) \"a change in the axial tilt of the Earth,\" (3) \"an increase in population growth, energy consumption, and exploitation of nature,\" (4) \"an increase in the greenhouse gas concentration of the atmosphere due to human actions,\" and (5) \"a natural fluctuation of climate periods on Earth.\" Based on the IPCC report [24] , alternatives 3 and 4 indicated sufficient understanding resulting in a score of 1, whereas alternatives 1, 2, and 5 indicated a poor understanding of climate change resulting in a score of 0. Furthermore, two questions were asked to assess the degree of concern over climate change. The first question was, \"How serious of a threat do you think climate change is to humankind?\" The choices were (1) \"a very serious threat,\" (2) \"quite a serious threat,\" (3) \"not a serious threat,\" (4) \"not a threat at all,\" and (5) \"I do not know.\" Alternatives 1 and 2 indicated a high level of concern, whereas alternatives 3, 4, and 5 indicated low concern over climate change. The second question was, \"What are the possible future effects of climate change in Saudi Arabia?\" The choices included (1) \"hotter temperatures,\" (2) \"more rain and floods,\" (3) \"colder temperatures,\" (4) \"rise in sea level,\" (5) \"loss in animals and plants,\" (6) \"no effect,\" and (7) \"I do not know.\" Alternatives 1 to 5 indicated a high level of concern, while alternatives 6 and 7 indicated low concern over climate change. The answers that reflect high levels of concern were given a score of 1 and the sum of scores for the two questions was calculated for all participants.",

Likewise, approximately half of the study participants (45%) stated that they understood the term climate change, and 39% said they understood it to some extent. In contrast, only a small percentage (16%) said they did not know what climate change meant. In addition, 77% of the participants believe that human activity is largely responsible for climate change, while 10% believe that human activity is not responsible for climate change and a further 13% are unsure whether human activity is responsible or not (Table S1 ). Overall, 45% of the study participants demonstrated a sufficient understanding of climate change and 55% exhibited a poor understanding. Approximately 56% of study participants displayed a high level of concern over climate change and 44% exhibited low concern. Climate change understanding and concern scores stratified by sociodemographic characteristics are presented in Table 2 . Regarding the climate change understanding score, there were significant differences between males and females (p < 0.0001), where males displayed a higher understanding score (0.71 \u00b1 0.45) compared with females (0.31 \u00b1 0.46). There were no significant differences in the climate change understanding score between participants in different age, nationality, marital status, education, occupation, and monthly income groups. Regarding the concern over climate change score, males demonstrated significantly greater concern over climate change scores (1.59 \u00b1 0.70) compared with females (1.35 \u00b1 0.69; p = 0.01). Additionally, participants with a postgraduate degree demonstrated the greatest concern about climate change scores compared with the other two educational groups (p = 0.006). There were statistically significant differences in concern over climate change scores between participants in different income and occupational groups (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). Participants working in the public sector and with a monthly salary between SAR 7000 and 12,000 exhibited the highest level of concern over climate change scores. There were no significant differences in concern over the climate change score between participants in different age, nationality, and marital status groups. Table 3 displays participants' intake of selected food items according to their understanding of the climate change score. The participants were categorized as low (n = 154) and high (n = 126) according to their understanding of the climate change score. There was a significant positive association between understanding of climate change score and vegetable oil intake when comparing participants with high scores (3.26 \u00b1 1.07) to those with low scores (3.00 \u00b1 1.01; p = 0.009). Additionally, participants in the high score group consumed more vegetables (3.47 \u00b1 0.98) compared with participants in the low score group (3.31 \u00b1 0.96) after adjustment (p = 0.01). There were no significant differences between the intake of fruits, French fries, potatoes, rice, red meat, poultry, milk, low-fat cheese, other cheeses, butter, margarine, soy products, and organic food, and understanding of climate change score. Participants' intake of selected food items according to their concern over climate change scores is presented in Table 4 . Participants were categorized according to their concern over climate change scores into low (n = 123) and high (n = 157) groups. Higher scores for concerns about climate change were negatively associated with the intake of red meat (p = 0.0001), poultry (p = 0.003), margarine (p = 0.02), and soy products (p = 0.04). The intake of red meat, poultry, margarine, and soy products among participants in the high score group were lower (2.71 \u00b1 0.95, 3.17 \u00b1 0.88, 2.15 \u00b1 1.04, and 1.82 \u00b1 0.97, respectively) than that in the low score group (2.98 \u00b1 0.74, 3.38 \u00b1 0.65, 2.38 \u00b1 1.25, and 2 \u00b1 1.07, respectively). There were no significant differences between the intake of fruits, vegetables, French fries, potatoes, rice, milk, low-fat cheese, other cheeses, butter, vegetable oil, and organic food, and concern over climate change score. Overall, the participant intake of non-climate-friendly food was higher than that of climate-friendly food (2.93 \u00b1 0.56 and 2.58 \u00b1 0.60, respectively). Table 4 .

However, a study in Guyana found no significant difference between both sexes in their understanding of climate change [23] . Scientific evidence has indicated sex differences regarding obtaining health knowledge and adopting healthy behaviors since females are more conscientious and more likely to seek reliable health information [35, 36] . Our results can be explained by the fact that the males were more educated and older than the females in this study; 40% of males were postgraduate degree holders, whereas only 28% of females held a postgraduate degree. In addition, 39% of males in the study were 40-59 years of age, whereas 35% of females were 18-29 years of age.

Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that a higher income is associated with a greater concern about climate change.

These results corroborate with those of previous studies, demonstrating that concerns about the environment are associated with sustainable behaviors, such as increasing eco-friendly product consumption [1] . Specific food item consumption and production are a primary cause of GHGEs [40] . Previous research indicated that animal products, such as red meat, poultry, cheese, and butter are associated with high GHGEs, whereas fruits, vegetables, and margarine are associated with low GHGEs and can thus be considered climate-friendly food items [25, 31, 40] . A study in Finland illustrated that individuals who demonstrated sufficient knowledge about climate change exhibited a higher intake of fruits, vegetables, vegetable oils, organic foods, and soy products. The study also indicated that individuals with a high level of concern over climate change consumed less red meat and French fries; however, they consumed more fruits, vegetables, vegetable oils, organic foods, and soy products [1] . These findings are consistent with our results, except for soy product and organic food intake; the consumption of soy products and organic foods was low in our study. Nearly half of the study subjects (48%) reported that they never consumed soy products or consumed them less than once per month in the last 12 months. The consumption of organic foods was also low; 20% of participants admitted that they never bought organic food, and 40% stated that they consumed organic food less than once per month in the last 12 months. One possibility for this finding is the higher prices of these food items in Saudi Arabia, particularly organic food.",

            "text": "Food and livestock production is the primary cause of environmental harm, since it typically consists of excess water use and deforestation [4] . For example, the production of meat and dairy products is responsible for 15-24% of GHGEs worldwide, which explains why climate change scientists consider these food items non-climate friendly [4, 35] . In the United Kingdom, one study indicated that reducing meat consumption decreased the production of GHGEs by 35%. In addition, eliminating food waste also decreased GHGEs by 12% [41] . Similarly, a study in the United States suggested that replacing meat with plant-based food effectively reduced GHGEs and improved human health [42] . Research demonstrated that vegan and vegetarian diets are highly associated with reduced GHGEs compared with a diet rich in meat (including fish) [43] . A study in Lebanon indicated that the western diet, which is rich in meat, dairy products, and processed foods, was highly associated with GHGEs. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in vegetables, fruits, and legumes, produced minor amounts of GHGEs [44] . Our results demonstrated that individuals with higher concern over climate change scores exhibited significantly lower red meat and poultry consumption. This implies that the effect of concern on individual behaviors, including environmental behaviors, may be higher than the effect of knowledge on behaviors that has been demonstrated in previous research [1, 45] . However, our results also showed that individuals with a higher concern of climate change score had no increase in the intake of vegetables. Indeed, previous studies reported that the population of Saudi Arabia had a generally insufficient intake of fruits and vegetables [46, 47] , which may be the reason for this finding.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated that reducing the consumption of red meat prevents coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and several types of cancers, in addition to decreasing the production of GHGEs [48, 49] . Chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease, obesity, hypertension, high blood lipids, and type 2 diabetes, are highly prevalent in Saudi Arabia [50] . Saudi Arabia ranked number 84 in the Global Climate Risk Index (2018) since it has many environmental challenges that place the Kingdom at great risk. These challenges include air pollution, restricted freshwater sources, coastal flooding, high rates of energy consumption, and high rates of CO 2 emissions per capita [51] . The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has implemented numerous strategies for climate change mitigation, including green building projects and sustainable transportation, such as light rail transit in Riyadh, Jeddah, Makkah, Madinah, and Dammam, as well as the Riyadh metro [51] . The \"Green Saudi initiative\" was launched in 2021 as part of the national 2030 vision. The initiative aims to increase vegetation cover and reduce land degradation, air pollution, and CO 2 emissions nationwide [52] . Regardless of the massive efforts of the Saudi government to mitigate climate change, the study indicated poor understanding and medium concern over climate change in the Kingdom. Therefore, enhancing the knowledge and concerns about climate change, increasing the intake of climate-friendly food choices, and reducing or replacing the intake of non-climate-friendly food among the population of Saudi Arabia can simultaneously benefit human and environmental health.",

Further, the results cannot be generalized to all Saudis, since the study was only conducted in one city. Future studies should include representative samples from all regions of the country. In addition, using an online survey to recruit study participants may introduce self-selection bias and non-probability sampling; however, the online survey was a safe way to collect the data for this study due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In particular, initiatives and campaigns that disseminate knowledge about individual dietary habits and their subsequent influence on the environment and public health should be increased. Further efforts should be made by the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture to increase Saudi population awareness of the benefits of sustainable consumption on the environment and to broaden their knowledge about their responsibility toward the environment. Businesses, as part of their social responsibility, should encourage green products, services, and operations to foster green consumption behaviors.

The extent to which human practices and behaviors have an impact on the environment, and specifically climate change, has been documented in the literature; choosing what to eat is one of them. In particular, dietary choices have an enormous impact on the environment and are important strategies to combat climate change. Hence, the current study investigates climate change awareness and concern in Saudi Arabia, as well as the association between these factors, social demographics, and dietary choices. Data were collected for this cross-sectional research using an online questionnaire. We retrieved 280 completed forms; 45% of the study participants had sufficient understanding of climate change, and 56% were concerned about climate change. Participants who understand climate change and are concerned about it are more likely to be male, have a medium-high monthly income, have a high education level, and work for the government. The findings also revealed that participants with a sufficient understanding of climate change ate more vegetables and vegetable oils, while those with a high level of concern for climate change ate less red meat, poultry, margarine, and soy products. Furthermore, the intake of nonclimate-friendly food was typically higher than the intake of climate-friendly food among the study participants. These findings are critical for encouraging people to adopt healthy behaviors and consume climate-friendly food to minimize the risk of climate change and improve public health. The current study contributes to the body of literature about climate change by investigating the relationship between food intake and its subsequent impact on the environment. As far as we are aware, this is the first study of its kind to measure Saudi citizens' awareness of the effects of climate change and its impact on their food choices. The findings of this study shed light on how citizens in Saudi Arabia perceive and believe in climate change. As a result, we have a better understanding of Saudi Arabians' perspective about climate change. It also lays the groundwork for future studies aimed at promoting healthy eating habits and reducing climate change in the country.",
