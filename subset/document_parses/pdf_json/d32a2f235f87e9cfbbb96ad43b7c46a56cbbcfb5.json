The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted separate emergency use authorizations (EUAs) to anti-spike monoclonal antibodies, including balmlanivimab with or without etesevimab and casirivimab with imdevimab for treatment of these patients. [1] [2] [3] These new treatment options for mild to moderate COVID-19 have shifted the recommendations from symptomatic management and strict isolation at home to having the patients access healthcare teams and facilities to receive monoclonal antibody infusions in the outpatient setting.",

The FDA EUA limits their use to \u226410 days of symptom onset. Patients who are eligible to receive the monoclonal antibody infusions are therefore early in their clinical disease, when they have high viral loads and are most likely in their highly infectious stage of illness. This situation has challenged many healthcare systems, including the Mayo Clinic, that were not equipped with dedicated COVID-19 outpatient infusion treatment facilities. Herein, we describe the critical importance of integrating infection prevention and control (IPAC) policies during the development and implementation of a safe monoclonal antibody infusion program.",

At the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, we transformed an existing outpatient clinic into an off-site, 16-room ITC that has the capacity to administer up to 60 monoclonal antibody infusions per day (assuming four 3-hour appointments). The existing outpatient clinic rooms were reformatted to ensure that it complies with IPAC standards. For example, the rooms were simplified for ease of cleaning, including the work stations, flooring (which was changed from carpet to vinyl), furniture (which was changed to vinyl-covered infusion chairs), and installation of sinks, as needed (Table 1) .",

Cleaning recommendations were enforced for surfaces with patient contact. Hospital grade disinfectants included in\"List N\" disinfectants for coronavirus as collated by the EPA were used.",

Upon arrival at the facility for their infusion appointment, we adopted a telephonic check-in process, wherein patients called the ITC desk directly instead of walking in for check in. The patients were asked to remain in their vehicles until a staff member escorted them to the ITC room. This procedure was intended to prevent patients from lingering in common areas and waiting rooms. All patients were required to wear a mask at all times upon arrival and after leaving the facility. We also adopted a \"no accompanying visitor\" policy in the building; accompanying visitors were advised to remain in their cars or were asked to return at end of patient appointment.",

Periodic checks by IPAC staff ensured adherence to strict policies and procedures. During the first 3 months of the program at the Mayo Clinic COVID-19 ITC, bamlanivimab and the combination of casirivimab and imdevimab were infused to 955 patients. To date, there have been no known reported COVID-19 infections among our staff, and we continue our strict adherence to these IPAC policies and procedures. ",
