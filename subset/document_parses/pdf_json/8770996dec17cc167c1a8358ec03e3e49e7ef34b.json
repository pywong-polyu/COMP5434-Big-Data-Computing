            "text": "Numerous studies have suggested the use of early warning signals (EWSs) of critical transitions to overcome challenges of identifying tipping points in complex natural systems. However, the real-time application of EWSs has often been overlooked; many studies show the presence of EWSs but do not detect when the trend becomes significant. Knowing if the signal can be detected early enough is of critical importance for the applicability of EWSs. Detection methods which present this analysis are sparse and are often developed anew for each individual study. Here, we provide a summary and validation of a range of currently available detection methods developed from EWSs. We include an additional constraint, which requires multiple time-series points to satisfy the algorithms' conditions before a detection of an approaching critical transition can be flagged. We apply this procedure to a simulated study of an infectious disease system undergoing disease elimination. For each detection algorithm we select the hyper-parameter which minimises classification errors using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. We consider the effect of time-series length on these results, finding that all algorithms become less accurate as the amount of data decreases. We compare EWS detection methods with alternate algorithms found from the change-point analysis literature and assess the suitability of using change-point analysis to detect abrupt changes in a system's steady state. 7 approaches a critical transition, such as increased autocorrelation, variance and 8 magnitude of fluctuations, due to the system's slow recovery from perturbations as its 9 dominant eigenvalue approaches zero. These statistical trends in time-series data serve 10 as early warning signals (EWSs) of critical transitions. EWSs can be generated in 11 real-time from time-series data and offer a computationally inexpensive technique for 12 monitoring the progress towards elimination. Moreover EWSs are model-independent, 13 in that they do not rely on empirically fitted models, and can be used to investigate : medRxiv preprint NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.",

            "text": "The field of change-point analysis is closely linked to the field of EWSs. 26 Change-point analysis relates to identifying when the probability distribution of a 27 time-series changes. Change-point analysis is used to identify when any abrupt change 28 occurs and provides methods designed to detect the timing of such event(s). The first 29 work in change-point analysis was in the 1950's [14, 15], motivated by designing a 30 method to automatically detect failures for quality control in manufacturing. This is a 31 classical problem for detecting abrupt changes in the statistical behaviour of an 32 observed signal, with extensive applications to climate modelling [16], network 33 security [17] and fraud detection [18]. It is broken into two types of change-point 34 analysis: offline, when the full data are available and we aim for the most accurate 35 detection of the change-point; and online, for real-time monitoring of change-points. 36 EWSs attempt to infer a single change point, where the system is undergoing a 37 bifurcation, using signatures of the CSD phenomenon [10, 19]. Manifestations of CSD 38 include changes in the variance and autocorrelation of the fluctuations of time-series 39 data as the system approaches a critical transition. Moreover, change-point analysis can 40 detect changes in the variance or correlation, by monitoring the probability distribution 41 describing the time-series data and predicting the most likely timepoint where the 42 change occurs. Thus change-point analysis can be used find when a change in an EWS 43 can be detected rather than detecting the transition itself. 44 These two areas, although studying related questions, have little overlap in the 45 literature. In some cases change-point analysis has been dismissed in the field of EWSs 46 as it does not offer an advanced detection of a bifurcation [20]. However, the offline 47 approach still offers the potential for predicting when a system underwent a bifurcation, 48 which many in the field of EWSs desire. Offline change-point methods can be used to 49 test the performance of EWS based techniques [21-23] and can provide an upper limit 50 to the diagnostic performance expected of a real-time detection method. 51 The only study which proposes using EWSs within a change-point framework is 52 Carpenter et al., [24] who implement an online change-point analysis (called Quickest 53 Detection) by detecting the statistical signatures of CSD. The Quickest Detection 54 method calculates the likelihood ratio for each data point and the ratio is updated as 55 each data point becomes available, this is known as the Shiryaev-Roberts (SR) 56 Procedure [25, 26]. To be implemented it requires the users to specify two probability 57 distributions which describe the data pre-and post-critical transition, as well as 58 specifying the detection threshold [27]. Establishing suitable choices for probability 59 distributions and threshold criterion can influence the result of the time-of-detection, 60 limiting the generality of the method [24].

            "text": "Many attempts have been made to identify indicators of critical transitions in real 2 systems. For infectious disease systems, criticality typically occurs when the basic 3 reproduction number equals 1. Research has shown that infectious disease systems 4 undergo the phenomenon of Critical Slowing Down (CSD) when the basic reproduction 5 number, R 0 , crosses through the critical transition at R 0 = 1 [1] [2] [3] , reviewed in [4] . 6 CSD describes the changes in the statistical properties of time-series data as a system systems on the approach to a critical transition. 67 We compare a simple offline change-point analysis approach using the maximum 68 likelihood estimation with the Quickest Detection method and with three other methods 69 found in the EWS literature. We combine knowledge of CSD with change-point analysis, 70 to find the first time an upcoming bifurcation can be detected, applied to an infectious 71 disease system approaching elimination. In particular, the three methods we evaluate 72 for detecting a critical transition using EWSs are: 73 1. Exceeding two standard-deviations (known as 2-sigma). Drake & 74 Griffen [29] proposed that an EWS, or composite of EWSs, is significant if it 75 exceeds its long-run mean plus two long-run standard-deviations. The 76 time-of-detection is given by the first time the EWS exceeds this threshold. 77 2. The time changing p-value score of Kendall's \u03c4 statistic. Harris et al. [30] , 78 evaluate the significance (p-value) of Kendall's \u03c4 score of an EWS by using a 79 bootstrapping method to create a null distribution. This procedure is applied to Each method is designed for real-time implementation (e.g. an \"online\" framework), 89 where the EWSs are updated as new data are observed and a detection is triggered 90 when the threshold criteria is exceeded. These methods have previously been applied to 91 empirical studies, where the time of the critical transition was known and thus they 92 could report the \"lead-time\" of each EWS. The \"lead-time\" gives an indication of how 93 early on (prior to the transition) a change in the system could be anticipated, 94 quantifying the power of EWSs of critical transitions. 95 Evaluating the available methods found in the literature is needed to understand 96 whether there is a high false alarm rate, which would limit the potential for integrating 97 EWSs with public health systems. For disease elimination, it is crucial that features of 98 EWSs are not detected in data that are not undergoing a bifurcation, as this may lead 99 to disease controls being incorrectly lifted. Therefore a highly specific method is 100 essential. However, it is not necessary to have a large lead-time; instead of being used to 101 prevent a critical transition, EWSs could be used to confirm the path to elimination. In 102 contrast, for disease emergence, it is preferred to identify all possible cases which could 103 lead to an epidemic or pandemic even if they are incorrect (i.e. high sensitivity) and 104 ideally a method which gives a large lead-time so that there is enough time for control 105 measures to be implemented and alter the course of the disease. 106 We evaluate each method on the same simulated epidemiological time-series data, for 107 synthetic data that are: (1) at steady state and unchanging, (2) approaching disease 108 elimination but levels off just before and (3) undergoing disease elimination. The first 109 two data types represent two different null datasets, where we do not want to identify a 110 bifurcation, with the second null dataset being more realistic. The purpose of this study 111 is to validate each detection method and compare their performance. Some of the suitability under these circumstances. Therefore, we test each method for different 117 lengths of time-series data, to provide quantitative evidence for which method performs 118 best for varying amounts of data. 119 The 2-sigma method has been previously adapted by Clements et al., who found 120 that by monitoring when two consecutive timepoints crossed the threshold (rather than 121 1), the frequency of false positive detections significantly decreased from 13% to 7% [32] . 122 We extend the idea of a consecutive point strategy to all of the online detection 123 methods we consider. We present a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to 124 evaluate the \"best\" number of consecutive points, which we define as the number of 125 consecutive points which minimises the classification error. We validate each method 126 using a single point and measure the increased sensitivity and specificity when a 127 constraint on the number of consecutive points is considered. Using the consecutive 128 signal approach, we compare the first time disease elimination can be detected and the 129 lead-time for each detection method and discuss the suitability of detecting disease 130 elimination with these methods. 131 Methodology 132 Below we describe the three EWS based methods in detail, followed by the two 133 change-point analysis based methods (summarised graphically in Fig. 1-4) . The colours 134 used in Fig. 1-4 highlight similarities between the different methods. Red shaded boxes 135 describe the input of the time-series data; green shaded boxes describe the calculation of 136 a composition of EWSs (if applicable) and blue shaded boxes present the calculation of 137 the time-of-detection for each methodology. In addition, we have provided open-source 138 Python code located at https://github.com/ersouthall/Time-of-detection, 139 which can be used to implement the detection algorithms found in this section and 140 reproduce all results in this paper. 141 Normalised Composite (2-sigma threshold) 142 Drake & Griffen first introduced the idea of anticipating a bifurcation with EWSs using 143 a detection-based method [29] . They discussed taking a composition of normalised 144 EWSs and detecting a critical transition when the composition crossed two 145 standard-deviations (2\u03c3). This method was initially applied in an experimental study, 146 to detect the onset of environmental deterioration and offered a 110 day lead-time of the 147 bifurcation [29] . Since, it has been implemented to a number of systems to detect: 148 population collapse [33] , recovery of a ecosystem [32] and the emergence of 149 COVID-19 [34] , although it has not been formally tested with a simulated control 150 environment [35] .",

Here, a bootstrapping 177 technique is proposed, which preserves the original features of the observed data and 178 can be used to create the null distribution.

We find that when testing the logistic transform method with data from 224 different settings, such as with a lower population size or a smaller initial number of 225 infections, the weights are not appropriately scaled for the testing data. Instead, we 226 normalise the training data using a z-score standardisation of EWSs, equivalent to 227 Drake & Griffen's long-run standardisation (see Fig. 1 ). A standardisation of EWSs 228 allows the weights to be independent of the data scale and greatly improves the 229 generality of the logistic transform method. 230 We generate the training dataset using the same SIS dynamics as the test dataset 231 (described in Supplementary Methods S1). While, Brett & Rohani implemented their 232 method for disease emergence [31] , they demonstrated that the same weights could be 233 used for the emergence of pertussis, mumps and even plague. Here, by evaluating the 234 obtained weights with a training dataset which has the same SIS dynamics as the 235 testing dataset, we are assessing the best predictive performance of the logistic classifier. 236 We only train the classifier using data of length 100, which assumes that the weights 237 will be independent of sampling or length of the time-series.

The data and code used to run these simulations can be found at 334 https://github.com/ersouthall/Time-of-detection. 335 We evaluate each detection method using the same testing data of Ext, Fix and 336 NExt simulations. We sample the original time-series (of length 500) and consider how 337 the detection methods perform for different lengths of available data. In particular, we 338 consider four different lengths of time-series: 20 timepoints, 50 timepoints, 100 339 timepoints and 250 timepoints.

This constraint removes scenarios when an anomalous timepoint, 353 or isolated timepoints, are observed above the threshold but the majority lie below.

However, an analysis 361 on the \"best\" number of consecutive points has not been conducted. In particular, the 362 most suitable number of consecutive points may depend on the length of the time-series; 363 the EWSs considered; the time-series data available (e.g. incidence or prevalence); the 364 system's dynamics (e.g. rate of elimination) and the detection method used. 365 We extend the proposal of using multiple consecutive points to examine the optimal 366 number of consecutive points, which we find by minimising classification errors for each 367 detection method. We examine the consecutive signal approach for all methods which 368 use a threshold: 2-sigma composite, changing p-value, logistic transform and quickest 369 detection. Error rates can be visualised by ROC curves [47] . ROC curves are 370 constructed by measuring the sensitivity and specificity of each EWS at different 371 threshold values. To minimise classification errors, we present discrete ROC curves for 372 each EWS and find the threshold (number of consecutive points) which maximises the 373 power metric from these curves. The performance of each detection algorithm is 374 measured by the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve. An AUC score of 1 375 will indicate that the algorithm correctly detected an EWS in all Ext simulations, and 376 that there was also perfect specificity (no false detections were reported in the null 377 datasets). We study the ratio of consecutive points of the dataset and whether there is 378 a general trend in the best number of consecutive points by percentage of the 379 time-series length. In particular, we consider if any significant issues arise when 380 implementing the methods on shorter time-series.",

            "text": "Although the quickest detection method performs best when comparing the power 432 metric, we show that when only the first 80% of the time-series is analysed (i.e. data 433 prior to the critical transition at t * = 80) the power metric drops and the quickest 434 detection method is no longer suitable ( Fig. 7(b) ). The power metric reduces for all 435 detection methods when only considering data up to the bifurcation point (see Fig. S2 ), 436 however this is the most severe for the quickest detection. This implies that the 437 time-of-detection for the quickest detection method is delayed (post bifurcation) for 438 nearly all 500 simulation sets and that the method is detecting disease elimination 439 rather than an advanced indication that R 0 is crossing through 1 due to a change in the 440 variance. As such, there is little lead-time with this method, as it does not provide an 441 early signal of the bifurcation. In comparison, the 2-sigma method also worsens 442 (although more mildly) suggesting that the time-of-detection for some simulations occur 443 after the bifurcation point. The logistic composite is the least impacted, implying that 444 the logistic composite method gives the largest lead-time. In particular, with the 445 2-sigma method, we find that the composite CV+Va has a fairly strong power metric, 446 although it is not as robust at CV (Fig. 6(a) ), however when using just 80% of the 447 time-series, CV+Va outperforms the other composites ( Fig. 7(a) ).

This 484 is summarised across all EWSs for each detection method in Fig. S3 . In general, we 485 observe that for quickest detection, the best number of consecutive points is less than 486 5% of the time-series and that for both null datasets, quickest detection achieves an 487 AU C \u2265 0.9 except for a time-series of length 20 (Fig. S3(a) , 0.55 \u2264 AU C \u2264 0.9) -488 agreeing with Fig. 8 and Fig. 6 . Similarly, for the 2-sigma composite method, there is a 489 clear general trend with the best number of consecutive points being between 5 \u2212 10% 490 of the time-series; however as found in Fig. 8 , the AUC score is less concentrated and 491 some compositions perform poorly. For the logistic method a higher number of 492 consecutive points are optimal, with the general trend suggesting between 10 \u2212 25% of 493 the time-series length. However, some composites perform best with over 30%. There is 494 not a general trend across time-series lengths for Kendall's \u03c4 p-value method, with 495 results ranging from 1 \u2212 50%. As such, the biggest disadvantage of this method is that a 496 large number of points are required to cross the threshold in order to minimise the 497 classification errors. This is an impractical constraint and limits the potential of this 498 method to be used in real-time. 499 We consider the EWS (or composite of EWSs) which achieves the highest AUC for 500 each method and compute the time-of-detection of each simulation set. We evaluate the 501 time-of-detection using the consecutive points strategy, where we use the best number of 502 consecutive points for each EWS which we found during the ROC analysis. In particular, 503 we examine the CV using 12 consecutive points with the 2-sigma method; the CV using 504 5 consecutive points with Kendall's \u03c4 p-value method; the InD using 21 consecutive 505 points with the logistic composite method and the quickest detection method with 506 A = log(100) \u2248 4.5 using 6 consecutive points. Additionally, we implemented the MLE 507 method, which is a retrospective method and cannot be considered in real-time. 508 We find that with the 2-sigma method, the time-of-detection is on average just after 509 the critical transition (no lead-time), with a mean time-of-detection of 82.2 for the Ext 510 simulations (blue distribution Fig. 9(a) ). As we consider a 12 consecutive point strategy, 511 the points above the threshold begin on average at 70.22, thus, if a less strict constraint 512 is used, the time-of-detection will on average be before the critical transition. There are 513 few false detections with the steady state data (8 out of 500, shown in the green 514 distribution) and 107 simulations of NExt data returned a false detection (purple 515 distribution). The false positive rate found with the 2-sigma method is much lower than 516 the high number of false positives returned with the other EWS based methods:",

Here, we showed that it is also possible to 597 distinguish disease elimination from a system of declining incidence which does not go 598 through a critical transition. We found that the 2-sigma method was the only method 599 which provided a robust and timely classification with this null dataset, although 600 performance depended on which EWS was used. In particular, the specificity of all 601 detection methods were markedly worse when using a more realistic null dataset. We 602 consistently found that change-point analysis based methods reduced the false positive 603 rate the most for both null datasets. However, we found that change-point analysis 604 based approaches did not provide a lead-time of the critical transition.

Thus, a 616 limitation of the quickest detection method is determining suitable distributions which 617 describe the detrended data. 618 We found that the most reliable detections occurred when a consecutive point 619 strategy was included. We demonstrated that by requiring multiple time-series points to 620 be observed above the detection threshold, the performance of all algorithms greatly 621 improved. The majority of false detections with the steady state data were sparse 622 isolated points which crossed the threshold. For the more realistic null dataset, small 623 clusters of points were observed above the threshold. Hence, using a consecutive point 624 strategy would reduce the false positive rate. Here, we examined the number of 625 consecutive points which would be optimal to minimise the classification errors. We 626 noted that by including an additional constraint, the lead-time reduced, as multiple 627 points were required before a detection was alarmed. We found that for some detection 628 methods, a strategy using over 40% of the length of the time-series would be 629 recommended as the best number of consecutive points, thus delaying the first possible 630 time-of-detection by over 40%.

Finally, considerations for the 674 operational use of detection algorithms remains an open topic. In particular, integrating 675 EWSs into a decision theory framework to determine how decision makers should 676 interpret the detection of an upcoming disease transition and assign a cost to S1 Simulation Study This section provides further 683 details on the methods used to generate the synthetic data and the parameter values 684 used in the simulation study",
