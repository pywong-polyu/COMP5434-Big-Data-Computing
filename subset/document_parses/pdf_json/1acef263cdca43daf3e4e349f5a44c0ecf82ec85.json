The majority of nosocomial S. aureus-infection are traced back to a source of contaminated surfaces including surgery tables. We assessed the efficacy of a mixture of levulinic acid (LA) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), hereafter called MoWa, to eradicate nosocomial pathogens from contaminated surfaces.",

A time course study further showed that attached MRSA bacteria were eradicated within 4 h of incubation with 65/2 mM MoWa. Staphylococci were killed as confirmed by bacterial counts, and fluorescence micrographs that were stained with the live/dead bacterial assay. We then simulated contamination of hospital surfaces by inoculating bacteria on a surface prone to contamination. Once dried, contaminated surfaces were sprayed with MoWa or mocktreated, and treated contaminated surfaces were swabbed and bacteria counted. While bacteria in the mock-treated samples grew at a density of~10 4 cfu/cm 2 , those treated for~1 min with MoWa (1.0/0.04 M) had been eradicated below limit of detection. A similar eradication efficacy was obtained when surfaces were contaminated with other nosocomial pathogens, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Staphylococcus epidermidis.",

S. aureus strains persist in hospital environments for up to 7 months with no differences found whether the strain bear resistance to antibiotics or not (Kramer et al., 2006; Dancer, 2014) . In hospitals where MRSA strains are endemic, bacteria have been isolated from 40% of overbed tables, 27% from beds or siderails, and >20% from door handles (Dancer, 2008) . This high prevalence of contamination has placed S. aureus strains as the most prevalent etiology in bloodstream infection in the USA (Diekema et al., 2019) , and a very common cause of HAI in burn patients (Pangli and Papp, 2019) . Outbreaks of MRSA infection have been also reported in neonatal intensive care units (Kim et al., 2019) . Along the same lines, other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that cause a high burden of hospital acquired infections include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Acinetobacter baumannii (Magill et al., 2014; Magill et al., 2018; Cruz-Lopez et al., 2020) .",

This LA/SDS (1 ;M/0.04 M) solution reduced the density of Salmonella species by >7 logs and the density of shiga toxin-producing E. coli strains by >5 logs within minutes (Zhao et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2014) . The efficacy was similarly observed in pure cultures, or when strains were spiked on different surfaces or food items (Zhao et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014) . A similar formulation of LA-and SDS-disinfected bacteria from produce such as pecans (Beuchat et al., 2012; Beuchat et al., 2013) , cantaloupes (Webb et al., 2013) , or those contaminating beef cheek meat (Schmidt et al., 2014) and eradicated bacteria from food slicers . However, the same LA/SDS solution was ineffective to eradicate parasites, such as Cryptosporidium parvum and Encephalitozoon intestinalis (Ortega et al., 2011) . To the best of our knowledge, this LA/ SDS solution has not been assessed to disinfect clinical settings contaminated with nosocomial pathogens. It has, however, demonstrated potential to remove biofilms made by oral streptococci as assessed by using an in vitro approach and a mouse model of oral colonization (Wang et al., 2012) .",

As shown in Figure 1 , MoWa at a concentration of levulinic acid and SDS of 8.2 and 0.33 mM, respectively (thereafter referred as 8.2/0.33 mM), was sufficient to kill NRS384 planktonic bacteria 24 h post-inoculation that otherwise grew at a high density of~1 \u00d7 10 13 cfu/ml ( Figure  1A and Table 2 ). A similar low concentration of MoWa was enough to eradicate planktonic cultures of other MRSA and methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) strains ( Figure 1B) . Given the observed high potency of MoWa against planktonic cells, we assessed its antimicrobial activity against MRSA biofilms. A mid-log phase culture of MRSA strain NRS384 was inoculated into a 24-well plate containing fresh BHI broth and incubated for 24 h. After this incubation period, planktonic staphylococci were removed, and biofilms were challenged with the mixture of levulinic acid and SDS at different concentrations ( Table 2) . Treated and untreated biofilms were incubated for another 24 h period. A concentration of levulinic acid and SDS at 32/1.3 mM, respectively, eradicated preformed NRS384 biofilms, whereas the untreated NRS384 biofilm control reached a very high density ( Figure 1C and Table 2 ).",

As expected, micrographs of untreated MRSA biofilms showed \u226590% of live staphylococci retaining the cell permeable SYTO-9 green fluorescent reporter, while \u226410% MRSA cells had a damage cell wall and therefore propidium iodide permeated inside those bacteria ( Figure 2B, upper left panel) . MRSA cells treated with a lower dose of MoWa, i.e., 32/1.3, or 16/0.6, showed a mixture of live SYTO-9-positive bacterial cells and dead staphylococci that had incorporated propidium iodide ( Figure 2B , lower panels). In contrast, MRSA biofilm cells challenged with MoWa, 65/2.6 mM ( Figure 2B , upper right panel) and higher doses (not shown), were all stained with propidium iodide, indicating that bacteria had been intoxicated and therefore that their membrane was permeabilized ( Figure 2B) . Similarly, whereas 24 h mature MRSA biofilms were viable ( Figure 2C , XY optical section) and formed a thick~15 \u00b5m biofilm structure ( Figure 2C , YZ optical section), those treated with MoWa (65/2.6 mM) for 24 h showed a~75% reduction of thickness (~5 \u00b5m) of the biofilm structure and MRSA bacteria that remained attached to the substratum have incorporated propidium iodide confirming that bacteria were dead. Together, these experiments demonstrated that treatment of MRSA bacteria with MoWa 65/2.6 mM for 4 h, or mature biofilms for 24 h, results in dead of staphylococci by a mechanism that involves the permeabilization of the bacterial membrane.",

For example, planktonic cells were eradicated within 24 h with a very low concentration (8.2/0.3 mM), whereas biofilms grown at a higher density were killed in 24 h with (32/1.3 mM), and it required of 1 M/0.04 M to kill bacteria within 1 h; this latter was established as the MIC 90 .

The safety of LA and SDS for humans has been widely assessed, and therefore, those two compounds were designated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as GRAS given they can be directly added to food as a flavoring substance (LA), or as a multipurpose additive (SDS) (Zhou et al., 2019; Administration FFaD, 2021) . Furthermore, the investigated LD 50 of SDS is 977 mg/kg, thereby it will require 233 M of SDS to affect an individual weighing 70 kg. On the other hand, the LD 50 of LA is 1850 mg/kg (Anonymous, 1979) , which is the equivalent to 15 M and therefore it will require 1050 M of LA to affect an average individual. Therefore, the contactkilling MIC 90 of 1/0.04 M of MoWa is~1,000-fold, or~5,825-fold, lower than that concentration required to reach a LD 50 in animal models. At the concentration used in MoWa, levulinic acid has a light fruity fragrance, it is in fact a common additive to foods (Administration FFaD, 2021) and therefore its smell will not represent a negative factor to discourage its use. Neither sensorial (i.e., smell, color, or other sensory aspects) nor safety concerns were identified when a similar solution of LA and SDS was utilized to decontaminate strawberries (Zhou et al., 2017) . A similar MoWa formulation did not cause adverse effects in mice after a 2-week period of treatment by the oral route (Wang et al., 2012) .",

Levulinic acid (C 5 H 8 O 3 ) is a 4-oxopentanoic acid containing two functional groups, carboxylic acid and ketones. These two groups certainly provide pathways to further reactions. SDS is a detergent used to solubilize biological membranes by forming micelles with membrane phospholipids; this occurs at a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of SDS of 0.3 mM per mole of phospholipids (Tan et al., 2002) . The presence of a five-carbon molecule, i.e., levulinic acid, might have decreased the CMC, thus increasing the solubilization of the bacterial membrane at a lower saturating concentration of SDS. An additional hypothesis might be that once SDS have permeabilized the FIGURE 5 | MoWa efficiently decontaminate surfaces containing nosocomial pathogens. The indicated bacterial strain was inoculated in a 10-cm2 sterile surface and let dry for~1 h. Contaminated surfaces were sprayed with PBS (control) or with a mixture levulinic acid (LA) and SDS at a concentration of 1/0.04 M. Bacteria were removed from MoWa-treated or mock-treated surfaces after 1 min and immediately diluted and plated onto BHI agar plates to obtain colony counts (cfu/ml). Error bars represent the standard errors of the means calculated using data from at least three independent experiments. *p<0.05 compared to control. bacterial membrane(s), LA could trigger downstream signaling events at the intracellular level and leading to the observed rapid death of bacteria. The infectious dose of S. aureus strains that causes disease varies but can be as low as 10 bacteria to several thousand cfu (Dancer, 2008) . In our life-like contamination model, we infected bacteria spanning most, if not all, bacterial densities observed in studies assessing the contamination of surfaces in hospital environments. MoWa successfully eradicated all surfaces that had been contaminated with~1 \u00d7 10 6 cfu, within 1 min of exposure, thereby it is expected that this disinfectant eradicates contamination with a lower density. It has been reported that S. aureus strains can be carried in the nose by~25% of hospitalized patients of which <1% corresponds to MRSA strains (Weterings et al., 2019) . In China,~20% of healthcare workers carry MRSA strains while the prevalence in the general population was~28% . It is therefore expected that 30% of individuals in a hospital, whether patients, their family member, or hospital staff carry S. aureus. Transmission of these strains from nose to hands occurred in 100% of those carrying staphylococci in the upper airways and serves as a persisting vector of contamination (Kramer et al., 2006) . Our initial characterization demonstrated antibacterial activity against 100-fold more cfu than that required to initiate an infectious process and eradication of bacteria contaminating a surface at a density of~10 4 cfu/cm 2 as rapid as 1 min post-treatment with MoWa.",

This was not a factor in our study as our in vitro test was conducted at 35\u00b0C, and the ambient temperature, when assessed using the surface-contaminated model, was~20\u00b0C. The temperature should not represent a factor whether MoWa is utilized in hospital environments where the ambient temperature should be around 20\u00b0C but certainly not below 10\u00b0C. A similar formulation of LA and SDS has been used overall to disinfect bacteria contaminating pecans (Beuchat et al., 2012; Beuchat et al., 2013) , cantaloupes (Webb et al., 2013) , or beef cheek meat (Schmidt et al., 2014) and from food slicers . Besides environmental contamination, LA/SDS removed biofilms made by oral streptococci (Wang et al., 2012) . Given the potential safety of MoWa, and its proven antimicrobial effect against MRSA strains, dermatological use of MoWa for the prophylactic use, or the treatment of, MRSA-induced skin infection is envisioned. To the best of our knowledge, until the current study, this LA/SDS solution has not been assessed to disinfect clinical settings contaminated with bacterial nosocomial pathogens. It will be important also to assess in the future whether MoWa can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 viruses, since it has demonstrated activity against the influenza A virus and surrogated human noroviruses (Cannon et al., 2012; Aydin et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Antimicrobial activity against MRSA and E. coli has also been demonstrated, with a similar efficacy to that presented in the current study, for antimicrobial formulations containing chlorhexidine gluconate and/or isopropyl alcohol (Campos et al., 2012; Hendry et al., 2012) . Ethanol wipes, and a portable UV radiation device, were also effective to eradicate contamination by MRSA and other nosocomial pathogens whereas spraying a solution of 70% ethanol only reduced the density of MRSA (Panousi et al., 2009; Umezawa et al., 2012) . The advantage of MoWa against other available sanitizing for hospital environments includes the known safety of its components (Administration FFaD, 2021), the availability of LA and SDS during shortages of disinfectants, such as the one we are experiencing in the current Covid-19 pandemic (Berardi et al., 2020) , and the lower price for eradicating nosocomial pathogen from contaminated surfaces. Compared to alcohol-based disinfectants, treating a surface by spraying of MoWa (~780 \u00b5l) will cost >10-fold cheaper than a similar treatment of the contaminated surface with an alcohol-based solution or alcohol wipes (i.e., MoWa US $0.010 cents compared to a solution of 70% ethanol US $0.100 cents or alcohol wipes US $0.300 cents each wipe).",
