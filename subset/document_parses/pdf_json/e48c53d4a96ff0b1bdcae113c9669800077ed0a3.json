In this study, the content dynamics for protein, fat, chitin, and other components in the whole development process of yellow mealworms were analyzed by sampling from different instars and combining with their growth conditions. The results of the component dynamic analyses in the different development stages showed that the percentages of protein, fat, and chitin were the highest in the larval stage, pupal stage, and adult stage, respectively. The results of amino acid composition dynamic analysis also indicated comparatively higher essential amino acids in the earlier instar (e.g., before the 9th instar) larvae. Therefore, we found that the earlier instar is better than the final instar as the insect farming harvest time. Furthermore, the larvae in the earlier instar consumed dramatically less feed and could effectively reduce the farming costs of insect farmers. This finding provides an alternative option to farm insects for different purposes and in an economic way.",

Tenebrio molitor displays variability in developmental time (1, 2) , as the number of instars can vary from 9 to 20 (3, 4) depending on several abiotic factors, such as temperature, humidity, oxygen concentration, and biotic factors, such as population density, parental age, and feed quality (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) .

Meanwhile, with the COVID-19 pandemic as a background, nutritional advice has suggested that protein is important to immunity and recovery. Studies have shown that a high-protein diet can ameliorate the decrease in amino acid absorption caused by gastrointestinal disorders in patients with COVID-19 (22) . Thus, an increase in the daily protein intake of patients from 0.8 to 1 g/kg (23) has been recommended. With freeze-dried yellow mealworm larvae containing approximately 50% crude protein and its protein extract having a true protein content of approximately 75%, it has been observed that mealworms are increasingly being incorporated into food either as whole insects in fresh or dried form, as rough machining products, or as crude extracts to increase their nutritional value or functionality (24) .",

Feed was added to each box and its weight was recorded. The yellow mealworms and their feces were screened every 3 days, and the weight of the remaining food was measured until the yellow mealworms in the box entered the next stage. The feeding amount of the yellow mealworms in the different instars was measured. The percentage value of the consumption of a single larva during a certain period and the consumption of the whole larva period were used as the food consumption proportion. Feed assimilability and feed-protein conversion rate were calculated by these formulas: ",

The contents of glutamic, aspartic acid, and alanine were the highest, while the contents of tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine were the lowest. The highest contents of essential amino acids were Val, Lys, and Leu, which are involved in muscle development, signal transduction, and energy supply (26, 28, 41, 42) . Among the non-essential amino acids, Glu, an important component of nitrogen metabolism, had the highest content (43) . The four non-essential amino acids (glutamic acid, aspartic acid, glycine, and alanine) related to flavor accounted for approximately 20% of the dry weight of T. molitor, which were beneficial to the development and production of the flavorings derived from the protein of the yellow mealworm. The content of the amino acids decreased with the development of the worms, and the contents of amino acids in the pupal and adult stages as significantly lower than that in the larval stage. Thus, it can be concluded that the pupal and adult stages of T. molitor are not good sources of protein. In addition, the adult mealworms cannot be eaten because they contain certain toxic compounds and secretions with a strange smell (44) , which is in line with the harvest situation in the production of yellow mealworms. We obtained the amino acid scores of the yellow mealworms at different stages according to the amino acid scoring patterns for infants, children, adolescents, and adults from the 2007 WHO/FAO/UNU report (40) . As shown in Figure 2 , the yellow mealworms contained all phases of the restrictive amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, sulfur-containing amino acids (SAA) and other aromatic amino acids (AAA), however, the amino acid score is declining with the development of yellow mealworms. Thus, the protein nutritional value of 13th instar yellow mealworms that insect farming chose usually is obviously inferior to that of the earlier instar larvae due to the deficiency of tryptophan, leucine and sulfur-containing amino acids.",

Compared with the growth curve of the yellow mealworms, the results were analyzed by combining with the study of Babu D E (45): 7-10 instars were the stage of rapid growth for yellow mealworms. The amino acids in the body of these yellow mealworms, especially in terms of the content of essential amino acids, were rapidly consumed by individuals as energy and raw materials, so the score of essential amino acids in the body and the EAAI value decreased during this period. Before and after 7-10 instars, the growth rate slowed down and the larvae entered a developmental slow period.

From another point of view, the advantage of the single weight of older larvae can make up for the disadvantage of low amino acid contents, but the feed utilization efficiency of insects will continue to decline with the aging of larvae. It can be inferred from the analysis in 3.2 that, under the condition of the same intake of feed, the growth rate slows down significantly and the biomass conversion ratio decreases significantly with the development of larvae. A large amount of feed is used to provide energy, and the rate of feed waste increases (47) . In fact, instar growth was considered to be the most effective factor in reducing feed availability in mealworms (48) . Therefore, it is not economical to insist on harvesting final instar larvae.",

The study concluded that fat content is the highest in the pupal stage and chitin content is the highest in the adult stage. The protein content of T. molitor also decreased with the increase of instars, and the nutritional value of the proteins changed with the variation of the physiological status of the yellow mealworms. Furthermore, it was found that the protein yield and quality of the earlier stage of larvae are better. Due to the low chitin and fat content, easy digestion, utilization and preservation, better protein content and nutritional value, and higher feed utilization rate, a good harvest time could be when the larvae are still young. Combined with the yield, feed availability, nutritional value of protein, and other factors, 9thto 10th-instar yellow mealworms would be a better choice for harvesting than the 13th-instar larvae. This study will provide reference for the improvement of mealworm production value and the selection of the best harvest time for other edible insects in the future.",
