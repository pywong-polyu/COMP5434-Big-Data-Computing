This broader adoption of agile methods has been labeled large-scale agile transformation and is considered a particular type of organizational change, originating in the software development units. So far, there is little research-based advice on conducting such transformations. Aiming to contribute towards providing relevant research advice on large-scale agile transformation, we apply a research-based framework for evaluating organizational agility on a product development program in a maritime service provider organization. We found that doing a large-scale agile transformation involves many significant challenges, such as having a shared understanding of the problem, getting access to users, and getting commitment to change that needs to be done. In order to overcome such challenges, we discuss the need for a holistic and integrated approach to agile transformation involving all the units linked to software development.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Software development teams are currently working on developing products providing new digitally enabled customer experiences -while simultaneously incubating and accelerating digital innovations -are facing increasingly complex problems to be solved. Part of the complexity is because solving such problems involves relying on several actors outside of the agile software development team [1, 2] . One example is close cooperation with the business development unit needed in order to achieve the potential advantages of a continuous business and development process [3] . Another example is the need for fast feedback from the customer, which in agile software development is realized by the introduction of frequent software releases to the customer or market. Further, a transformation to continuous delivery needs to consider units such as operations (i.e., the customer-facing side of the organization) and sales and marketing [4] . Agile software teams cooperating with other non-agile units represent a challenge [8] , as agile software teams work highly iterative in a sense and respond manner. Other units may be more plan and document-driven. The need for agile software development teams to interact with other units in the organization dynamically and responsively is why companies today aim to scale agile methods beyond software development.

Overby et al. [5] define organizational agility as \"the ability of firms to sense environmental change and respond appropriately,\" and show the different combinations of sensing and response capabilities that organizations should have. They argue that a company that is highly effective at sensing environmental change but is slow to act or acts inappropriately cannot be considered agile. Likewise, a firm that responds appropriately will not be agile if it is unable to sense the correct opportunities to follow. In an agile organization, therefore, if operations sense a change in customer behavior, software development must change the digital customer experience must change, and so must sales and marketing must change accordingly. Worley et al. [6] argue that \"agility allows an organization to respond in a more timely, effective, and sustained way than its competitors when changing circumstances require it.\" Having the ability to make timely and effective and sustained change results in sustained high performance. Worley et al. (ibid.) introduce a framework to assess organizational agility based on the literature of organization design and flexible and agile organizations. The framework was validated with studies of performance data from 20 firms and interviews with executives. The framework explains routines, the features of these routines, and describes how agile organizations apply them. In order to grasp large-scale agile transformation, we will apply the framework. We chose that particular framework because it is based on organization studies theory and on findings from empirical studies (the framework is detailed in Table 1 in Sect. 2). However, as of yet, few other researchers have tested the framework.

An alternative to creating a new organization, therefore, is to start an agile transformation in a part of the existing organizations that already have agile features, which software development units typically do have. The focus in the transformations should be on which features to address to increase agility and how to do it. A part of the organization can, for example, be everyone involved in the development of a product from team management, operation, software development, business, sales, legal, and marketing.

Further, booking surveys were sub-optimized, resulting in ships doing surveys in harbors that were not cost-effective and that did not allow all work to be done at once.

A system based on machine learning could potentially reduce the cost of surveyor traveling, reduce the total number of services needed, the need to offer services in expensive ports, and reduce the time a vessel needs to be in a port.

Further, there were many customer complaints regarding invoices. It became clear that there was confusion among some customers regarding the service ordered and the service provided by the company.

In the following, we answer this research question by discussing our findings in light of a research-based framework on agile organizations [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 131, "end": 134, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 260, "end": 263, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 305, "end": 309, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 400, "end": 403, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 870, "end": 873, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We found how a typical innovation journey was followed, a product was developed and launched, but the economic gains did not meet expectations. Importantly, as a consequence, the company started investigating the reasons why the product did not meet its projected earnings. One critical insight during the diagnosing phase was that it was not the design of the digital solution per se that caused the lack of customer uptake. For the solution to have its envisioned effects, it would require a change in the internal organization to be able to change customer behavior. The company started a change in a product development environment that already had some agile features, i.e., including software development that was already using agile methods, as suggested by [12] . The change process was done in order to improve its capacity for sensing customer behavior and adapting the digital solutions. The software development and business development units needed more unfiltered access to customer behavior. This is in line with [5] , who argue that both sensing and adapting is essential for organizational agility.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 765, "end": 769, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1031, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We analyzed the steps taken by the unit under study in light of a research-based framework on agile organizations [6] .

The second routine, perceiving, involved being willing to experiment with new products, being able to change who gets access to customer insight and that bringing stakeholders together across different units is a critical activity in enabling change. The third routine, testing, we found that it was not changing the technical parts of the system that was the most challenging, but rather to being able to experiment with the organization and making the necessary changes. The fourth routine, implementing, we found that monetary rewards systems and involvement of expertise with decision-making authority were vital in making transformation occur.

However, our rationale for choosing the company as our case was that it represents a critical case for explaining the challenges of conducting a large-scale agile transformation in practice.

This work is an essential step in its own right since there is much confusion around terms related to agile transformations, similar to early research on the agile transformation of teams [18] . The need for a framework for agile transformation outside of the software development unit is evident when one considers the emergence of phenomena such as Enterprise Agile, Beyond Budgeting, DevOps, Lean Startups, and many other concepts from business agility in general.
