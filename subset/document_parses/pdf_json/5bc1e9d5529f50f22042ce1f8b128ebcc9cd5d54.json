The current generation is between stories-the religious and the scientific. How might religious education be developed in the Catholic school to reflect the growing convergence in theological discourse of the Christian Story with the New Universe Story? How might it energise young students with images that empower them to develop a prophetic stance towards their future and the future of humanity? We first consider the need for a paradigm shift in the way we tell the Christian Story. Then, taking our lead from the theology of Karl Rahner which allows us to take a cosmic view of Christian religious experience, and from various writers who apply such a view to different areas of Christian life, we attempt a synthesis of current theological thought. Lastly, we suggest how this shift might be applied to the religious education curriculum in order to provide an answer to the questions posed above.",

Gabriel Moran's definition of religious education as 'the attempt to keep education open to the undreamt possibilities of the human race ' (1981, p. 62 ) also points to its forward-looking character. This vision of religious education is especially significant in view of the global economic, social and ecological crises facing the world today. Can religious education draw humanity forward in hope with a new language that moves hearts and minds, especially those of the young who find themselves 'between stories' -those that religion and science tell (Berry 1988, p. 23 )? The first of these stories they find increasingly incomprehensible; the second attracts to such an extent that it becomes the only story worth considering.",

Religion, on the other hand, must realise that its myths are not empirically real (p. 193) . Thus both religious and scientific ways of addressing reality are limited: both are in need of a larger story.

Ewert Cousins, in 1992 , proposed that we are at a major new epic in human consciousness-a second Axial Age 1 (Vincie 2014, p. 4) , and Pope Francis echoed the same idea. \"We are not living an era of change,\" he said, \"but a change of era\" (McElwee 2015).

Perhaps we are already witnessing this in the Catholic Church where Pope Francis shows awareness of the possibility of schism (San Mart\u00edn 2019). Francis had already sounded a call to transformation in his Apostolic Exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium (2013) where he encourages us to forego comfort and security (par. 10) and \"constantly seek ways of expressing unchanging truths in a language which brings out their abiding newness\". We must avoid \"the greatest danger\" of \"hold(ing) fast to a formulation while failing to convey its substance\" (par. 41).

However, the references to creation are sporadic and more often signify the preservation of what is already created.

The universality of revelation thus means that there is a 'Spirit-shaped relationship' among religions (Lane 2006, p. 227 ). This idea is implicit in Vatican II's declaration, Nostra Aetate, and expressed more clearly in Paul VI's Apostolic Exhortation, Evangelii Nuntiandi (par. 53) where he speaks of the efficacy of other religions which contain \"seeds of the Word.\" B\u00fchlmann goes further to advise that the possibility of the Logos having been manifested also in the Buddha, in Krishna, in Zoroaster and Mohammed should not be rejected on an a priori basis (1992, p. 94).",

His answer is to see the Christevent, not as an exception to the universal action of the Spirit, but as \"the historical sacrament of the Spirit of God in the world\" (p. 231). Similarly for Rahner, the Incarnation is not a divine intervention into human history, an event as it were outside of space-time, but a natural consequence of the process of evolution, \"of matter evolving towards spirit from the very beginning\" (Cannato 2010, p. 54 ). So we can see the humanity of Jesus both as God's fullest self-expression within the created world, and as the fulfilment of the world's self-transcendence into the mystery of God.

They were endemic to the evolutionary process. This is also the view of De Chardin who suggests that if to create is to gradually unite multiple and disorganised matter, then God cannot create without evil appearing as a shadow (Delio 2011, p. 80) . Teilhard saw the cross as a sign of progress \"as suffering and death yield to greater union\" (Delio 2008, p. 141) . Elizabeth Johnson (2014, p. 192) reminds us that the Creator is not aloof from the evolutionary process. In Christ, the One who creates and empowers the evolutionary world personally drinks the cup of suffering and goes down into the nothingness of death to transform it from within. Hope springs from this divine presence amid the turmoil.",

The more complex a thing is, the more it is a single whole: think of the difference between a stone and a cow, for example. And the more of a single whole a thing is, the more it is in control of itself and its life. Human beings have moved through different stages in the evolution of their consciousness. In the beginning, they were fully inserted into the circle of life, and were guided by instincts that did not harm themselves or their environment. But life was a struggle to provide their two basic needs-a need for nature to keep them alive and well, and a need for each other in order to be happy. As self-consciousness dawned, they became aware of the possibility of stepping out of the circle, and making their own considered decisions (Faller 2007, pp. 31-32) . From that point onwards, life became not only a struggle to provide their basic needs, but also, in the satisfaction of these needs, a struggle to resist that \"huge, universal, inertial force that resists this creative movement of the Spirit towards wholeness\" (Moore 1985, p. 84) . In this sense, sin is anything that is opposed to the meaning of history, which is the establishment and completion of the Reign of God.",

The implication for religious education seems clear. We must meet students where they are on their faith journey, accompany them, and trust the Holy Spirit to lead them to the truth (John 16:13).",

This is because meditation, of all practices and techniques aimed at raising consciousness, develops what Cannato (2010) calls 'unitive' or cosmic consciousness-an awareness that all life is connected and of being one with all that is (p. 100, 101, 119).
