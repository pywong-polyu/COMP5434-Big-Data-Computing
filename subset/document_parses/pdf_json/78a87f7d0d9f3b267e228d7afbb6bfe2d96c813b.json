We aimed to compare outcome of two types of combination therapies atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus hydroxychloroquine among COVID-19 patients. 108 patients with moderate and severe forms of COVID-19 were divided into two groups (each group 54 patients). One group received ATV/r plus hydroxychloroquine, and the other group received hydroxychloroquine plus LPV/r. Then, both groups were evaluated and compared for clinical symptoms, recovery rates, and complications of treatment regimens. Our findings showed a significant increase in bilirubin in ATV/r-receiving group compared to LPV/r receivers. There was also a significant increase in arrhythmias in the LPV/r group compared to the ATV/r group during treatment. Other findings including length of hospital stay, outcome, and treatment complications were not statistically significant. There is no significant difference between protease inhibitor drugs including ATV/r and LPV/r in the treatment of COVID-19 regarding clinical outcomes. However, some side effects such as hyperbilirubinemia and arrhythmia were significantly different by application of atazanavir or lopinavir.",

This pandemic disease has infected more than 200 million people worldwide [2, 3] caused by a single-stranded RNA virus with human and animal hosts [4] [5] [6] . The average incubation period of the disease is between 4 and 5 days, but it may last up to 14 days. Some data show that SARS-CoV-2 with mild presentation leads to short protection rather than severe infection [5, [7] [8] [9] . The disease may differ from a mild and asymptomatic form to a severe presentation with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. According to the results of the studies, about 81% of patients presented moderate and mild forms whereas 14% and 5% had severe and threatening to fatal forms of the disease, respectively [10] [11] [12] . Symptoms including fever, cough, and dyspnea have been found in about 70% whereas muscle pain and headache were seen in 36% and 34%, respectively [13] .",

Among these drugs, protease inhibitors which are used for treatment of HIV-1 are applied in COVID-19 [15] . Protease inhibitors impair the virus replication by inhibition of protease, which are hepatically metabolized via the CYP isoenzyme CYP3A4. Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 metabolism; therefore, it induces more drug interactions [16] . Moreover, LPV/r, as a protease inhibitor drug, can inhibit the protease 3CLpro enzyme, which is one of the RNA polymerase-dependent proteases of the virus and is involved in virus replication [15] . Atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) is another drug belonging to the protease inhibitor family that has a greater inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and fewer side effects compared to LPV/r; therefore, ATV/r is easier to tolerate for patients. Moreover, LPV/r has been shown to have better pulmonary permeability [17] . COVID-19 causes a widespread inflammatory response in the body through the cytokine storm mediated by interleukin-6. Some symptoms of COVID-19 stem from this inflammatory reaction. Evidence showed that some protease inhibitors such as atazanavir can reduce symptoms and disease severity to some extent by decreasing the release of interleukin-6 from primary monocytes [18, 19] .",

In this study, almost all the patients received antibiotic therapy in addition to antiviral therapy including fluoroquinolones and macrolides which may cause arrhythmias. On the other hand, the interaction of LPV/r with these antibiotics, as well as with hydroxychloroquine, which has been used as part of combination therapy against COVID-19 in these patients, might be the cause of higher arrhythmias in the LPV/r group.",

The findings indicated a significant increase in bilirubin in ATV/r receivers compared to LPV/r-treated patients. Arrhythmias were also significantly increased in the LPV/r group compared to the ATV/r group during the treatment. Apart from the rate of hyperbilirubinemia and cardiac arrhythmia, other indices were not statistically various between the two groups. There was no significant difference for mortality rate and complications of treatment regimen between two groups. It seems that the current applying agents are not preferably acceptable to overcome COVID-19 infection, and therefore, more therapeutic antiviral regimens must be studied in this era. ",
