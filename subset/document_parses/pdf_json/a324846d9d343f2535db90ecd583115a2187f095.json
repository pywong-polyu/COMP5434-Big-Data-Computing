Whilst there are numerous online/mobile geographical information systems, dashboards 1 and applications these systems are often reliant on information from lab-confirmed cases. The lab-confirmed cases that are released daily in the UK were initially only for hospital patients with a medical need before extending to healthcare workers and to more recently to those over 5 s with symptoms who seek a test (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/). 2 There are also delays in the release of these labconfirmed cases from the first onset of symptoms. Firstly, the patient must seek a test and go to a test centre and then there is the time taken in processing the results (often over 24 h) and then the results need to be collated and released. In addition, not everyone with symptoms will adhere to advice to seek a test or feel well enough to do so.",

Whilst Twitter users may not be posting to aid symptom monitoringusers often describe symptoms or whether they have or suspect they have COVID-19. Indeed, people often post their symptoms of COVID-19 from the first stages of the disease and do so in real-time (before organizing a test if available or whilst awaiting results). In light of the deficit in testing and the disparities in testing -both temporal and geographical, we propose that social media may provide useful additional insight into symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Using Twitter may also capture people who are reluctant to use an app, fill in a survey or organize a test.",

We identified approximately 160,000 (2%) of the 7 million tweets that matched handwritten regular expressions (Online Appendix 1) designed to identify tweets indicating that the user potentially has been exposed to COVID-19. We then removed approximately 30,000 (19%) of the 160,000 matching tweets using an automated system for filtering out 'reported speech' (e.g. quotations, news headlines) from health-related social media data. 8 (b) Annotation: Annotation guidelines were developed to help two annotators manually distinguish between three classes of tweets in a random sample of 10,000 of 130,000 of the filtered tweets:",

We coded user's as positive who described experiencing symptoms that match those listed as the most common to COVID-19, according to the WHO and the CDC, unless it is ascribed to another reason (e.g. choking on something, smoking, asthma etc.). Symptoms included fever, coughing and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; and/or the lesser experienced but more unique reported symptoms such as loss of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia). \u2022 Possible: The tweet indicates that the user or a member of the user's household has had experiences that pose a higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 (e.g. recent travelling) or exhibits symptoms that may be, but are less common, associated with COVID-19. Mentions of symptoms that are sometimes present but not the most common symptoms associated with the COVID by WHO and the CDC were annotated as possible cases. \u2022 Other: The tweet is related to COVID-19 and may discuss topics such as testing, symptoms, travelling or social distancing, but it does not indicate that the user or a member of the user's household may be infected. Mentions of feeling unwell with no specific symptoms mentioned or describing or listing the symptoms of COVID-19 with no indication that the person posting is experiencing those symptoms were classified as 'Other Mention' (for more detail: see Online Appendix annotation guidelines). The inter-annotator agreement was 0.73 (Cohen's kappa), considered 'substantial agreement'. 9 (c) Automatic classification. We split the 10,000 annotated tweets into 80% (8000 tweets) and 20% (2000 tweets) random sets to train and evaluate, respectively, a deep neural network classifier based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERTs). 10 After feeding the sequence of tweet tokens to BERT, the encoded representation is passed to a dropout layer (dropping rate of 0.1), followed by a dense layer with two units and a softmax activation, which predicts the class for each tweet. For training, we used Adam optimization with rate decay and warm-up. We used a batch size of 64, training runs for three epochs, and a maximum learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Prior to automatic classification, we preprocessed the tweets by normalizing usernames and URLs, and lowercasing the text. (d) City of residence determination. We used to tweet or profile metadata to derive the user's likely place of residence to the most specific administrative level possible. Although the location of geotagged tweets is commonly assumed to be the place of residence of a user, the percentage of tweets geotagged is very small (estimated at less than 5%). Thus, we utilized a rule-based system to normalize the text provided in the user's profile location metadata. 11 Additional methods that use the user's publicly available tweets were deployed if necessary. Whilst some posts could only be ascertained as from England, the majority had more specific geographical locations, such as city, county or region. In order to compare the data to that of UK government figures, we coded each city to its appropriate region, for instance, Leeds or West Yorkshire were placed in the 'Yorkshire and Humber' region. Those tweets with a US location were analysed in a separate study. 12,13 (e) Data Analysis. We provide a detailed analysis of those posts with a UK geographical location. We compared the data to lab-confirmed cases over time and per region using cumulative frequency graphs to visually convey the spread of the disease and identify trends in the number of cases.",

            "text": "The BERT-based classifier achieved an F 1 -score of 0.64 (precision = 0.69, recall = 0.61) for the 'probable' class, 0.53 (precision = 0.54, recall = 0.52) for the 'possible' class, and 0.68 (precision = 0.70, recall = 0.67) when the 'probable' and 'possible' classes were unified, where F 1 -score = 2 \u00d7 recall \u00d7 precision/recall + precision; precision = true positives/true positives + false positives; and recall = true positives/true positives + false negatives. We deployed the classifier on more than 400,000 tweets, collected between January and April 2020 that match the regular expressions. We identified 4110 cases (58% (2393) probable and (42% (1717) possible) from the UK. The majority were from England (78%, 3206/4110), with 8% (339) from Scotland, 4% (145) from Wales, 1.5% (61) from Northern Ireland and 9% (359) from an unknown country in the UK. The daily number of probable or possible tweet cases ranged from 3 to 95 with a mean of 45. Figure 1 illustrates the number of detected users from each nation in the UK who have posted 'probable' or 'possible' tweets between 23 January 2020 and 28 April 2020 and compares this to; the UK government statistics for labconfirmed cases by nation, the population of each nation and the proportion of other COVID-19 tweets retrieved from each nation. This figure clearly indicates that for the different nations in the UK the figures are consistent between the personal reports on Twitter and lab-confirmed cases. However, Wales and Northern Ireland appear to either tweet slightly less or we have not retrieved quite as many of their tweets (this could be due to language differences). Figure 2 illustrates the proportion of users posting 'probable' or 'possible' tweets by region in England compared to the proportion of lab-confirmed cases, the proportion of population per region and proportion of other COVID-19 tweets per region, 23 January 2020 to 28 April 2020. There is a notably high number of tweets from London, not just personal reports but also of other COVID-19 tweets. This may reflect a younger demographic in London who are tweeting more than outside London. The other regions appear to have an overall agreement with the lab-confirmed cases. It should be noted that the labconfirmed cases are not necessarily an accurate reflection of actual cases given the limited testing available in England. This limitation applies to all regions, however. Figure 3 illustrates the seven-day rolling average of users posting 'probable' or 'possible' tweets, and cumulative labconfirmed cases, from 23 January 2020 to 28 April 2020. When comparing the curve of the personal reports on Twitter and lab-confirmed cases we can see that the spike appears earlier in the tweets than in the lab-confirmed cases. The shape of the cumulative curve indicates whether the daily number of cases is increasing, decreasing or staying the same. Both graphs demonstrate a similar pattern of spread of COVID-19, however, lab testing was unavailable in January and February and extremely limited in March 2020. Figure 4 illustrates the seven-day rolling average number of users posting 'probable' tweets, 'possible' tweets, and the total cumulative number of personal reports on Twitter, from 23 January 2020 to 28 April 2020. This demonstrates the increasing proportion of tweets that are probable as opposed to possible cases.",

In the future, the analysis could be more detailed by assessing trends in smaller geographical areas as much of the data contained information at the city or town level or borough in the case of London. Figure 3 indicates that personal reports on Twitter began to increase sharply around the beginning of March but not until the middle/end of March for UK government confirmed cases or deaths. The comparison of the figures shows some agreement in trends but more reports were on Twitter when no testing was available. The lab testing may also show a higher rate of increase as more testing became available. Figure 4 suggests that tweets had more clarity in their content as time progressed and were more likely to report the common symptoms of COVID-19 as the proportion of probable as opposed to possible cases increased.",

This raises more questions than answers but is an interesting finding given that the first confirmed cases and first confirmed deaths are now thought to be early than first recorded. Thus, our research suggests that real-time, user-generated Twitter data could help provide early warning signals of the spread of COVID-19. This finding is similar to other research on social which indicates that Twitter may have the capacity to detect formal outbreaks up to 7 days ahead 14 or even 7 to 19 days ahead of official recordings. 4 Other studies have focused on the US to ascertain case estimations of COVID-19, with similar results to our study in the UK. 13, 15, 16 To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the use of social media data in the UK. Other UK studies have focused on online search behavior 17 or online apps. 18, 19 Monitoring COVID-19 outbreaks are not the only potential use of social media data in the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, by using social media data, researchers were able to identify an emerging a spectrum of symptoms, such as anosmia and ageusia, body aches and skin lesions, [20] [21] [22] and to identify common combinations of symptoms earlier than in the biomedical literature. 23 Other studies have used social media to conduct more qualitative research on public views and opinions. [24] [25] [26] A limitation of our study is in the comparison of the twitter cases to lab-confirmed testing. We are unable to conclude whether the trends observed are causally related.",
