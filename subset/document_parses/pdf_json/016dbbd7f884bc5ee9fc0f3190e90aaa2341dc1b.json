            "text": "A model that predicts levels of coronavirus (CoV) respiratory and fecal\u2212oral transmission potentials based on the shell disorder has been built using neural network (artificial intelligence, AI) analysis of the percentage of disorder (PID) in the nucleocapsid, N, and membrane, M, proteins of the inner and outer viral shells, respectively. Using primarily the PID of N, SARS-CoV-2 is grouped as having intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal\u2212oral transmission potentials. Related studies, using similar methodologies, have found strong positive correlations between virulence and inner shell disorder among numerous viruses, including Nipah, Ebola, and Dengue viruses. There is some evidence that this is also true for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which have N PIDs of 48% and 50%, and case-fatality rates of 0.5\u22125% and 10.9%, respectively. The underlying relationship between virulence and respiratory potentials has to do with the viral loads of vital organs and body fluids, respectively. Viruses can spread by respiratory means only if the viral loads in saliva and mucus exceed certain minima. Similarly, a patient is likelier to die when the viral load overwhelms vital organs. Greater disorder in inner shell proteins has been known to play important roles in the rapid replication of viruses by enhancing the efficiency pertaining to protein\u2212protein/DNA/RNA/lipid bindings. This paper suggests a novel strategy in attenuating viruses involving comparison of disorder patterns of inner shells (N) of related viruses to identify residues and regions that could be ideal for mutation. The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has one of the lowest M PID values (6%) in its family, and therefore, this virus has one of the hardest outer shells, which makes it resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluid. While this is likely responsible for its greater contagiousness, the risks of creating an attenuated virus with a more disordered M are discussed.",

MERS-CoV originated from a zoonotic transmission event of a camel coronavirus. Since fecal\u2212oral transmission is generally the most efficient mode of transmissions among farm animals, including camels, this could evolutionarily account for the high fecal\u2212oral transmission potential of MERS-CoV as predicted by the model. 9 This is also supported by the fact that MERS-CoV is not easily transmitted unless it involves close contacts. SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, falls into the same category B as its closely related cousin, SARS-CoV, with intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal\u2212oral transmission potentials.",

This might account for the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV. Further evidence that the M protein protects the virion from damage lies in the fact that the M is the most abundant protein found in CoV and its spans the membrane so as to provide greater rigidity to the virion. 14 ",

A major concept used in the study is the phenomenon of protein intrinsic disorder, which refers to proteins or protein regions that have no unique 3D structure. While protein structures are linked to protein functions via a classic protein structure\u2212function paradigm (where unique protein sequence encodes a unique 3D structure that is responsible for unique biological function), protein disorder, likewise, has been linked to myriads of protein functions. 20\u221224 Tools have been developed to predict disorder, since disordered and ordered proteins are characterized by specific and therefore predictable features of their amino acid sequences. The first of these disorder predictors is the PONDR VLXT (www.pondr.com), which is a neural network (artificial intelligence: AI) trained to recognize disordered and ordered sequences. 25\u221227 PONDR VLXT has been highly successful when used to study viral proteins, especially viral shell proteins, since many of these proteins are structural proteins held together by protein\u2212protein or protein\u2212RNA/DNA interactions, and PONDR VLXT is known to be one of the best predictors that can take into account these factors. 28\u221230 It is for these reasons that PONDR VLXT has been successfully used in the study of a large variety of viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), NiV, EBOV, 1918 HIN1 influenza A virus, CoVs, and flaviviruses including yellow fever (YFV), Zika (ZIKV), and DENV. 1\u22123,6\u22128, 10,11,15\u221219,31\u221234 An important number that is used as a yardstick to measure the level of disorder in a protein is the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID), which is defined as the number of residues predicted to be disordered divided by the total number of residues in a protein. The sequences are available at UniProt (http:www.uniprot.org) and NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947). Relational database is used to store disorder and sequence information. 31 Statistical calculations using multivariate analysis were done using R statistical package. 35 Basic Alignment Search Tools for Proteins (BLASTP) is available at NCBI (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins).",

As mentioned previously, the CoV shell disorder model is based on the disorder levels of two major shell proteins: M (membrane, outer shell) and N (nucleocapsid, inner shell). 7, 14 Table 1 shows the grouping of the three categories of coronaviruses. Figure 1 tells us that the SARS-CoV-2 is odd as its outer shell (M) is among the hardest in the family given its low PID M value, which is likely indicative of greater resistance of this virus to antimicrobial enzymes found in the saliva, mucus, tongue, and skin. 2,3,11\u221213 This characteristic is believed to cause greater shedding of viral particles that is responsible for its greater contagiousness. There is, however, at least one other \"competing\" theory that could also account for the greater contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. This involves research showing that the glycoprotein spike (S) is highly adapted to the human ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-2) receptor by binding more tightly by a factor of 20\u221230 times that in the case of the 2003 SARS-CoV. 36 While the finding in this research does not in any way contradict the results as seen Table 1 and Figure 1 , the question of the true cause of its greater contagiousness remains. With a high probability, both of these factors contribute to the higher transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Incoming COVID-19 Data Supporting the CoV Shell Model. Incoming clinical data are increasingly providing compelling evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 sheds large quantities of infectious particles. Heavy viral shedding has been detected on the first day when the patients showed the slightest symptoms 37 or even no symptoms. 38 The heavy shedding lasted until the days of recovery. This shedding was observed to be much greater among COVID-19 patients than those infected with SARS-CoV. 37 Large amounts of virions are not confined to the respiratory tract and spread in the form of respiratory droplets, but can also be found in fecal matter. The infectious particles found in feces were observed to be active for a prolonged period of time. 39 Moreover, CoVs with such hard shell are found to be associated with burrowing animals such as rabbits and pangolins that are often in contact with buried feces. 11 All these are consistent with the CoV shell model and its predictions including the resilience of viral particles outside the physiological environment, as the virus is found to have among the hardest outer shells among CoVs, while it also has intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal\u2212oral potentials. Figure 1 tells us that the neighboring viruses with similar PID N values are bat coronaviruses. Not only does this corroborate with phylogenetic studies showing that one of the bat CoVs (RATG13) has as much as 96% similarity to SARS-CoV-2, 4,5 but it also highlights the evolutionary connection between this virus and bat CoV. One interpretation would be that the PID N in the range of 47\u221248% defines the optimal respiratory transmission potential to spread among the bats. If this is the case, then the N protein from SARS-CoV-2 did not evolve much, if any, and is not too different from its ancestral counterpart in bat CoV, even if there is an intermediary host before the appearance of CoV capable of infecting humans. (Since the writing of this paper, an added twist to this analysis has, however, been found upon inspection of pangolin-CoV data as seen in a recently published paper. 11 This is in sharp contrast to its close cousin, SARS-CoV, which has a PID N of 50%, which could imply that the N protein from SARS-CoV probably had time to evolve in an intermediary host, such as the civet cat, since the N PID has to evolve from 47% to 48% to 50%, and a greater number of mutations is required for this to happen.)",

For instance, a virus may need more immediate protection by evolving a harder outer shell (more rigid M protein), if it moves to a new host species that has stronger antimicrobial enzymes in its saliva. Figure 1 shows that very few other CoVs have such low PID M values as SARS-CoV-2, and unlike disorder levels in N proteins, none of the SARS-CoV-2 bat cousins are close to such low PID M . The closest counterparts found in this sample include caninerespiratory CoV and bovine CoV. This is likely a reflection of the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 M protein had evolved in an intermediary host. Indeed, there has been much debate with regard to the possibility of a snake or pangolin serving as intermediary host for SARS-CoV-2. 40, 41 Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 is now know to infect domesticated animals, such as cats and dogs. 42 Our model seems to imply that there is probably a non-bat intermediary host in which the virus had for just enough time for its M protein to evolve, but its N protein probably needed a longer time to evolve outside the original bat host, and our data show that the N protein did not have a chance to evolve in an animal host other than bats.",

Correlations between inner shell disorder and virulence have been previously discovered among a large variety of viruses, such as NiV, EBOV, and flaviviruses, such as Zika (ZIKV), Dengue (DENV), and yellow fever (YFV) viruses. Figure 2 represents the links between case-fatality rates (CFR) and inner shell disorder levels among a variety of viruses. While Figure 2A show some evidence of a link between SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 virulence and PID N , Figure 2B , 18 The nucleocapsid, nucleoprotein, and capsid of NiV, EBOV, and DENV are denoted by N, NPm, and C, respectively. 14 As also seen in Figure 2 , the high correlations (R) as seen in the coefficients of determination (R 2 ) of greater than 0.25 for the various viruses reveal strong correlations between virulence and inner shell disorder. Further details pertaining to the correlations between virulence and inner shell disorder among the mentioned viruses can be found in previous papers. 10 Figure 2A shows that there is a link between SARS CFR and PID N . While the actual CFR for SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial, reasonably and commonly measured CFR for SARS-CoV-2 is in the range of 0.5\u22125%. SARS-CoV-2 is generally believed to be less severe than SARS-CoV, which has a CFR of about 10%. 49\u221252 However, it should be noted that establishing a link between virulence and PID N among CoV is an intricate matter, since CoVs are genetically diverse and have 4 genera. Furthermore, CoVs infect a large variety of animal hosts with different virulence and often use different host receptors. For instance, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter the host cell using the ACE2 receptor, while MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase-4 DPP4. 7,26 Even more confusingly, MERS-CoV has a 35% CFR for humans, but is generally harmless to its predominant camel host. 9 Incidentally, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 lie within the same lineage of \u03b2-CoVs and share close to 80% in genomic sequence identity, whereas MERS-CoV has only 50% sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2. 53 For these reasons, MERS-CoV cannot be included in the correlation.",

The previously mentioned link among virulence, modes of transmission, and disorder of N protein may seem like a perplexing enigma, but it is not. When we built the CoV shell model before 2012, the viruses were clustered into levels of respiratory potentials in line with the ordering of PID N . The reason has to do with the fact that the viral loads found in saliva and mucus of the infected person have to be above certain minimal levels before the virus can becomes infectious via the respiratory modes of transmission. 2, 3, 11 Similarly, in the case of virulence, death often occurs when the viral load in the human body crosses a certain threshold. 7,10,15\u221219 Inner shell disorder holds the connection for these two phenomena, as the inner shell is intimately involved in the viral replication process.",

This is the reason that correlations of virulence and inner shell disorder are easily found in a large variety of related and unrelated viruses. The ability to rapidly replicate utilizing the advantages of the inner shell disorder is also manifested as greater respiratory potential, as this will also allow for greater viral load in body fluids, such as saliva and mucus, not just in the blood and internal organs.

We have seen that inner shell disorder is likely to be responsible for fast replication of many viruses. Since this virulence arises form the increased viral load caused by greater disorder in the inner shell protein, a strategy for developing an attenuated vaccine would be to find ways of reducing disorder of N protein in the case of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine strain would therefore be more optimally attenuated if the virus is still able to replicate but only very slowly so as to maintain the lowest possible viral load. Figure 3 shows the RNA binding domain of the N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with the disordered regions represented in red. It can be observed that the N protein from SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3A ) contains noticeably more disordered regions than the N protein from MHV ( Figure 3B) , even though the MHV PID N (46%) is just moderately lower than the SARS-CoV-2 PID N (48%). Since Figure 3 represents the structures of the RNA binding domain, it is likely that the greater disorder differences lie in this region. The reason that MHV is chosen in Figure 3B is that its data is easily accessible in PDB. There are, of course, CoVs with lower PID N values as seen in Table 1 . One illustrative example is shown in Figure 4 representing data for the close cousin of MHV, HCOV-HKU1, which has the lowest PID N among the CoV samples shown in Table 1 .",

We have seen that N disorder is likely a large factor in virulence, as it might contribute to greater viral load in the body. The next question Journal of Proteome Research pubs.acs.org/jpr Reviews is then: How do we mutate SARS-CoV-2 such that it becomes optimally attenuated without it dying out from being totally unable to replicate? A strategy would be to compare the N sequences and disorder patterns of a CoV with a lower PID N to those of SARS-CoV-2. Figure 4A represents the PONDR VLXT plots for SARS-CoV-2 (blue), SARS-CoV (red), and HCOV-HKU1 (dashed green). Disordered regions are denoted by the PONDR VLXT scores of 0.5 or above. Keeping in mind that PID N of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and HCOV-HKU1 are 48%, 50%, and 37%, respectively, we can see plenty of regions, which are disordered in SARS-CoV-2 but are not in HCOV-HKU1. These regions make good potential targets in the development of vaccine candidates. It should be restated that HCOV-HKU1 was chosen because of its lowest PID N , but there could also be other good N proteins with low PID that can be used to compare with the SARS-CoV-2 N disorder pattern. Any N protein from category C, as seen in Table 1 , could be a potential comparative candidate to be be used for the attenuation of SARS-CoV-2, but it is obviously wiser to choose the ones with a lower PID N so as to ensure the design of a potential vaccine strain that is sufficiently attenuated and to prevent, as much as we could, the vaccine strain from mutating back to its virulent self\ue0d5as we have seen in the case of Sabin polio vaccine. 7, 11, 14 Sequence Analysis. Upon study of Figure 4A , one region that sticks out is a disorder peak around locations 74\u221299, which is labeled as \"X\" in the graph. Apparently, this is a region where the largest differences in disorder propensity lie, not just between SARS-CoV-2 and HCOV-HKU1, but also between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. This area falls within the RNA binding domain approximately at locations 1\u2212140. Figure 4B shows a BLASTP (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast. cgi?PAGE=Proteins) alignment of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 of part of the N proteins. A large gap in disorder differences can be found around locations 17\u221227 ( Figure  4A ,B) that is likely to be responsible for the slight difference (48% vs 50%) in N PIDs between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The source of the differences can be found in a specific mutation, within the same region. This involves a single amino acid mutation of S (Serine) to T (Threonine) ( Figure 4B ) that can be seen when we compare SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV. Serine (S) is more polar than threonine (T) and is therefore more disorder inducing. 25\u221227 We can also see, in Figure 4C , a large number of amino acid replacements from polar residues to nonpolar residues when we compare the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and HCOV-HKU1 N proteins, respectively. Disorder and order inducting residues are generally polar and nonpolar, respectively. 25\u221227 All these provide for a wide range of potential mutations available for use in order to induce greater order to SARS-CoV-2 N protein while attempting to attenuate the virus.",

Figure 5 summarizes the dangers and implications of viruses with higher outer shell. While we have seen that greater inner shell disorder causes virulence, viruses with higher levels of outer shell disorder, on the other hand, can cause higher morbidity. For example, ZIKV can inflict higher morbidity on fetus by causing microcephaly, i.e., small head and brain. Figure 5A shows that ZIKV has a higher outer shell disorder (PID M = 29%), 17 which is exceptionally high especially among its flavivirus cousins. This is in sharp contrast to the DENV PID M of 10%, and although DENV2 causes microcephaly, it does it at a much lower rate. 17 As for the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, while more data are needed, it is currently observed that the viruses generally harm the fetus of a pregnant woman. 61 The main reason for the link between outer shell disorder and morbidity has to do with the greater ability of viruses with higher outer shell disorder to penetrate organs as the placenta and brain. 7, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] 34 This is likely the result of greater binding promiscuity resulting from higher disorder.",

            "text": "Yet another risk of increasing levels of disorder in M protein in the attempt to attenuate a virus is that it could backfire and actually thwart the effectiveness of vaccine by reducing the ability of the vaccine to elicit immune response. It has been known that some viruses, including HIV, HSV, and HCV, evade the host immune system by having highly disordered outer shells, thereby decreasing the ability of antibodies to bind Journal of Proteome Research pubs.acs.org/jpr Reviews firmly to the viral surface glycoproteins. 7, 15, 16, 34 Further discussion on this immune-evasion mechanism is presented in the next paragraph. Feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Development: Encouraging News . The search for effective vaccines for  HIV, HCV, and HSV has taken approximately 40, 30, and 100 years, respectively, with failures. The possibility of such failures would definitely be a nightmarish scenario for COVID-19. As mentioned, the research in this paper is actually a spin-off from parent research that began about 15 years ago. 6, 7, 15, 16, 34 The parent research has found that the reason for the difficulties in finding effective vaccines for these viruses has to do with the way that they are transmitted, and their relationships with sexual transmission that leads to the highly disordered outer shells. As a result of the motions of the outer shell proteins, neutralizing antibodies are not able to bind tightly to the surface proteins. Figure 5B provides encouraging news as the outer shell PIDs of HSV, HCV, and HIV look nothing like those of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 5A ), and all CoV samples that we have examined in Table 1 . The HIV-1, HCV, and HSV maximal outer shell PIDs reach 70%, 53%, and 63%, 7,16 respectively, in contrast to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 PID M values of 8% and 6%. As seen, the CoVs have relatively hard outer shells (M), while highly disordered outer shells have been detected for HSV, HCV, and HIV. CoVs need the harder outer shell to survive in the environment longer, given that they are transmitted via respiratory and fecal\u2212oral modes, whereas HIV, HCV, and HSV, on the other hand, do not need to remain in the environment for long, as they can be usually spread by sexual intercourse or needle sharing.
