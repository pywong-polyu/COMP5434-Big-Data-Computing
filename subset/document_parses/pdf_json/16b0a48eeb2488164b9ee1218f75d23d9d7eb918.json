Most research on this location probability learning (LPL) effect uses 2-dimensional (2D) search environments that are distinct from real-world search contexts, and the few studies on LPL in 3-dimensional (3D) contexts include complex visual cues or foraging tasks and therefore may not tap into the same habit-like learning mechanism as 2D LPL. The present study aimed to establish a baseline evaluation of LPL in controlled 3D search environments using virtual reality. The use of a virtual 3D search environment allowed us to compare LPL for information within a participant's initial field of view to LPL for information behind participants, outside of the initial field of view. Participants searched for a letter T on the ground among letter Ls in a large virtual space that was devoid of complex visual cues or landmarks. The T appeared in one target-rich quadrant of the floor space on half of the trials during the training phase. The target-rich quadrant appeared in front of half of the participants and behind the other half. LPL was considerably greater in the former condition than in the latter. This reveals an important constraint on LPL in real-world environments and indicates that consistent search patterns and consistent egocentric spatial coding are essential for this form of visual statistical learning in 3D environments.",

Previous research has identified several mechanisms that support visual search, including search history (Awh et al. 2012) . Imagine yourself standing in the center of your living room, searching for your keys, glasses, or the TV remote. Presumably, you have searched for these objects in this space before, and that search history may inform your current search (Oliva et al. 2004 ). However, the vast majority of research on selection history effects thus far lack one key component of real-world search environments: their 3D nature, which results in the need for search both in front of and behind one's initial field of view. 1 As a result, the mechanisms by which selection history guides search in 3D navigable environments, where search involves turning one's body and reorienting, rather than just oculomotor movements, remain unclear. The current study investigates the role of selection history in visual search in 3D environments using virtual reality.",

When a search target disproportionately appears in one \"target-rich\" region of a computer monitor, participants harness that statistical regularity, becoming faster at finding targets when they Sisk et al. Cogn. Research (2021) 6:21 appear in that region than when they appear elsewhere (Druker and Anderson 2010; Geng and Behrmann 2002; Miller 1988) . LPL can guide search independently of conscious awareness , and the attentional bias that participants develop toward the target-rich region is lasting and robust: participants retain this attentional preference for an extended period of time after learning , the preference persists in the face of added cognitive load , and aging and serious neurological conditions do not interfere with the acquisition or expression of LPL . These findings suggest that LPL is supported by repeated shifts of attention in space, resulting in a robust attentional bias or preference akin to a search habit .",

            "text": "The robust nature of LPL suggests that the effect should extend to search in large-scale 3D environments. Indeed, two lines of previous research have observed evidence of LPL in either visual search in complex outdoor environments (Jiang et al. 2014; or foraging in an indoor controlled environment (Smith et al. 2010 ). In Jiang et al. (2014) , participants searched for a coin on the ground in an outdoor search space. Unbeknownst to participants, the coin more often appeared in one region of the ground. Participants developed LPL, exhibiting not only faster search time but also an increased tendency to turn their head in the direction of the high-probability region. Smith et al. (2010) created a visually sparse indoor 3D environment that consisted of an empty room surrounded by black curtains with colored lights embedded into the floor. All of the lights were initially the same color. Participants had to press switches next to the lights embedded in the floor until they found the light that changed colors when the switch was pressed. Because the target was not defined by visual characteristics until the participant actively interacted with it, the task involved foraging rather than visual search. As in 2D LPL studies, the target appeared in one region-either the left or the right half of the room-more often (80% of all trials) than the other region (20% of all trials). Participants located the target more quickly in the \"rich\" side of the room if they began each search trial from the same starting point. Thus, despite increased size and complexity of the search environment, when the target frequently appears in one region of space, participants appear to have the capacity to acquire LPL.",

Real-world search experiments (e.g., Jiang et al. 2014) were conducted in natural environments that provided rich visual cues, such as landmarks, which could lead to high levels of explicit awareness about the target's location probability. The floor-light foraging task of Smith et al. (2010) did not contain rich visual cues, but the task took many seconds to complete and entailed complex foraging strategies, yielding a pattern of navigation behavior that distinguished it from visually guided search (Pellicano et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2008) . In fact, participants in both Jiang et al. (2014) and Smith et al. (2010) achieved high levels of explicit awareness, with the majority of them correctly identifying the target-rich region when probed. If the learning effect observed in these 3D tasks is driven by explicit awareness of where the target-rich region is, then LPL in these 3D tasks may reflect goal-driven attentional guidance, rather than implicitly guided search habits.",

To understand LPL in 3D search environments, where search involves the space behind one's starting position, it is necessary to first characterize LPL in highly controlled 3D environments in the absence of rich visual cues or complex foraging strategies. Only then can we systematically evaluate the influence of various environmental features, such as landmarks, navigability, and spatial scale on selection history effects in searching for items outside of the initial field of view.",

This provides a \"baseline\" for future research on selection history effects in such large-scale environments. Although removing discrete visual cues eliminates the possibility of associating landmarks with target probabilities, it does not preclude participants from acquiring explicit awareness of the target's location probability through learning the room geometry.

            "text": "Finally, we aimed to test whether LPL is equivalent, regardless of whether target-rich locations appear in front of someone or behind that person. Although humans are capable of representing space that is outside of the field of view, the computational demands of attending to space in front us are different from the demands of attending to space behind us. Two primary computational distinctions can be noted. First, visual search among stimuli appearing in front of a participant is guided by perceptual properties of the search items. The integration of such perceptual representation with top-down goals is a hallmark of theories of visual search (Itti and Koch 2001; Treisman 1988; Wolfe et al. 2015) . In contrast, stimuli behind a participant cannot be seen, depriving participants of bottom-up sources of attentional guidance and preventing them from engaging in visually guided search. Instead, search for regions behind someone is initially guided only by internal representations, with perceptual features of the search stimuli becoming available only after participants have physically oriented toward that region. Previous studies showed that participants tend to rely on perception, rather than memory in search tasks (O'Regan 1992) . For example, participants frequently re-fixate the same object to extract different features of that object in visuomotor tasks instead of relying on memory for the object (Ballard et al. 1995; Droll and Hayhoe 2007) . When participants searched within the same environment but for different targets, search was not more efficient, despite the familiarity of the search environment (Oliva et al. 2004 ). This may again reflect a tendency to rely on perceptual cues, rather than memory for the locations of objects within a familiar environment. A possible result of this tendency may be that people attend to space in front of them differently than to space behind them due to the availability of perceptual cues only for the space in front of them. This could, in turn, influence their ability to learn from prior selection history within those regions.",

            "text": "Second, because search of space behind oneself depends on physically turning one's head or body, learning of a target-rich region behind oneself may be more challenging than learning of a target-rich region in front of oneself. Consider first a case in which the target-rich region is in the front right corner of the room relative to the initial perspective of a participant. Since this region is in front of the participant, they do not need to turn their body and reorient to find the target. Although the initial field of view does not include the entire front two quadrants of space if the search space is divided into four quadrants, participants in virtual reality studies typically use only head movements-not torso or body movements-when searching within this region (Sidenmark and Gellersen 2020) . This region is therefore consistently referenced as \"front right\" on each trial where the target appears in that part of the room. Now consider a case in which the target-rich region is in the back right corner of the room, relative to the initial perspective of a participant. To find the target, the participant has to turn and reorient. Yet the lack of visually guided features prevents participants from knowing which direction to turn-clockwise or counterclockwise. Because the participant may turn clockwise on some trials and counterclockwise on others, and because the participant may turn 90\u00ba on some trials and 180\u00ba on others before searching the back quadrants, the position of the target-rich region relative to the participant after reorienting will not be consistent across trials, even when its position in the room remains constant. Because LPL may depend on a viewer-centered representation of space Jiang et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2010) , the lack of consistent spatial coding introduced by spatial reorienting could impair LPL for target-rich regions behind the participant.",

Participants searched for a letter T among letter Ls on the floor of a large nondescript virtual room with sparse visual cues. Participants began each trial at the center of the square room, facing the same direction in the virtual space. They pressed a key on a handheld controller to begin each search trial. After the start key was pressed, distractor Ls and the target letter T appeared on the floor of the search space. Participants searched until they found the letter T, pressing another button on the controller when they identified the target. After identifying the target, they indicated whether the T was light gray or dark gray using their controller. During training, the target appeared in one quadrant of the floor on half of the trials, with that target-rich quadrant being counterbalanced across participants. This allowed us to assess whether participants could acquire LPL in a visually sparse 3D space, and whether learning differed depending on whether the target-rich regions appeared in front of or behind the participants.",

The experimenter monitored participants throughout the task to ensure they did not trip over the cord connecting the headset to the computer, they did not run into any obstacles in the real world, and they continued to follow instructions and turn to face the starting wall before starting a new search trial. Because participants rarely walked around during the experiment, they almost never had to be instructed to avoid real-world obstacles.

Most participants voluntarily unwound themselves between trials or stepped over the cord, though some required frequent reminders between trials from the experimenter.

Research (2021) 6:21 First head turn The position of participants' headsets in degrees along the x-, y-, and z-axes were output every 30 ms during the first two seconds of search. Participants were not given instructions regarding which direction to turn first during search, so on any given trial, they could turn their head to the left or to the right. We measured the direction of the first head turn by first identifying a time point at which the velocity of the head turn along the z-axis, or the azimuth, exceeded 20-deg/sec. Mean latency of the first head turn was 430 ms (SE = 31) overall. Mean latency on trials in which the target appeared in the rich quadrant was 425 ms (SE = 31), and mean latency on trials in which the target appeared in the sparse quadrant was 435 ms (SE = 31). There was not a significant difference in latency of the first head turn between rich and sparse trials, t(15) = 1.16, p = 0.26, Cohen's d = 0.29. We then compared the degrees on that plane at that time point to the starting value to calculate the direction-left or right-of the participant's first head turn. Then, we determined whether the target-rich quadrant was to the left or the right of each participant and coded each head turn as either a turn toward the rich quadrant (+ 1) or a turn away from the rich quadrant (\u22121). If there is no bias in the direction of head turns, the mean should be 0. A tendency to turn toward the rich quadrant should result in positive values (mean greater than 0). This analysis includes all trials, not just correct trials under 15 s. All trials were included because this analysis only considers the first 2000 ms of each trial in which the initial head turn is likely to occur. Trials in which participants take longer than 15 s to find the target or trials in which participants eventually make an incorrect response are unlikely to systematically differ from correct trials within the first 2000 ms of search. The same analysis excluding incorrect trials and trials over 15 s yielded the same pattern of results. Data are visible in Fig. 3 . First, it is worth noting that at the start of the experiment, participants did not demonstrate a preference toward turning in a particular direction. The average direction of the first head turn across all of the trials in Epoch 1 (M = 0.01, SE = 0.10) was not significantly different from 0, t < 1, meaning that participants turned both toward and away from the target-rich quadrant with equal frequency at the start of the experiment. Second, participants also did not develop a preference of turning toward the rich quadrant over time. The mean across all epochs (M = 0.08, SE = 0.10) was not significantly greater than 0, t < 1, and neither the mean of any individual epoch nor the mean of the training epochs differed significantly from 0 or from the mean of epoch 1, lowest p = 0.08. The same was true when analysis was limited to participants with the rich quadrant in front of them. An ANOVA on head turn data in the training phase with epoch as a within-subjects factor and direction of the rich quadrant (front or back) did not yield a significant effect of epoch, F(2, 28) = 1.53, p = 0.24, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.10, nor an interaction between epoch and direction of the rich quadrant, F < 1.",

An ANOVA on RT with epoch (1-5) and the target's general location (front or back) as within-subject factors and location of the rich quadrant (front or back) as a between-subjects factor found only a significant main effect of target location (slower response to targets appearing behind a participant), F(1, 14) = 269.72, p < 0.001, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.95, with no interaction between target location and location of the rich quadrant, F(1, 14) = 1.14, p = 0.30, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.08. This suggests that participants with a rich quadrant behind them did not show a significantly smaller RT cost when targets appeared behind them than participants with a rich quadrant in front of them. The cost, or the difference in RT between targets appearing behind and targets appearing in front of participants, was numerically smaller for those with a rich quadrant behind them (1906 ms) than for those with a rich quadrant in front of them (2178 ms), but this effect was not significant, t(14) = 1.06, p = 0.31, Cohen's d = 0.53.",

Because our study included set sizes 12 and 16, we examined whether search slope was shallower in the rich quadrant (see Table 2 ). This analysis was restricted to the group that showed LPL in RT, using data from the three training epochs where the effect was observed. An ANOVA on RT with set size and target quadrant as factors showed a significant main effect of quadrant, F(1,7) = 18.18, p = 0.004, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.72, but no significant effect of set size, F < 1, and no interaction between set size and quadrant, F < 1. Thus, we did not find evidence that LPL reduced search slope. The lack of a search slope effect might mean that LPL in 3D search environments did not enhance search efficiency. However, it is possible that we have missed a slope effect given the small number of observations in the targetsparse condition (averaging 11 trials per participant in each condition).

An ANOVA on RT with quadrant (rich or sparse) as a within-subjects factor and direction of the rich quadrant (front or back) as a between-subjects factor found both a significant effect of quadrant, F(1, 30) = 14.73, p = 0.001, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.33, and a significant interaction between quadrant and direction of the rich quadrant, F (1, 30) = 5.74, p = 0.02, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.16. Considering only participants with a rich quadrant behind them, there was no significant effect of quadrant, t(15) = 1.62, p = 0.13, Cohen's d = 0.40. Thus, doubling the sample size by combining these two studies still did not yield significant location probability learning in participants with a rich quadrant behind them.",

These findings demonstrate, on the one hand, the robust nature of LPL in large-scale visual search environments. On the other hand, they highlight a theoretically relevant limitation of LPL: Learning may be disrupted for information appearing outside of the initial field of view. Because participants whose rich quadrant was behind them had to frequently turn around to find the target, and because the direction and degrees of that turn were not entirely consistent from trial-to-trial, they were unable to accurately update and maintain statistical information about the target's location across many trials. This suggests that consistent search patterns are necessary for LPL to occur in large-scale 3D environments in the absence of rich environmental visual cues.",

In Jiang et al. (2014) , participants developed a habit of turning their head in the direction of the target-rich quadrant over the course of the experiment. Although we observed LPL in RT in participants with a rich quadrant in front of them, those participants did not tend to turn their head in the direction of the rich quadrant. The exact reasons for the difference in head turn results are unclear, but several factors may have contributed to the findings. First, the search stimuli were different between the two studies. Jiang et al. (2014) asked participants to search for a single coin on the ground. Although the coin was small and difficult to find within the visual noise of the concrete ground, it did not involve search for a target among discrete distractors as in the present study. This may have changed search behavior. In fact, the latency for the first head movement was considerably longer in the outdoor task (Won et al. 2016 ; mean 561 ms) than in the current study (~ 430 ms). It is possible that participants in the outdoor task turned their heads after they had spotted the target on some trials.",

In both cases, participants were allowed to wander throughout the search space, but participants rarely did so in VR-they tended to rotate, rather than walk around during search, as is frequently observed in VR contexts (Pausch et al. 1996) . The tendency to remain stationary, and the evident lack of navigational planning, may have precluded the formation of certain motorrelated habits. Experimentally induced movement, even in terms of required rotation or navigation, may increase the likelihood that statistical learning effects would be expressed in the pattern of head turns at the start of a search trial.

Might the lack of persistence indicate a lack of probability learning, with the bias observed in the training phase reflecting repetition priming effects? Further analysis suggests that repetition priming cannot explain the quadrant effects. In our study, the bias in the training phase existed independently of repetition priming effects, with the effect persisting when quadrant-repeat trials were removed. The lack of the effect in the testing phase then is likely attributable to one of two other factors. First, the relatively small number of training trials may have reduced the persistence of LPL. Typically, LPL studies include hundreds of training trials. Due to fatigue effects caused by virtual reality, the present study was limited to 144 training trials. This may have made the bias more susceptible to interference from the new, even statistical distribution in the testing phase.",

In the present study, search required both oculomotor movements and head movements, with the possibility of body movements as well. This may increase the difficulty of maintaining search biases in the absence of reinforcement, as procedural habits across many different systems must be maintained for an RT bias to persist. This may also have made it more difficult to detect search biases in RT alone. Considering these potential influences alongside the lack of dependence on repetition priming, our findings in the training phase likely do represent statistical learning, with the effect simply being more fragile and susceptible to interference in the testing phase than is typically observed in other LPL studies with longer training and simpler computerized search.",

On those repeated arrays, the positions of all of the distractors on all of the monitors and the target position repeated.

Like Shioiri et al. (2018) , Marek and Pollmann observed a contextual cueing effect that was present even when the target was outside of the initial field of view. Although the studies that observed intact contextual cueing in 3D search spaces did use simple stimuli that controlled for the influence of visual complexity, contextual cueing represents a form of visual statistical learning that may be mechanistically distinct from LPL (see Sisk et al. 2018 Sisk et al. , 2019 . Contextual cueing involves learning of associations between the locations of distractors and the target's location, whereas LPL involves repeated shifts of attention to one region of space across many search trials. The distinction between the two types of visual statistical learning is particularly relevant in the context of a transition to a 3D search space. Contextual cueing, which relies on memory for the relative positions of the distractors and target, may be particularly robust to changes in the local search space that occur as one turns and reorients during search. This is because regardless of one's orientation, the association between the distractor array and the target location is maintained. LPL, on the other hand, requires a consistent search pattern that may be disrupted by the turning and reorienting that occurs during search in 3D environments.",

It is worth noting that both participants with a target-rich quadrant in front and those with a target-rich quadrant in back had to turn around during search frequently, so reorientation during search does not inherently interfere with LPL. However, participants with a rich quadrant behind them had to reorient more frequently, and more crucially, they had to reorient before finding the target and coding its location. Participants with a rich quadrant in front of them often found and identified the target without having to turn and reorient, so its coding was consistent-if the target-rich quadrant was to their upper right when they began the trial, it was still to their upper right when they found the target. Participants with a rich quadrant in back, however, had to turn their bodies before finding the target in the rich quadrant, since the rich quadrant was not within their starting fields of view. If the target-rich quadrant were behind them and to the right, they may sometimes turn 90\u00b0 to the right and find the target in the rich quadrant in a position that is in their upper right visual field. Other times, however, they may turn 180\u00ba to the left and find the target in the rich quadrant in a position that is in their upper left visual field. Thus, it is not the simple frequency with which one reorients across all search trials that disrupts LPL-it is primarily the inconsistency of the rich quadrant's position relative to the participant when they find the target there. If participants were required to turn in the same direction on every search trial, we may expect those with rich quadrants behind them to show an emergence of LPL. However, the lack of LPL in the testing epoch when the probability distribution was even, even in participants with a target-rich quadrant in front of them, may suggest that the frequency of reorienting does interfere with expression of LPL after learning has occurred.",

Searching for the target when it frequently appears behind a participant may interfere with the coding of the location of the rich quadrant, making it more difficult to acquire LPL. It may also interfere with the expression of LPL, as participants may be slowed by their proclivity for searching for the target in front of them first and their over-reliance on potentially misleading visual cues, effectively masking the LPL effect. This may explain why those with a rich quadrant behind them were numerically slower at finding the target when it appeared behind them than those with a rich quadrant in front of them. It may also have contributed to the lack of an LPL effect in the testing phase, whereby even those who had been trained with a rich quadrant in front of them were slowed by their tendency to rely on visual information, rather than memory. However, those with a rich quadrant in front of them did appear to rely on memory during search, as demonstrated by the significant LPL in that group, so search was not entirely guided by perceptual cues, even in the group that frequently had access to a perceptual view of the target. Regardless, this tendency to rely on perception, rather than memory, represents an additional computational challenge to LPL in 3D search environments where targets can appear either in front of or behind one's starting position.",

Before in-person testing was halted, we collected preliminary data in two conditions: one in which the participant's starting orientation changed randomly from trial to trial while the rich quadrant's location in room coordinates remained constant (allocentric learning condition) and one in which the participant's starting orientation changed while the rich quadrant's location relative to the starting orientation on each trial remained constant (egocentric learning condition). While we have been unable to collect enough data to report in a published manuscript, our data thus far showed evidence of learning in the egocentric learning condition, but only for those with a target-rich quadrant in front of them. No evidence of learning was observed in the allocentric learning condition. This finding suggests that rich locations may be coded in an egocentric reference frame, though further data collection is needed to confirm this finding.",

One potential reason for why we did not observe learning for those with a rich quadrant behind them in the present study but Jiang et al. (2014) did find a larger (though still not significant) effect in that group could be the presence of rich visual environmental cues in the latter study. We created an experiment that is identical to the one presented here except for the addition of a visually rich environment surrounding the search space. The data from four participants resemble the findings observed here, with no evidence of learning in the group with the rich quadrant behind them. However, during testing it became clear that participants did not pay attention to the visual environment, as it simply surrounded the search space and did not have any bearing on search itself. In fact, some participants noted more than halfway through testing that they had just realized that there was a visual environment surrounding the floor of the search space. It will be important to create experimental settings in which the visual details surrounding the search space are integrated with the search space, and not automatically filtered out.",

Location probability learning is a powerful effect that is robust to aging, cognitive load, and serious neurological disorders. It therefore has the potential to greatly improve search efficiency in many real-world search tasks, if the proper training can be provided. In order to utilize location probability learning in real-world search, however, researchers must first understand i) the capacity of the effect in 3-dimensional search environments and ii) the factors that modulate this kind of visual statistical learning in 3-dimensional search environments. The present study provides a crucial baseline by exploring location probability learning in 3-dimensional search spaces while controlling for confounding factors like complex visual cues or landmarks. The observation that location probability learning is weaker when targets most often appear behind a person is critical in considerations of location probability learning in real-world contexts, as many real-world search contexts involve search of space outside of one's initial field of view. Future research may focus on identifying the factors that allow participants to overcome this limitation of location probability learning while maintaining the implicit, habitual nature of location probability learning that likely underlies its resistance to aging, cognitive load, and neurological disorders.",
