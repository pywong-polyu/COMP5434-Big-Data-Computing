Widely used medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been flagged as having the potential to cause harm in the context of COVID-19. It is unknown if the benefits of NSAID use in the orthopedic population will outweigh the potential risks of increased morbidity in COVID-19 orthopedic patients. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of the use of NSAIDs in the orthopedic patient with COVID-19, focusing on the effects of NSAIDs on the inflammatory process, the role of NSAIDs in orthopedics, and the associations between NSAID use and complications of pneumonia. Results: We found that it may be appropriate to consider NSAID use in otherwise healthy orthopedic patients with COVID-19 and significant pain. Conclusions: In this context, we recommend that NSAIDs be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible in orthopedic patients with COVID-19. However, pending further data and based on the concerns outlined in this review, we recommend avoiding NSAIDs in orthopedic patients with significant comorbidities and those who are undergoing major orthopedic surgery.",

Such complications may be particularly severe in elderly people and those with underlying health conditions [47] . One of the hallmarks of severe COVID-19 is the contribution of a dysfunctional immune response to disease progression as a result of an aggressive inflammatory response [38] . In the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19, many commonly available drugs have been examined for potential utility in managing this complicated disease. However, other widely used medications have been flagged as having the potential to cause harm in the context of COVID-19 [13] . In March 2020, the French Health Minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, claimed on Twitter that anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or cortisone might aggravate COVID-19, stimulating widespread global concern about these classes of otherwise useful drugs [43] . Approximately 1 in 15 adults in the USA use prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and nearly half have used nonprescription NSAIDs during the COVID-19 pandemic [28] . In the realm of acute and chronic pain management, the potential impact of empiric avoidance of NSAIDs could be vast.",

Prostaglandins (PGs) mediate diverse physiologic effects in different tissues, ranging from allergic responses and bronchoconstriction to vasoconstriction/vasodilation, platelet aggregation, sleep regulation, pain, inflammation, and maintenance of the gut mucosa [23] . Thus, while NSAIDs are appealing for their antipyretic and analgesic effects, the potential deleterious effects of selective and non-selective COX inhibition in various tissues must be considered. The most common complications of NSAIDs encountered in clinical practice are gastric ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal injury, and coronary vascular events (especially with COX-2 inhibitors).",

            "text": "However, NSAIDs as a class may be considered to be a potential risk factor for increased COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. One concern is that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has a viral envelope with glycoprotein spikes that bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) on cell surfaces and fuse with cell membranes [2] . ACE-2 is expressed in high levels on alveolar epithelial cells and is considered to be both an essential infectious route for SARS coronaviruses and a key contributor to associated lung pathology [19, 30] . It has been widely reported that NSAIDs may increase COVID-19 risk by increasing expression of ACE-2 [6, 22] . However, this hypothesis hinges entirely on data from a diabetic mouse model of cardiac fibrosis in which abnormally low ACE-2 levels were corrected by ibuprofen administration [31] . It is unclear how or if this study is relevant to human ACE-2 expression in the lung or any other tissue in diabetic or nondiabetic patients. It is also not clear if the observed experimental effect was specific to ibuprofen or applicable to other NSAIDs. Moreover, even should NSAIDs be shown to increase ACE-2 expression similarly to the use of ACE-1 inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) [2] , preliminary evidence does not support an association with increased risk or severity of COVID-19. A database analysis of approximately 5894 COVID-19 patients (2573 who had hypertension) found no association between any single medication class (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics) and an increased risk of severe COVID-19 [32] . Previous treatment with antihypertensive medications also was not associated with a higher risk of testing positive for COVID-19 [32] .",

In severe cases of COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is often associated with the development of a cytokine release syndrome characterized by persistent fevers with increased levels of inflammatory markers such as ferritin, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [11, 12] . As PGs can both promote and attenuate inflammation, the impact of various NSAIDs on the inflammatory pathology of COVID-19 remains unclear. Moreover, severe COVID-19 is strongly associated with risk of renal injury, myocardial events, and thrombotic complications [14, 15, 45] , any of which may be exacerbated by the known risk profiles of various NSAIDs [17, 20, 23] . Observational studies suggest a higher rate of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 inpatients, with 75% having abnormal urine dipstick test results, 44% with proteinuria, 27% with hematuria, and approximately 14% with elevated serum creatinine/blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 mL/min [5, 29, 48] . Acute kidney injury occurs in approximately 5 to 15% of COVID-19 inpatients [5, 48] . Evidence of myocardial injury has been reported in 7 to 20% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients [10, 16, 35] . Incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been described in as many as 46% of inpatients, with 31% incidence reported in an intensive care unit (ICU) population despite thromboprophylaxis, and evidence of cardiac injury is seen in approximately 20% in hospitalized and critically ill patients [18, 35] .",

Of these patients, 15% had filled an NSAID prescription within 60 days before the index date. The authors found an association between NSAID intake and increased risk of pleuropulmonary complications (pneumonia, lung abscess, pyothorax, or pleural effusion) with the highest risk observed in patients with a recent NSAID prescription filled within 0-7 days before CAP [3] . An observational study (n = 106) in CAP patients requiring ICU admission found that the 20 patients who received NSAIDs within 4 days of ICU admission were younger with fewer comorbidities but were more likely to have complicated pleural effusions or pleuropulmonary complications [25] . Finally, in a small observational study of 90 CAP inpatients admitted to the ICU, stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that patients who had taken NSAIDs prior to hospital admission had a higher rate of pleuropulmonary complications, such as pleural empyema and lung cavitation [40] . It is unclear whether the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of NSAIDs directly affect the clinical course of CAP or if the observed complications result from delayed treatment in the context of suppression of symptoms [21, 25, 40] .",
