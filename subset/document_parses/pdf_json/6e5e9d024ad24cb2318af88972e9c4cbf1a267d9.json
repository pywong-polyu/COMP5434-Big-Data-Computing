We employ a novel concept masking paradigm where the term occurrences were replaced by a dummy token. Thus, essentially we remove the entire vocabulary associated with these entities from our training corpus. This inductive bias guides the model to make inference using the surrounding context alone and helps us achieve state-of-the-art results on biomedical entity recognition problem 1 . We use a transformer architecture 2 with the following three joint end-to-end multitask learning objectives: 1) masked token prediction 2) next sentence prediction 3) entity type prediction. We train the word piece tokenization algorithm on our in-house corpus to generate a vocabulary set of 30000 word pieces. The network had 8 encoder layers with each layer composed of self-attention followed by a feedforward network. Positional encodings were used in the beginning. We will have an elaborate publication on this at a later date 1 .",

The third candidate is Ribavirin which is very popular anitviral drug effective against many different species of virus. At first, these results surprised us. However, some of the recent experiments have corroborated our findings. The interferon signalling system plays a key role in immune system response to virus infestations. It was observed in recent study the SARS-CoV-2 suppresses the induction of type I interferons while aggravating IL-6 response. These results suggest an important immune imbalance where low levels of interferons reduces the hosts ability to contain the viral replication, and the activation of IL-6 immune responses promotes inflammation15 .
