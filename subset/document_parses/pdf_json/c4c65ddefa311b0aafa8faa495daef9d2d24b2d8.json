            "text": "Individuals with DS have more risk of infections with respiratory complications and present signs of auto-inflammation. They also present with multiple comorbidities that are associated with poorer COVID-19 prognosis in the general population. All this might place DS individuals at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or poorer clinical outcomes. In order to get insight into the interplay between DS genes and SARS-cov2 infection and pathogenesis we identified the genes associated with the molecular pathways involved in COVID-19 and the host proteins interacting with viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2. We then analyzed the overlaps of these genes with HSA21 genes, HSA21 interactors and other genes consistently differentially expressed in DS (using public transcriptomic datasets) and created a DS-SARS-CoV-2 network. We detected COVID-19 protective and risk factors among HSA21 genes and interactors and/or DS deregulated genes that might affect the susceptibility of individuals with DS both at the infection stage and in the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our analysis suggests that at the infection stage DS individuals might be more susceptible to infection due to triplication of TMPRSS2, that primes the viral S protein for entry in the host cells. However, as the anti-viral interferon I signaling is also upregulated in DS, this might increase the initial antiviral response, inhibiting viral genome release, viral replication and viral assembly. In the second pro-inflammatory immunopathogenic phase of the infection, the prognosis for DS patients might worsen due to upregulation of inflammatory genes that might favor the typical cytokine storm of COVID-19. We also detected strong downregulation of the NLRP3 gene, critical for maintenance of homeostasis against pathogenic infections, possibly leading to bacterial infection complications.",

            "text": "The recent outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 86 million cases of COVID-19 and is responsible for almost 2 million deaths (08/01/2020; https://covid19.who.int/), with figures expected to rise in the coming months. COVID-19 is particularly severe in elderly individuals (> 60 years old), especially those with chronic medical conditions (i.e., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or cancer). However, fast spread of SARS-Cov-2 infection has precluded the study of other possibly vulnerable populations, such as individuals with intellectual disability (ID). Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic form of ID. Individuals with DS present with comorbidities, such as obesity, type I diabetes or congenital heart disease (CHD), that are associated with poorer COVID-19 prognosis in the general population. Hypotonia, developmental delay, obstructive sleep apnea, craniofacial anomalies, immune deficiency, and cardiac problems, as well as gastroesophageal reflux, are also frequent in DS and contribute to the increased risk of respiratory tract infections 1 . Individuals with DS also develop more severe complications during other viral respiratory infections such as influenza 2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 3 , including pneumonia, hospitalization, intubation and greater mortality due to secondary bacterial infections. Another risk factor is that immune response is substantially impaired in DS 4 . Deficits in trisomic individuals include functional anomalies in a variety of immune cells (i.e., T-and B-cells, monocytes and neutrophils), and, of importance to vaccine-development, suboptimal antibody responses 5 . A number of studies found reductions in T and B cells, and increases in serum inflammatory cytokine levels in peripheral blood of people with DS, suggesting suboptimal immunization 6 . In the general population, severe COVID-19 patients typically show increased cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, IL-7 and TNF-\u03b1) 7 , lymphopenia (in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells), and decreased IFN-\u03b3 expression in CD4+ T cells. Those are associated with severe COVID-19 and the so-called \"cytokine storm\" 8 , an excessive immune response to external stimuli that predicts worse COVID-19 prognosis 9 and correlates with the severity of pathogenic coronavirus infections 10 . DS is characterized by an 'inflammatory priming' of immune cells, which is in line with the elevated levels of cytokines 11 in blood in the absence of viral infections 12 . Furthermore, the interferon response (IFN), key for initiating and amplifying cytokine release, is chronically overactive in DS 13 and Interferon Alpha and Beta Receptor Subunits 1 and 2 (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2), that form a heterodimeric interferon receptor, are also triplicated in trisomic cells. Finally, recent evidence suggests that an increase in Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expression results in increased infection/ establishment of infection with lower viral titers. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. The TMPRSS2 gene, located on Chr21q22 14,15 , encodes for a serine protease that proteolytically activates the S protein for its interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor, allowing the entrance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the host cell 16 . In fact, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry has been proposed as a treatment option 15 . In theory, all these factors could lead to a more vulnerable scenario in DS, induced by the triplication of the genes encoded by human chromosome 21 (HSA21). However, gene expression studies showed that, even if HSA21 shows the highest percentage of differentially expressed genes, the transcriptome deregulation extends genome wide, with many non-HSA21 genes upregulated or downregulated 17,18 . To understand the potential differential impact of COVID19 in individuals with DS compared to the general population, we here mapped the transcriptomic changes induced by the trisomy onto the pathways and proteins known to be affected by SARS-CoV-2. We reasoned that besides TMPRSS2, other genes consistently deregulated in DS could define genetic risk factors of DS-COVID19 comorbidity. We analyzed 69 DS transcriptomic and proteomic studies and we detected that genes mapping on HSA21 were consistently deregulated across different tissues and states. We also reasoned that the levels of proteins interacting with or regulated by HSA21 genes (HSA21 interactors) are more likely to be deregulated in cases of trisomy 21. We then analyzed their overlap with molecular pathways involved in COVID-19 and the host proteins interacting with viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and created a DS-SARS-CoV-2 network.",

We therefore connected these genes based on their functional and physical annotated interactions ( Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Approximately half of the nodes in the DS-SARS-CoV-2 network (55/114 nodes) contained proteins involved in host Covid-19 related pathways, while the other half (59/114 nodes) contained host proteins known to interact with viral proteins. Six of these nodes were HSA21 genes, and 92 HSA21 interactors.

TMPRSS2 was upregulated across the different DS studies, with a median fold change of 1.59, in cortical tissue 31, 32 , white blood cells 33 , lymphoblastoid cell lines 31 , iPSCs 34 , mouse fetal liver and placental tissue 35 (Fig. 3A ). This suggests that the proteolytic activation of the viral spike protein (S-protein) for its interaction with the receptor ACE2, would be favored in DS, allowing increased entrance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the host cell. Conversely, we found downregulation of the endosomal protease cathepsin B (CatB) that, similarly to cathepsin L (CatL), could also prime S-protein, suggesting that the preferential virus entry in DS is through TMPRSS2. In fact, only TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host whereas CatB/L activity is dispensable [36] [37] [38] . However, ACE2 itself is not consistently differentially expressed, and it is not even a HSA21 interactor. We found ACE2 (Fig. 3B ) upregulated in DS human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 34 , downregulated in peripheral blood from DS individuals 39 ; slightly upregulated in the hippocampus of the DS model Ts1Cje (6-7 months old) 40 , DS human postnatal inferior temporal cortex 32 32, 42 , one of the HSA21 interactors revealed in our analysis, and of the metalloprotease CPA3, that is normally upregulated in asthma patients. BDKRB1 upregulation, as part of the kallikrein-kinin system, could determine a higher susceptibility in DS individuals to ARDS. Following viral binding, ACE2 expression and activity is eventually downregulated by the virus through multiple mechanisms, preventing it from performing its usual function in states of health 43 . The downregulation of ACE2 signaling induces the kallikreinkinin system which is activated during inflammatory conditions with vascular-alveolar fluid extravasation, leukocyte extravasation and recruitment to the lung and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung injury and pneumonia 44 .",

IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 initiate the innate antiviral immune response, that leads to the phosphorylation of STAT1-STAT2, that dimerize and activate transcription of inflammatory genes in the nucleus. OAS1 and OAS2 are two HSA21 interactor proteins, activated by the interferon signaling pathway, leading to activation of the RNAseL that, in turn, leads to the degradation of the viral genome 54 . On the other hand, Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kB) inhibitor alpha, is activated by the inflammatory NF-kB signaling and inhibits the translocation of the same NF-kB into the nucleus. With the exception of IFNA1 expression, type I interferons (IFNA2 and IFNB1) were all upregulated, indicating that the axis IFNAR-STAT-OAS is upregulated in Down syndrome. A recent paper shows that SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is an interferon-stimulated gene in human airway epithelial cells and is detected in specific cell subsets across tissues 55 . Therefore, we predict that virus entry might be significantly increased in DS patients that have both an increased interferon signaling and triplication of the protein S-priming through TMPRSS2.",

In this pathway we found 7 genes downregulated (BCL2 31 13, 32, 41, 49, 51, 57 ) . Interestingly, some of these proteins, such as Interferon Induced Transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1), Interferon Induced protein 27 (IFI27) and Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 precursor (BST2), are all interferon-induced proteins with antiviral properties. Specifically, IFITM1 is active against multiple viruses, including SARS-CoV 64 , preventing the viral fusion after endocytosis and the release of viral contents into the cytosol. Fig. 1 is shown here for each of the WikiPathways, the biological process \"Viral life cycle\" and the KEGG pathway tight junction 30 . The color code indicates the gene mean log2FC from genes upregulated in DS (red) to genes downregulated in DS (blue). When this information is not known the gene is in dark gray color. 65 , leading to the cytokine storm. Given the higher basal inflammation in DS we would have expected the inflammasome to be upregulated. Instead, we detected a strong downregulation of the NLRP3 gene 39 , critical for maintenance of homeostasis against pathogenic infections 66 , along with lower levels of the gene for the NF-kB subunit RELA. Actually, even if the IFN-I signaling in the beginning induces an antiviral response, it eventually exerts an antiinflammatory action inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome through STAT1. Although this could potentially be beneficial in later stage to shut inflammation down, it could also be one of the reasons why DS patients with influenza often manifest bacterial infection complications 67 .",

As a matter of fact, coronavirus replication is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and this often induces ER stress, with subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR leads to the blockade of protein synthesis, and subsequent apoptosis through EIF2AK2 71 . EIF2AK2 is an interferon-induced serine-threonine protein kinase (PKR), that, once activated by the viral RNA, phosphorylates and inhibits the initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, preventing viral replication. The coronavirus' non-structural related protein 15 is an endoribonuclease that can inhibit EIF2AK2 preventing a premature block of protein synthesis upon viral infection 72 . However, in DS, EIF2AK2 levels are elevated 32, [40] [41] [42] , and therefore, once again, trisomic cells might be more resistant to this inhibition. Supporting this, the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1-alpha catalytic subunit PPP1CA, one of the three catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is also downregulated in DS 32, 42 , leading again to the translation shutoff mediated by phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1. proteins (squared nodes) we found that they were enriched in two main categories: the biological process \"viral life cycle\" and the KEGG pathway \"tight junction\" 30 . Among the first are worth mentioning the nucleoporin NUP62 33, 39 and NUP210 39, 42 , that are downregulated in DS. Upon viral infection, nucleoporins are normally degraded to suppress innate immune responses, and improve viral replication and transmission 73 . This may indicate altered virus-host interactions in DS leading to more efficient viral innate immune evasion 74 . As regards the tight junction pathway, we detected 4 genes upregulated and 2 downregulated in DS. Even though the net effect of these deregulations cannot be predicted, interestingly, many viruses, including coronaviruses, disrupt epithelial tight junctions of the respiratory tract that serve as a barrier to invaders 75 . Another interesting protein is a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1 (ADAMTS1) that interacts with the viral helicase/triphosphatase nsp13. While the significance of this interaction is unknown, it is known that ADAMTS1 is triplicated and upregulated in DS, both in blood datasets and in DS lung 13, 29, 39, 42, 76 , where it contributes to the global anti-angiogenic milieu leading to higher risk for developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in infants with DS.

Besides, individuals with DS present clinical history of infections, increased rates of hospitalization upon respiratory viral infections, and higher mortality rates from pneumonia and sepsis and the immune dysregulation caused by trisomy 21 may result in an exacerbated cytokine release syndrome relative to the euploid population.

At the infection stage, individuals with DS might be more susceptible to infection due to triplication of TMPRSS2. However, the upregulation of the anti-viral interferon I signaling in DS might increase anti-viral response, inhibiting viral genome release, viral Type I interferon  WikiPathway  IFNAR1, IFNAR2   CHUK, IKBKB,  NFKBIA, MAPK8,  MAPK14, JUN,  NFKB1, IFNA1,  IFNAR1, JAK1,  IFNAR2, TYK2,  STAT1, STAT2,  OAS1, OAS2, IRF3,  FOS, IRF9, OAS3   IFNAR1, IFNAR2,  EIF2AK2, FOS   NFKBIA, IFNAR1,  IFNAR2, STAT1,  STAT2, EIF2AK2,  OAS1, OAS2   MAPK14, IFNA1, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ replication and viral assembly. In the pro-inflammatory immunopathogenic phase of the infection, upregulation of inflammatory genes might favor the typical cytokine storm of COVID-19. Finally, the strong downregulation of NLRP3, critical for maintenance of homeostasis against pathogenic infections, may favour bacterial infection complications. On balance, we consider that DS individuals might be particularly at risk during this pandemic, both at the stage of infection and for the prognosis once the cytokine storms begin (Fig. 4 , Table 1 ). However, this increased risk may apply predominantly to DS individuals older than 40 years of age or those with significant comorbidities. Future epidemiological data would help to investigate this hypothesis.",
