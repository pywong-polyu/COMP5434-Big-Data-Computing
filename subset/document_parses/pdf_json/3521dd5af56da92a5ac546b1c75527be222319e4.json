            "text": "R heumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases that can cause disability if not diagnosed and treated on time. 1 Besides the rapid remission goal that establishes the treat-to-target strategy in RA, we are not able to evaluate in a holistic way in our patients the impact of constant pain suffering, the psychological impact of a chronic treatment, changes in the quality of life, or self-perception that might contribute to the susceptibility of RA patients to anxiety and depressive disorders. 2, 3 In a previous study by our group, the biopsychosocial aspects of RA were evaluated, showing significantly lower levels of quality of life in patients with RA than in the general population, associated with polypharmacy. 4 A shared pathophysiological pathway between depression and chronic diseases such as RA is chronic inflammation, where proinflammatory cytokines and neurotransmitters produce alterations in behavior. Altered levels of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 have been detected in patients with major depression. [5] [6] [7] In addition, suicidal ideation has been reported in approximately 6% of patients with RA, up to 2-fold compared with non-RA subjects. 8 Vitamin D has a multitude of functions; the 2 main functions are classified based on the calcium relationship as calcemic and noncalcemic. The most important function of vitamin D is related to bone health, including mineralization, remodeling, and maintenance. 9 However, the function of vitamin D is not limited to bone metabolism, because the renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1\u03b1-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP27B1) has been identified in a large number of cells and tissues, such as the immune system and the central nervous system. 10 The association between vitamin D levels and depressive, anxiety, and suicidal ideation has been reported. 11, 12 Recent studies reveal the importance of evaluating the suicide risk in vulnerable populations not related to RA, especially in Latin American countries such as Mexico, Peru, and Colombia with increased suicide cases reported. [13] [14] [15] [16] In Mexico, the suicide mortality rate has grown from 1.13 in the 1970s to 5.31 in 2017. 13 Notwithstanding in RA, the information seems to be oriented to emphasize the existence of depressive symptoms associated with the disease itself, [17] [18] [19] but the association of altered vitamin D levels as a possible triggering or additive factor to conceive depressive and anxiety symptoms including suicidal ideation in RA patients is scarce. 8, 11, 12 The aim of our study was to determine whether there is an association between depression, anxiety symptoms, and suicidal risk associated with vitamin D serum levels in patients with RA.",

This study also showed a high prevalence of depressive and anxious symptoms (approximately 90%), as evaluated by the HADS score. In addition, the suicide risk in RA patients assessed by the selfreported Plutchik scale was found in 6 of 10 patients included. These results are remarkably high compared with those in the literature using this instrument in different disorders 29, 38, 39 and in agreement with other authors. 38 Notwithstanding the high prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, we were able to demonstrate an association and a low correlation coefficient with Plutchik score and inadequate serum levels of vitamin D (Figs. 1E, F) . Our study showed that vitamin D levels were inversely related to the SDAI, CDAI, and HAQ-DI scores (Fig. 2) . The importance of vitamin D supplementation has been debated in RA, and a recent meta-analysis showed that doses of vitamin D \u226550,000 IU seem to improve the quality of life and diminish the clinical disease activity index. 40 Finally, higher scores of RAQoL correlated with a greater functional disability, anxiety, and depression (Figs. 3A, C, D), and suicide ideation was associated with the RAQoL score (Fig. 3B ). Based on our results, patients with a HADS score \u22658 were referred to the psychology service. When the Plutchik scale score was \u22656, a referral to the psychiatric service was performed. Vitamin D supplementation was started in all patients with insufficient or deficient levels, and diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug treatment with moderate or severe RA activity was adjusted when needed. This study described suicidal ideation and suicidal risk in patients with RA associated with inadequate vitamin D serum levels. If vitamin D is identified as an additional risk factor for maintaining the quality of life in RA, adequate levels of vitamin D could reduce the suicidal and ideation risk in this group of patients. Our results suggest that further studies need to be carried out with a greater number of patients using other validated instruments that allow adequate and reliable screening of suicide, depression, and anxiety symptoms in RA patients in daily clinical practice.",
