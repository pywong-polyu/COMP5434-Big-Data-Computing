The former includes information about attributes of each firm, including the location, the industry, sales, and the number of employees, whereas the latter includes major customers and suppliers of each firm. The number of firms in the data is 1,668,567, and the number of supply-chain links is 5,943,073. That is, our data identify major supply chains of most firms in Japan, although they lack information about supply-chain links with foreign entities.

In this estimation process, we have to drop firms without any sales information. Accordingly, the number of firms in our further analysis is 966,627, and the number of links is 3,544,343.

This small average path length indicates that the supply chains have a small-world property: i.e., firms are indirectly connected closely through supply chains. Therefore, we would predict that economic shocks quickly propagate through the supply chains. Using the same data set, previous studies [5, 15] find that 46-48% of firms are included in the giant strongly connected component (GSCC) in which all firms are indirectly connected to each other through supply chains.

In the model, each firm utilises inputs purchased from other firms to produce an output and sells it to other firms and consumers. Supply chains are pre-determined and do not change over time in the following two respects. First, each firm utilises a firm-specific set of input varieties and does not change the input set over time. The variety of input is determined by the industry of the producer, and hence firms in a particular industry are assumed to produce the same output. Second, each firm is linked with fixed suppliers and customers and cannot be linked with any new one over time. Further, we assume that each firm keeps inventories of each input at a level randomly determined from the Poisson distribution. Following Inoue and Todo [5] where parameter values are calibrated from the case of the Great East Japan earthquake, we assume that firms target to keep inventories for nine days of production on average. When a lockdown directly or indirectly causes a reduction in production of particular firms, the supply of products of these firms to their customer firms declined. Then, one way to keep the current level of production of the customers is to use their inventories of inputs. Alternatively, the customers can procure the input from their other suppliers in the same industry already connected prior to the lockdown if these suppliers have additional production capacity. If the inventories and inputs from substitute suppliers are insufficient, the customers have to shrink their production because of shortage of inputs. In addition, suppliers of the firms directly affected by the lockdown may have to reduce production because of the reduction of demand from the affected customers.
