            "text": "Mucormycosis, also called \"Black Fungus\", is a new cause for worry in the current Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. Mucormycosis is devasting due to its high rate of morbidity and mortality which is a great cause of concern. Mucormycosis, in general, affects immunocompromised patients including diabetic, people with malignancies, organ and stem cell transplants and people affected with pandemic diseases like covid-19. Diagnosis of Mucormycosis is often delayed either due to clinical complications or misdiagnosed as symptoms of other diseases, especially covid-19. This could delay the treatment protocol which results in the failure of treatment. Mortality rate due to secondary infections in covid-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetics and who are on steroid therapy can soon reach 100% if diagnosis and treatment doesn't happen on timely basis. Risk of Mucormycosis is not just in immunosuppressed patients, but immunocompetent people with late diagnosis are also prone to infection. In view of this, we present a comprehensive review on risks of Mucormycosis in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients highlighting the epidemiology, forms of Mucormycosis, immune response against Mucorales, difficulties in diagnosis and challenges in treatment of Mucormycosis, with emphasis on covid-19 associated Mucormycosis. Importantly, we have discussed the precautions and care to effectively manage Mucormycosis in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Thus, current review helps clinicians in understanding various risk factors in both immunocompromised (especially covid-19 patients) and immunocompetent patients which is critical in managing Mucormycosis in current covid-19 pandemic.",

The term \"Mucormycosis\" was coined by American pathologist R.D. Baker [1] . The first case of Mucormycosis was reported by German pathologist Paltauf in the year 1885 [2] . Humans acquire the infection predominantly by inhalation of sporangiospores, occasionally by ingestion of contaminated food or traumatic inoculation [3] . Eleven genera and \u2212 27 species under Mucorales are associated with human infections, but the most common causative agent of Mucormycosis that is reported globally is Rhizopus arrhizus, followed by Lichtheimia, Apophysomyces, Rhizomucor, Mucor and Cunninghamella species [4] . Nevertheless, there are diverse of species that cause fungal infection in various forms of Mucormycosis as seen in the clinical isolates. This could be a major concern and remains a challenge for clinicians to treat the disease.",

Data collected by Suganya et al. (2019) described the survival rate in different forms of Mucormycosis that varies with foci of the infection: rhino-orbito-cerebral Mucormycosis -45%, focal cerebral Mucormycosis -33%, pulmonary Mucormycosis -36%, sinusitis without cerebral involvement -87%, cutaneous isolated -90%, disseminated disease -16%, and involvement of gastro intestinal form -10% [6] . Unfortunately, the mortality rate is high which makes Mucormycosis a devastating disease. In a recent study conducted in India by Prakash and Chakrabarti (2021) in gastro intestinal form showed highest mortality rate of 66.7%, followed by disseminated (61.5%), pulmonary (61.3%), cutaneous (57.1%), renal (50%) and rhino-orbitocerebral (48.6%) [5] . The mortality can soon reach 100% if not diagnosed and treated timely. Though Mucormycosis is globally distributed, certain risk factors and clinical forms contribute to its estimated prevalence to around 70 times higher in India than that in global data [5] . In the world, India is the most affected country with 44.3% immunocompetent patients infected with Mucormycosis, followed by USA (19.8%) and Australia (5.7%). Most common representative clinical form is the cutaneous/subcutaneous type with 42.5% patients [7] . Global epidemiology of prevalence of Mucormycosis is shown in Fig. 1C .",

            "text": "Immune system and its competence to fight against the fungi play an important role in controlling the spread of clinical manifestations of the disease and thus reduce mortality. Entry of spores into the body happens via 2 main routes: respiratory route or cutaneous. Mucorales attack deep tissues by means of ingestion or inhalation of spores, and percutaneous Disseminated Mucormycosis Brain, spleen, heart, and skin Immunocompromised patients Fever, chills, green, mucopurulent sputum [79, 83] injection of spores by tainted needles. Once they enter into the deep tissues of a healthy individual, they need to fight with the first line of immune defence. In a healthy host, immune system is capable of destroying the spores via oxidative metabolites and cationic peptides [8] . We describe the roles and functions of different immune cells and the kind of immune response against Mucorales in a healthy individual. Neutrophils are key players in fighting against Mucorales species as they are important cells in host defence system. Neutrophils are the first line of defence in the innate immune response as these cells rapidly migrate into the infected tissue, produce reactive oxygen species, and release neutrophil extracellular traps. It was observed that fungal damage was enhanced by influencing the neutrophil activity by cytokines, and is different in different microorganisms [9, 10] . However, decreased levels of neutrophils were observed in diabetes mellitus patients [11, 12] . During infection by diverse mucoralean species, leukocytes communicate with each other by producing a wide range of cytokines and chemokines. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) has been described to play an important role in response to pathogenic fungi. In addition, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-6, IL-12, IL-8, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) helps in recruitment, survival, activation, and differentiation of neutrophils, natural killer cells, T cells, basophils, and eosinophils [13] .",

Natural Killer cells are involved in production of diverse cytokines, including Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF, and CCL5. It was observed that Natural Killer cells exert indirect antifungal activity by modulating immune cells via the production of diverse cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF, and CCL5. However, an opposite kind of immune response was observed in Mucorales as the production levels of IFN-\u03b3 and the pro-inflammatory chemokine CCL5 was significantly reduced [19] . The studies on importance of B cells and their antibodies against Mucorales is very scarce and we suggest it needs to be explored further. Contrastingly, in case of immunocompromised patients these immune cells are incapable of showing an optimum response due to which the production of cytokines and chemokines are significantly reduced, thus causing a higher risk of attack and severe infection in such patients.",

This is an alarming situation as it adds additional risks of Mucormycosis infection to the people with already pre-existing disease. In diabetic patients, Mucormycosis occurs as a destructive and potentially critical condition due to augmented availability of micronutrients and diminished defence mechanism of the body [21] . Ketone reductase present in Rhizopus species increases the glucose and acidic They cause various symptoms which can vary from minor amputations to major symptoms including depletion of organs and even death. This disease can be prevented or treated by timely diagnosis and effective treatment methods environment. This results in ketoacidosis with increased fungal invasion in diabetes mellitus patients that aggravates the condition and risk factors that results in patient prone to all types of Mucormycosis infections [22] [23] [24] . Mucormycosis incidences in patients with diabetes as primary disease exhibited inflammatory infiltration of neutrophils, multinucleated giant cells, and phagocytes in the site of infection, as well as tissue damage and necrosis [25] .",

When Mucor attacks the sinuses, it spreads to the lungs, the brain and the central nervous system. The fungus invades the sinus and makes its way into the intra-orbital and intracranial regions. 50-80% of patients are at a risk of death if not checked at early stages. If immune system is strong then the inhaled spores would be killed by immune system. On the other hand, if the immune system is weak or suppressed the spores germinate and grow rapidly as thin, wire-like tubes that branch out and enter the blood vessels and kill them. Covid-19 patients are more prone to infection as they are immunocompromised and the fungi take advantage of the same to invade the host of such patients and hence, we call such infections as opportunistic infections.

Pulmonary Mucormycosis being the second prominent type, requires a high degree of clinical suspicion to diagnose in covid-19 patients. Another study conducted by Sharma et al.

Mucormycosis infection in healthy individuals has a worldwide distribution and the real predisposing factors involved in its pathogenesis in such people are unknown. Some of the possible risk factors in immunocompetent people include occurrence of disease in dark colour people, climatic conditions due to hot weather that could give the chance to causative organism to thrive, air condition which gives organism a great circumstance to multiply, which can further lead for dryness of mucosal epithelium [7] . Low immunity related to poor nutrition, bad hygiene due to socioeconomic poor conditions, surgical procedural related conditions, recurrence of the trauma, poor education, lack of awareness and late diagnosis, are few possibilities as risk factors [47] . Of the risk factors in immunocompetent patients that fosters development of fungal infection includes chronic insult of a well-defined and localized body area [7] . Other reasons includes environmental factors like the hot and humid climate of the country, especially as that seen in India [48] . In addition, unsanitary re-use of face-masks, especially during the prevailing hot and humid weather increases the risk of infection [49] .",

Of the eight cases, three were infected with Apophysomyces elegans, again an unusual pathogen causing Mucormycosis [50] . A recent study conducted by He et al. (2021) described the clinical manifestation of a young adult who is immunocompetent but was still diagnosed with Pulmonary Mucormycosis. In addition, they also presented other case studies of immunocompetent patients who were diagnosed with Pulmonary Mucormycosis [51] . Of 14 patients who received antifungal drugs, 6 died due to either respiratory failure or liver failure, accounting to a mortality rate of 43% [52, 53] . The reasons contributing to this might be decompensation of vital organ function which may be a contributing factor to death. However, there are cases where immunocompetent people are also infected with rhino-orbito-cerebral Mucormycosis type of infection and the clinical manifestations of such patients are similar to those occurring in patients with the known underlying conditions [54] . A study conducted by Shivaprasad et al. (2008) described a case of a healthy young male with fungal sepsis secondary to gastrointestinal Mucormycosis [55] . However, reported cases of gastrointestinal Mucormycosis in an immunocompetent host are very few in the literature. Intestinal Mucormycosis is very rare in immunocompetent. Interestingly, a case report described a 40-year-old male patient without any traditional risk factors diagnosed with intestinal Mucormycosis. The patient was cured with aggressive antifungal (parenteral Liposomal Amphotericin B) and supportive care without surgical intervention [56] . Thus, risks of Mucormycosis are not limited to immunosuppressed patients, but immunocompetent people with late diagnosis are also prone to the infection.",

Molecular based assays are often recommended as valuable add on tools that complement conventional diagnostic procedures. It includes conventional PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses (RFLP), DNA sequencing of defined gene regions and melt curve analysis of PCR products [58] . A recent study describes new diagnostic tools such as Nano-based sensors which can help early diagnosis and help control the disease.

Preliminary step is surgical debridement has to be extensive, involving all necrotic areas for rhino-oculo-cerebral infection, and repeated surgical procedures to achieve local control and improved outcome [57] . Commonly used anti-fungal agents including fluconazole, voriconazole, and echinocandins do not work against fungi that cause Mucormycosis. For this reason, Amphotericin B (given intravenously), posaconazole or isavuconazole (given intravenously or orally) are currently used drugs for Mucormycosis. Pilmis et al. (2018) described among antifungal agents, the first-line recommended is liposomal Amphotericin B or Amphotericin B lipid complex, and there are no data for the use of posaconazole as first-line therapy [57] . A retrospective study of 41 cases of rhino-orbital-cerebral Mucormycosis showed a survival benefit of patients who were treated with a combination of Amphotericin B with caspofungin [72] . Existing data showed that the mortality rate was low in patients treated with a combination of Amphotericin B and surgical debridement of the infected tissue (19-44%) compared with Amphotericin B monotherapy (50-61%), these findings are in concordance with global data [70, 73] . Further, in majority of the cases urgent surgical debridement to remove the infected necrotic tissue is suggested followed by antifungal therapy. Interestingly, a rare case of delayed-onset gastric Mucormycosis in a polytrauma patient was successfully treated by antifungal medical therapy alone without any surgical debridement [74] . However, the major drawbacks in Mucormycosis management in developing countries are crucial gap in initiation of treatment protocol and the financial constraints of patients to afford liposomal Amphotericin B. Recently, Lactoferrin was being investigated as a potential fungistatic agent and an immune regulator that acts as an iron-chelator [75] . This new approach can be exploited as the adjunct treatment for Mucormycosis infection. Thus, new advances in treatment options are most needed to overcome the drawbacks and to manage Mucormycosis.",

With the current knowledge of the risks of Mucormycosis in covid-19 patients, doctors suggest early detection and crucial time to initiate treatment for Mucormycosis is a key to fight the disease. They suggest any alarming signs and symptoms should never be neglected. One such example is, neglecting cases with a blocked nose as cases of bacterial sinusitis, particularly in the context of immunosuppression and/or Covid-19 patients on immunomodulators.

Thus, clinicians should bear in mind that even immunocompetent people are prone to any type of Mucormycosis infection by reviewing the exposure history. Moreover, clinicians should be cautious with the occurrence of pulmonary embolism in patients with signs of lung infection [51] . Mucormycosis in immunocompetent individuals can be effectively managed by maintaining good nutrition in diet, good hygiene, thoroughly sterilizing air, water, oxygen supply, equipments used for surgical procedures, educating public about precautions, care and creating awareness about disease and most importantly early diagnosis (without any negligence as in case of healthy individuals) and timely treatment.",

Steroids which are life saviours for covid-19 patients should not be used unless absolutely necessary. It is suggested to stop continuing immunomodulating drugs and in addition, steroids should be used judiciously, and correct dose of the same must be given at right point of time.

Diagnosis of this disease is often difficult due to the misinterpretation of signs and symptoms with other diseases, especially covid-19. In addition, the clinical manifestations of the disease often delay its diagnosis at the late stage. Delayed diagnosis directly affects the treatment protocol and often leads to failure of the treatment due to rapid spread of infection in the body that not only destroys immune cells, but also becomes unresponsive to medicines. Mucormycosis affects immunocompromised patients including diabetes, haematological malignancy, organ and skin transplant and covid-19 patients. Moreover, covid-19 patients who have received steroids for covid are particularly at high risk of Mucormycosis infection, as steroids suppress the immune system. Mortality rate was reported 90% or even more with Mucormycosis in case of diabetes and 50-80% in case of covid-19 patients. Importantly, Mucormycosis is also reported in immunocompetent individuals, which is a great cause of concern and necessitates quick attention.

Additionally, diagnosis and treatment of Mucormycosis should be considered on population-based methods in different set of populations (due to variation in medical history), across different countries, due to the fact that different organisms are involved in causing the disease (variation in clinical manifestations in different forms). Prospective validation, similar studies of other populations at risk for Mucormycosis and development of a \"scorecard\" for diagnosis of Mucormycosis is suggested. In addition, molecular tools with improved definition of the clonality of Mucormycosis cases is required which can give more insights on epidemiology of Mucormycosis. Further, more research and clinical trials needs to be carried out to develop drugs or combination therapies for successful treatment of Mucormycosis. Moreover, since the estimated prevalence of Mucormycosis is around 70 times higher in India than that in global data and the exact incidence of this is unknown especially due to the lack of population-based studies, extensive awareness of the disease and precautions are crucial to manage Mucormycosis in the current Covid-19 pandemic.",

The Mucorales species (approximately 27 different types) are known to cause the infection. Initially the spores released by Mucorales enter the body deep into the tissues either by ingestion, inhalation or percutaneous injection of spores. Soon after the infection, the immune cells are recruited to fight against the foreign agents. However, due to influence of various risk factors (internal, external, local and systemic) as shown in the figure, immune sytem fails to fight against the organism and result in immune disregulation or immune system breakdown. This results in a disease called 'Mucormycosis'. Mucormycosis can affect various vital body organs including skin, nose, eyes, face, mouth and lungs.",
