Patient and Methods: The study was conducted with medical records of 987 (82%) patients with confirmed COVID-19 virus via real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction between March 11, 2020, and April 21, 2020. Patients were divided into 2 groups as computed tomography (CT)negative and CT-positive groups considering the presence of the CT findings depicting COVID-19 disease. Results: The mean age was significantly higher in CT-positive group than CT-negative group (41.53 + 12.82 vs 36.61 + 11.81, P < .001). Cough and shortness of the breath were observed with a significantly higher rate in CT-positive group than that of CT-negative group (44% vs 29.9%, P \u00bc .001 and 18.4% vs 9.7%, P \u00bc .002, respectively). Conclusions: In conclusion, advanced age, cough, and shortness of breath could be related to CT scan positivity.",

            "text": "The novel COVID-19 disease, which has announced as a pandemic in March 2020 by World Health Organization, is a contagious disease that affects mainly respiratory systems. 1 It was first described in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1 The highly infectious disease occurs due to a virus defined ''Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.'' The virus spreads through respiratory droplets during sneezing and coughing among individuals. 2 The disease's main symptoms are fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and arthralgia. 2, 3 In the diagnosis of the disease, clinical symptoms, history of contact with patients, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, and presence of ground-glass opacities in computed tomography (CT) scan are essential. 4 Chest imaging is of great importance for the diagnosis and management of patients with COVID-19 infection. 5 Computed tomography scans have enabled us to detect COVID-19 disease earlier and accurately, especially in suspicious patients and in the delay of PCR results. Therefore, the wide use of thorax CT scans has been observed during the pandemic period. 5 However, overuse of CT scans in ambulatory care patients has raised concerns due to expose patients to ionizing radiation, a known human carcinogen. 5 Recent studies have focused on evaluating the relation between serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), monocytes, lymphocytes, homocysteine levels, and prognosis of the disease in addition to the generally observed symptoms. 6, 7 Besides, there are also cumulating data evaluating the relationship between the otolaryngology-specific symptoms such as sudden loss of smell and taste and the mild stage of the COVID-19 disease. 8 However, there are no studies reporting the relation between otolaryngology-specific clinical symptoms and CT findings yet.",

The early diagnosis of the disease and prevention of infection may help reduce complications and mortality rates. 10 However, due to nonspecific symptoms of the disease and false-negative and delayed results of the PCR test, chest CT scan is one of the main diagnostic tools to determine the severity of the COVID-19 disease. 8 However, it is also known that repeated doses of ionizing ration could have potential harm to blood cells, reproductive organs, and the growing fetus. 7 To obtain an easy use and achievable diagnostic tool, especially in developing countries, as an alternative to PCR and chest CT scan, recent studies evaluated some laboratory markers such as a decrease of lymphocytes, elevated CRP, procalcitonin, and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) levels. 6, 7, 10 According to the results of the study by Tan et al, elevated CRP and ESR levels were significantly observed at the early stage of severe COVID-19 patients. 7 These results suggested that CRP and ESR could be used to identify patients who might become severely ill in the early stage of the disease before the occurrence of CT findings. 7, 11 The current data have reported that patients with influenzalike symptoms are 6 to 10 times more related to test positivity of COVID-19 infection. 12, 13 In the aspect of otolaryngology perspective, it was reported that olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions were associated with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease due to the infectious process of the virus in olfactory epithelia resulting localized inflammation in the olfactory cleft. 8, 12 It was also suggested that smell loss seems to be an independent risk factor and may be utilized as a marker for the detection of patients with the mild presentation of COVID-19 infection and were not associated with any other risk factors. 12 In our study group, 46.9% of patients presented with smell loss and 44.2% of them with taste loss. However, there was no significant difference between the study groups in terms of smell loss and taste loss. The presence of these variable results may be due to the difference in the methods used in the diagnosis of smell and taste loss, the design of studies in different ethnicities, and the use of different techniques in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. It was reported that cough (76%) and dyspnea (55%) were also highly associated with presenting symptoms of the COVID-19 disease. [13] [14] [15] In our study, cough (31.9%) and shortness of breath (10.9%) were the other related symptoms considering the daily otolaryngology practice. These symptoms were also higher in CT-positive group than those of CTnegative group, and in regression analysis, they were significantly related to positive CT findings. These findings could be associated with the severe damage of pulmonary alveoli in patients with positive CT findings.",
