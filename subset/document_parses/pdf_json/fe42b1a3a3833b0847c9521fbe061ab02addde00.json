For a network with a single weight, previous studies have shown that they can promote synchronization. But for complex networks with multi-weights, there are no rigorous analysis to show that synchronization can be reached faster. In this paper, the complex network is allowed to be directed, which will make the synchronization analysis difficult for multiple couplings. In virtue of the normalized left eigenvectors (NLEVec) corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of coupling matrices, we prove that if the Chebyshev distance between NLEVec is less than some value, which is defined as the allowable deviation bound, then the synchronization and control will be realized with sufficiently large coupling strengths, i.e., all coupling matrices do accelerate synchronization. Moreover, adaptive rules are also designed for the coupling strength.",

Previous works mainly focus on the synchronization and its control for networks with a single coupling matrix, which has been widely and deeply investigated. Among them, pioneering works [1] , [2] , [3] all use the normalized left eigenvectors (NLEVec) corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of coupling matrix to set up the framework of synchronization analysis. Using this NLEVec, a dummy node is defined, and the synchronization between nodes is transformed to the synchronization between nodes and this dummy node. Moreover, this NLEVec can also be used in the pinning control problem for networks, see [4] . The main stream of investigation for synchronization and control follows these works' technical route, which makes NLEVec vital in analysis [5] .",

In this case, different coupling matrices will cause different NLEVec, which will make the Lyapunov function hard to design. Therefore, 1. We firstly loosen the requirement of NLEVec for complex networks with a single weight (CNSW), and prove that if the Chebyshev distance between NLEVec and a normalized positive vector is less than a bound, then this vector can also be used for synchronization analysis. This fact will greatly improve the rigid property of original synchronization technique and successfully bridge the gap between single weighted and multi-weighted networks.",

Then based on this new technique, for directed CNMWs, we can choose another weight coefficients to combine all NLEVec of multiple coupling weights, and prove its validity for (adaptive) synchronization and control. We finally conclude that directed CNMWs can accelerate synchronization than that with a single weight.",

On the other hand, simple computer program does find many normalized vectors \u03b8, such that G \u03b8 has positive EVal. For example, if \u03b8 = (0.0025, 0.52, 0.4775) T , EVal of G \u03b8 would be: 0.004, 0, \u22122.2612.Remark 3. Notice the fact that NLEVec \u03be and \u03b8 are both positive scalars, so the angle between them must be acute. In the above example, we can calculate the angle between NLEVec \u03be and the valid vector \u03b8 = (0.25, 0.25, 0.5) T is 0.115 rad; on the other hand, the angle between NLEVec \u03be and the invalid vector \u03b8 = (0.0025, 0.52, 0.4775) T is 0.6611 rad, so an intuitive understanding of the limitation of valid vectors \u03b8 is that they should near the NLEVec as close as possible.",
