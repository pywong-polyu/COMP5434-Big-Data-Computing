The early detection and prediction of influenza outbreaks are crucial for efficient resource planning to save patient's lives and healthcare costs. We propose a new data-driven methodology for influenza outbreak detection and prediction at very local levels. A doctor's diagnostic dataset of influenza-like illness from more than 3000 clinics in Malaysia is used in this study because these diagnostic data are reliable and can be captured promptly. A new region index (RI) of the influenza outbreak is proposed based on the diagnostic dataset. By analysing the anomalies in the weekly RI value, potential outbreaks are identified using statistical methods. An ensemble learning method is developed to predict potential influenza outbreaks. Cross-validation is conducted to optimize the hyperparameters of the ensemble model. A testing data set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model. The proposed methodology is shown to be sensitive and accurate at influenza outbreak prediction, with average of 75% recall, 74% precision, and 83% accuracy scores across five regions in Malaysia.",

Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection that causes diseases ranging from mild respiratory tract infection (RTI) to severe pneumonia and even death. Worldwide, seasonal influenza leads to an estimated 5 million cases of severe illness and 650,000 respiratory deaths every year 2 . It also causes a significant hospitalization burden, workplace absences, and productivity losses. For example, based on a study conducted at the University of Malaya Medical Centre in Malaysia in 2009, the direct healthcare cost for each hospitalized H1N1 patient was USD 510, which was 60% higher than the year 2007 per capita national expenditure on health of USD 318 3 . Given these circumstances, investigators are working on detecting and predicting influenza outbreaks early. This prediction would bring tremendous value to the world's healthcare systems. Firstly, the early detection of influenza outbreaks is crucial to the healthcare system to enable efficient resource planning and save healthcare costs. Secondly, early detection can potentially help save people's lives. Thirdly, we can control the spread of influenza if we can predict it early.",

To study the regional influenza outbreak, we introduce the RI, a metric that normalizes the impact of the weekly number of clinics and the clinic size. Using the diagnostic data from the clinics, we have the flexibility to decide on the granularity of the regions by grouping the clinics based on geographic location. In this paper, we define five regions in Malaysia by following the definition used by the Malaysia Federal Department of Town and Country ( Table 2) 18 . All clinics are segmented into five regions: the Central, East Coast, East Malaysia, Northern, and Southern regions (Fig. 1 ). After segmentation, each of the regions still has good coverage for the number 15 , an ILI is defined by the WHO as \"An acute respiratory illness with a measured temperature of > 38 \u2022 C and cough, with onset within the past 10 days\", in which fever and cough are the two key diagnoses.

A histogram is plotted below to show the distribution of RI, which is close to a normal distribution (Fig. 2 ). Next, we will apply anomaly detection models to label the regional outbreak on a weekly basis. From the past research papers [19] [20] [21] , the 70th and 90th percentiles are often used on normalized ILI cases to identify weak and strong indications of influenza outbreaks. Applying these thresholds to the data, RI \u2265 1.05 and RI \u2265 1.2 give weak and strong indications of influenza outbreaks at the 70th and 90th percentiles, respectively (Table 4 ). In the example illustration plot for the southern region, the weeks in the pink range represent strong indications of influenza outbreaks above the 90th percentile; the weeks in the light pink range represent weak indications of influenza outbreaks between the 70th and 90th percentiles (Fig. 3 ). These thresholds are used to design the anomaly detection models. The majority ( 70% ) of the RIs were below RI=1.05, representing a normal situation. A RI=1.05 will be used as the minimum requirement for a week to be www.nature.com/scientificreports/ labelled as an outbreak. (Equation (10)). A RI=1.2 is applied in one of the anomaly detection models. (Equation (3)).",

In other words, it is the week j-w to week j-1's RI pattern that decides whether week j is an outbreak. That is why parameter w must be selected with care.

In this study, we used WHO data to validate the high-level ILI trend at the national level. Although the WHO data is able to show some useful national ILI trends, it is very approximate due to the small sample size. In addition, the WHO data cannot support the detailed weekly analysis at the regional level. Therefore, we compared the regional detection and prediction results with the GFT data. As an example of collective intelligence, GFT has attracted a lot of attention in the past 10 years 28, 29 . On the one hand, GFT unlocked the power of big data in the public health area. It is able to understand the prevalence of influenza at very local levels with more finely granular data from search engines, which is not practical for the traditional surveillance systems to widely produce. In addition, GFT can provide influenza alerts much earlier than the traditional surveillance systems. On the other hand, GFT was challenged by some researchers because its predictions have sometimes been inaccurate. This is because that people making influenza-related Google searches may know very little about how to diagnose influenza. Therefore, searches for influenza or influenza symptoms may well be researching disease symptoms that are similar to influenza but are not influenza.",

We believe that when our method is deployed in conjunction with traditional surveillance systems and GFT, it will provide better influenza detection and prediction outcomes. During a typical outbreak life-cycle as plotted in Fig. 11 , there are three types of datasets that can be used for the influenza outbreak study: Google Trends dataset, diagnostic datasets, and official reports. Diagnostic data stand out for the following reasons. First, they are used to monitor ILI cases based on licensed doctor diagnoses, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ which are usually more reliable than Google Trends search-based data. Second, diagnostic data provide earlier detection insights into influenza outbreaks compared to the official reports. Andrea validated that diagnostic data from one medical center work well for the influenza case forecasting 9 . In this study, we used diagnostic data from over three thousand clinics, covering half of the clinics in Malaysia 24 . We can extend Andrea's work to address geographic generalizability. In addition, as this dataset is directly extracted from a real-world healthcare system, our methodology can be easily integrated with this system and deployed for daily operations.",

In real-world scenarios, the sensitivity of the outbreak detection www.nature.com/scientificreports/ model is crucial because we try to detect as many outbreaks as possible. To improve the sensitivity of outbreak detection methods, we introduce five complementary statistical models in this paper. These models are used to label the weekly regional outbreaks to train the prediction model. This paper emphasizes the study of RI patterns before an outbreak and develops a machine learning model to predict future outbreaks. There are usually two types of methodologies when detecting outbreaks, i.e., regression models and classification models. Regression models focus on seasonal or periodical outbreaks and fit long-term predictions better. By contrast, classification models capture dynamic patterns and fit short-term predictions better. In this paper, we decided to use classification models because Malaysia, which is located in Southeast Asia, does not have distinctive seasons; therefore, there are no clear seasonal trends in ILI cases 4 . Moreover, we can give early alerts using classification models by learning the patterns right before the outbreaks.",

Therefore we conclude that the methodology is sensitive and accurate in predicting influenza outbreaks at very local levels. Compared to previous similar research works, the proposed methodology is more reliable, effective, and scalable to influenza outbreak detection and prediction.",

In addition to the short-term prediction results presented in this paper, the methodology can be extended for long-term outbreak prediction by restructuring the data and incorporating other machine learning models. In addition, we can apply more complex nonlinear models such as LSTM or other neural networks to the data set to explore if they have better prediction accuracy.",
