However, health proposal repetition and its perceived efficacy also influence the behavior intention toward the proposal, which has not yet been confirmed in the COVID-19 context. The present study examined whether the extended parallel process model (EPPM) could be generalized to a naturalistic context like the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we explored how repetition of a health proposal is involved with the EPPM. In this study, two groups of participants were exposed to the same health proposal related to COVID-19, where one group was exposed once and another group twice. Participants then filled out a questionnaire consisting of items concerning behavior intention and adapted from the Risk Behavior Diagnosis Scale. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the multivariate associations between the variables. Although the results showed that behavior intention is predicted by perceived efficacy, no significant influence of perceived threat was detected. Furthermore, no significant effect of repetition was found toward either response efficacy or perceived susceptibility. These findings indicate that to promote health compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more efficient to focus on health proposals' perceived efficacy rather than the disease's perceived threat. For future health communication research, the present study suggests improved analysis strategies and repeated manipulation of messages.",

As of February 2, 2021, there are over 100 million confirmed cases globally; in Japan, 389,518 cases and 5,722 deaths (mortality rate: 1.47%) have been reported Currently, we are exposed to the same health proposals concerning COVID-19, in all likelihood, at least once in our daily lives, which makes message repetition an essential factor to be taken into consideration. Although research concerning stimulus repetition first emerged in the 1960s (Zajonc, 1968) , there was no study on message repetition in persuasive communication until 10 years later. It is suggested that under moderate repetition (less than three times), agreement toward persuasive messages rises (Cacioppo & Petty, 1979) . The rationale is explained as follows: Scrutiny is reinforced through a moderate level of message repetition, which enhances the understanding of message content and the merits advocated by the message, consequently improving supportive attitudes toward the message. Later research revealed that the mechanism mentioned above is applicable only when arguments in the message are perceived as strong and when the issue is of high personal relevance (Cacioppo & Petty, 1989; Claypool et al., 2004) .",

Concretely, response efficacy and perceived susceptibility might be perceived when reading a health proposal message. If the content of a health proposal was supported, high response efficacy should be found, resulting in a decrease in perceived susceptibility. Given the connection between the EPPM and message repetition in persuasive health communication and the actual state we have been through when confronted with health proposals during the COVID-19 pandemic, we built an integrative model ( Fig. 1) to investigate the factors and their associations concerning an individual's behavior intention to conduct effective health proposals to prevent the infection.",

Take perceived threat, for example: In previous research, perceived threat was always considered together with fear because without extra fear-arousing materials (e.g., explanation of a certain disease in text or video), the perceived threat might not be notable enough to act as an independent variable. Unlike other unfamiliar diseases (e.g., melanoma), even though the degree to which one is influenced by the pandemic may vary, COVID-19 should be one of the immediate health threats in several countries and regions, including Japan, where the present study was conducted. Considering that fear-arousing information is no longer needed in the message, we are interested in exploring how perceived threat alone for COVID-19 affects behavior intention when there is no intentional manipulation of fear arousal (i.e., Hypothesis 8 below).",

To be specific, when supportive arguments toward the content of a recommended proposal are enhanced due to moderate repetition, it can also be interpreted as the change in response efficacy and perceived susceptibility in the EPPM.

We assume better health compliance is due to higher perceived efficacy, but what does perceived efficacy mean? By learning more about its two indicators, self-efficacy and response efficacy, we can better understand why people choose to conform or not to certain health proposals. For instance, even though physical distancing is considered efficient in preventing infection (high response efficacy), the difficulty in keeping physical distance may vary between people based on their socializing needs (divergent self-efficacy), which results in different levels of health compliance. Similarly, if we are aware that perceived threat is indicated by perceived susceptibility and severity, we may know which properties to emphasize in education on COVID-19 to boost public health compliance.",

In contrast, high threat and high efficacy would result in a danger control process where people take efficient actions to avert the threat. Moreover, low threat-high efficacy condition and low threat-low efficacy condition are not sufficient triggers for behavior change compared with the former two conditions. To the best of our knowledge, there is limited research using SEM to test the EPPM, except for a study conducted by Ort & Fahr's (2018) . Considering that the differences in analysis strategies may bring us new insights into the result of the non-significant path from perceived threat to behavior intention, we would take into account other analysis strategies in the previous research when discussing the results. Nevertheless, the following discussion was based on several post-hoc analyses, which were not registered in advance. We conducted the analyses simply for exploration, and thus any implication based on them should be treated with caution and confirmed through further investigation.",

Then the discriminating value was calculated by subtracting these two scores (Z efficacy -Z threat = discriminating value). When the discriminating value was negative (i.e., perceived threat outweighed perceived efficacy), the participant was considered to get involved in the fear control process. When the discriminating value was positive (i.e., perceived efficacy outweighed perceived threat), the participant was considered to take danger control actions. In other words, the formula emphasized the comparison between perceived threat and perceived efficacy rather than a single variable's level (high/low) alone in determining health communication outcomes. Applying this strategy, we divided our participants in the no-repetition condition (which had the same design as the previous research) into two groups-danger control group and fear control group (N danger = 70, N fear = 82)-according to their discriminating values, and then conducted independent samples t-test on their behavior intention scores. The behavior intention of participants in the danger control group was significantly higher than that in the fear control group (t(150) = 3.65, p < 0.001), which was theoretically consistent with the basic frame of the EPPM. Given that these analyses were not registered beforehand and that the discriminating value approach has been criticized for its flawed conceptual logic (Ort & Fahr, 2018) , we consider it not appropriate to make any conclusion about the EPPM's validity in the present study. Instead, we suggest treating the result's limited implication as a mere reference or a hint when discussing the relation between perceived threat and behavior intention.",

            "text": "The exploratory analyses mentioned above provide several possible explanations for the non-significant path between perceived threat and behavior intention in our theoretical model. As one possibility, a perceived threat may act as a judgment criterion, meaning that the danger control process will not start until the perceived threat reaches a certain level. Subsequently, the fluctuation in its value does not influence behavior intention anymore. If this is the case, the increase in perceived threat might not affect behavior intention, for the perceived threat was already at a high level in this study. Another possibility is that we have to take perceived threat's interrelation with perceived efficacy into consideration when evaluating its effect on behavior intention. When perceived threat increases and perceived efficacy is controlled to stay constant, there are three kinds of possible changes in the process people get involved in when facing a health threat, namely switching from the danger control process to the fear control process; staying unchanged in the fear control process; or staying unchanged in the danger control process. While behavior intention should decrease in the switch from the danger control process to the fear control process, it is unclear how behavior intention would change when the process stays the same. Consequently, the relation between perceived threat and behavior intention would not be monotonic. In any case, we prefer to think that threat has its own function even if not reflected in number because studies (Witte, 1992; Gore & Bracken, 2005) have shown that if individuals receive a no-threat and high-efficacy message, the message did not influence them, which is not predicted by the EPPM.",

            "text": "Regarding message repetition, neither response efficacy nor perceived susceptibility were found to be influenced by message repetition. Based on the differences in message repetition manipulation between the present study and previous ones, there may be several possibilities accounting for the results. First of all, considering that there are 24-72 h between two exposures to the message, the stimulus was too simple to be impressive, making the manipulation of message repetition invalid. For example, in Cacioppo & Petty (1979) , a simple message was repeated several times in one experiment section with almost no interval. In the studies where the interval lasted for several days or weeks (Shi & Smith, 2016; Horowitz, 1969; Skilbeck, Tulips & Ley, 1977) , the materials serving as stimuli were more complicated (e.g., 5-min video clip; eight-page pamphlet; 20-min lecture). Similarly, in a recent study investigating the relation between short health reminders and the change in behavior intention during the COVID-19 pandemic (Yonemitsu et al., 2020) , no effect of the reminders was reported with a 1-week interval. Therefore, it is reasonable to conjecture that in the present study, the complexity of the health proposal message and the length of time interval did not make a good match to test message repetition's effect. Furthermore, considering that COVID-19 has been a severe health threat in Japan-where the present study was conducted-the large amount of relevant information people received from sources other than the survey may have become an extraneous variable. On all accounts, it was not detected that mere repetition of a short piece of health proposal at 24-72h's interval significantly influenced its response efficacy and COVID-19's perceived susceptibility.",

Concretely, for a health proposal considered to be effective, \"it can be easily carried out\" and \"it works well for preventing COVID-19 infection\" are the points that need to be emphasized. Meanwhile, it was also confirmed that perceived threat consists of perceived susceptibility and severity. However, when the public's perceived threat for COVID-19 has already been at a high level, it may not help promote health compliance to show people how threatening it is or how easily they can get infected.

Moreover, only one health proposal was used as stimulus material in this study. We suggest that the effect of various health proposals should be addressed in subsequent studies. Specifically, considering that there was no association between message repetition and the EPPM in this study, one important task will be to explore the balance among the message's complexity, the length of time interval, and even the times of exposure to confirm the results.",

Former researchers have detected the psychological typhoon eye effect in the COVID-19 pandemic in China, showing a negative correlation between exposure level and mental health problems (Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Moreover, it is indicated that the differences among residents in various areas were only found in the indicator, \"wanting to have a physical investigation,\" but not in other behavioral response indicators (e.g., frequently washing or cleaning hands; taking the initiative to avoid strangers). Since the present study did not collect information about participants' residence, we could not compare the results of participants with various exposure levels to COVID-19.
