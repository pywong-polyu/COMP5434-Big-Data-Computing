In order to longitudinally track SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in people after vaccination or infection, a large-scale COVID-19 sero-surveillance progam entitled SPARTA (SeroPrevalence and Respiratory Tract Assessment) was established early in the pandemic. Anti-RBD antibody levels were tracked in more than 1,000 people. There was no significant decrease in antibody levels during the first 14 months after infection in unvaccinated participants, however, significant waning of antibody levels was observed following vaccination, regardless of previous infection status. Moreover, participants who were pre-immune to SARS-CoV-2 prior to vaccination seroconverted to significantly higher antibody levels, and antibodies were maintained at significantly higher levels than in previously infected, unvaccinated participants. This pattern was entirely due to differences in the magnitude of the initial seroconversion event, and the rate of antibody waning was not significantly different based on the pre-immune status. Participants who received a third (booster) dose of an mRNA vaccine not only increased their anti-RBD antibody levels ~14-fold, but they also had ~3 times more anti-RBD antibodies compared to the peak of their antibody levels after receiving their primary vaccine series. In order to ascertain whether the presence of serum antibodies is important for long-term seroprotection, PBMCs from 13 participants who lost all detectable circulating antibodies after vaccination or infection were differentiated into memory cells in vitro. There was a significant recall of memory B cells in the absence of serum antibodies in 70% of the vaccinated participants, but not in any of the infected participants. Therefore, there is a strong connection between anti-RBD antibody levels and the effectiveness of memory B cell recall.",

The goals were 1) to investigate the level and duration of protection afforded by natural infection following SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2) to assess immunological risk factors for infection outcome and examine immune responses to infection across the disease spectrum, and 3) to study the immune effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in both pre-immune and immunologically na\u00efve participants. Participants were located at several sites in three U.S. states and represented a diverse cohort that provided a real-time snapshot into the progression of immune responses during the pandemic. To date, ~3,800 participants have provided serum, peripheral blood cells, and saliva at multiple timepoints.",

In addition, in order to ascertain whether the presence of serum antibodies is necessary for a robust recall response, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and differentiated into memory B cell in vitro from 13 individuals. These 13 participants had an initial antibody response induced by vaccination or infection, but their antibody levels subsequently declined to undetectable levels.

While infection-induced antibody levels were ~10-fold lower than vaccinated participants, there was no significant waning over the next 14 months after infection. While vaccination-induced antibody levels measured 2-4 weeks post-vacination were significantly higher than infection-induced antibodies, they waned quickly, eventually asymptoting to levels similar to participants who were infected, but not vaccinated. Thus, the difference between the antibody levels in infected participants regardless of vaccination status is only apparent in the primary response and diminishes in the following months. Participants who were both infected and vaccinated had significantly higher antibody levels than infected unvaccinated participants for over 10 months. In contrast, participants who were never infected with SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination had significantly higher antibody levels compared to infected but unvaccinated participants for only the first 4 months following vaccination. The most robust antibody levels were reached and maintained by participants who were infected prior to vaccination. However, there was no significant difference between the rate of waning between the na\u00efve vaccinated and the infected vaccinated groups, suggesting that pre-immunity does not significantly affect the rate of the waning of antibodies after vaccination. Thus, the differences between the two vaccinated groups were entirely due to the higher level of initial seroconversion amongst pre-immune participants. As the half-life of human IgG antibodies is 2-4 weeks, it is evident that the level of waning is proportionally related to the antibody level, and as their antibody levels dwindle, they asymptote instead of continuing to decline in a linear fashion 22, 23 .",

            "text": "Memory B cell recall occurs in the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated and convalescent individuals [30] [31] [32] [33] . While the waning of antibody levels is natural due to the short halflife of antibodies 22, 23 , concerns were raised about what happens to a very specific subset of participants who had a blunted serological response demonstrated by significantly lower initial antibody concentrations after vaccination (*p=0.026; mean for cohort = 44.8 \u00b5g/mL, mean for subset = 11.77 \u00b5g/mL). This subset of participants subsequently wane below the level of seroprotection 13 . In order to explore the effectiveness of B cell memory recall in the absence of detectable circulating antibodies, the SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific recall response in differentiated PBMCs from participants who lost their seroprotected antibody levels after vaccination or infection was assessed. Though the anti-RBD ELISA had a sensitivity and specificity of 96% 10 , most of these participants were close to the threshold and had a higher likelihood of being categorized as false positive or false negative. In order to verify that they did indeed possess protective antibodies, which later declined to undetectable levels, VN assays were performed in order to confirm seroprotected status. While analysis of binding antibody levels is useful and highly correlated with neutralization titers 10,34-36 , VN assays using naturally occurring infectious SARS-CoV-2 is useful to assess not only the ability of antibodies to bind a small portion of the virus but also to quantify all antibodies capable of preventing cytopathic effects elicited by the entire live virus, creating a more realistic in vitro model. The 13 participants whose anti-RBD antibodies declined below the threshold of protection based on ELISA also lost their previous ability to neutralize virus (Table S2 ). In addition, two normal vaccine responders and four who never seroconverted after vaccination were included as controls. After in vitro PBMC stimulation with IL-2 and R848, all normal responders were able to recall SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, while the non-responders did not have a significant SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific recall, but still produced non-specific IgG antibodies de novo ( Table   1 ). Three of the four non-responders had autoimmune conditions or were taking immunosuppressant medication (Table S2) . Of the 13 participants who lost previously existing seroprotected status, 10 initially seroconverted due to vaccination, while the other three initially seroconverted due to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. All three had asymptomatic infections. None of the 3 previously infected and only 7 out of 10 vaccinated participants showed a significant SARS-CoV-2-specific recall response. B cell immunophenotyping confirmed that 6 of the participants who had a robust memory recall had a significant number of IgG + memory B cells (Table S3) . On the other hand CVI-732, a non-responder taking the corticosteroid medication Prednisone 37 , as well as the anti-CD20 monoclonal therapy rituximab 38,39 for rheumatoid arthritis, had no antigenspecific antibody recall post-stimulation and no detectable B cells by flow cytometry (Table 1,   Table S2 , Table S3 ). Future studies will focus on the effect immunosuppressants and autoimmune conditions have on serological and cellular responses.",

Another study found that SARS-CoV-2 may blunt the germinal center response due to a block in Bcl-6 + TFH cell differentiation, an increase in T-bet + TH1 cells, and aberrantly high TNF-\u03b1 levels, causing a diminished recall response 41 . Our finding that antibody recall to Cal/09 was also absent in all non-responders and in some who lost seroprotection to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that while the overall IgG recall is substantial, the antigen-specific recall response in these participants is blunted not only against SARS-CoV-2 but also the Cal/09 pandemic influenza strain, perhaps due to overall lower level of total IgG antibodies ( Table 1) .",

IgG antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat antihuman IgG detection antibody (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) at a 1:4,000 dilution and colorimetric development was accomplished using 100 \u03bcL of 0.1% 2,2'-azino-bis(3ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS, Bioworld, Dublin, OH, USA) solution with 0.05% H2O2 for 18 minutes at 37\uf0b0C. The reaction was terminated with 50\u03bcL of 1% (w/v) SDS (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA). Colorimetric absorbance was measured at 414nm using a PowerWaveXS plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). All samples and controls were run in duplicate, and the mean of the two blank-adjusted optical density (OD) values were used in downstream analyses. IgG equivalent concentrations were calculated based on a 7-point standard curve generated by a human IgG reference protein from plasma (Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA, USA), and verified on each plate using human sera of known concentrations.",
