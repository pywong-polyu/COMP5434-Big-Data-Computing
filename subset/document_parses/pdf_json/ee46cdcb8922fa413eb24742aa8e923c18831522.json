Multiple searches were run of academic databases in 2018-2020, examining literature on mobile apps for peripartum mental health. Multiple searches were also run of the iOS and Android app stores in 2019 and 2020, looking at apps for peripartum mental health. Results were compared within the academic dataset as well within the commercial app dataset; the two datasets were also examined for overlap. The academic search results were notable for small sample sizes and heterogeneous endpoints. The app store search results were notable for apps of generally poor quality (as assessed by a modified Silberg scale). Very few of the mHealth interventions studied in the academic literature were available in the app store; very few of the apps from the commercial stores were supported by academic literature. The disconnect between academically developed apps and commercially available apps highlights the need for better collaboration between academia and industry. More collaboration between the two approaches may benefit both app developers and patients in this demographic moving forwards. Additionally, we present a set of practice guidelines for mHealth in perinatal psychiatry based on the trends identified in this review.",

Robust evidence has demonstrated the elevated prevalence of mental illness in the perinatal period, with postpartum depression affecting up to 1 in 7 women (Osborne et al. 2015) . Perinatal anxiety, mania, and psychosis further increase the prevalence and burden. The myriad consequences of undertreated perinatal mental illness are well documented, including impaired fetal development, impaired maternal-fetal bonding, and difficulties for offspring later in life (Bansil et al. 2010; Field et al. 2006; Beebe et al. 2008; Glover et al. 2010; Murray et al. 2003) . Perinatal illness also has the potential to be associated with mortality; suicides account for 1 in 5 perinatal deaths (Lindahl et al. 2005) , and postpartum psychosis is associated with up to a 4.5% risk of infanticide (Brockington 2017) .",

This need for mental health care has only increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (Czeisler et al. 2020) . Given the prevalence and impact of perinatal mental illness, as well as the lack of resources, there is a need for innovative solutions to increase access to information, resources, and care.",

Today, smartphone prevalence rates among women in the USA are around 79% and above 90% for women ages 18-49 (Pew 2019). Through surveys, smartphones can capture traditional scales like the EPDS and through sensors can also capture data related to activity, sleep, energy etc. This real-time data offers a novel window in perinatal mental health that allows understanding of how both the environment and temporal dynamic impact clinical state. Finally, there are already thousands of mental health apps available today offering on demand psychoeducation, therapy skills, and other resources that are easily accessible. This access combined with potential for novel data capture and interventions presents a new opportunity to not only expand access to evidence-based care but also quality of that care.",

Reviews of research on general depression, anxiety, and substance use have examined the research evidence for mental health apps and found the current evidence does not support recommending them for routine clinical use (Lecomte et al. 2020; Connolly et al. 2020) . In terms of the marketplace and app stores, increasing research suggests that apps available to consumers are often untested ) and may present privacy risks that may expose sensitive mental health data . For example, in January 2021, the period tracking app, Flo, settled Federal Trade Commission allegations that the company inappropriately shared the health information of users (FTC 2021) . Preliminary evidence has shown that women in the perinatal period are likely to use mobile devices to access health-related information (Osma et al. 2016) , suggesting that perinatal mental illness may be an area well-suited to digital mental health interventions. Recent reviews have examined the research in the perinatal app space (Dol et al. 2020; Hussain-Shamsy et al. 2020; Chan and Chen 2019) , and one review in 2017 investigated the commercial apps available to patients (Zhang et al. 2017) . However, no recent reviews have examined both the marketplace offerings and the clinical evidence, to provide a complete picture both of the evidence for apps in this space as well as the quality of apps which are available to consumers. In this review, we aim to summarize research findings and marketplace apps with the goal of informing clinicians and patients about current risks and benefits, as well as proposing clinical implementations advice and a harmonized agenda for both academic and industry advancement in this space.",

Four out of the 12 apps indicated some connection to academia. Taken together, these two trends (very little academic One name, no credentials No involvement for commercial apps, and very little commercial availability for academically developed apps) suggest a concerning disconnect between the academic approach and the commercial approach to the digital mental health space in this population. We found that even finding apps on the commercial marketplace was not simple, as four of the articles described apps which were available when searched for by name but did not appear in our survey of the app stores. When considering the patient population, we modeled our search terms (e.g., \"postpartum depression\") after what we believe real patients would type into the app store when searching for resources. Therefore, there is some question as to whether apps which exist in the store but are not easily found can be considered as resources available to the average patient. Apps were assessed based on a number of criteria, including a modified Silberg scale (Griffiths and Christensen 2000) , which is a tool to evaluate the quality of digital health information. Of the 12 apps in this study, only three specified the source of their funding. In the initial search of the app stores in 2019, only one of the apps (14%) commented on what was done with user data (another app stated that it \"may collect anonymous usage data\" but did not clearly state what was done with that data). In contrast, when the search was run again a year later, 4 out of 12 (33%) specified what they did with user data, which may suggest a positive trend towards more transparency around data use. Overall, these apps provided little of the data necessary for users to make an informed decision about the app's quality. Also worthy of note are the apps which were not included in this analysis. Of the results from searching \"postpartum depression\" in the Android app store in 2020, 9% (n = 22) were not related to mental health at all. Of those, more than half were fitness apps, promising faster ways to lose baby weight. While physical activity can help reduce the burden of depressive symptoms, the focus on body image and messaging of these apps is troubling, particularly in this context.",

A secondary analysis revealed that five apps from the initial search results were still available in the app stores, but no longer appeared as results of the same search, while two apps from the initial set were no longer available in the app store. This suggests changes in the search algorithms of the app stores themselves, as well as turnover in app availability, which may pose limitations for systematic research in this area.

Ideally, this tool can be used by patients and providers together, to guide conversations about specific apps and whether they may be appropriate for that patient's needs. While the space remains nascent, understanding its limitations and being able to explore those with patients is a critical skill today, as more and more patients are interested in digital mental health tools. The disconnect between academically developed apps and commercially available apps highlights the need for better collaboration between academia and industry. The academic approach, as shown in this review, has the advantage of a basis in evidence and rigorous measurements, but many of the apps developed by academia don't make it to consumer-facing platforms. The industry approach has an advantage at getting new apps into consumers' reach, but would benefit from a more evidence-based approach to both the tips provided in these apps and to the interventions themselves. More collaboration between the two approaches may benefit both app developers and patients in this demographic moving forward.",
