            "text": "SARS-CoV2 outbreak hit the entire world in late winter/early spring 2020, with a dramatic mortality rate in hospitalized patients across countries. While the pandemic has been continuing to hit on a global scale, the mortality rates started to decline with respect to the initial observed levels. In the current issue, Carolina Garcia Vidal and colleagues [1] report a decrease in COVID-19 mortality in a consecutive cohort of patients admitted over a period of six months (from March to September 2020) to the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Spain. According to this study, overall mortality decreased from 11\u00a26% in March 2020 to 1\u00a24% in September 2020 in the overall cohort, with the reduction being observed particularly in those older than 70 years. Importantly, the authors report a concomitant decrease in the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality from 19\u00a21% in March 2020 to no mortality in the September 2020. The study describes other important findings, namely the changes over time in patient characteristics at hospital admission, as well as in treatment approaches. In March 2020 the clinical presentation of patients was characterized by signs of hyperinflammation, high D-Dimer levels, high CRP and low absolute lymphocyte count. Along the same lines, during the more recent months, the medical treatments for COVID-19 patients changed significantly, with an earlier use of remdesivir after symptoms onset replacing lopinavir/ritonavir, a more frequent use of dexamethasone and a decrease in the use of antibiotics. Patients admitted with shorter duration of symptoms before hospital admission experienced higher mortality. This may be in part related to the high viral load which may affect clinical outcome, highlighting the need of prompt intervention on such patients, as recently demonstrated by Marks et al. [2] .",

The use of antivirals changed after demonstration of a possible effectiveness of the early use of remdesivir in reducing mortality [6] . Anti-inflammatory drugs and immunomodulation therapies to reduce the cytokine release storm induced by COVID-19 were extensively used, targeting different pathways of inflammations. In addition, dexamethasone was more frequently used, replacing the use of other corticosteroids [7] . Furthermore, dysregulated inflammation and endothelial cell direct injury promote the expression of coagulation initiating factors, like tissue factor, on cell surfaces, thereby causing downstream activation of coagulation, common in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The rapid start of anticoagulant regimens [7] with low molecular weight heparin for prevention of COVID-19 related complications is also reflected by the significant decrease of D-dimer levels reported over the months in the present study. Other important factors contributing to the improvement of COVID-19 management included the availability of Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) and the possibility of performing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) outside the ICU, together with the beneficial effect of prone positioning.",
