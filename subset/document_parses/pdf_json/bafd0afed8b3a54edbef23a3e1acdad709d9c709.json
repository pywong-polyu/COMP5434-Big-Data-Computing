In particular, this study aims to provide basic principles for future ERT implementation. Seven universities in Indonesia were involved in the first phase of the study, aiming to obtain initial information regarding the relevance, content validity, and readability of fundamental initial principles of ERT. The second phase aims to assess the quality ERT scale quality using confirmatory composite analysis (CCA) procedure, involving 2,957 undergraduate students from 22 universities in ten provinces in Indonesia. The results seem to indicate that the ERT principles can be viewed as 1) a complementary tool for ERT design covering five principles including simplicity, accessibility, affordability, flexibility, and empathy; and 2) In Indonesian higher education, affordability and flexibility are the two principles that are rated the lowest based on students' experiences. The lack of access to a fast, affordable, and reliable Internet connection in some areas of Indonesia is a fundamental problem in implementing ERT. This result is likely to be the case in other developing countries with similar geographical characteristics. The findings provide information based on practical experience -showing that learning design in a crisis is dynamic and open to revision based on socioeconomic considerations, technological infrastructure, and students 'and teachers' readiness.",

ERT is contrary to online learning, which is preplanned and designed to be delivered virtually (Hodges et al., 2020) . The main purpose of ERT is not to completely transfer the conventional methods to e-learning, but to provide temporary access during emergencies using various available and reliable media or platforms. Thus, ERT can be understood as a temporary solution and should be separated from the term \"online learning\" (Hodges et al., 2020) . Accordingly, online learning is an alternative and flexible option for universities/colleges, while emergency remote teaching is an obligation to protect the educational community from spreading the virus. Therefore, online learning and emergency distance teaching are not the same since their purpose and function are different.",

Several authors had a different research focus in highlighting ERT activities, such as differences between online learning and ERT, emergency curriculum design, and how to evaluate ERT. For example, Hodges et al. (2020) specifically provide important points regarding the difference between ERT and online learning. Mohmmed et al. (2020) evaluated ERT implementation. Wang and East (2020) constructed an emergency curriculum during the pandemic, while Whittle et al. (2020) developed a conceptual framework for responsive online teaching in a crisis. Other studies (e.g., Green et al., 2020; Karakaya, 2020) used the activity-centered analysis and design (ACAD) framework to design ERT in New Zealand, and Karakaya (2020) focused on a human-centered approach. Several researchers have focused on various pedagogical constraints in remote teaching activities (Bozkurt and Sharma, 2020; Ferri et al., 2020; Gelles et al., 2020; Peters et al., 2020; Rapanta et al., 2020) . More comprehensively, Reimers et al. (2020) developed a module as a framework to guide an education response to the Pandemic. This module aims to support education leaders in developing three essential components: curriculum, professional resources, and tools or technology used as learning media. However, none of them specifically developed principles for implementing ERT. In addition, geographical differences and different technological readiness between countries cause the conditions for ERT implementation to be different, thus giving the possibility of different results. Thus, this study aims to fill this gap by proposing the principles for implementing ERT more universally.",

The current study examined administrators', lecturers', and students' perceptions as reflections of the principles and challenges behind the implemented ERT model based on the current situation. ERT principles are novel in their foundational work and guide developing online courses and distance learning modes in unplanned or responsive remote teaching situations. Specifically, this study explored two research questions: (1) What are the main principles for implementing ERT?; (2) How do students' perceptions about emergency remote teaching during the pandemic? Two studies with a mixed-method approach were conducted to answer these questions: the first study to explore the relevant principles in implementing ERT involving an expert panel for content validity, readability, and logical flow. The next phase (Study 2) is a quantitative endeavor involving 2,957 undergraduate students from 22 universities in ten Indonesian provinces. This second stage provides an overview of student responses to the five principles generated in Study 1.",

However, it is undeniable that the response of educational institutions is almost the same and that they are experiencing a shock in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly because of societal shifts (Aguliera and Nightengale-Lee, 2020) . While all countries ordered all provinces, districts, and school levels to close face-to-face learning services in schools and shift activities to online media, the response was mixed. The speed of the change from conventional methods to online delivery was staggering (Hodges et al., 2020) , especially for institutions that were not adequately prepared in terms of technology and human resources. In short, learning must be designed through the innovations of each university and teaching staff to develop an effective ERT. Because ERT is a temporary solution, from a practical point of view, it should be distinct from the concept of online learning (Hodges et al., 2020) , which requires a series of development processes.",

From an educational perspective, this idea was developed more specifically as a cognitive approach to becoming more reflexive in dealing with issues of power, access, and representation (Luka, 2014) . Previously, Price and Osborne (2000) described humanizing pedagogy as a pedagogy that focuses on developing the entire person. Thus the reliance on humanizing pedagogy as the basis for ERT is aimed more at providing valuable experiences for learners and their well-being (Salazar, 2013) . In other words, in an emergency, universities and teachers cannot obsessively focus on teaching delivery, knowledge transmission, and lectures using various tools or sophisticated technology (Bozkurt and Sharma, 2020) , but must instead focus on care, collaboration, support, and empathy (Wang and East, 2020) .",

            "text": "Emergency remote teaching, as the name implies, is a learning method specifically designed for emergencies. Using this understanding, ERT is not a long-term solution but a temporary one to maintain educational sustainability. Several authors have focused on remote teaching mode in special situations. For example, Mohmmed et al. (2020) evaluated ERT implementation. Through a case study at Middle East College in Oman, the authors used the CIPP (Context, Input, Process, Product) evaluation model to assess the effectiveness of the adopted learning model during COVID-19. This study provides recommendations for implementing asynchronous activities to provide additional opportunities and flexibility for students compared to synchronous mode. Wang and East (2020) highlighted Chinese curriculum decisions during emergency remote teaching in the context of higher education in New Zealand. They noted that ERT was designed to be student-centered, communicative, and task-based. This approach is considered to build experiential learning and build a strong rapport with students through hands-on activities and teamwork in class. Also, pedagogical innovations are key to the successful implementation of an emergency curriculum. Whittle et al. (2020) developed a conceptual framework for responsive online teaching in a crisis. They introduced an emergency remote teaching environment (ERTE) framework, which consists of the following stages: inquiry, classification, design, and finally evaluation. Their study highlights several important aspects of design, learning goals that must be adapted to the situation, paying attention to the ratio between lecturers and students, developing good communication, and encouraging students to become agents of learning in online education. Teachers discussed the possibility of learner-driven assignments. Other studies (e.g., Green et al., 2020; Karakaya, 2020) used the activity-centered analysis and design (ACAD) framework to design ERT in New Zealand, and focused on a human-centered approach. Green et al. (2020) used a theoretical approach to design a transition during an emergency in New Zealand. They drew on the ACAD framework and discussed educational design implications, providing a detailed explanation of tools, social arrangements, and tasks to support learning activities in emergency remote education. On the other hand, Karakaya (2020) gave special notes on the approach of humanizing pedagogy and the pedagogy of care as part of student-/learning-centered design (see Baran and AlZoubi, 2020; Bennett et al., 2017; Luka, 2014; Salazar, 2013) .",

On the other hand, online learning is optional and is best described as an innovation to increase flexibility, accessibility, affordability, and the development of a robust educational ecosystem (Hodges et al., 2020) . We argue that it is not sufficient to base ERT solely on the three principles of simplicity, flexibility, and empathy (Mohmmed et al., 2020) . It is also necessary to consider two additional aspects, accessibility, and affordability, based on community Socio-economic considerations and differences in Internet access speed, which often become obstacles, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, we propose five principles-simplicity, accessibility, affordability, flexibility, and empathy-by combining the previous works (Hodges et al., 2020; Mohmmed et al., 2020 ; The University of Auckland, 2020).",

This situation allowed us to acknowledge the novelty of the ERT phenomenon quickly rather than gathering extensive data that would entail a long time to validate the theories. We conceive the principles from the first study and follow-up questionnaires to obtain opinions on the principles as intertwined. The next phase (Study 2) is a quantitative endeavor involving 2, 957 undergraduate students from 22 universities in ten Indonesian provinces. This second stage provides an overview of student responses to the five principles generated in Study 1.

The collecting data was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Study 1. The Study 1 was conducted in two phases. First, we engaged a panel of seven experts in the initial design of ERT principles. To broaden the scope as much as possible, we included two practitioners from the field of educational technology and five senior lecturers from different universities. The five principles proposed based on the literature review included simplicity, flexibility, empathy (The University of Auckland, 2020), accessibility, and affordability (Hodges et al., 2020) . For content validity, the expert panel was asked to provide input on the items' appropriateness and relevance to the Indonesian education context. Furthermore, the expert panel provides an assessment of the relevance of items with 4 Likert types of items ranging from \"relevant \u00bc 4\" and \"irrelevant \u00bc 1.\" This stage produces five relevant principles as the basis for evaluating ERT implementation, including simplicity, accessibility, affordability, flexibility, and empathy (See Table 1 ).",

ERT is neither an attempt to fully teach the study material in an online mode using various \"advanced\" applications nor a time to strive for the \"best practice\" in online delivery (Wang and East, 2020) . Instead, ERT is focused on delivering practical learning with quick and simple approaches to online delivery of materials and assignments.

(2020) regarding the differences between ERT and online learning. It is not sufficient to base ERT solely on the three principles of simplicity, flexibility, and empathy. It is also necessary to consider two additional aspects, accessibility and affordability, based on community socioeconomic considerations and differences in the speed of Internet access, which often become obstacles, particularly in developing countries.

Cahyadi et al. Heliyon 7 (2021) e07788 especially in Indonesia and developing countries with the same geographical characteristics. Third, ERT principles cannot be separated from the psychological and socioeconomic aspects. In an emergency, we cannot obsessively focus on teaching delivery, knowledge transmission, and lecturing using sophisticated technology (Bozkurt and Sharma, 2020) . We support the term \"humanizing pedagogy\" (Karakaya, 2020) , in which the focus of ERT is to push beyond purely cognitive approaches and become more reflexive. Humanizing pedagogy as a part of the human-centered design may help university teachers to build empathy. Therefore, the ERT design needs to be preceded by assessing students' needs and available technological resources. In general, these five principles support learning design based on evaluating needs and environmental situations (e.g., physical, psychological, economic, health, and spiritual) . Thus, the five principles can be integrated with the ACAD framework (see Carvalho and Goodyear, 2018) and are in line with human-centered design (Salazar, 2013 ) (see Figure 2 ).",

In this sense, online learning and ERT are not the same; they differ in both purpose and function. Imposing teacher-selected or technology-driven learning delivery without considering the macro socioeconomic environment or individual resources could mean that ERT will not meet the principles of accessibility, simplicity, and affordability. For example, using special programs that require fast Internet access and high random-access memory (RAM) on a mobile device will cause new problems, such as obstruction of the learning process and increase quota consumption quickly. Furthermore, most Indonesian students rely on expensive limited-capacity mobile networks, making it challenging to meet their online learning requirements. Consequently, many technical problems can occur in video conferences, such as loss of sound, delayed images, or inability to access classes due to low-speed Internet networks or devices' technical capabilities (for example, the device may not meet the minimum requirements for the application). This condition causes new problems in the learning process rather than make it easier for students. This study argues that the implementation of ERT should be a collective decision by all participant groups. By conducting discussions with groups of students and lecturers, the most effective midpoint may be found to implement learning and reduce the effects of technological boundaries.",

Thus, university administrators must ensure that teaching staff has two essential lecturer competencies, technical and pedagogical. To be effective, administrators should focus on the technical skills of lecturers to run ERT. Although this task can be assisted by IT support in some ways, all lecturers need to prepare technical knowledge and skills in managing online-based learning for the effectiveness of future learning. Apart from technical skills, the most critical aspect is pedagogical ability in managing learning. This ability is needed to maintain student motivation under challenging situations.
