            "text": "Background SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has posed formidable public health and clinical challenges. The use of immunosuppressive agents, such as high dose corticosteroids and cytokine inhibitors (e.g., Tocilizumab) has been suggested to contrast the hyperinflammatory process involved in the pathogenesis of the severe disease, with conflicting evidence. Among the drawbacks of immunosuppressive therapy, the risk of reactivation of latent infections, including parasitic infestations, is to be considered. Case presentation We report a case of a 59-year-old Italian patient treated with high dose intravenous dexamethasone and two intravenous doses of Tocilizumab for interstitial bilateral pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed itching, abdominal pain, and an increased eosinophil count. Stool examination confirmed the presence of S. stercoralis larvae. The patient was treated with a 4-day course of Ivermectin with full recovery. Discussion We report the first case of S. stercoralis infection following an 11-day treatment with high-dose steroids and Tocilizumab for severe COVID-19. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of strongyloidiasis as a complication of the treatment for severe COVID-19.",

Many studies have recently been conducted to identify the molecular pathway leading to alveolar damage in moderate and severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , and have shown the pivotal role of the hyperinflammatory response of the patients' immune system to the virus in determining alveolar destruction [2] . This is the rationale for the use of corticosteroids, to counteract respiratory failure in severely ill patients, along with oxygen supply [3] . Clinical observational studies have described an improvement in clinical symptoms and oxygenation after steroid administration in patients with severe COVID-19 [4] [5] [6] [7] . Moreover, one randomized clinical trial has been recently published to support a survival benefit (the RECOVERY trial) [8] . This controlled, open-label randomized trial provides evidence that treatment with dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg once daily for up to 10 days reduces 28-day mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are receiving oxygen supply, but not among those receiving no respiratory support. On the other hand, IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease, causing what is known as \"cytokine release syndrome\" (CRS), contributing to the development of ARDS. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has been suggested to reduce ARDS-related complications in patients affected by COVID-19 [9, 10] .",

            "text": "In case of immunosuppression, strongyloidiasis can determine an hyperinfection syndrome or disseminated infection, with fatality rates up to 70-100% [15] . In Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome an acceleration in the parasite life cycle leads to excessive reproduction rates within the traditional reproductive sites of the worm (skin, guts and lungs). The number of larvae increases in stools and/or sputum along with clinical manifestations to the respiratory, gastrointestinal system and peritoneum. Disseminated strongyloidiasis is a severe infection which results from massive dissemination to body districts the parasite does not normally reach and colonise, such as the liver, heart, brain and the urinary tract [22] .",

Risk assessment for strongyloidiasis should be performed for people who live or have visited areas, where the organism is endemic. Similarly, we suggest considering this helminth in case of unexplained appearance of hypereosinophilia. When a prompt diagnosis is not feasible, due to the urgency of treatment and the risk of fatal outcome either for COVID-19 or Strongyloides hyperinfection/ dissemination syndrome, empirical pre-emptive single-dose ivermectin therapy must be considered.
