We collated the data provided by the Nepalese Ministry of Health and Population and assessed scenario of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal during the lockdown period. There were only two confirmed cases from 610 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and no fatalities when the government introduced nationwide lockdown. Nepal had performed 7,791 RT-PCR tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests during the lockdown. It has recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of 740 new cases from the total of 4,483 RT-PCR tests performed on a single day. Nepal had reported total 17,994 positive cases and 40 deaths at the end of lockdown. The spatial distribution clearly shows that the cases were rapidly spreading from the southern part of the country where most points of entry and exit from India are located. The Government of Nepal needs to allocate more resources, increase its capacity to test and trace, establish dedicated isolation and quarantine facility and impose local restrictions to manage potential COVID-19 outbreak after easing lockdown.",

On 29 June, Nepal had performed 7,791 tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests during the lockdown. It has recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of 740 new cases from the total of 4,483 test performed on a single day on 3 July. The number of daily cases was decreasing after its peak on 3 July but subsequently, the number of tests were also decreasing. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cumulative cases, recoveries, and active cases during the lockdown. As per the figure, the number of people recovered from the coronavirus in Nepal increased during the lockdown. However, the number of active cases decreased. On 1 July there were 10,390 active cases in the country which was continuously declining till the end of the lockdown period. Lack of proper management of quarantine and isolation centres may have caused a significant increase in cases twomonths after lockdown started as most of the cases were imported from India, and were later transmitted to the community. Data show that the bending of the curve had started before the government decided to lift the nationwide lockdown however the risks of further transmission in the community was prevailing. .

Figure 4 shows the comparison of the COVIRA risk model and Nepal data (relative percentage of CFR). Correlation between CFR in age groups and COVIRA model is 0.986 which shows very good agreement of data. The trend of CFR by age group shows exponential relation with r-square value of 0.714. Hence, one of the alarming points for Nepal is, if the infection spread in the community and the older people get infected, the death toll will rapidly increase.
