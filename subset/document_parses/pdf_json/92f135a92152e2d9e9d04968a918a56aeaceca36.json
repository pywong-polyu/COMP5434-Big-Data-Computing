The continuous global outbreaks of West Nile disease in the bird, human, and horse populations, with no preventative measures for humans, pose a major public health threat. The development of a vaccine that contributes to the \"One Health\" Initiative could be the answer to prevent the spread of the virus and control human and animal disease. The current commercially available veterinary vaccines are generally costly and most require high levels of biosafety for their manufacture. Consequently, we explored making a particulate vaccine candidate made transiently in plants as a more cost-effective and safer means of production. A WNV virus-like particle-display-based vaccine candidate was generated by the use of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher (ST/SC) conjugation system. The WNV envelope protein domain III (EDIII), which contains WNV-specific epitopes, was fused to and displayed on AP205 phage virus-like particles (VLPs) following the production of both separately in Nicotiana benthamiana. Co-purification of AP205 and EDIII genetically fused to ST and SC, respectively, resulted in the conjugated VLPs displaying EDIII with an average coupling efficiency of 51%. Subcutaneous immunisation of mice with 5 \u00b5g of purified AP205: EDIII VLPs elicited a potent IgG response to WNV EDIII. This study presents the potential plants being used as biofactories for making significant pharmaceutical products for the \"One Health\" Initiative and could be used to address the need for their local production in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs).",

            "text": "Serological data have shown that many species can be infected by WNV, with the highest incidence of infection observed in birds, humans, and horses (Marfin et al., 2001) . Infections in humans can result in febrile illness and less commonly neuroinvasive disease with significant mortality and morbidity (Gray and Webb, 2014) . To date, disease treatment is supportive as there is no antiviral treatment and no available human vaccine. Approximately 20% of the infections in horses result in disease development, of which 90% involve neurological symptoms, with 30-40% fatality rates (Ward et al., 2006) . As with humans, there is no antiviral treatment available for horses. However, several equine West Nile vaccines (whole inactivated virus, inactivated/live recombinant) produced in the United States (Castro-Jorge et al., 2019) and Europe (Rebollo et al., 2018) are licenced for use. These vaccines can be difficult and expensive to obtain in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), with regards to import permits, cost of the vaccines, and the need for annual vaccination. Therefore, the preventative strategies tend to rely on the low-tech prevention of mosquito bites (Sule et al., 2018) . The development of a vaccine that contributes to the \"One Health\" Initiative could be the answer to overcoming this challenge. The \"One Health\" Initiative is dedicated to improving the lives of all species, both human and animal, through the integration of human and veterinary medicine and environmental science.",

This is co-and post-translationally processed into three structural proteins-the capsid, membrane (M, translated as prM, the precursor of the membrane protein), and envelope (E) proteins-and seven non-structural proteins (Chambers et al., 1990; Lindenbach et al., 2007) . The E protein is the major virion surface protein and consists of three structurally distinct \u03b2-barrel envelope domains, namely, EDI, EDII, and EDIII. EDIII is an immunodominant domain that is highly variable among flaviviruses and has been suggested to contain the cell receptor binding sites for the infection (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2017; Campos et al., 2018) . Several studies using murine mAbs against E suggest that those directed against EDIII have the highest neutralising potency (Beasley and Barrett, 2002; Nybakken et al., 2005; Oliphant et al., 2005) . Moreover, antibodies binding to EDIII do not result in antibodydependent enhancement (ADE)-unlike antibodies binding to EDI and EDII-when inside cells expressing Fc\u03b3 receptors (Oliphant et al., 2006; Brandler and Tangy, 2013) . Consequently, for the development of recombinant vaccines, EDIII has been the favoured target (Chu et al., 2007; Spohn et al., 2010; He et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "Several antigen-display technologies have been developed and employed for different applications, such as protein cyclisation, creation of multi-component architectures such as hydrogels (Reddington and Howarth, 2015) , vaccine development (Liu et al., 2014) , and protein stabilisation for enzymes (R\u00f6der et al., 2017) . Of interest for this study was the split-intein SpyTag/SpyCatcher (ST/SC) conjugation system. This is based on the spontaneous formation of irreversible isopeptide bonds between the complementary peptides. The ST and SC peptides originate from the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes: the immunoglobulin-like collagen adhesion domain (CnaB2) of the fibronectin-binding protein of this bacterium contains an isopeptide bond between the amine of Lys31 and carbonyl carbon of Asp117. Consequently, the CnaB2 domain was split into two peptides: a 13 amino acid ST peptide containing the Asp117 residue and its complimentary SC peptide of 116 amino acids containing the Lys31 residue. The coupling of ST and SC by the formation of an amide bond has been demonstrated to occur at a range of temperatures (4-37 \u2022 C) and pH values (5-8), in various buffers, and in the presence of non-ionic detergents (Zakeri et al., 2012) . Thrane et al. (2016) used the ST/SC technology to develop a Spy-virus-like particle (VLP) platform. This was achieved by the genetic incorporation of the ST or SC peptides at the N-terminus of the coat protein (CP) of the AP205 bacteriophage, yielding icosahedral particles that display 180 peptide-binding motifs on their surfaces. They evaluated the versatility of this platform by expressing 11 diverse vaccine candidate antigens and successfully expressed and coupled the Spy-antigens to the Spy-AP205 particles in vitro. The immunogenicity of the coupled products was evaluated in mice and robust IgG responses were elicited. This technology has also been used for the development of candidate vaccines for malaria (Brune et al., 2016; Janitzek et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2017; Yenkoidiok-Douti et al., 2019; Harmsen et al., 2020) and breast cancer (Palladini et al., 2018) that are predominantly produced in bacterial and insect cells. Janitzek et al. (2019) demonstrated the potential of this Spy-VLP system for the development of a combinatorial vaccine. The authors genetically fused the L2 gene of human papillomavirus (HPV) and the SC peptide at the 5 \u2032 and 3 \u2032 ends of the AP205 CP gene, respectively, and the ST peptide to the N terminus of the VAR2CSA Plasmodium falciparum protein. These constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified products were coupled in vitro that resulted in the formation of AP205 VLPs, which displayed both the HPV L2 and VAR2CSA antigens at high density. High levels of anti-L2 and anti-VAR2CSA IgGs were elicited in vaccinated mice. With the recent coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19) (Zhu et al., 2020) , several studies have been published using the ST/SC technology for the development of candidate vaccines. Tan et al. (2020) developed a SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine by displaying the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the surface of the mi3 VLP computationally engineered from Thermotoga maritima. In another study, Zhang et al. (2020) displayed the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer on the Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LuS) 60-mer nanoparticle scaffold also employing the ST/SC technology, with a coupling efficiency of \u223c91%. Mice immunised with the LuS:CoV-2 spike nanoparticle elicited a higher neutralising response than the mice immunised with the trimeric spike protein. Both these studies illustrated that a significantly lower dose of immunogen is required to elicit a potent neutralising response when the antigen is displayed on the surface of a particle, compared with when it is used as an immunogen on its own.",

The integrity of the AP205:EDIII VLPs was assessed by TEM of filtered samples containing AP205:EDIII. The particles with a diameter of 30 nm were observed (Figure 4 -yellow arrows). The concentration of the final purified AP205:EDIII complex was determined by anti-WNV-EDIII western blot to be 90 \u00b5g/ml (Supplementary Figure 6) with a total yield of \u223c10.5 mg/kg FLW. On average, the coupling efficiency calculated from repeat experiments was determined to be 51%, translating to \u223c92 WNV-EDIII antigens displayed per AP205 particle. However, the coupling efficiency calculation does not take into account the uncoupled dimer and tetramer ST-AP205 CP bands ( Figure 3B -red arrows) and the intensity of these bands together with that of the monomeric band suggests that the coupling efficiency of this specific experiment was overestimated. The complete absence of uncoupled WNV-EDIII-SC bands ( Figure 3A ) suggests that the low coupling efficiency may be due to the saturation of the protein during coupling. To address this, we evaluated several co-extraction ratios of leaves infiltrated with ST-AP205 to leaves infiltrated with WNV-EDIII-SC/CRT and found that the increase in FLW of the latter resulted in a decrease in uncoupled ST-AP205 CP subunits, suggesting an increase in the coupling efficiency (Supplementary Figure 7) . However, with an increase in WNV-EDIII-SC FLW, we observed a decrease in AP205:EDIII complex yield which is why an extraction ratio of 1:2 was used for generating AP205:EDIII VLPs for testing their immunogenicity in mice.",

The immunodominant domain III of the WNV envelope protein (EDIII) was selected for display on AP205 particles, both to reduce the possibility of ADE seen with the complete protein, and to enhance its immunogenicity. Generally, viral proteins accumulate at reasonable levels when expressed in plants; however, viral glycoproteins express poorly and often below the threshold of detection in plants, for reasons not yet fully understood. Our laboratory has, however, succeeded in dramatically increasing the expression of a variety of complex virus-derived envelope glycoproteins, by co-expression of these with one or other of the human ER chaperone proteins, such as CRT and CNX. Margolin et al. found that plant-expressed ERtargeted glycoproteins from Epstein-Barr virus, Rift Valley fever virus, chikungunya virus, and human immunodeficiency virus were only detectable when co-expressed with a human chaperone protein (Margolin et al., 2020) . It is suggested these ensure correct folding, thus minimising degradation of proteins by targeting them to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway.",

The SC rather than the ST peptide was selected for genetic fusion to the EDIII gene because of the increased expression yields observed for several E. coli-produced proteins when fused to the SC compared with the ST peptide . Additionally, our lab has demonstrated that a higher yield of AP205 CP is obtained from infiltrated N. benthamiana, when it is fused to the ST rather than to the SC peptide (Dennis, 2019) . Infiltration of WNV-EDIII-SC in N. benthamiana resulted in no detectable WNV-EDIII-SC protein expression. Subsequently, we co-expressed WNV-EDIII-SC with the human chaperone proteins, CNX and CRT. The co-expression of WNV-EDIII-SC with either human chaperone allowed detectable levels of WNV-EDIII-SC as assessed by anti-EDIII western blot. A higher yield of protein was obtained when WNV-EDIII-SC was co-expressed with CRT, which was expected as CRT is a soluble luminal protein situated within the ER that is known to associate with soluble proteins, whereas CNX is known to associate with membrane-bound proteins (Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003) . In this study, we showed that co-expression of WNV-EDIII-SC with CRT has resulted in yields of up to 69 mg/kg FLW that are similar to those reported by He et al. (2014) .",

We investigated each of these methods and were able to successfully couple WNV-EDIII-SC to ST-AP205 VLPs for all three tested groups. The ease of coupling by either co-expression or co-extraction compared to the more laborious process of carrying out the various purification methods required for in vitro coupling was viewed as a more promising coupling model for commercialisation purposes, specifically with regard to scaled-up production.

In addition to the monomeric coupled complex of AP205:EDIII, a protein band of \u223c58 kDa was detected by both anti-WNV-EDIII and anti-ST-AP205 western blots. We proposed that this band is a coupled dimeric product that consists of two AP205 CP (33 kDa) with only one coupled WNV-EDIII (25 kDa): given that we continuously observed a dimer and a tetramer of uncoupled ST-AP205 CP in addition to a coupling efficiency of only 51%, it is highly probable that this could be the case. Covalent cross-linking of proteins is a common phenomenon of plant expression (Castells-Graells and Lomonossoff, 2021). Castells-Graells and Lomonossoff showed that the insect virus, Nudaurelia capensis omega virus \u03b1-peptide formed multimers only when in the presence of plant material since procapsids produced in insect cells only consisted of monomeric \u03b1-peptide (Castells-Graells and Lomonossoff, 2021).

Additionally, the IgG antibody level elicited by AP205:EDIII VLPs was significantly higher than that of soluble WNV-EDIII. We anticipated that the VLP-based candidate vaccine would induce a stronger immune response than the soluble WNV-EDIII due to the enhanced antibody responses observed against WNV-EDIII chemically conjugated to VLPs (Spohn et al., 2010; Cielens et al., 2014) . The low immunogenicity of soluble protein antigens can be ascribed to their small size (<10 nm), their increased susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, and poor capacity to activate the innate immune system , therefore a higher dose, multiple injections, and strong adjuvants are required to ensure a strong immune response (He et al., 2014) .",

The same effect was observed for the production of ST/SC coupled SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines, where a lower dose of immunogen coupled to a particle elicited a better immune response in comparison with the corresponding soluble protein on its own (Tan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . These findings illustrate that a significantly lower dose of immunogen is required to elicit a potent immune response when the antigen is displayed on the surface of a particle, compared with the dose when it is used as an immunogen on its own.",

Their immunisation dose was five times more than what was used in our study, however, we observed similar or superior antibody binding titres with our lower dose of soluble WNV-EDIII and AP205:EDIII VLPs, respectively. Additionally, immunisation of 5 \u00b5g plant-made AP205:EDIII VLPs or soluble WNV-EDIII was observed to stimulate an immune response of similar potency to E. coli-produced WNV-EDIII immunised at 25 \u00b5g (He et al., 2014) . This suggests that plants are just as effective at producing WNV-EDIII proteins as E. coli.",

Both AP205:EDIII VLPs and soluble WNV-EDIII elicited potent humoral responses in mice, equivalent to that of protective WNV-EDIII antigens in previous studies. These outcomes show that the ST/SC technology and plant molecular farming have the potential for creating opportunities for LMICs to locally produce their pharmaceuticals, thus working towards fulfilling the goals of the \"One Health\" Initiative. It also indicates the feasibility of making poly-flavivirus vaccines, by coupling SC-tagged EDIII domains of a variety of flaviviruses to a common carrier, such as ST-coupled AP205-and of making the whole system in plants.",
