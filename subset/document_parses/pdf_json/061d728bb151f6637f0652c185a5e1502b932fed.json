These patients have a broad spectrum of B and T cell dysfunctions, so their immunological responses are impaired, and they are prone to a variety of infections (2) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), like intact individuals, can infect patients with CVID. Few studies have reported that CVID patients are not different from other people considering mortality and severity (3) . Due to impaired immune responses, these patients are less likely to have a cytokine storm and severe complications of COVID-19. Instead, they are prone to opportunistic infections, which can mimic COVID-19 manifestations (4) . For this reason, among immunocompromised patients, it is important to distinguish accurately COVID-19 from the differential diagnoses such as P.jirovecii and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of opportunistic infections can lead to perilous consequences, even death (5).",

Symptoms began 14 days earlier and gradually worsened. The most important point in her medical history was the diagnosis of CVID 6 years ago, under treatment with Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) monthly. She also was a known case of ulcerative colitis and was being treated with azathioprine, mesalazine, and prednisolone. Additionally, 1 week before this visit, the patient was diagnosed with CMV viremia, was treated with valganciclovir. At the time of admission, her vital signs were as follows: respiratory rate = 30 /min, pulse rate = 116 /min, blood pressure = 100/65, temperature = 38 \u2022 C, and Saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO 2 ) on room air = 90%.",

The spiral chest Computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral groundglass opacities (compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia) and multiple nodules (consistent with CMV pneumonia or fungal infections) (6, 7). Thus, to cover all the differential diagnoses mentioned above, we prescribed the following drugs: remdesivir (200 mg daily for first day and 100 mg daily for the next 4 days), dexamethasone (8 mg daily for 5 days), voriconazole (6 mg/kg every 12 h for first day and 4 mg/kg every 12 h for the next 7 days), and replacing injectable ganciclovir (5 mg/kg every 12 h for first day and 5 mg/kg daily for the next 13 days) instead of valganciclovir.

Also, no fever was detected since the third day of hospitalization. On the eighth day of hospitalization, the patient did not respond to treatment as expected. In addition, the patient complained of chest pain and had subcutaneous chest emphysema on examination. Therefore, we performed more diagnostic measures. Repeated chest CT scan showed that the groundglass opacities and multiple nodules were reduced. In addition, pneumomediastinum, limited pneumothorax, and subcutaneous emphysema were reported. The patient then underwent bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for Aspergillus and galactomannan (fungal infections ruled out) and SARS-CoV-2 PCR (by targeting RdRp, E, and N genes). But it turned out to be positive for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) genome by PCR. PCR method was used for amplifying mitochondrial large subunit rRNA (mt-LSU-rRNA). So, the patient was discontinued antifungal medication. We first prescribed co-trimoxazole to treat PCP, but the patient had severe hypersensitivity. After discontinuation, a combination of clindamycin and primaquine was administered. The patient was also hypersensitive to primaquine. So, considering pharmacological consult, treatment with high-dose clindamycin (600 mg every 8 h for 7 days) was continued. Additionally, based on surgical consult, high-pressure oxygen was prescribed to treat pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum.",

Considering the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the mentioned clinical characteristics and the ground-glass opacities found in the CT scan, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, due to the inappropriate response to treatment and the background of immunodeficiency, we performed bronchoscopy. Then PCP was diagnosed using PCR. This patient with a history of under-treatment CVID and UC already had a CMV viremia that can aggravate immunodeficiency. Besides, COVID-19 and the medications used to treat it interfere with the immune system. All of these risk factors make the patient susceptible to opportunistic infections such as PCP (11) .",
