Although previous data revealed characteristics of GI symptoms in COVID-19, for patients with only GI symptoms onset, their diagnostic process and potential transmission risk are still unclear. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 205 COVID-19 cases from January 16 to March 30, 2020, in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All patients were confirmed by virus nuclei acid tests. The clinical features and laboratory and chest tomographic (CT) data were recorded and analyzed. Results A total of 171 patients with classic symptoms (group A) and 34 patients with only GI symptoms (group B) were included. In patients with classical COVID-19 symptoms, GI symptoms occurred more frequently in severe cases compared to non-severe cases (20/43 vs. 91/128, respectively, p < 0.05). In group B, 91.2% (31/34) patients were non-severe, while 73.5% (25/34) patients had obvious infiltrates in their first CT scans. Compared to group A, group B patients had a prolonged time to clinic services (5.0 days vs. 2.6 days, p < 0.01) and a longer time to a positive viral swab normalized to the time of admission (6.9 days vs. 3.3 days, respectively, p < 0.01). Two patients in group B had family clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion Patients with only GI symptoms of COVID-19 may take a longer time to present to healthcare services and receive a confirmed diagnosis. In areas where infection is rampant, physicians must remain vigilant of patients presenting with acute gastrointestinal symptoms and should do appropriate personal protective equipment.",

Chinese researchers shared the virus complete genome sequences and extremely facilitated the studies and confirmation of infected patients [4, 5] . Early detection of infected patients is one of the most important steps to take early isolation and mitigate the spread of the virus [6, 7] . Fever, cough and other respiratory symptoms were reported as common presentations of the novel coronavirus infection , and patients with these classical symptoms warrant further screening for viral infection [3, 5, 8] .",

Abbreviations: GI, gastrointestinal. p values indicate differences between group A1 and group A2 or between group A and group B. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant Although previous studies reported GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients, the clinical characteristics, diagnostic duration, and transmission risk for patients with only GI symptoms were still unclear. Here, demographic and clinical characteristics analysis revealed that GI symptoms were presented in 38.5% (79/205) patients (Table 1) which were not less common as previously reported [3] . Additionally, patients with both classic and GI symptoms were more severe which resulted in higher morbidity and mortality than those with only classic symptoms. For patients in group B, GI symptoms were not chronic and always not severe. Awareness and recognition of these acute and mild GI presentations might benefit early screening and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Although GI symptoms in patients with classic symptoms (group A2) were related to more severe cases which could be because of viral infection in the digestive tract, multi-organ failure, or preexisting comorbidities (Table 1) , most patients [91.2% (31/34)] with only GI symptoms (group B) were non-severe. Importantly, 73.5% patients with only GI symptoms already had obvious infiltrates in their first chest CT scans. Mild GI symptoms with sub-clinical COVID-19 pneumonia possibly led to patient misdiagnosis and facilitated the spread of disease. Three severe cases in group B also needed close monitoring. It is also critical for clinicians to follow-up patients with GI symptoms suspicious of COVID-19 because classic symptoms can have a later onset. Early identification and management of these patients can benefit pandemic COVID-19 control (Supplementary Figure 1) .",

It was evident that group B patients presented later to healthcare services (5.0 days in group B vs. 2.6 days in group A, p < 0.01). Mild symptoms possibly contributed to the clinic visit delay. Patients in group B also needed more time to obtain CT scans (6.6 days vs. 3.8 days, p < 0.01), virus nuclei acid tests (7.6 days vs. 4.2 days, p < 0.01) ,and finally hospitalizations (8.2 days vs. 3.7 days, p < 0.01) when compared to group A (Fig. 2a) . Patients in Wuhan were screened for COVID-19 by RT-PCR testing TBIL, total bilirubin; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; AST, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme II from nasal and oropharynx swabs, complete blood tests, virus antibody tests (IgM and IgG), and chest CT scans. Patients had characteristic lung infiltrates with or without classic symptoms but negative for viral RNA which were identified as suspected patients and needed further nuclei acid testing; especially, positive virus IgM was detected. Limited experiences of clinicians, awareness of these patients with only GI symptoms, and variability of virus tests were the possible reasons for delayed diagnosis and treatment. In this study, patients with only GI symptoms took an obviously longer time from their symptoms onset to hospital admissions (13.2 days in group B vs. 6.3 days in group A, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2b) . These results indicated that GI symptoms were easily neglected or underestimated and might be misdiagnosed. Although anorexia sometimes was not considered as a GI symptom, it was one of the commonest symptoms for patients in China to search GI clinic services. Here, we strongly recommended healthcare workers to pay more attention to extra-pulmonary symptoms of Previous studies demonstrated that GI symptoms also occurred in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection [12] [13] [14] . A metallopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is proved to be the host cell receptor for COVID-19 recognition, the same as SARS-CoV infection [15] [16] [17] . Researchers postulated that besides the most recognized mode of transmission through aerosol droplets, feco-oral transmission was also a potential route of COVID-19 transmission. [18] Just recently, studies revealed that in digestive system, ACE2 expressed in esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon [18, 19] . More importantly, Hoffmann et al. demonstrated SARS-CoV-2-S used ACE2 for entry into target cells and offered important implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and pathogenesis [20] . These results provided evidence of digestive tract as a potential invasive target for SARS-CoV-2 which possibly contributed to gastrointestinal symptoms.",
