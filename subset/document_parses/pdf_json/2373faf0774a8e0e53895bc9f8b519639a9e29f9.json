In this study, we expressed SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in a novel vaccinia virus ACAM2000 platform (rACAM2000). Following a single intramuscular immunization, the rACAM2000 co-expressing the spike and nucleocapsid proteins induced significantly improved protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in comparison to rACAM2000 expressing the individual proteins in a hamster model, as shown by reduced weight loss and quicker recovery time. The protection was associated with reduced viral loads, increased neutralizing antibody titre and reduced neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Thus, our study demonstrates that the rACAM2000 expressing a combination of the spike and nucleocapsid antigens is a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate and further studies will investigate if the rACAM2000 vaccine candidate can induce a long lasting immunity against infection of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. from the immunization with current vaccines [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , new vaccines developed with alternative platforms and/or antigens that are safe, induce effective and long-lasting protection against emerging breakthrough variants, and are also convenient for delivery are still needed.",

Previously it has been shown that deletion of VACV E3L or K3L gene would render the deletion mutant viruses (VACV\u0394E3L or VACV\u0394K3L) attenuated 23, 24 . In addition, it has been shown that VACV\u0394E3L was more potent at inducing innate immune responses than the parental VACV 25, 26 . Thus, it is tempting to use VACV\u0394E3L as a vector to develop recombinant vaccines 27 . However, VACV\u0394E3L has a restricted host range and the capacity of VACV\u0394E3L at delivering antigens is compromised in nonpermissive host cells, such as human cells 28 . Recently, we reported that the host range of VACV\u0394E3L can be modified by swapping VACV K3L gene with a poxvirus K3L orthologue, such as taterapox virus 037 (TATV037), which would enable the virus replication in human cells 29 . Based on the host range specificity of poxvirus K3L genes, we have developed an easy and highly efficient method to construct recombinant VACV using the E3L and K3L double deletion mutant (VACV\u0394E3L\u0394K3L) as the backbone 30 . Using a laboratory VACV strain Western Reserve (WR) , we recently constructed a recombinant VACV\u0394E3L expressing the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein, in that its original K3L gene was replaced with a poxvirus K3L orthologue, TATV037. We demonstrated that the VACV\u0394E3L vectored recombinant virus was as immunogenic as MVA vector expressing RSV F protein to induce protection against RSV challenge in cotton rats. Importantly, the recombinant virus was highly attenuated in mice 31 .",

In comparison with the MVA platform, recombinants constructed based on this ACAM2000\u0394E3L\u0394K3L backbone have two novel features. First, the E3L gene, which encodes a potent inhibitor of innate immune responses (e.g. IFN and TNF-\u03b1 pathways) 25, 26 , was deleted, thus the recombinants should be more immunogenic. Second, exchange of VACV K3L with the poxvirus ortholog TATV037 renders the virus replication-competent in 5 human cells 32 , thus increasing the capacity of the recombinants to express the candidate antigens. Since most of current COVID-19 vaccines use the spike (S) protein as an immunogen and the escape SARS-CoV-2 variants from the vaccine induced neutralization immune response have been on the rise 33 , a different immunogen is desirable for the future vaccine development. Therefore, we used the ACAM2000\u0394E3L\u0394K3L as a backbone to construct three recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidates expressing SARS-CoV-2 S (rACAM2000S), nucleocapsid (N, rACAM2000N) , and a combination of the S and N (rACAM2000SN). A poxvirus K3 orthologue TATV037, which will enable ACAM2000\u0394E3L\u0394K3L replication-competent in human and rodent cells was used as a selection marker 30 . Hamsters were immunized with a single intramuscular (i.m.) injection of the rACAM2000 viruses and the protective efficacy was examined following intranasal (i.n.) challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

First, the E3L gene was disrupted using a transient selection method similar to the previously described 36 , except an mCherry fluorescent protein was used as the transient selection marker (supplemental Figure 1A) . The purified E3L deletion virus (ACAM2000\u0394E3L) does not carry the selection marker mCherry, as colorless plaques were selected during the plaque purification. Then, the K3L gene was disrupted by insertion of an EGFP gene driven by the VACV late promoter p11 using the standard homologous recombination procedure 37 (supplemental Figure 1B ). The ACAM2000\u0394E3L with the disrupted K3L gene (ACAM2000\u0394E3L\u0394K3L) was selected and purified using EGFP as the selection marker.

Based on this protocol, we used the ACAM2000\u0394E3L\u0394K3L as the backbone and the TATV037 as a selection marker to construct recombinant ACAM2000 (rACAM2000) expressing the wild-type full-length SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins separately or in combination. The genes were synthesized by Genscript (NJ, USA) based on the Wuhan isolate with a FLAG tag included at the C-terminus (Genbank accession number MN908947). Silent mutations were made to remove the poxvirus early transcription termination signal, TTTTTNT, in the genes. The structure of the recombinant shuttle vector is shown in Figure 1A . The TATV037 gene is highly homologous with VACV K3L 32 and the TATV037 gene was used as one of the flanking sequence for homologous recombination. Since the native VACV K3L promoter likely resides in the adjacent K4L gene, which forms a part of the flanking sequence, the promoter for a sheeppox virus K3L ortholog gene was used to drive the transcription of TATV037 to avoid unwanted in-genome homologous recombination.",

On day 5 post challenge, 12 animals (6 males and 6 females) of each vaccinated group were euthanized, underwent necropsy, and tissues were collected for histopathological examination and viral load analysis. Another 12 hamsters (6 males and 6 females) were monitored for up to 28 days and body weights were recorded daily for 15 days post challenge. Following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, the major clinical signs shown by hamsters were weight loss and lethargy. Since weight loss is quantifiable, the percentage of weight change was used as the main indicator of clinical disease. The daily weight changes of each hamster is shown in Figure 3A . The percentage of the maximum weight change and the DPI (day post infection) when the maximum weight loss occurred are summarized in Figure 3B and 3C respectively. In the rACAM2000S vaccinated group, the maximum weight loss occurred 1 day earlier (5 DPI vs 6 DPI, P<0.1) than the rACAM2000vc group on average, while the difference in the maximum weight loss was not statistically significant (9.5% vs 12.2% in comparison with the rACAM2000vc). The rACAM2000N induced moderate but statistically significant protection as measured by maximum weight loss and the DPI when maximum weight loss occurred (7.9% vs 12.2% in the vector control, 5DPI vs 6 DPI of the vector control, P<0.01 and P<0.1 respectively, Figure 3B and 3C). In comparison to the rACAM2000vc, rACAM2000S and rACAM2000N groups, the maximum weight loss of the hamsters vaccinated with rACAM2000S plus rACAM2000N or rACAM2000SN (expressing S and N from the same recombinant virus) were significantly less (5% and 5.4% vs 12.2% in the rACAM2000vc group, P<0.0001, Figure 3B ). In addition, the maximum weight loss occurred markedly earlier following the vaccination with the recombinants expressing S and N antigens than other groups (a median of 3 or 4 DPI vs 5 or 6DPI, P<0.0001 and P<0.001 respectively, Figure 3C ).",

Representative images of hematoxylin and eosin stained, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from male and female hamsters are shown at 2X and 20X magnifications in Figure 8A . Gross lesions were evident in all lung tissue with varying severity of pulmonary pathology. Generally, the rACAM2000vc vaccinated animals showed more severe interstitial pneumonia with bronchiolitis, necrosis, edema and hemorrhage regardless of the gender of the animals in comparison to the animals vaccinated with rACAM2000 expressing the S and/or N proteins. Pulmonary pathology from lungs of animals vaccinated with rACAM2000N showed less severe infiltration of leucocytes than in rACAM2000vc vaccinated animals, while those vaccinated with other constructs showed some degree of leucocyte infiltration into airway lumen. The extent of interstitial pneumonia across each lung lobe section was estimated in comparison to non-infected control hamsters ( Figure 8B ). The overall percentage of the lung tissue with interstitial pneumonia was less in the hamsters vaccinated with rACAM2000 expressing the S and/or N proteins than the rACAM2000vc group, albeit the difference in the case of some constructs, e.g. rACAM2000N and rACAM2000SN was not statistically significant. It is interesting to note that the individual variation in the percentage of interstitial pneumonia lung tissue among hamsters vaccinated with the S and/or N constructs (ranging from approximately 25% to 100%) was greater than the rACAM2000vc group (ranging from 70% to 100%) ( Figure 8B ). [11] [12] [13] [14] . More recently, a recombinant MVA expressing both the S and N proteins was shown to induce neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses 16 and was protective against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hamsters and NHPs 17 . Although MVA is well known for its safety record and capacity to express foreign proteins, Its immunogenicity is lower than the first generation of VACV 27,45-47 . Moreover, for the application as a recombinant vaccine vector, it has been shown that MVA vectored vaccine candidates tend to work well as a booster rather than primary vaccine in a heterologous prime-boost regimen 48 . Thus, there is a need to develop alternative VACV vectors to improve immunogenicity.",

Since VACV E3L is a virulence gene and the protein it encodes is a potent inhibitor of host innate antiviral immunity, deletion of the E3L gene renders the virus attenuated and more immunogenic than wild-type VACVs 23, 25, 26 . In addition, exchange of the authentic VACV K3L gene with a poxvirus ortholog TATV037 makes the recombinant virus replication-competent in human cells, and thus more robust at expressing a target antigen protein 32 . Recently, we used this platform to construct a recombinant RSV vaccine candidate based on VACV WR strain (a laboratory strain VACV). It was found that the recombinant virus induced comparable protective immune response to the MVA based recombinant in cotton rats and was avirulent in mice 31 .",

We anticipate that the modification of rACAM2000, (i. e. deletion of the host range gene Neutralizing antibody is a major indicator of the protective immune response induced by S proteinbased COVID-19 vaccines 57 . In sera collected post-vaccination, but prior to the SARS-CoV-2 challenge, none of the vaccinated hamsters developed detectable neutralizing antibody. At 5 days post SARS-CoV-2 challenge, however, the neutralizing antibody titre in the hamsters vaccinated with the recombinants expressing the S protein (rACAM2000S, S+N and SN) was significantly higher than the vector control (rACAM200vc). Therefore, rACAM2000 expressing the S protein (rACAM2000S and rACAM2000SN) induced effective memory B cell response responses for the S protein, which were boosted following SARS-COV-2 infection to produce significant level of neutralizing antibody. Unexpectedly, the neutralizing antibody titres in hamsters vaccinated with rACAM2000N were lower than rACAM2000vc control hamsters following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In fact, 7 out of 12 hamsters in the rACAM2000N group did not show detectable levels of neutralizing antibody post SARS-CoV-2 challenge, compared to 2 out 12 hamsters in the rACAM2000vc group ( Figure 6C ). The similar antibody profile was also demonstrated by ELISA. Therefore, the protection induced by rACAM2000N was the effect of cellmediated immune responses. It is possible that vaccination with rACAM2000N induced a strong Th1 immune response that may have resulted in a weaker anti-spike Ab response. It is interesting to note that hamsters vaccinated with rACAM2000SN also developed lower S antibody levels than the hamsters immunized with the rACAM2000S+rACAM2000N and rACAM2000S ( Figure 6A ). This could be due to the combined effects of the antigen presentation and/or an unknown biological function of the N protein.",

Among COVID-19 patients, increasing evidences have demonstrated that men tend to develop more severe clinical manifestations [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . To our knowledge, however, it is unknown if the currently used COVID-19 vaccines induce different protection between men and women. In this study, we found that rACAM2000 expressing SARS-CoV-2 N protein protect male and female hamsters differently, in that the vaccinated female hamsters recovered significantly quicker than the males following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Further investigation of this observation should aid in an improved design of vaccines and therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.",

In this study, we found that the protection induced by rACAM2000s expressing the S and N proteins was associated with reduced NLR in hamsters following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that immunization with a COVID-19 vaccine candidate reduced the NLR. However, it should be noted that the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters is not the same as human COVID-19. Further studies with a different animal model, particularly those with more reagents available for various immunological assays (e.g. a mouse model) should provide more information on the link between immunization, reduced NLR and disease development.",

To control the COVID-19 pandemic, effective and safe vaccines are essential. Since the start of the pandemic at the end of 2019, there have been almost 300 COVID-19 vaccine candidates that are in clinical or pre-clinical development 1 . To date, COVID-19 vaccines based on several different platforms have been approved for human use, including mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/BNT162b2, Moderna/mRNA-1273), adenovirus vector based vaccines (Oxford/AstraZeneca, Janssen-Johnson & Johnson, Sputnik V) and inactivated virus vaccines (SinoVac, Covaxin). It is an extraordinary achievement that COVID-19 vaccines have been successfully deployed for clinical application in humans within one year after the onset of the pandemic. Clinical data have shown that a nationwide mass immunization with Pfizer/BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine could effectively curb the spread of the disease 2,3 . Thus, it is encouraging that the COVID-19 pandemic can be contained with a vaccination approach. However, in consideration of the continuous spread of the virus and increasing cases of breakthrough infections",

Body weight was recorded daily for 7 days post vaccination and the percentage of weight change is shown supplemental Figure 2. Most of the animals gained weight at 7 days post vaccination. Although a few hamsters vaccinated with rACAM2000N, rACAM2000S or rACAM2000SN lost a moderate amount of weight in the first week post vaccination, their body weight recovered prior to the challenge with SARS-CoV-2 at day 21 post vaccination (data not shown).

However, with continuous spreading of the virus, SARS-CoV-2 variants which can cause breakthrough infections from the immunity induced by the vaccines are rapidly emerging 33 . Although the administration of a third dose of the current vaccine (i.e. BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine) has been shown to be effective 43,44 , new vaccines, which are capable of inducing long-lasting protection against a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 variants, are needed to efficiently combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we performed an initial investigation on the protective efficacy of the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidates expressing both the S and N antigens based a novel VACV ACAM2000 platform. MVA, the most popular VACV vector for recombinant vaccines 10 , has been used as one of the major viral vectors for development of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Several studies have reported that a recombinant MVA expressing the S protein induced protective immune responses in transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 and in non human primate (NHP) model",

Since the N protein is an abundantly expressed protein and more conserved among various SARS-like viruses than the S protein 49 , it is conceivable that combining the S and the N proteins in the vaccine design would likely provide improved protection against the emerging variants.Conserved T-cell epitopes in the N protein have been identified among SARS-CoV-2 variants and these epitopes may induce cross-protective immune responses against a wide range of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 50,51 . Several studies have demonstrated that the N protein vaccine candidates based on different platforms induced protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection 17,52-56 . In this study, we constructed three novel rACAM2000 based COVID-Hamsters vaccinated with a single dose of constructs expressing both the S and N antigens (rACAM2000S+rACAM2000N or rACAM2000SN) were significantly better protected than hamsters vaccinated with the rACAM2000S or rACAM2000N (Figure 3B, 3C). Thus, our study clearly demonstrates that the immune responses induced by the N protein contribute to the overall protective efficacy. A recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on MVA expressing both the S and N proteins was shown to protect hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 infection after two doses of vaccination 17 . It would be valuable for the future design of recombinant VACV based COVID-19 vaccines to compare the protective efficacies of the recombinant MVA 17 and the rACAM2000 (described in this study) vaccine candidates expressing both the S and N proteins. It is interesting to note that the effect from immunization with rACAM2000N on the viral load in the distal tissues, e.g. liver and small intestine, was more significant than the proximal respiratory tissues, such as nasal turbinate and lung. This observation suggests that the rACAM2000N induced immune responses limited the virus dissemination from the primary infection site (i.e. lung). Further studies are required to elucidate the link between the development of clinical disease and the virus dissemination in the hamster model. A similar finding was also reported in a mouse model, in that SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the brain of K18-hACE2 mice immunized with a combination of the S and N expressed from an Adv5 platform was lower than the mice immunized with the S only construct following i.n. challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus, while there was no significant difference in the viral load in the lung 54 .",
