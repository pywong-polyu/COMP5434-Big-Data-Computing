In this pilot survey study of hematology-oncology (HO) fellows at a large academic training program, the majority of 20 respondents (43% of all fellows) reported a plan to specialize in medical oncology, and most planned to practice in an academic setting. Fellows who had started the job search process reported using several tools/techniques including online job centers and email distribution lists, word of mouth, prior connections with other institutions, and their HO fellowship program leadership, and most reported that their current institution provided help for their job search in at least one way. Job search challenges included learning about available positions, lack of mentorship on the process, lack of sufficient time for the process, and lack of preparation for negotiation. Fellows suggested additional resources that could be helpful to future job searchers including access to information about prior HO fellowship graduates, training in negotiation and interviewing, and career development mentorship. We plan to use this information to expand our own Career Development program for fellows enacting many of these suggestions, and we encourage the use of this information as pilot data for the development of larger studies across other medical and surgical specialties.",

Given the lack of prior studies in the literature specifically regarding the job search process for graduating HO trainees, it is somewhat difficult to compare these results to other studies within the specialty itself. Our findings are generally in accordance with the literature in non-HO fields. Regarding challenges faced during the job search, a survey of graduating pediatric urology fellows similarly found that issues regarding identification of available positions and contract negotiation were commonly cited during the job search process [4] . In pathology, international medical school graduates reported greater difficulty in finding and accepting positions, similar to the Visa issues faced by fellows in our study [5] . Regarding new tools/ techniques and recommendations for improvement, a study of critical care fellows found that less than half of trainees received formal guidance from mentors or training programs regarding post-fellowship employment, but that the vast majority felt it would be important to have formal training programs in the job search and interview process [6] . A survey of recent endocrine surgery fellow graduates noted that fellows cited increased mentor involvement with the job search process and training in job search strategies as areas for fellowship program improvement [7] . One difference between our study and a study of radiation oncology trainees was that while a minority of radiation oncology fellows found jobs through the American Society for Radiation Oncology Career Center [8] , our fellows reported that their mostutilized resource was society-run online job centers such as the American Society of Hematology Job Center [9] and American Society of Clinical Oncology Career Center [10] .",

These studies could be conducted using inperson interviews and a grounded theory approach. As leaders invested in our fellows and their career development and future success, we plan to use the results of this pilot study to make changes within our own HO fellowship program. We will develop a database of recent fellowship graduates containing information on their current position and contact information, and hope to invite several recent graduates for a panel discussion on their own experiences with the job search process and suggestions they have for current fellows. We also plan to develop more formalized sessions on contract negotiation and Visa assistance as part of our ongoing Career Development curriculum. We also see a role for large specialty societies such as the American Society of Hematology and American Society of Clinical Oncology to provide additional resources and training opportunities for fellows undergoing the job search process. Overall, this study highlighted for us several ways that we could improve our current guidance to fellows and we hope that other HO fellowship programs and professional societies also find this information helpful in informing their career development programs in the future.",
