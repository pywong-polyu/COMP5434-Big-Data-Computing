One lecture was given separately to each group (twice in total). Both lectures were given using the same slides, which were translated into each native language, Japanese and English. First, a periodontist (T.T.) presented clinical scenarios. Next, a clinical anatomist/dentist (J.I.) addressed the scenario from a clinical anatomical point of view (Figure 1 ).",

Taken together, even after the pandemic, interactive online lectures from different states/countries might provide postgraduate CA education to dentists who are located anywhere in the world.
