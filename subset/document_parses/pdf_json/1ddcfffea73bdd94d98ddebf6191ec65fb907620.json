With this foundation, we then propose an influence graph, using which we assess the intent of fake news spreaders.

That is, by informing them of the news falsehood, or simply requesting from them to pay attention to news accuracy before spreading the news [24, 36] . Such findings encourage social media platforms to develop more gentle strategies for these unintentional fake news spreaders to reasonably and effectively combat fake news. Clearly, such strategies should vary from the aggressive deactivation and suspension strategies that platforms adopt for inauthentic or toxic accounts (e.g., Twitter 1 and Facebook 2 ). For example, platforms can present such unintentional fake news spreaders with useful facts, motivating the need for new recommendation algorithms. Such algorithms not only recommend topics to these users that they enjoy reading the most (or users they are similar to), but also facts or users active in fact-checking (see Fig. 1 for an example) [18, 36, 47] .",

Furthermore, knowing that some users had malicious intent in the past provides a strong signal indicating that their future posts are also potentially fake. This information can be immensely useful for fake news detection [47] . While determining the intent is extremely important, it is yet to be investigated. This work: Assessing Spreading Intent. We aim to assess the intent of individuals spreading fake news. Our approach to assessing the intent of fake news spreaders relies on fundamental social science theories and exploits advanced machine learning techniques. In particular, we first look into psychological factors that can contribute to the unintentional spreading of fake news (see Section 2.1). These factors can be categorized as internal influence and external influence [47] . To capture these factors, and in turn, quantify intent, we propose an influence graph; a directed, weighted, and attributed graph. The degree to which fake news spreaders are intentional/unintentional can be assessed with this graph. To evaluate our assessment, we first extend two fake news datasets by introducing annotated intent data of fake news spreaders (intentional or unintentional) due to the unavailability of ground truth. With this data, we validate the assessed intent and show that it can strongly differentiate between intentional and unintentional fake news spreaders. We further show through experiments that the assessed intent can significantly enhance fake news detection.",

With advances in deep learning, recent attention has been paid to employing multimodal (textual and visual) information of news content to detect fake news (see related work such as [1, 26, 39, 43, 46] ). On the other hand, propagation-based methods utilize auxiliary social-media information to predict fake news. Some examples of such information include post stances [33] , post-repost relationships [37] , user comments [32] , and profiles [9] .",

Hence, an individual is more unintentional in spreading a news article if his or her spreading behavior receives more internal and external influence. Specifically, both confirmation bias [20, 21] and selective exposure [12, 19] point out that the more consistent an individual's preexisting attitudes and beliefs are with the fake news, the higher the probability that the individual would believe the fake news and unintentionally spread it (internal influence) [15, 30, 47] . As availability cascade [14] and social identity theory [3, 13] suggest, individuals can be affected by others as well. An individual would be more unintentional in spreading a fake news article if the spreading follows a herd behavior; i.e., the individual's participation matches extensive participation of others and his or her attitude conforms to the attitudes of most participants (external influence) [47] . Problems then arise on social media: where can one find out the preexisting attitudes and beliefs of a user, the participation of users, and their attitudes towards a news article? We note that a user's preexisting attitudes and beliefs can be reflected in his or her historical activities on social media. For most social media sites, such historical activities include past posts, likes, and comments. Similarly, the participation of users often takes the form of posting, liking, and commenting. Hence, mining the content of posts and comments allows understanding users' attitudes. For simplicity, we start with posts in this work to determine users' preexisting beliefs and participation. In sum, a user spreads a fake news article in his or her post more unintentionally if the post is more similar to or influenced by (1) the user's past posts (internal influence), and (2) the posts of other users (external influence).",

As user posts are often short and within 512 words (e.g., on Twitter, the number of words are not allowed to exceed 280), 4 we use a pre-trained Sentence-RoBERTa model, which modifies RoBERTa by the Siamese network, to obtain the post embedding [28] ; the model performs best in the task of semantic textual similarity. 5 Differently, as news articles are often long and over 512 words, 6 we employ Longformer [4] to derive the semantically meaningful text embedding of news articles. Longformer addresses the limitation of 512 tokens in BERT by reducing the quadratic scaling (with the input sequence) to linear [4] . For visual features, we extract them using a pre-trained DeepRanking model particularly designed for the task of fine-grained image similarity computation [38] .

Such manual annotation for large-scale data is hence impractical, which drives us to consider algorithmic annotation that accurately simulates manual annotation in an automatic manner. Interestingly, we observe that annotators are more confident in identifying intentional fake news spreaders than unintentional ones. Specifically, the expert annotator is at 0.93 confidence level in identifying intentional fake news spreaders and at 0.75 confidence level in identifying unintentional fake news spreaders. For the graduate student annotator, the confidence score is 0.84 and 0.57, respectively. Both results have \u226a 0.001 with Mann-Whitney U test.

In fact, they have played a significant role in fake news dissemination [11, 31, 34, 47] . As a comparison, unintentional fake news spreaders deserve a \"gentle\" strategy developed by social media platforms: nudging and fact-presenting recommendation are more reasonable than suspension and deactivation, as we specified in Section 1. Therefore, we separate bots and trolls from unintentional fake news spreaders. We further notice that users active in fact-checking can spread fake news as well, in a correction manner; i.e., they clarify news is false (objectively, and not aggressively) and inform other users of it in their spreading. We call the corresponding posts that spread fake news correction posts and these users correctors later in the paper. These correctors enables recognizing news falsehood.

We first employ the assessed affected degree of posts in news propagation within a traditional machine learning framework. Then, we utilize the proposed influence graph within a deep learning framework. I. Combating Fake News by Affected Degree. For each news article, we manually extract over 100 (propagation and content) features as its representation. Propagation features include the average (internal, external, and combined) affected degree of posts spreading the news and a set of widely-accepted propagation features. Content features are extracted using LIWC [22] . See Appendix C for feature details. Five-fold cross-validation and XGBoost [8] are then used with these features for training and classifying news articles. Results indicate that this method correctly identifies fake news with an AUC score of around 0.93. As a comparison, dEFEND [32] , a state-of-the-art method that detects fake news by news content and propagation information, performs around 0.90. Furthermore, we observe that, as presented in Tab. 3, the proposed method performs above 0.89 with limited propagation information of news articles, i.e., at an early stage of news dissemination on social media. Notably, internal affected degree of posts greatly contributes to detecting fake news, whose feature importance assessed by XGBoost ranks top five all along. II. Combating Fake News by Influence Graph. We construct the news-post heterogeneous graph (shown in Fig. 8 ); a post is connected with a news article if the post shares the news, and the relation among posts is modeled by the proposed influence graph . Then, we train the HetGNN (Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network) model [42] with this news-post graph to learn news representation, with which XBGoost [8] is further utilized to predict fake news. Varying the percentage of labeled news from 20% to 80%, this method performs with an AUC score ranging from 0.83 (with small-scale training data) to 0.91 (with relatively large-scale training data) on two datasets. To further evaluate the proposed influence graph , we consider two variant groups of the constructed heterogeneous graph as baselines. One replaces by a random version ( Random ): Based on our graph sparsification strategy (see Appendix A), we construct the random graph by randomly selecting a hundred posts for each post ensuring that no self-loops are formed in this graph. The other replaces by its subgraph (i) with internal influence only ( Internal ); (ii) with external influence only ( External ); or (iii) with internal and external influence but the latter only exists between two posts sharing the same news ( Same News ). Tab. 2 presents the full result; Subgraph in the table refers to Same News , which performs best among all subgraphs. We observe that in general, the proposed influence graph outperforms its variants in detecting fake news, especially with limited training data. See Appendix C for other implementation details.",

            "text": "We look into the phenomenon that social media users can spread fake news unintentionally. With social science foundations, we propose influence graph, with which we assess the degree to which fake news spreaders are unintentional (denoted as affected degree). Strategies to sparse the influence graph and normalize the affected degree by determining its upper bound are presented as well. We develop manual and automatic annotation mechanisms to obtain the ground-truth intent (intentional or unintentional) of fake news spreaders for MM-COVID and ReCOVery data. We observe that the affected degree of intentional fake news spreaders are significantly less than that of unintentional ones, which validates our assessments. This work helps combat fake news from two perspectives. First, our assessed intent helps determine the necessity of a fake news spreader being nudged or recommended with (users active in sharing) facts. Second, we present that the assessed spreader intent and proposed influence graph effectively help detect fake news with an AUC score of around 0.9. Limitations and Future Work: We effectively assess the degree to which fake news spreaders are unintentional, but remain the task to classify a fake news spreader as an intentional or unintentional spreader. We point out that merely relying on determining a threshold for affected degree is barely enough. To address this problem, we aim to propose a more complicated classification model in the near future, which involves non-posting behavior (e.g., commenting, liking, and following) of news spreaders.",

With HetGNN, we use pre-trained transformers to extract content features of nodes (Longformer [4] for news stories and Sentence-BERT [28] for tweets). The news node is associated with the news embedding and the average embedding of its connected posts. The post node is associated with the post embedding, the average embedding of its connected news, and the average embedding of its connected posts. Hence, the Bi-LSTM length of news content encoder is two, and that of post content encoder is three. For both datasets, the embedding dimension of HetGNN is 1024, the size of sampled neighbors set for each node is 23 (3 news nodes plus 20 post nodes), the learning rate is 0.0001, and the maximum number of training iterations is 50. The other hyperparameters are set the same as mentioned in [42] .",
