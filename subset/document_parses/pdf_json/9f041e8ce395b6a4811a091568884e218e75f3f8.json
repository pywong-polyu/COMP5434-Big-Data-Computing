All patients had respiratory rate > 40; FiO 2 > 0.7(on NIV); PiO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 100 and D-dimer>1000 ng/ml. C.T. Pulmonary Angiography could not be done in these patients due to poor general condition, but 2D echo was normal and none of the patients was in shock. So there was no conventional indication of thrombolysis in these patients, yet after thrombolysis, we saw dramatic changes in oxygenation. All patients became off oxygen within 3-7 days and were discharged within 2 weeks. The whole idea was to prevent intubation, since mortality rates are very high in intubated COVID19 patients. tPA is associated with <1% risk of fatal bleed. In this unprecedented pandemic with high mortality rates, thrombolysis could be an effective and safe option in carefully selected critically ill patients of COVID19.",

These series have shown presence of fibrin rich microthrombi and macrothrombi developing in lungs of critically ill COVID19 patients. Probably COVID Induced Coagulopathy (CIC) mimics presentation of subclinical pulmonary thromboembolism: both disease have significant pulmonary vascular shunting without hypotension initially, with significantly raised markers like D-dimer and BNP. But unlike sub-massive PE (in which there is a welldefined clot), there is widespread microthrombi and continuous ongoing inflammation causing hypercoagulability in COVID19. In sub-massive PTE, mortality is in the range of 3-5%, so thrombolysis is not advised routinely due to risk of thrombolysis induced life threatening bleeding (1%). But in COVID19 which can cause severe hypercoagulable state in some patients, mortality rates varies from 30 to 50% in critically ill patients on HFNC to 80-90% in patients on mechanical ventilation [6] . Surprisingly, very few cases of bleeding have been reported with COVID; probably coagulation pathway is significantly tilted towards hypercoagulable state rather than bleeding tendency. One study showed complete fibrinolysis shutdown, as evidenced by elevated D-Dimer and complete failure of clot lysis at 30 min on thromboelastography in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [7] .",
