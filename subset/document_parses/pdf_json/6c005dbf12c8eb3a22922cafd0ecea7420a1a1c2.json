Although susceptible to confounding, the test-negative case-control study design is the most efficient method to assess VE post-licensure. Control of confounding is often needed during the analyses, which is most efficiently done through multivariable modeling. When a large number of potential confounders are being considered, it can be challenging to know which variables need to be included in the final model. This paper highlights the importance of considering model uncertainty by re-analyzing a Lyme VE study using several confounder selection methods. We propose an intuitive Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) framework for this task and compare the performance of BMA to that of traditional single-best-model-selection methods. We demonstrate how BMA can be advantageous in situations when there is uncertainty about model selection by systematically considering alternative models and increasing transparency.",

While these methods are easy to implement, they can have several limitations. For example, restricting the analysis to a single model can lack transparency, and may lead to uncertainty about the potential effects of the variables ultimately not included in the final model. An alternative approach to selecting a single model is Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). Several studies have shown that in the presence of model uncertainty, BMA can provide better inferences than single-model selection methods [10, 11] . However, few have explored the use of BMA in the context of case-control VE studies [12, 13] . In this study, we explore the importance of model uncertainty by re-analyzing data from a Lyme VE study using various confounder selection techniques. We then describe an intuitive BMA framework that is tailored for the analysis of case-control VE studies and compare the performance of this BMA approach to that of traditional single-best-model-selection methods.",

The methods for the Lyme VE study have been previously described [14] . Briefly, cases were residents of Connecticut, 15-70 years of age, reported to the Department of Public Health as having Lyme disease. Up to 2 controls were identified and matched to each case by age. All participants were interviewed, and medical records were reviewed from primary care providers to ascertain immunization history, evaluate potential confounders, and verify the participant's case-control status.

We then tested 3 traditional, single-model-selection approaches. The first selection approach was the two-stage method. In this approach, we first considered each of the potential confounders separately by fitting numerous binary conditional logistic regression models. A multivariable model was then built by including all variables that were statistically significant (p-value <0.05) on the binary models. The second selection approach we used employs backward selection. This approach began with the \"full model\" (all potential confounders), and then each potential confounder was eliminated, one-at-a-time (least significant first), based on whether it had a p-value cutoff of <0.2 [15] . The third approach we used incorporated the leaps-and-bounds algorithm to search across the modeling space and select the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) score [16] .",

Hence, our approach begins by first assigning a prior probability to each model to create a probability distribution of all candidate models. The prior probabilities reflect how likely a given model is based on how well it fits the data and how many covariates exist in each model. To approximate this, we use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which is a measure of goodness of fit that penalizes the overfitting models (based on the number of parameters in the model), and minimizes the risk of multicollinearity [17, 18] . BIC estimates can be obtained in most statistical packages or can easily be computed with two values from the logistic regression outputs (sample size and the maximum likelihood).",

After fitting each potential model, we assign a BIC score to each model and approximated the probability of each model by comparing its fit and complexity relative to the \"best BIC-model\" (the model with the lowest BIC). Model weights were then estimated using the relative difference in BIC's, which is equivalent to the Bayesian posterior model probability given the candidate models. The BIC-derived weights are then used to rank all models by their posterior probability of being the best approximation of the true model. We use this rank to ascertain how informative each candidate model is relative to the top model. Then, we use the estimated posterior model probabilities to reduce the modeling space to the most realistic models by dropping the models that provide little to no improvement in fit (i.e., those with a posterior probability of <1% relative to the best model). After reducing the modeling space to only the top subset of models, we recompute the BIC-weights for the newly defined subset of models and only use this top subset for model averaging procedures. Credibility intervals (95%CI) are calculated using the unconditional error. After calculating the pooled OR and 95%CI on the log scale, they are exponentiated to obtain the weighted average of the VE estimate. This BMA approach also allows for comparisons to be made about the relative importance of each potential confounder based on how it may improve the fit of the model. To make these assessments, we extract the BIC-weights from the top subset of candidate models that included a confounder of interest and take the sum of them to estimate the given variable's posterior inclusion probability (PIP).

For comparison, the estimate using a model that only controlled for race, which was excluded from model averaging procedures due to its poor fit, is also shown in Figure 1 . Averaging across the top 15 models, the model-averaged aOR was 0.31, corresponding to a VE of 69% (95%CI= 18% to 88%). The components of each model, their BIC-derived weights (i.e., their model probability), and the PIP of each potential confounder are summarized in Figure 2 . Figure 3 summarizes the performance of the various single-best model-selection techniques examined. The unadjusted effectiveness of 3 doses of Lyme vaccine was 59% (95% CI: -4% to 84%). On bivariate analysis, we identified seven variables that were significantly different between cases and matched controls based on P-values.

First, we show how the selection of a poorly specified model could significantly affect the interpretation of the VE. For example, when re-analyzing the Lyme VE data, had the model that only controlled for race been selected as the final model (excluded model in Figure 1 ), the VE would have been significantly lower (59%), and the confidence intervals would have been bloated to suggest that it was not statistically significant (95% CI: -1% to 83%). This demonstrates the potential advantage of BMA, as it is systematic in the consideration of alternative models and can facilitate assessments of the effect confounders have when included in the model [19] .",

We found that the top-ranked model in the Lyme VE study had a weight of 0.15, which means that there is a 15% probability that it is the best model given the alternative models. Had this model clearly stood apart from all candidate models as the one with the best fit (i.e., if it is >90% better than all other candidate models), then further BMA would have been unnecessary, and the single best model could have been used to estimate the VE. However, the models ranked 2-4 had a similar fit and competed for the top spot (probabilities of 0.12-0.15). This variability underlines another advantage of using the BMA estimate, as this uncertainty in model selection is then accounted for in the credibility intervals across several models [20] .",
