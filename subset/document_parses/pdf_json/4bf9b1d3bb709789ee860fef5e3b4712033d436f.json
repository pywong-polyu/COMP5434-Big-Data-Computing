Assembly election in four states and a union territory of India was taken place during March-May 2021 when the Covid-19 second wave was close to its peak and affected a huge number of people. We studied the impact of assembly election on the effective contact rate and the effective reproduction number of Covid-19 using different epidemiological models like SIR, SIRD, and SEIR. We also modeled the effective reproduction number for all election-bound states using different mathematical functions. We separately studied the case of all election-bound states and found all the states shown a distinct increase in the effective contact rate and the effective reproduction number during the election-bound time and just after that compared to pre-election time. States, where elections were conducted in single-phase, showed less increase in the effective contact rate and the reproduction number. The election commission imposed extra measures from the first week of April 2021 to restrict big campaign rallies, meetings, and different political activities. The effective contact rate and the reproduction number showed a trend to decrease for few states due to the imposition of the restrictions. We also compared the effective contact rate, and the effective reproduction number of all election-bound states and the rest of India and found all the parameters related to the spread of virus for election-bound states are distinctly high compared to the rest of India.",

The number of confirmed and deceased individuals was increased drastically during the election (as shown in the shaded region of Figure 3 ). The effective contact rate and effective reproduction number were showed a sharp rise for the cumulative study of all election-bound states during the time of election. The effective reproduction number was also increased drastically from early April 2021 and reached a maximum value of \u223c8 for the SEIR model. For SIR and SIRD models, the peak value of R(t) reached \u223c 2.5. The value of R(t) was \u223c1.03 on the date of announcement of the election and increased drastically to a record value of 8.3 for the SEIR model during election time (on April 11, 2021). The right side of Figure 3 showed the variation of different parameters for non-election states of India, which indicated that the value of the effective contact rate and effective reproduction number during the same time is less compared to election-bound states. So, it was evident that the impact of the election and political activities on the spread rate of the Coronavirus was significant for India.",

The grey dotted lines indicated the announcement date of the election and red dashed lines pointed to the different phases of election for mentioned states. The blue solid line shows the date of warning notice of ECI to political parties. The black solid line indicates the date of counting and election result. 8 All rights reserved.

SIR and SIRD models showed a similar trend and varied between 0 and 0.17 and reached a maximum near March 19, 2021. The third panel showed the variation of recovery rate \u03b3(t), which was varied between \u223c0.06 to 0.12 during February-April. The variation of effective reproduction number showed in the bottom panel of Figure 1, which increased drastically during February-April for all the mathematical models. Using the SEIR model, the effective reproduction number (R(t)) reached the highest value of \u223c4 during the mid-week of March 2021. For SIR and SIRD models, the value of the effective reproduction number varied between 0.75 and 2.1 and peaked near March 28, 2021.",
