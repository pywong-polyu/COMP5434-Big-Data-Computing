In this sense, identifying specificities of each location is essential to minimize the damage caused by the disease. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the vulnerability of 853 municipalities in the second most populous state in Brazil, Minas Gerais (MG), in order to direct public policies. An epidemiological study was carried out based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using indicators with some relation to the process of illness and death caused by COVID-19. The indicators were selected by a literature search and categorized into: demographic, social, economic, health infrastructure, population at risk and epidemiological. The variables were collected in Brazilian government databases at the municipal level and evaluated according to MCDA, through the Program to Support Decision Making based on Indicators (PRADIN). Based on this approach, the study performed simulations by category of indicators and a general simulation that allowed to divide the municipalities into groups of 1-5, with 1 being the least vulnerable and 5 being the most vulnerable. The groupings of municipalities were exposed in their respective mesoregions of MG in a thematic map, using the software Tabwin 32. The results revealed that the mesoregion of Norte de Minas stands out with more than 40% of its municipalities belonging to group 5, according to economic, social and health infrastructure indicators. Similarly, the Jequitinhonha mesoregion exhibited almost 60% of the municipalities in this group for economic and health infrastructure indicators. For demographic and epidemiological criteria, the Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte was the most vulnerable mesoregion, with 42.9 and 26.7% of the municipalities in group 5, respectively. Considering the presence of a population at risk, Zona da Mata reported 42.3% of the municipalities in the most vulnerable group. In the joint analysis of data, the Jequitinhonha, Vale do Mucuri and Vale do Rio Doce mesoregions were the most vulnerable in the state of MG. Thus, through the outlined profile, the present study proved how socioeconomic diversity affects the vulnerability of the municipalities to face COVID-19 outbreak, highlighting the need for interventions directed to each reality.",

In this sense, individuals living in urban areas are more likely to test positive for the disease when compared to individuals living in rural areas (47, 48) . Thus, the lower vulnerability verified in Norte de Minas mesoregion is due to the much lower urbanization rates in comparison to the average state, in addition to the low demographic density and predominance of smaller cities (12) . Furthermore, proving this strong relationship, it is important to mention the specificity of Montes Claros (Figure 3-1) , a municipality in the Norte de Minas that differs in terms of higher rates of urbanization and, for this reason, exposed a similar profile to the municipalities located in the center-south portion of Minas Gerais, with high vulnerability, comparable to the Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte mesoregion (49) .",

Remarkably, this information is relevant as, in the context of the pandemic, the politicians have focused on populations at risk considering mainly comorbidities and age (46) . However, socioeconomic issues have been in the background, which may favor COVID-19 exposure and mortality. Additionally, economically disadvantaged people are more likely to live in accommodation with high number of people and less access to open areas, besides to having unstable occupations that do not allow remote office work (46) .

            "text": "Considering the number of tests for COVID-19, an important factor in determining the prevalence of infection/disease in the population (28) , Brazil, as the vast majority of other developing countries, has a very modest number when compared to developed countries (52) . Despite being the second country with the highest number of absolute deaths and the fifth with the highest number of deaths per million inhabitants, Brazil is only the 14th country testing patients, hence demonstrating a serious concern (53). The context of Minas Gerais is even more worrying, considering that the state has the third lowest number of tests per thousand inhabitants among the 26 states and 1 federative unit (6) . This has failed to identify potential transmitters and directly influences the number of reported cases, which may be much lower than the actual number. Additionally, questions have been raised about possible underreporting of cases, which further aggravates the state's situation, thus making government intervention urgent (7) . The factors of comorbidities and age, which compose the population at risk indicators, were raised during the pandemic in order to draw a well-defined profile of people more susceptible to the complications of COVID-19. Both in Wuhan, China (54) and in the Italian states (55) , respiratory and cardiac diseases, as well as neoplasms, diabetes and advanced age are considered factors for complications of the clinical condition and of higher mortality. In this sense, access to health infrastructure and education acts as an aggravation of diseases, and the region that is able to provide more appropriately these resources to the population ensures better conditions to prolong life (56) . Importantly, a greater longevity is also accompanied by an increase in the elderly population, which is more affected by chronic diseases, and with regard to COVID-19, these diseases act as complicating factors of the clinical condition. Thus, as reported by this study, the worst social and health infrastructure indicators in the Norte de Minas may be associated with lower longevity, hence leading the northern portion of the State to have fewer people in the risk group (57) . On the other hand, the Zona da Mata is better assisted, which leads its population to be longer-lived and, consequently, to have a higher number of people more susceptible to the health complications caused by COVID-19.",

In this sense, the observance of the great impact of the mesoregions further south and southeast of the state becomes relevant when considering that these places are located on the border with the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which concentrate the highest number of cases in Brazil. Besides that, the lower socioeconomic development in the north of Minas Gerais favors the scenario of underreporting of cases in the state, which can be associated with a large northsouth discrepancy in the numbers found. Thus, social distance should be considered through reliable measures, including travel restrictions or even the institution of lockdown, which have proven effective in countries such as China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France and the United States (60) . In addition to these measures, others widely used worldwide must be promulgated with greater avidity in the most affected municipalities, including awareness about the use of personal protective equipment, social distance, closing schools and business buildings, quarantine, cleaning and disinfection and increase in the number of tests (19, (61) (62) (63) (64) .",

Therefore, a more segmented analysis of the state should be conducted, as proposed by this work, in order to identify the particularities of each municipality and mesoregion in the search for interventions that have an effect in a faster and more practical way, as the context requires. In this scenario, measures are needed to contain the spread of the disease in the state as a whole, not just in the most economically important regions. For this, the problem of capillarity of the state related to social, economic and health indicators must be solved, so that everyone has a similar capacity to fight the pandemic. As a result, the state will not only benefit from combating the COVID-19 pandemic, but also from combating all inequalities that have been consolidated in Minas Gerais and directly affect the quality of life of the population in the less-assisted regions.",
