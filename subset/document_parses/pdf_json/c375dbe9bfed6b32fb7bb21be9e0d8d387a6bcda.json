Considering a highresolution (1 Hz) data set provided by a large European bookmaker, we investigate the effect of news on the dynamics of live betting. In particular, we consider stakes placed in a live betting market during football matches. Accounting for the general market activity level within a state-space modelling framework, we focus on the market's response to events such as goals (i.e. major news), but also to the general situation within a match such as the uncertainty about the outcome. Our results indicate that markets might overreact to recent news, confirming cognitive biases known from psychology and behavioural economics.",

For comparison, as of 2010, the gross gaming revenue was reported as 6 billion euro only. The total amount of stakes placed has increased in recent years, and this concerns especially the market for bets placed during a match -the so-called live betting market (sometimes also referred to as in-game betting or in-play betting). Whereas in the past the vast majority of bets were placed before the start of a match, nowadays the share of live In this contribution, we consider a high-resolution (1 Hz) data set covering stakes placed (i.e. the amount of money) in a live betting market, which was provided by a large European bookmaker. We use this unique data set to investigate betting dynamics in a football live betting market. Specifically, these high-resolution data enable a finegrained analysis of betting patterns, which differ with respect to the course of the match or teams' strength. The main focus of our analysis is on the market's response to news.",

In total, our data include 274,778 intervals (i.e. observations). Regarding the major news in a football match, i.e. the goals scored, we observe 969 goals in total, corresponding to an average of 3.2 goals per match. Figure 1 shows the average stakes placed in each interval (indicated by the dots), together with the number of goals observed in the interval (indicated by the bars).

The Elo ratings vary across matches, i.e. they account for the current form of a team, but remain constant within a single match. It seems intuitively plausible that teams with higher Elo ratings attract more bets, simply as better teams tend to attract more fans, many of whom prefer to bet on their favourite team (see, e.g., Feddersen et al., 2017 and Feddersen et al., 2020) . This is similar to sentiment traders in financial markets, whose investment decisions are beyond rational pricing (see e.g., Baker and Wurgler, 2007 , Brown and Cliff, 2005 Braun and Kvasnicka, 2013 .

To account for uncertain courses of a match which may cause increased stakes, we introduce a further covariate, called ginidiff in the following, capturing such changes by subtracting the current Gini at interval t from the Gini at the beginning. A decreasing ginidiff value coincides with a rather uncertain course of the match, for example after VfB Stuttgart equalised against Bayern Munich (see Figure 2 ). Here, the ginidiff value dropped from 0.029 to -0.027, which means that after the goal the bookmaker considered the winning chances to be more balanced than at the beginning. Vice versa, an increasing ginidiff coincides with a course of the match associated with decreasing outcome uncertainty, as indicated by a ginidiff value of 0.1765 after Bayern Munich scored their fourth goal. Table 1 briefly summarises all covariates considered. 3 Modelling stakes in a live betting market Figure 2 indicates clear serial correlation in the time series to be modelled, with extended periods of low (e.g. before 16:00) but also of high betting activity (e.g. around 16:30). This example time series further highlights that betting patterns vary according to the course of a match, and in particular in response to important events, namely goals: when a team has a clear lead and the match outcome is fairly certain (e.g. after",

However, while discrete states may be easy to interpret, the use of a continuous-valued state process provides more flexibility as a corresponding model can capture gradual changes in the underlying market activity level, which makes more sense conceptually as there is no clear justification for a finite number of market activity levels. This reasoning is analogous to that of corresponding modelling approaches in finance, where share returns are typically modelled via stochastic volatility models, with a continuous-valued state process (see, e.g., A\u00eft-Sahalia et al., 2007; Langrock et al., 2012; Barra et al., 2017) .

In contrast, this effect is only half as large for slightly surprising goals (\u03b2 4 = 0.218), and vanishes almost completely for unsurprising goals (\u03b2 5 = 0.034). While, in general, positive effects of goals may seem intuitive, it is worth remembering that the odds (and hence the potential profits) for the goal-scoring team naturally decrease. Our results thus indicate that the increased confidence of bettors regarding the outcome more than outweighs the substantially decreased odds, especially for surprising goals.",

A well-documented finding in psychology and behavioural economics is that humans tend to \"overreact\" to (unexpected) events and news (see, e.g., Ma et al., 2005; Piccoli et al., 2017) and to attach too much weight to recent information (see, e.g. Durand et al., 2021) . For stock markets, such overreaction of investors results in prices moving too heavily compared to shifts in fundamental data (see, e.g., De Bondt and Thaler, 1985; Howe, 1986; Kudryavtsev, 2018) . In our analysis, we observe an increased market activity level for unexpected courses of a match (\u03b2 2 ) as well as surprising and slightly surprising goals (\u03b2 3 > 0 and \u03b2 4 > 0 ), which might be due to overreaction of bettors. Bettors appear to overreact in particular to goals, as the market activity level for the goal-scoring team increases even though the associated decreased odds will obviously reflect these news. Bookmakers could exploit this bias by increasing their margin for the odds of the goal-scoring team, as they can still expect clients to place bets on that team to win the match. Following such a pricing strategy could thus increase the bookmakers' profits.",

The accuracy of the approximation can easily be checked by increasing m as well as the width of the range (i.e. b m \u2212 b 0 ) -when this results only in negligible changes in the estimates and the maximum of the likelihood function, then the approximation is virtually exact.",

For such an outlier detection in the live betting market, it would seem to be crucially important to incorporate the underlying market activity level, as we propose with the SSM approach considered here. For example, if news such as goals lead to a notably increased market activity level in a certain period of time, associated with very large stakes, then a model without a corresponding state process would -most likely erroneously -label these stakes as suspicious. To avoid such false positives in an automated system for detecting match fixing, it is thus important to explicitly model the general market activity level and how it evolves over time driven by news during the match.

To obtain a more detailed picture of our final model aside from such visual inspections, we compare the actual stakes to the corresponding simulated stakes for all goals scored in all matches. In particular, to check whether our model mimics the betting patterns after scored goals, for each goal scored we consider the sum of the actual stakes placed during the first three minutes after a goal. For the simulated data, we average the simulated stakes for each three-minute interval over 500 Monte Carlo simulations. To further check the adequacy of our model with respect to the different types of news, we again distinguish between unsurprising goals, slightly surprising goals, and surprising goals.The comparison is shown inFigure 4, demonstrating that our final model adequately captures the stakes placed after a goal. The most notable mismatch is found for the slightly surprising goals, where the stakes of the actual data are smaller than expected by our model.A further characteristic of our data is that sometimes no stakes are placed, e.g. in situations where the match is almost decided. To check whether our model is able to capture the occurrence of these zeros, we compare the proportion of observations where no stakes are placed to the expected proportion under our final model. For the modelbased proportion, we again use Monte Carlo simulation. Comparing these proportions over all matches, we find that our model predicts that no stakes were placed in about 7.3% of all intervals, which is very close to the true proportion of 7.2%. In addition, our model correctly predicts 96.5% of the intervals where stakes were placed.",
