Outcomes related to the quality of these assessments and the impacts on system capacity have not been systematically examined. This systematic review identifies and summarizes published studies that included ASD diagnostic training for primary care providers (PCPs) and aims to guide future training and evaluation methods. Methods: Systematic searches of electronic databases, reference lists, and journals identified 6 studies that met 3 inclusion criteria: training for PCPs, community setting, and training outcome(s) reported. These studies were critically reviewed to characterize (1) study design, (2) training model, and (3) outcomes. Results: All studies were either pre-post design or nonrandomized trials with a relatively small number of participants. There was considerable heterogeneity among studies regarding the training provided and the program evaluation process. The most evaluated outcomes were access to autism diagnosis and accuracy of diagnosis. Conclusion: Training PCPs to make ASD diagnoses can yield high diagnostic agreement with specialty teams' assessments and reduce diagnostic wait times. Current data are limited by small sample size, poor to fair quality study methodology, and heterogenous study designs and outcome evaluations. Evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the overall effects of training PCPs for ASD diagnostic assessments. Since further research is still needed, this review highlights which outcomes are relevant to consider when evaluating the quality of ASD assessments across the continuum of approaches.",

Delays in ASD diagnosis lead to a missed window of opportunity for early interventions. Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefit of early intervention, such as improvements in social and communication skills, 6 cognitive abilities, 7-9 verbal abilities, 6 adaptive behavior, 9, 10 and potential to reduce societal costs. 11 Therefore, to improve the long-term outcomes for patients with ASD, it is imperative to address the impediments to timely diagnosis.",

This presents a bottleneck for many patients because wait times commonly exceed a year. 12 There have been numerous innovative approaches aimed at enhancing early detection of ASD, such as initiatives to increase ASD screening, telehealth-supported models, and novel assessment models. 13, 14 Recent disruptions to standard care related to COVID-19 encouraged prioritization of strategies aimed at increasing overall diagnostic capacity and accessibility. One of the most promising approaches to improving access is training primary care providers (PCPs; e.g., family physicians or community pediatricians) to provide comprehensive assessments. Encouraging community-based assessments for less complex presentations of ASD is supported by the most recent guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and Canadian Pediatric Society. 12, 15 Although recent studies have evaluated whether PCPs, with appropriate training, could perform as reliable and valid an ASD diagnostic assessment as a specialist team, it remains unclear whether adding community assessment pathways will reduce wait times and improve access to early interventions. To address these questions and guide future training and evaluation efforts, we conducted a systematic review of all published studies of ASD diagnostic training for PCPs, with the aim of summarizing and critically assessing (1) the training models and how they were implemented and (2) the reported outcomes.",

            "text": "Vol. 43, No. 1, January 2022 Diagnostic wait times for ASD have reached a critical level. 29 The development of innovative approaches to address challenges will be of great value to families and systems of care alike. 14 There are several barriers to developing and evaluating PCPs' training programs highlighted in the reviewed studies. First, ASD assessment by traditional multidisciplinary teams is very resource and time intensive. Having patients go through similar diagnostic processes twice, as part of the accuracy evaluation, would require significant resource investments and dedication from patient families. This may limit participation. One study video recorded the PCP's interview and assessments, enabling expert teams to form independent diagnostic impressions based on these recordings. 22 This approach could reduce the required time commitment and travel for families for confirmatory assessments. Second, training programs are time intensive for PCPs. After training, community pediatricians may not have the time, resources, or infrastructure to incorporate the assessments into their clinical practices or to participate in evaluative studies. In addition, higher-volume and lower-complexity clinical activities may be better reimbursed for fee-for-service primary care physicians; thus, enhanced reimbursement and/or alternate payment models may be needed for sustainability of a PCPbased diagnostic stream. PCPs in these included studies may have had special interest in ASD and/or protected time for ASD assessments and may not be representative of all PCPs. Targeting \"local champions\" in the care of patients with ASD may be essential to building community capacity. Incorporating a task-sharing approach in primary care, whereby other nonphysician primary care workers (e.g., case managers, community health workers, or therapists) support PCPs' diagnostic assessments, is another strategy. There are also recent feasibility data on incorporating ASD diagnostic assessment into pediatric residency training, which may also enhance community capacity. 30 Furthermore, eligibility for supports and services may depend on including measures (e.g., adaptive skills or other relevant functional domains) that may be less accessible to PCPs than to specialized teams. Mitigating strategies are possible. First, PCPs could work in partnership with other community professionals to complete such measures. These assessments could provide the developmental context to inform differential diagnoses, consistent with current American Academy of Pediatrics practice recommendations. 15 Second, leaders from ASD centers could work with decision/policy makers to ensure that requirements for specific measures are aligned with what is essential to inform care and not to inadvertently create barriers to diagnostic access. Ensuring the sustainability of improved access to ASD diagnosis related to PCP training is important. To date, there are no data to indicate to what degree trained PCPs maintain an active role in ASD assessment be-yond the initial study period. Reimbursement models (as noted above) and other potential incentives, such as ongoing continuing education/case discussion opportunities, may be needed. Indeed, maintaining a longitudinal relationship to the specialized assessment team would be beneficial to provide PCPs with ongoing support as the clinical landscape and evidence base changes over time. These points argue for consideration of system-level issues and the need for longer follow-up when assessing strategies to increase access to ASD diagnoses.",

Patients selected for this process should be determined before assessment by either group to reduce selection bias. Although the reviewed training models were generally associated with high levels of concordance between diagnostic decision making by the trained PCPs and local specialty teams, clinical information available to the PCP about the children they were assessing did not generally include language, intellectual, and/or adaptive skill data. Information about the developmental level of the child is needed to inform clinical interpretation of behavioral symptoms, as recommended by clinical practice parameters internationally. 12 Future training efforts should ensure this aspect of differential diagnosis is understood by participating PCPs and ensure that assessment data including developmental level are made available. Finally, conducting future studies in settings that serve diverse patient populations such as race/ethnicity and rural/urban settings would be invaluable.",

A retrospective chart review would provide more objective data than self-reported surveys for these outcome measures. Future studies are needed to evaluate improved access to diagnosis to demonstrate that adding a community assessment pathway is not moving the problem downstream, delaying access to intervention. Family experiences with trained PCPs and the expert teams should also be compared. A comprehensive framework for evaluating effectiveness should include a family-centered approach, continuity of care, and expertise pertaining to local resources. This discussion raises broader questions about how to evaluate the quality of diagnostic assessments, regardless of format and setting. A framework is needed that can be applied across the continuum, from traditional multidisciplinary center-based assessments to solo discipline, \"virtual team\" community assessments, and telehealth-based assessments. We should be working toward overall ASD assessment strategies that might involve multiple pathways within a single community. 12 There are several limitations to this systematic review. We did not include studies that only targeted community-based psychologists trained as diagnosticians, which could be an additional strategy to increasing overall assessment capacity. The number of studies included is small, which made it difficult to assess publication bias. Study methodology for all the studies included was of low quality (e.g., before-after designs and nonrandomized trials), and none of the studies took steps to ensure fidelity. The diversity of training strategies and outcome assessments limited the ability of the review to compare programs and combine data across studies. The studies reviewed spanned the transition from DSM-IV to DSM-V, further complicating the comparison. As such, there is insufficient evidence from this review to draw conclusions about the effects of PCP training in the ASD diagnostic assessment or to recommend one approach over another.",

However, current data are limited and difficult to synthesize because of small sample sizes, variable quality of study methods, and heterogenous study design and outcome evaluation. More rigorous training model evaluations addressing diagnostic accuracy, reduction in wait time, family satisfaction, and longer-term outcomes are needed. The potential to apply these training models on a larger scale holds great promise in improving access to ASD diagnosis, with the advantage of embedding diagnosis within the medical home for some children with ASD. This review also highlights important questions about which outcomes to consider when evaluating the quality of ASD diagnostic assessment, applied across the continuum of approaches, from traditional center-based teams to novel community-based models. Ultimately, evidence-based training processes could promote further uptake and increase capacity for high-quality communitybased assessments. In combination with tertiary assessments, for patients with greater complexity, these approaches could move us forward toward a more flexible and integrated system of care.",
