New cases are continuously reported especially in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the risk of exposure remains an issue. Data visualization plays a vital role in effective analysis of the data. In this paper, we introduce an interactive visualization application for MERS data collected from the Control and Command Centre, Ministry of Health website of Saudi Arabia. The data corresponding to the period from January 1, 2019 to February 28, 2019 was used in the present work. The attributes considered include gender, age, date of reporting, city, region, camel contact, description and status of the patient. The visualization tool has been developed using Shiny framework of R programming language. The application presents information in the form of interactive plots, maps and tables. The salient feature of the tool is that users can view and download data corresponding to the period of their choice. This tool can help decision makers in the detailed analysis of data and hence devise measures to prevent the spread of the disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "MERS is a viral disease that was first discovered in 2012 when a patient in Saudi Arabia was diagnosed with critical respiratory distress and kidney trouble [1] .

The users can view details about either all the cases together or recovered cases, death cases or hospitalized cases separately. The details regarding the cases can be viewed with respect to all cities, all regions or cities within a region. In the case of the option \"cities within a region\", the user has to choose a region from the drop down list provided. Unlike conventional pie charts, the pie charts created using googleviz package are interactive in nature. By pointing the cursor over a portion in the pie chart, one can understand the actual number of cases in that particular part of the chart. In the map, places are marked based on longitude and latitude of that place. On clicking the marker displayed in the map, the name and number of cases in that place will be displayed as a pop-up. Based on the number of cases, markers are assigned colors such as red, orange or yellow. The colors red, orange and yellow represent \"large number of cases\", \"moderate number of cases\" and \"few number of cases\" respectively. The information in Figs. 1 and 2 is presented in the form of pie chart and map. The screen shot of the page corresponding to different cases analysis is shown in Fig. 1 . The figure depicts the analysis of all MERS cases reported for the first two months of the year 2019 with regard to cities. It can be inferred from Fig. 1 that during that period 76.8% of the patients recovered from the disease and the maximum number of cases (61%) were reported from the city of Wadi Aldawasir. The analysis based on all cases reported in \"all cities within Riyadh region\" during January to February 2019 is shown in Fig. 2 . It can be observed from the figure that majority of cases in Riyadh region were reported from the city of Wadi Aldawasir. Nearly 78% of the infected people in Riyadh region recovered from the disease. The application page with table output is shown in Fig. 3 .

The analysis is carried out for \"all cities\", \"all regions\" or \"cities within a region\". The details are displayed as pie chart, map and table. The pie chart represents the numbers of cases corresponding to the location type selected by the user. The places where camel contact cases are reported are marked in the map. This can help in analyzing whether the cases pertaining to people with camel contact are clustered in a region or not. The table displays the details of infected people who had contact with camels. The data visualization based on camel contact is shown in Fig. 5 . The figure depicts the analysis corresponding to all cases with regard to cities in Saudi Arabia. It can be observed from Fig. 5 that 56% of the camel contact based cases were reported from the city of Wadi Aldawasir. Camel contact based analysis of MERS patients is highly essential to identify places where people in contact with camels have been infected with the disease. This will help health authorities in taking more measures to spread awareness about the precautionary methods to be taken when handling camels. The infected camels in such regions may be identified and isolated to prevent the spread of the disease. Month-wise comparison of the data can be carried out for \"all cases\", \"death cases\" and \"recovery cases\". The stacked bar chart for cases reported in different months is plotted based on the location type specified by the user.
