The virus that causes COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is readily transmitted in the community, where it is having devastating social and economic impacts. Yet our understanding of SARS and COVID-19 is derived primarily from studying the most severe cases in clinical and hospital settings. A complementary, field-based approach is desperately needed, and human biologists are well-positioned to make important contributions to our understanding of which individuals, and communities, are most vulnerable and why.",

These tests are important for clinical diagnosis, and if deployed more widely can be used to identify viral spread in the community. However, shortages of swabs, personal protective equipment (PPE), transport media, and accurate testing platforms have led to a rationing of tests. As a result, priority has been given to testing suspected cases of COVID-19, with limited application outside the clinical context through the first wave of the pandemic. It is also becoming apparent that false negative results may be more common than originally thought, as viral RNA production in the naso-pharynx is transient and subject to sampling variability.",

As the immune system mounts a response to infection, B lymphocytes produce antibodies against viral proteins which bind, and in some cases, neutralize the virus. The isotype immunoglobulin M (IgM) is the first antibody to appear in circulation following initial exposure to an antigen. It is a large pentamer that is detectable 3 to 10 days after infection, but its expression is transient and concentrations decrease in the weeks following exposure (Zhao et al., 2020) . IgG production is slower to come online, but antibodies of this isotype remain detectable for months, and often years, after infection (Tan et al., 2020; Xiao, Gao, & Zhang, 2020) .",

For example, in some cases individuals present with symptoms of COVID-19 but test negative with PCR because the virus has been cleared, viral shedding is not occurring at the time of sampling, and/or technical errors lead to a false negative result. If sufficient time has passed since the initial infection, the presence of IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be used to confirm a clinical case of COVID-19. The time course of IgG production makes testing less relevant for diagnosis of acute infection, but since levels of anti-SARS IgG antibodies remain elevated long after infection, IgG testing can be used to identify \"cases\" after the fact. As described below, there are several ways these tests can inform research and policy related to There are currently two predominant approaches to antibody testing: enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). In ELISA, viral antigen is fixed to the bottom of a microtiter plate well, diluted serum or plasma is added, and antibodies specific to the viral antigen, if present, are \"captured\" in the well. The addition of anti-human IgG or IgM antibody with a label (eg, horseradish peroxidase) generates a signal proportional to the concentration of captured antibody, which is quantified in a spectrophotometer. ELISA protocols for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies for use with serum or plasma are now established (Amanat et al., 2020) .",

As such, they can be readily implemented in nonclinical, community-based settings with the potential to reach larger numbers of people. In LFIA, the antigen-antibody dynamics of ELISA are applied in a cartridge format: Blood (and often diluent) is placed in a small well, and as it diffuses through the cartridge antibodies are labeled and captured, with a test line emerging to indicate a positive result. An advantage of LFIA is that it is a \"point-of-care\" test, with results available in 5 to 10 minutes. However, these tests are qualitative rather than quantitative, and even though they use only a few drops of finger stick blood, they are difficult to self-administer and usually require a trained health care worker to implement. In addition, recent analyses have raised substantial concerns regarding the accuracy of LFIA tests for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (Adams et al., 2020).",

The DBS approach has several advantages that make it particularly well-suited to address important gaps in the current COVID-19 testing landscape. First, individuals can self-sample in the home. Although some samples may be inadequate for analysis, prior applications have demonstrated the feasibility of having, participants collect their own DBS sample (Roberts et al., 2016) . Second, samples can be returned in the mail without special handling (the CDC and US Postal Service consider DBS specimens nonregulated, exempt materials) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017). Third, since DBS samples are analyzed in the lab, we can apply more accurate and quantitative protocols than is possible with LFIA. In developing a low-cost ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, our hope is that others can draw on the longstanding tradition of methodological innovation in human biology to promote community-based research on COVID-19.",

Furthermore, food deserts, inadequate health care, limited opportunities for physical activity, and stress all contribute to hypertension and diabetes-conditions that predispose to COVID-19 mortality. As discrimination, concentrated disadvantage, and other forms of structural racism increase burdens of chronic degenerative disease among African-Americans in the US, they may also contribute to inequities in COVID-19 mortality.

Why are older people more vulnerable, while children are largely spared? Why do infections tend to be mild in pregnancy, in contrast to the 1918 influenza pandemic when mortality was particularly high for pregnant women (Taubenberger & Morens, 2006) ? Developmental plasticity, ecological sensitivity, and the finite nature of resources are key concepts from evolutionary life history theory that may generate important insights. For example, the immune system is a central component of maintenance effort, and the defenses that provide protection against COVID-19 are costly to develop and activate (McDade, 2003) . One might therefore hypothesize that the response to infection is shaped by the availability of nutritional resources, particularly resources during sensitive periods of immune development in infancy. Similarly, microbial exposures early in development may calibrate investments in innate vs specific immunity, with implications for the regulation-or dysregulation-of inflammation in adulthood (McDade, Georgiev, & Kuzawa, 2016) . A theoretically grounded, hypothesis driven life history approach may help us identify how, and why, individuals differ in the magnitude and effectiveness of immune responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Quantifying the antibody response to infection provides a direct measure of humoral immunity, and additional indicators of immune activity (eg, markers of inflammation, cell mediated responses) can further characterize the magnitude and direction of response.",

In addition, it is not just mothers that we should consider: The experience of fathers may be transmitted across generations as well, through epigenetic modifications to the germline that are inherited along with gene sequence (Ryan & Kuzawa, 2020) . We can also reach back in time, to consider how adaptations to environmental pressures may influence responses to infection in the present. For example, recent research with highaltitude populations in regions of Tibet, Bolivia, and Ecuador suggests that physiological responses that promote survival in hypoxic environments may also serve to decrease susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Arias-Reyes et al., 2020) .

            "text": "Human biologists are uniquely positioned to make important contributions to our understanding of COVID-19, and methods that facilitate research in community-based settings globally will be central to that effort. Antibody testing is a necessary surveillance tool, but we can also apply it in the service of advancing our understanding of human biological variation more broadly. In doing so we accept an obligation to challenge misleading claims regarding the significance of a \"positive\" antibody test. At this point it is not known if high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies confer immunity against future infection, and talk of antibody badges or passports is premature. We also need to be mindful of the potential for seroprevalence data to stigmatize members of the community, and to politicize debates regarding the costs and benefits of initiatives designed to mitigate viral transmission. The current pandemic underscores the social nature of human biology, and a contextualized, community-based approach is an essential complement to current clinical and public health research paradigms.",
