Several studies have shown that the severely ill patients have high or very high Ddimer values, and a hypercoagulable state has been described with, in some cases, development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A few reports have indicated that there seems to be a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism than expected in otherwise severely ill patients. In this article, we will discuss the prothrombotic changes observed and to what extent they are specific for COVID-19. The incidence of thromboembolic events will be compared with those reported in sepsis and severe influenza A H1N1. The emphasis is on venous events, which have been the most frequently reported events. Finally, the intensity of pharmacological prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism will be discussed.",

[5] [6] [7] On the other hand, abnormalities in the coagulation tests, meeting previously defined criteria for DIC, were observed during the terminal days in 71% of nonsurvivors in another cohort from Wuhan, China. 8 These preliminary findings generate several questions, some which are as follows:",

It seems, however, to give already at an early stage an idea of the severity of the infection and is a prognostic indicator of need for ICU care and of fatal outcome.",

It appears from the report that the investigators only performed objective diagnostic imaging in patients with symptoms, raising suspicion of a thromboembolic event, and among those, the composite outcome of all thromboembolism was as high as 31% or a total of 31 cases. Of those, 25 had PE, but there is no information regarding the location of the emboli and how many of those were only subsegmental. Of the three cases with DVT, two were catheter-related upper extremity thrombosis and one was a proximal leg vein thrombosis. Stroke was verified in three patients, presumably with evidence of acute infarct. These findings are difficult to interpret regarding PE due to the paucity of information and also the difficulty in finding comparable studies on other infections investigated in the same way.

Nevertheless, this is the case for many other patients admitted to hospital and ICU, and increased doses of heparin or LMWH are not recommended for those. Increased doses of anticoagulants may always carry a risk of more bleeding events. The only way to resolve this is by performing randomized trials. Observational studies will be fraught with a large number of confounders in view of the variety of intensive care procedures performed and the increasing number of experimental therapies introduced to manage severe COVID-19 pneumonia.",
