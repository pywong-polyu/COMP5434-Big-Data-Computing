This research tests for the existence of nonlinear patterns and chaotic nature in four major stock market indices: namely Dow Jones Industrial Average, Ibex 35, Nasdaq-100 and Nikkei 225. To this end, a comprehensive framework has been adopted encompassing a wide range of techniques and the most suitable methods for the analysis of noisy time series. By using daily closing values from January 1992 to July 2013, this study employs twelve techniques and tools of which five are specific to detecting chaos. The findings show no clear evidence of chaos, suggesting that the behavior of financial markets is nonlinear and stochastic.",

There are two divergent positions concerning the underlying dynamics of financial markets. Whilst several studies have found evidence of chaotic patterns in financial markets e.g., [12, 13] , the most recent studies support a non-chaotic but rather stochastic behavior. This is due to the use of an incorrect specification and to the approach applied [14, 15] . Indeed, the former studies applied a methodology, such as the correlation dimension method, that is not sensitive to noise, an intrinsic feature of financial series. However, studies that have used new and more robust methods, such as the test proposed by Matilla-Garcia and Ruiz Marin (MGRM test) [6] and the Lyapunov test based on BenSa\u00efda and Litimi [14], do not find evidence for chaos. In fact, to ensure that conclusions are sound and reliable, traditional tests should be applied to time series that consist of many observations and are noise-free.",

First, all linear dependencies were removed from the data by applying autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) filters. A wide range of procedures were then applied to the residuals obtained to detect the existence of nonlinearity. If nonlinear dependence was detected, since linear structures had already been removed using the best fit ARIMA model, it was indicative of some type of nonlinear dependence in the returns series resulting from a nonlinear stochastic system or a nonlinear chaotic system. Then it might be caused by the existence of a volatility cluster. In this case, the appropriate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and exponential GARCH models (EGARCH) were applied. Afterwards, the existence of chaotic motion was explored by means of five techniques i.e., 0/1 test, the correlation dimension, Lyapunov exponent, MGRM test [6] and recurrence plots, including those that are ideally suitable for noisy time series analysis.",

This opens up the range of alternatives for analyzing and predicting financial series and particularly stock market price series, traditionally anchored in methods such as technical and fundamental analysis or in assumptions like the efficient market, defined by Fama [2] and based on the fact that asset prices reflect all available information, causing asset returns to be unpredictable [3] .",

Thus, in the first stage, initiated by the work of Scheinkman and LeBaron [12] , who, using daily and weekly data of returns, found evidence of chaotic dynamics in the US stock markets, works that obtained a chaotic behavior were frequent. However, more recently, once new methods and more powerful tests on the detection of chaotic dynamics were incorporated, it can be observed that most research suggests that the data are not chaotic, that is, they present stochastic behavior.",

Table 2 presents all the techniques used in this research. Their main characteristics are described below, with special emphasis on the tools for detecting chaotic dynamics in a time series. Before proceeding with the description of the methodological process, it is appropriate to define the concepts of linear and nonlinear series. A stochastic process (X t , t \u2208 Z) is said to be a linear process if for every t \u2208 Z X t = \u221e j=0 \u03b2 j t\u2212j where a 0 = 1, t , t \u2208 Z is a process of independent and identically-distributed random variables (iid) with E[X t ] = 0, E X 2 t = \u03c3 2 and \u221e j=0 \u03b2 j < \u221e. Any process that does not satisfy this condition is said to be nonlinear. Nonlinear models display features that cannot be modelled by linear processes: e.g., higher-moment structures, time-changing variance, volatility clustering, breaks, thresholds, and asymmetric cycles. These traits are very often present in the study of financial time series.",

It distinguishes chaotic series from random series by investigating the correlation dimension behavior of the data [30] .",

Specifically, it has been empirically proven that the methodology adopted in this article to determine the Lyapunov exponent (\u03bb) is the one that behaves best for noisy series [55] . Indeed, to estimate \u03bb from experimental or observational data, there are two main classes of methods, both of which are based on reconstructing the space state by the delay coordinates methods. The direct methods are based on the calculation of the growth rate of the difference between two trajectories with an infinitesimal difference in their initial conditions [56] . Among the limitations of this method is that it cannot accept measurement errors or noise [57] . On the contrary, the Jacobian-based approach can give consistent estimates of the Lyapunov exponents even in the presence of noise [58, 59] . The Jacobian method is based on nonparametric regression to estimate the Jacobians and \u03bb. It consists of computing the Jacobian matrix of the chaotic map. However, for a scalar time series, the map generating the process is usually unknown; as a result, the Jacobian matrix could not be estimated, and the Lyapunov exponent cannot be computed. For that purpose, it is needed to approximate the unknown chaotic map with a known function. McCaffrey et al. [58] compared several alternatives: thin-plate splines, neural nets, radial basis functions and projection pursuit. Based on the simulations performed by them, neural net was the best regression method for chaotic systems with noise. In this line, Bailey et al. [59] proposed a regression method which involves the use of neural networks. Simulation results for a noisy Henon system suggest that the neural net regression method yields accurate estimates values of the Lyapunov exponent.",

While this approach could be appropriate for physical systems where noise is an intruder of the real pure signal, for financial data, where noise is an inherent property to markets, denoising the data could modify some of the stylized financial facts that have been discussed earlier in the paper and alter the true dynamics that underlie the time series to be tested [63] .

In this way the BDS test served as an indirect method of analyzing nonlinearity: if it rejected the null hypothesis, then the series was proven to be nonlinear. This procedure is theoretically feasible, since the calculations on the residuals of an autoregressive model do not lose the relevant information derived from the original series if the latter comes from a nonlinear chaotic system [51] . The BDS test is applied taking into account the different embedding dimensions (range: 2-9). The results are presented in Supplementary Materials B (Tables SB3-SB14). Kaplan's method is applied to a series in which the functional form that generated the series is unknown. The method's aim is to determine whether there is evidence of an underlying deterministic mechanism, i.e., that the hypothesis that is tested is the stochastic linearity of the process. It is considered that the null hypothesis is verified if the value of the statistic K, calculated for the original series (K test), is smaller than the values obtained for the surrogates of each series, defined as the smallest value (Kmin) between the minimum and the mean, minus two standard deviations (KS). Several different values for both the delay and the embedding dimension parameters were taken into account, and the conclusions did not differ (see Supplementary Materials B). Table 6 presents a summary of results for the nonlinear analysis. All the procedures used, except for Kaplan, suggest the existence of nonlinearity in the Dow Jones Index ARMA series. A similar pattern is observed for the Nasdaq Index. Further, as all the tests indicate some nonlinear dependence in the Ibex and Nikkei indexes, the data seems to present some type of dependence, since the BDS test shows significant results for the different embedding dimensions and the epsilons considered. For the latter, the White and Ter\u00e4svirta tests confirm the existence of dependence. ",

After fitting each model, standardized residuals were obtained (from now on GARCH and EGARCH series). Unlike GARCH models, EGARCH models can be used to estimate the conditional variance, taking into consideration the sign of the innovation of the previous period. These types of models successfully capture the asymmetric response in the conditional variance and, hence, are suitable candidates for modeling financial processes. The chosen models were EGARCH (2,1), EGARCH (2, 3) , and EGARCH (1,1) for the Dow Jones and Ibex indexes, the Nasdaq Index and the Nikkei series, respectively (Table 5 and Supplementary Materials A). The standardized residuals of all the series are less leptokurtic (with an average value of 4) than those obtained from the ARMA models (Table 3) .",
