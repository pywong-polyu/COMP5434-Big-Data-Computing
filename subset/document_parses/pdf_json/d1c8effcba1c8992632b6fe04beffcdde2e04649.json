            "text": "If we are to beat cancer, early detection and diagnosis are arguably the most effective means we have at our disposal. Progress during the past 40 years has transformed the prospects of people diagnosed with cancer in the UK, with survival doubling since the 1970s. 1 However, further improvements are still greatly needed, because cancer remains the leading cause of death in the UK, 2 with a stark projection of rising incidence to more than half a million cases per year by 2035. 3 Patients diagnosed with cancer at an early stage have the best chance of curative treatment and long-term survival; for example, 57% of people with lung cancer survive their disease for 5 years or more when diagnosed at stage I compared with only 3% of those diagnosed at stage IV. 4 Despite cancer screening programmes, improved awareness, and more streamlined diagnostic pathways, only 54% of patients with cancer in England had their cancer detected at stage I or II in 2018. 5 With lower survival rates in the UK than in similar countries, such as Australia, Canada, or Norway, 6, 7 and notable inequalities in survival across the UK, 8, 9 there is a pressing need to see a paradigm shift in our ability to accurately detect and diagnose cancer at an early stage.",

It highlights current challenges that are impeding progress and makes a series of tangible recommendations for research, development, health system delivery, and government policy on how to overcome these challenges and realise the shared vision (panel). The recommendations are for collaborative efforts across an interlinked network, building in a stepwise manner to deliver a huge shift in early detection and diagnosis.
