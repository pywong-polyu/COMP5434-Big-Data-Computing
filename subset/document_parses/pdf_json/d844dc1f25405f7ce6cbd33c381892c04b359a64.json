To infer future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth of infections. We have evaluated our model for three heavily affected regions in Europe, namely Berlin (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment measures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model parameters, namely ICU rate, time lag between infection, and ICU admission as well as length of stay in ICU. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and a stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy and Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3 days) and the stay in ICU (3 and 8 days) shorter. The region-specific models are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%) or linear growth. By keeping the growth rates flexible, this model allows for taking into account the potential effect of diverse containment measures. Thus, the model can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity depending on future growth. A sensitivity analysis for an extended time period shows that the proposed model is particularly useful for exponential phases of the disease.",

In the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this leads to the risk of underestimating case fatality rates 3, 4 but also the risk that the health system might be overburdened due to a too high number of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) 5 . Although it is well-known that a certain number of COVID-19 patients needs intensive care, especially elderly people and people with pre-existing conditions 6 , the exponential dynamics of infections along with the time lag between the number of reported infections and the number of ICU patients can lead to the false impression that the amount of ICU patients will be unproblematic 3, 7 . Due to the lag and ICU durations of one to several weeks, even when the exponential growth of infections is stopped, it takes a while until the pressure on ICUs is reduced [8] [9] [10] www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In several regions including Lombardy (Italy) and Madrid (Spain), the need for ICUs surpassed the available capacity and not all COVID-19 patients who needed intensive care could be treated 5, 11, 12 . To slow down the spread of the disease and to avoid a triage, several countries, including Germany, Italy, and Spain, decided to apply containment measures-ranging from temporary closures of schools and kindergartens to travel restrictions, compulsory mask wearing, and curfew. Those measures, however, disrupt economic activity and lead to the risk of a recession. Thus, policymakers are confronted with the difficulty of making decisions that severely affect the healthcare system, the global economy as well as the everyday life of many individuals while facing a large amount of uncertainty within the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (e.g., the time until new treatments or vaccinations have been developed and are available at a large scale). Since one major bottleneck for the healthcare system is the ICU capacity, risk models are needed that allow policymakers to estimate the future ICU load to take appropriate measures.",

Those models, however, assume that the initial exponential growth will hold over the forecast horizon (usually 14 days) and do not account for the alleviation of growth rates, e.g., due to containment measures.

Based on the total number of COVID-19 patients and the number of COVID-19 patients in ICUs, we first estimate the parameters of the model (i.e., ICU rate, length of stay in ICU, and time lag between the positive testing and the ICU admission). We restrict here the data to the first wave of infections and the time period before extensive containment measures made an impact. And second, we predict for a time horizon of 2 months the number of COVID-19 patients who need intensive care when assuming linear or exponential growth of the number of reported infections. By incorporating the dependency between the total number of COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 patients in ICUs as well as holding growth rates flexible, our model extends previous models and accounts for differential effects of potential containment measures. The predictions of our model in combination with epidemiological estimates regarding disease dynamics can be used in turn to predict future ICU load and to potentially infer when the ICU load will exceed a given capacity. In an additional analysis, we investigate the sensitivity of our proposed model with respect to different phases in the pandemic. For this, we extend the time series of all regions until December 2020 and estimate the parameters separately for each month.",

For example, a better protection of people with pre-existing conditions or elderly people as well as a higher testing capacity could lead to a reduced ICU rate \u03b1 due to an increased share of mild cases. In addition, the testing capacity and resulting timing of tests influence the time lag l, and the length of stay in ICU depends on the occupancy rates in the hospitals, which in turn can be influenced by successful containment.",

We show the sensitivity of the results for linear growth with the slope d between 0 and 2, 000 as well as exponential growth rates between 0 and 15%. A growth rate of 0% means that from one day to another, no more new infections are reported, which is an unrealistic extreme case. The other extreme, 15%, corresponds to a duplication of reported infections every 5 days. Please note that the daily growth rate in the last week before the strong containment measures came into force was 10% for Berlin, 23% for Lombardy, and 54% for Madrid. In Fig. 3 , the predicted number of ICU patients is additionally compared with the capacity limits introduced in the data section. A linear growth in the number of infections leads in the long-run to a constant number of ICU patients, which corresponds to \u03b1 \u00b7 d \u00b7 K . This means, a share of \u03b1 of the daily new infections d needs intensive care for K days. Regarding exponential growth, our estimated parameters show that for Berlin only growth rates between 0 and 4% guarantee that the number of patients at the end of May remains below the current maximal capacity, a rate of up to 5% guarantees to stay below the extended capacity by the end of May (but exceeds the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ capacity in June).

While for Lombardy and Berlin, the same data as for the early phase are available until December 2020, we need to adapt the data for Madrid since consistent data were only available for the time period between August and December 2020. After the beginning of the pandemic in March/April 2020 and a decline of reported infections and ICU patients afterwards due to containment measures, all three regions experienced a second wave starting in September/October 2020 with strongly increasing numbers of reported infections and ICU patients (Fig. 5 in the Appendix). Table 2 depicts monthly estimates of the parameters and the goodness of fit if separate models are estimated for each calendar month from March (if available) to December 2020. It can be seen that the parameters vary over time, indicating structural breaks in the course of the pandemic. For example, the ICU rate \u03b1 strongly decreases after the first wave, which can be explained by larger testing capacities and/or a better protection of people with pre-existing conditions or elderly people. In Berlin and Lombardy, the ICU rate seems to increase again with the second wave. Data for Berlin demonstrate that the age distribution of the reported infections changed significantly: Around 20% of reported infections in April and December belong to the group of 70 years old or older people, whereas this number goes down to 2% in August (own calculations based on data from LAGeSo Berlin 25 ) . Interestingly, the model fits are best in tipping points of the disease where the rates start to grow exponentially. For Berlin and Lombardy, the model fits best in March ( nRMSE = 18% , \u03c1 2 = 0.99 for Berlin, nRMSE = 12% , \u03c1 2 = 0.97 for Lombardy) and October ( nRMSE = 15% , \u03c1 2 = 0.93 for Berlin, nRMSE = 13% , \u03c1 2 = 0.99 for Lombardy), but the nRMSE goes up to 50% (Berlin) and 40% (Lombardy) in between. For Madrid, where we only have consistent data after the early phase, the lowest nRMSE has been found for September ( nRMSE = 19.15% , \u03c1 2 = 0.78 ). These results highlight that the model is in particular suitable for exponential phases of the disease. ",

We evaluated this model for Berlin, Lombardy, and Madrid, where we had access to the number of reported COVID-19 infections and ICU patients with COVID-19. Since the outbreaks are highly regional, we did not apply this model to larger areas such as whole countries. Based on data before extensive containment measures led to structural breaks, we first estimated the parameters ICU rate, length of stay in ICU, and time lag. For Berlin, an ICU rate of 6% was estimated which is close to an estimate of 5% in other studies 26,27 and expectations of intensive care physicians in Berlin 28 . An ICU rate of 5% has been reported based on data for 72,312 cases in China 29 . For Lombardy and Madrid, in contrast, a much higher ICU rate of 18% and 15%, respectively, resulted in the best model fit. This is in relative accordance with Grasselli et al. 5 who reported an ICU rate of 16% for Lombardy in the first 2 weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the sensitivity analysis, we have shown for Berlin and Lombardy that the ICU rate decreases to below 5% in the later months August to October/November probably due to a less restrictive testing scenario as in the beginning 22, 30, 31 . In similar models, relying only on exponential growth of intensive care patients, ICU rates of 9-11% have been assumed 14 .",

Whereas for Berlin and Madrid the numbers seems to be reasonable, a stay of 3 days in Lombardy seems to be rather short. We think that this can be explained by the excessive demands on the health care system resulting in higher mortality rates and thus in a shorter length of stay in ICU. Based on data from China, other forecast models assumed an average stay of 8-10 days 13, 30 . For Lombardy, a median length of ICU stay of 9 days has been reported for the early phase 32 . Also for other regions in Italy and USA, longer ICU stays (about 15 days for ICU patients who remain alive and about 10-12 days for patients who die after ICU treatment) have been found 8, 10 . In New York, COVID-19 patients typically need ICU care with ventilation for 11-21 days, some patients stay in ICU for 30 days 9 .",

Thus, the low numbers for Lombardy and Madrid can be explained by the limited testing capacity in those regions, where tests are mainly administered for patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms 22, 31 . In addition, the extended time period analysis for Lombardy (see Fig. 5 ) revealed that the time lag seems to reflect the extent of demands on the ICU capacity by providing a time lag between 5 and 9 in times when the pressure was lower.",

For simplicity, we assumed that all those beds are available for only COVID-19 patients and thus did not account for different utilization rates which might lead to an earlier capacity exceedance in practice. Additionally, we did not account for shortage in highly-qualified medical personnel. Already prior to the COVID-19 associated increase in capacities, it had been a common phenomenon that ICU beds were unused for lack of qualified personnel 33 . Please note that we here also did not differentiate between high and low care ICUs (i.e., with and without invasive ventilator) since we only had numbers on the total number of ICU patients with COVID-19. Future studies might also try to account for changing treatment strategies of COVID-19 patients. Guidelines have emerged 34 , but are likely subject to change. Early reports on the outbreak emphasized the potential progression of COVID-19 pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 35 , biasing towards early intubation and ventilation. However, a growing number of studies shows that a subgroup of patients seems to be clinically stable despite very low blood oxygenation levels and may benefit more from non-invasive oxygen supply and ventilation methods than early intubation 36 . Accumulating experience with COVID-19 patients will therefore result in shifting treatment strategies that can either increase or ease the strain on ICU capacities.",
