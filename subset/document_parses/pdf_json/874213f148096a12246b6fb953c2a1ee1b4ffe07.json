            "text": "It is no exaggeration to say that viruses accompany the history of humanity. In particular, even now, infectious viruses are a severe problem that affects the economy of the country and the lives of the people. There are countless infectious viruses, but the most representative is the influenza virus, which has been recognized as a big problem from the past to the present. Influenza infection, which is a representative contagious virus, usually starts in winter, in the eastern or southern hemisphere with high humidity, and then tends to spread to North America and Europe. In particular, when mutations occur, infectious diseases spread more [1] . In the case of influenza, there is an incubation period of about three days, and during this period, the virus carrier spreads the virus because there are no symptoms. Especially before the 1950s, influenza pandemics killed up to millions to tens of millions of people before influenza was found to be caused by a virus and a vaccine was developed [1, 2] . In the modern era of active vaccine development, dying from influenza is lower than before. However, deaths are still occurring. Infectious viruses are still very deadly and dangerous because they evolve with mutants. Vaccine research is active, however influenza viruses are constantly mutating, and the most effective treatment is vaccination and isolation from the source of infection.",

            "text": "In general, the route of infection of infectious viruses can be divided into infection by droplet and infection by contact [3, 4] . Infection by contact occurs when the mucous membrane is touched with the part of the body that has come into contact with the virus, and the best way to prevent this is to keep the body clean. However, since infection by droplets is invisible, it is difficult for both carriers and those around them to notice the risk of infection, and it is even more dangerous. Both droplet and contact infections occur when the virus binds to cells in the human body, and hemagglutinin (HA) [3, [5] [6] [7] and neuraminidase (NA) are known to be involved in the primary infection routes of the infectious virus. HA is one of the antigenic projections, a type of glycoprotein that causes red blood cells to aggregate, and NA is one of the enzymes that are antigenic determinants found on the surface of influenza viruses in various organisms. Among them, HA is a direct factor in the infection process as it causes the antigenic projections it possesses to directly attach to the cells of animals and plants. Influenza viruses (80-120 nm) [8] are known to cause infection by binding to sialic acid [6, 7, 9] , a type of sugar on the cell surface. Sialic acid present on the surface of animal and plant cells generally exists in the form of a sugar chain. Sugar chains refer to monosaccharides that combine in various formats to form a chain shape. Monosaccharides that make up sugar chains include glucose, mannose, galactose, fucose, xylose, N-acetylglucosamine, and sialic acid, and these sugar chains interact with a single protein. In general, the interaction between a single sugar chain and a single protein is weak because weak forces such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions mainly occur. Compensating for these shortcomings is the sugar cluster effect or sugar chain polyvalent effect [10] . In other words, proteins or glycolipids do not spread into cells but concentrate in some areas as needed to form sugar clusters, increasing the binding force. This sugar cluster effect has become the primary design guideline for developing antibodies, antivirals, and toxin inhibitors in immunology.",

            "text": "We decided to mimic the sugar chain cluster effect as way of developing material for adsorbing the influenza virus, and MNWF prepared by radiation-induced graft polymerization (RIGP) was selected as the substrate. RIGP introduces various functions using radicals generated when a base substrate is irradiated with radiation, plasma, light, and chemicals. The main base polymers used are polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, nylon 6, etc. [11] , and the various types of base polymers applied here include porous hollow fiber membranes, non-woven fabrics, films, and nanotubes [12] [13] [14] [15] . In particular, substrates made through RIGP have the advantage of controlling the length or density of polymer brushes created by controlling the amount of radiation or monomer concentration [11] . Polymer brush is one of the characteristics of polymer chains generated by RIGP and refers to polymer chains extending from the pore surface of the base substrate to the interior of the substrate [11] . We expected that if sialic acid could be introduced into the polymer brushes of the substrate prepared by this radiation graft polymerization method, it would be possible to mimic the effect of sugar chain clusters by controlling the density of the polymer brushes. In general, the average length of polymer brushes extending to the substrate is known to be 35 nm [12] , which is a sufficient size to bind HA (13.5 nm) [5, 6] present on the surface of the influenza virus. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was selected as the monomer used for RIGP, and in this case, the polymer contains an epoxy group and has hydrophilicity [12] [13] [14] . For the polymer base material, we selected microfiber nonwoven fabric (MNWF) made of polypropylene. In general, the advantage of nonwoven fabrics is that they have large pores compared to other substrates, so they are not easily clogged and are durable [14] . The disadvantage is that the functional group bonded to the nonwoven fabric has a smaller surface area than other substrates in contact with the adsorption target, so it may be disadvantageous for adsorption. However, MNWF used in this experiment was selected as a material for the experiment because it can overcome the disadvantage of a narrow surface area by weaving with microfibers while maintaining the advantages of the existing nonwoven fabric.",

Using the influenza virus directly in adsorption experiments is challenging, and other methods had to be devised. Therefore, as an alternative to the influenza virus used in adsorption experiments, we decided to target a lectin that can explicitly react with sialic acids, such as the HA of the influenza virus. N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA), which is used in this experiment, is one of the sialic acids and is known to respond with H1-type hemagglutinin of the influenza virus by specific recognition [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Similar to the specific recognition reactions of NANA with HA, concanavalin A (ConA) [16, 21] and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) [16, 21, 22] are also capable of specific recognition reactions with NANA. Therefore, rather than directly adsorbing the influenza virus in the design stage of the adsorption experiment, we tried to check whether the lectin, which is a non-hazardous material, can be adsorbed on the newly developed adsorbent. Con A and WGA were candidates for the lectin to be used in the experiment. However, in our preliminary experiments, WGA had better adsorption performance than Con A, so the adsorption target lectin was finally determined as WGA. Although the crystal structures of the influenza virus and WGA are different, both can bind by NANA-specific recognition and are considered helpful as alternatives to determining whether the influenza virus is adsorbed or not without infection risk during the experiment. WGA lectins are by-products of wheat processing, whose structure has been described since the 1970s [23, 24] . WGA lectins are composed of polypeptide chain homodimers [25] and are in the form of biaxial symmetry [26] . Polypeptides A, B, and C present in WGA are known to bind to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues [23, 27] .

Thus, it was expected that the introduction of sialic acid by selecting an appropriate functional group could be efficiently used for lectin binding. The selection of functional groups was considered from various perspectives, and the functional group used in this experiment was determined to be disodium iminodiacetate monohydrate (IDA). The IDA group is a functional group [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] widely used in protein adsorption, enzyme purification and fixation, and metal ion adsorption. In particular, IDA is judged to be more efficient when introducing sialic acid because there are two places where sialic acid can be introduced. However, in this experiment, to increase the efficiency of introducing sialic acid, it was finally decided to use the IDA-EDC functional group made through coupling with 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) instead of using IDA alone. The coupling process of IDA-EDC is shown in Figure 2 . In general, EDC is a substance used to covalently bond carboxylate (-COOH) or phosphate (-PO4) sulfide with an amine ",

            "text": "It has already been demonstrated in several studies whether an artificial enzyme can function as a catalyst by immobilizing it on a polymer brush [12, 29, 30] . Thus, it was expected that the introduction of sialic acid by selecting an appropriate functional group could be efficiently used for lectin binding. The selection of functional groups was considered from various perspectives, and the functional group used in this experiment was determined to be disodium iminodiacetate monohydrate (IDA). The IDA group is a functional group [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] widely used in protein adsorption, enzyme purification and fixation, and metal ion adsorption. In particular, IDA is judged to be more efficient when introducing sialic acid because there are two places where sialic acid can be introduced. However, in this experiment, to increase the efficiency of introducing sialic acid, it was finally decided to use the IDA-EDC functional group made through coupling with 1-(3dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) instead of using IDA alone. The coupling process of IDA-EDC is shown in Figure 2 . In general, EDC is a substance used to covalently bond carboxylate (-COOH) or phosphate (-PO 4 ) sulfide with an amine group (-NH 2 ). EDC has the disadvantage of being self-polymerized in some target biomolecules (e.g., peptides) containing both carboxylates and amine groups, however, it is water-soluble, so it is easy to handle and efficiently reacts with amine compounds [36] . group (-NH2). EDC has the disadvantage of being self-polymerized in some target biomolecules (e.g., peptides) containing both carboxylates and amine groups, however, it is water-soluble, so it is easy to handle and efficiently reacts with amine compounds [36] . IDA was used at a concentration of 0.125 mol, and since IDA has two sites that can react with sialic acid, EDC was used at a concentration of 0.25 mol, twice the concentration of IDA, to prepare an IDA-EDC complex. In the case of the IDA-EDC complex, a coupling reaction was performed at 25 \u00b0C for 72 h before being introduced into MNWF and used. Similarly, N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA, sialic acid) was also introduced at a concentration of 0.25 mol, twice the concentration of IDA.",

Therefore, 0.1 mL of WGA lectin solution was considered to contain up to 200 \u00b5g of WGA. The nebulizer was operated using a pump, and the aerosolized WGA solution was permeated through the NANA MNWF for about 1 min. After the adsorption process finished, NANA MNWF was washed with ionized water to remove lectins that may remain on the surface of NANA MNWF without being adsorbed. Lectins adsorbed to NANA MNWF were separated by 0.2 wt.% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution [39] [40] [41] [42] . Lectins isolated by SDS were treated with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method [42] [43] [44] [45] and then measured using a spectrophotometer for quantitative measurement.",

These results are shown in Figure 5 . The amount of IDA-EDC introduced into GMA MNWF was confirmed using Equations (2) and (3). In the case of IDA-EDC MNWF, it was confirmed that the higher the grafting degree, the more IDA-EDC was introduced. In this experiment, the highest density of IDA-EDC introduced in GMA MNWF was about 8.4 mmol/g at 173% dg. This seems to be because as the dg increases, the GMA content increases so that IDA-EDC reacts with more GMA. In MNWF supplemented with IDA-EDC, the surface state of MNWF was significantly changed as the dg increased. In the case of IDA-EDC MNWF with a dg of 100% or less, the edges of the MNWF were slightly curled, and in the case of IDA-MNWF with a dg of 100% or more, the MNWF was severely bent. It seems that the durability of MNWF cannot be sustained when IDA-EDC is introduced in too large a quantity. When IDA-EDC was introduced into the GMA MNWF, the weight change increased from 40% for low dg MNWF to 150% for high dg MNWF. From all results, the molar conversion rate of IDA-EDC MNWF from MNWF grafted with GMA was confirmed to be about 47% on average.",

The spectral results of FT-IR are shown in Figure 6 , and the interpretation of each peak is shown in Table 2 . For GMA MNWF, peaks in epoxy and ester groups were found at 747, 841, 972, 1053, 1166, and 1238 cm \u22121 , and peaks of C=O were found at 1726 cm \u22121 [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . In the case of IDA-EDC MNWF, the peaks of epoxy and ester groups were reduced compared to GMA MNWF, and it was confirmed that new peaks of N-H were generated at peaks of 1554-1564 [48, 54] and 1659-1662 cm \u22121 [46, 51, 54] . In addition, new peaks of the hydroxyl group (-OH) and N-H were generated at 3250-3400 cm \u22121 [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] 55] , confirming the introduction of IDA-EDC. In the case of NANA MNWF, the peak indicating C=O and the carboxyl group (COOH) was observed at 1726 cm \u22121 [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] , significantly increased, and the hydroxyl group of 3250-3400 cm \u22121 [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] 55] was also increased when compared with the peak of IDA-EDC MNWF. The introduction of NANA was confirmed by increasing the peak size of the carboxyl group and the hydroxyl group. In addition, the SEM image was confirmed to observe the change of the surface of the MNWF into which each functional group was introduced. Each sample was taken at 2200 magnification. The SEM image in which each functional group was introduced is shown in Figure 7 . After GMA was initially introduced as a functional group, no significant difference was observed on the surface of MNWF while each IDA-EDC or NANA was introduced.

As NANA MNWF showed utility for lectin adsorption, the lectin adsorption amount change of NANA MNWF according to the dg was compared. The difference in the amount of lectin adsorption according to the dg is shown in Figure 10 . The maximum lectin adsorption amount was 59.1% in dg 87% NANA MNWF. This is the result of adsorption of 118.2 out of 200 \u00b5g of lectin. The maximum adsorption was observed at dg 87%. However, the lectin adsorption results of NANA MNWF at dg 40-100% were very similar. NANA MNWF with the lowest dg of 38% used in this experiment adsorbed 109.7 \u00b5g out of a total of 200 \u00b5g, showing an adsorption efficiency of 54.9%. The dg 30-100% results were similar, but it was confirmed that the adsorption amount decreased in the case of NANA MNWF with a high dg. These results are similar to studies that attempted to immobilize enzymes on membranes prepared through RIGP [12] . According to the results of [12] , it can be confirmed that the results of the dg 50% membrane had higher adsorption efficiency when the enzyme was immobilized on the dg 50% membrane and the dg 100% membrane. This is thought to impede rather than induce more adsorption about the target if the density of the polymer brush is too high. Reference [12] details an experiment using a membrane with a large usable surface area to volume ratio. The membrane is a material with many advantages, but the disadvantage is that the pores are easily clogged, so it is thought that the maximum efficiency was observed at dg 50%. In our study, since MNWF was used, similar results were observed at a higher dg because the advantage of MNWF is that the pores are not easily clogged. In addition, according to [12] , it was confirmed that when the GMA concentration was changed when the membranes with the same dg were prepared, the length of the polymer brushes of the membranes prepared at lower GMA concentrations increased. Therefore, in our research, NANA MNWF with the same dg but different GMA concentrations during preparation was selected, and the results were compared.",

NANA MNWF successfully adsorbed lectins in aerosol form, but this is still in the early stages of experiments. We will soon also conduct studies on the correlation between GMA concentration and lectin adsorption rate in the manufacture of GMA MNWF, the optimal coupling reaction time of functional group IDA-EDC, the exact amount of NANA introduced, and the amount of lectin adsorption per 1 g of NANA. Subsequent experiments are expected to clarify the optimal GMA concentration, IDA-EDC binding reaction conditions, and NANA introduction conditions when preparing GMA MNWF for lectin adsorption. ",
