Overcoming inter-symbol interference (ISI) is one of the key challenges in the design of molecular communication systems. In this paper, we propose to optimize the detection interval to minimize the impact of ISI while ensuring the accurate detection of the transmitted information symbol, which is suitable for the absorbing and passive receivers. For tractability, based on the signal-to-interference difference (SID) and signal-to-interference-and-noise amplitude ratio (SINAR), we propose a modified-SINAR (mSINAR) to measure the bit error rate (BER) performance for the molecular communication system with a variable detection interval. Besides, we derive the optimal detection interval in closed form. Using simulation results, we show that the BER performance of our proposed mSINAR scheme is superior to the competing schemes, and achieves similar performance to optimal intervals found by exhaustive search.",

Due to its rapid spread, how to offer fast disease detection along with \"on-site\" results is a major challenge to medical care. In this context, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), an extension and specialization of IoT in the medical industry, was proposed to realize remote health diagnosis and monitoring in the time of COVID-19 [1] - [4] . In general, the IoMT network is composed of body sensors, local devices, and edge servers, in which the sensor is the basis of the entire network since it enables the collection of various health signals for the subsequent health assessment. Constrained by the volume and bio-compatibility of sensors, nano bio-sensors are considered a promising technology for the construction of IoMT. Besides, researchers also proposed using nano bio-sensors to facilitate various disease diagnoses and treatment, thus forming the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) [5] - [7] . At this point, we can regard the IoBNT as a special realization of IoMT in each individual.",

In the literature, a series of communication technologies for biological nano-sensors, such as molecular communication (MC), electromagnetic communication, and acoustic communication, has been proposed. Unlike the conventional communication methods, MC is a bio-inspired communication paradigm, and its carrier of information is chemical signals. Accordingly, MC has the following properties: small size, energy efficiency, and excellent bio-compatibility [8] . Based on the above advantages, MC is believed to have the potential to connect larger groups of nano bio-sensors in IoBNT [5] - [7] .",

            "text": "Molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is a highly popular MC method that uses the free diffusion of carrier molecules to transfer information at the nanoscale. However, considering the diffusion channel, the inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by the long delay of molecular diffusion is a great challenge for the MCvD system. The existence of ISI will adversely affect subsequent signal recovery and further lead to error propagation. At present, there are many proposed solutions to overcome ISI, mainly divided into the following three types: modulationbased [19] - [21] ; equalization-based [22] - [24] ; and channel-based, i.e., introducing an external factor, such as flow [25] or enzyme [26] , into the channel. Generally, these methods come at some increased cost, for example, more types of molecules/receptors [19] , [21] , [24] ; additional computational complexity [22] - [24] ; additional memory at nano-machines [27] ; and specific channel [20] , [25] , [26] . Notably, the MCvD system requires simple implementation. However, the above prevailing ISI mitigation schemes inevitably increase the system complexity, though they can achieve better performance. Then a question naturally arises whether we can effectively mitigate the impact of ISI by simple yet effective techniques such as sampling.",

Particularly, these methods can be divided into three categories according to their characteristics: the shift-\u03c4 method; truncating the symbol duration in advance; and extracting a small portion of the symbol duration. First, the shift-\u03c4 method means that the receiver can shift its absorbing/counting interval backward by \u03c4 seconds so as to avoid the strong ISI region [28] - [30] . The optimal reception delay of the absorbing receiver was approximately derived in [28] , thus providing a reliable guide for receiver design. Second, truncating the symbol interval in advance means that the detection process will be terminated ahead of the end of a symbol period, as proposed in [31] for the MCvD system comprised of a transmitter, an absorbing receiver, and an interference source. The authors of [31] found a proper detection interval, which can effectively overcome the interference from unintended transmitters. Third, extracting a portion of the symbol duration means that the detection process will start late and end early.",

For implementation, we assume that a transmitter can store (or generate) a certain number of information molecules with the diffusion coefficient D, and the corresponding receiver can recognize and distinguish these molecules. It is also assumed that the ON/OFF keying (OOK) modulation is applied to map the transmitted information to channel inputs. Specifically, the transmitter releases Q molecules to convey symbol \"1\", while releasing no molecules to convey symbol \"0\".

Besides, we include the optimal [t 1 , t 2 ] and [n 1 , n 2 ] obtained by two different methods for comparison. Taking the absorbing receiver as an example, we refer to \"Exhaustive search\" as [t 1 , t 2 ] * obtained from the exhaustive search for arg min P e , and \"mSINAR\" as [t 1 , t 2 ] * obtained from (18) . seen from these plots that for all cases considered, both t * 1 and t * 2 eventually converge, especially a smaller L will accelerate the convergence. This can be explained as follows: since the influence of noise is inversely proportional to Q, all interference can be approximately regarded as linearly related to the desired signal, when Q is large enough; while once this linear correlation is first achieved, [t 1 , t 2 ] * remains unchanged for future Q. Besides, for a given Q, due to the weaker interference, the situation with a smaller L can achieve this linear correlation faster. Moreover, we can observe from Fig. 2 that the initial value of t * 1 is about 1 2 t max instead of t max ; while for t * 2 , its original value is T s . This is because, as long as L is greater than 0, the forward ISI (the ISI with 0 \u2264 t \u2264 t max ) always exists and suppresses the expected signal in a short time, no matter how much Q is; while the backward interference (the ISI and noise with t max < t \u2264 T s ) is relatively small with a smaller Q. Finally, as expected, [t 1 , t 2 ] * obtained from mSINAR is well matched to that obtained from the exhaustive search, albeit with a slight gap. Fortunately, in Fig. 4 , we can find that this gap has little effect on BER performance. 2, 3, 5, 10. Similar to Fig. 2 , [n 1 , n 2 ] * is convergent and its convergence rate is inversely proportional to L. Moreover, [n 1 , n 2 ] * obtained from mSINAR almost perfectly matches that obtained from the exhaustive search for arg min P e , compared with Fig. 2 . This can be interpreted as follows: the passive receiver can be regarded as an absorbing receiver with limited sampling times, and due to a large sampling distance, it has some fault tolerance for the optimal detection interval.",

For reference, we also include the best BER curve obtained from arg min P e via the exhaustive search. Fig. 4 shows the resulting BER versus Q performance, where the absorbing receiver with T s = {0.2, 0.3} is considered. It can be seen from Fig. 4 (a) that the BER curve from the numerical mSINAR perfectly matches the best BER curve for all considered L. Then, as T s increases from 0.2 to 0.3, a similar phenomenon is also described in Fig. 4(b) . However, compared with the perfect match in Fig. 4(a) , we can observe that there is a slight gap between the above BER curves in Fig. 4(b) , especially for L = 8. This is because the denominator of (16) (i.e., the interference) decreases with an increasing T s , thus accelerating the convergence rate of mSINAR. Therefore, we can predict that as Q increases, the BER with the simulated [t 1 , t 2 ] * approaches the best BER. The above facts indicate that the proposed mSINAR can be good alternatives to measure the BER performance for the absorbing receiver. Moreover, as can be observed from Fig. 4 , the BER with the derived [t 1 , t 2 ] * is asymptotically tight with that of the other two cases for most Q, verifying the accuracy of the theoretical [t 1 , t 2 ] * . On the other hand, we also find that for a few Q, the BER with the theoretical [t 1 , t 2 ] * cannot agree well with that of the other two cases, especially when L = 10 and T s = 0.2. This is attributed to the fact: Q corresponding to the most obvious BER mismatch among all curves isQ defined in (18) ; whereas when 0 < Q <Q, the derivation of theoretical [t 1 , t 2 ] * neglects the impact of the noise, thus leading to this mismatch. Fig. 5 illustrates the resulting BER versus Q performance, where the passive receivers with T s = 1 and 2 are considered in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b) , respectively. Similar to the absorbing receiver, one can easily observe from Fig. 5 that the BER curves corresponding to the theoretical mSINAR agree with that of the numerical counterparts and the best BER curves approximately, showing the accuracy of the derived [n 1 , n 2 ] * and the effectiveness of the mSINAR metric for the passive receiver. Moreover, we also can find that the BER mismatch near the critical pointQ will be more pronounced than that of the absorbing receiver. This can be accounted for by the fact that the passive receiver itself cannot reduce ISI via absorbing the information molecules, thereby increasing the proportion of the counting noise in the received signals and further weakening the effectiveness using SID to approximately calculate [n 1 , n 2 ] * when 0 < Q <Q.",

As expected, both these schemes using the detection interval optimization and the shift-\u03c4 method outperform the conventional OOK cases. Additionally, we can observe from Fig. 6 that the BER curves with mSINAR almost perform best in all considered schemes for L > 1; whereas when L = 1, the shift-\u03c4 method is slightly superior to the numerical mSINAR, especially in Fig. 6(a) . This can be interpreted as we compare the BER curves using different performance metrics. As for SID, it can be seen from Fig. 6 that the degree of agreement between the BER curve corresponding to SID and that corresponding to mSINAR is not stable, which is caused by SID ignoring the influence of noise. Concerning SIANR, we find that the BER curve using SINAR will gradually deviate from . BER comparison among \"numerical mSINAR\", \"numerical SINAR\", \"numerical SID\", \"the shift-\u03c4 method\", and the conventional OOK for the passive receiver. that using mSINAR as Q grows.

Here, since the detection interval is always in the range of the current symbol period, the proposed mSINAR does not bring the extra interference generated in [T s , \u03c4 + T s ] and thus obtain the performance gain. Particularly, besides the existing ISI signal, the transmitted signal of the next symbol duration is also regarded as the interference in [T s , \u03c4 + T s ]. Finally,",
