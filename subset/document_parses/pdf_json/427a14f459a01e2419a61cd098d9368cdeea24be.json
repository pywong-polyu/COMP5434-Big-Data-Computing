Timely initiation of appropriate disease management is necessary to avoid serious long-term complications such as growth retardation, osteoporosis, and fractures, and includes an initial radiological assessment and ongoing monitoring of both the bone marrow and mineral components. General guidelines for the monitoring of skeletal disease in children with type 1 GD recommend magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine and femora; radiography of the spine (when clinically indicated), chest, pelvis, and long bones; and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the spine and hips at baseline and every 12-24 months [2, 3] . However, these recommendations require further clarification in view of the challenges associated with their use in children with GD, especially since the use of conventional radiography is limited by a high burden of radiation and lack of sensitivity and specificity.",

Dixon Quantitative Chemical Shift Imaging (QCSI), a quantitative MR-based technique, reports the displacement of triglyceride-containing marrow by Gaucher cells as a fat fraction.

Despite this technique's independence from the influence of bone marrow conversion, scintigraphic images are less spatially resolved than MR images, the radiation burden to the growing child is significant, and pediatric normal controls do not exist.

With serial measurements in the presence or absence of therapy, normal growth in a child with initially small bones should not be perceived as a false increase in BMD. Additional confounding factors for DXA scans of the hip or lumbar spine include avascular necrosis and vertebral compression fractures respectively, both of which may occur with GD.
