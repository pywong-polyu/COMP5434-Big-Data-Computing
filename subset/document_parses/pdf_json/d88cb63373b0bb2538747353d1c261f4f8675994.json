            "text": "Glyphosate (G) is the active ingredient of the most used herbicides worldwide. Its use is currently very debated, as several studies indicating its hazard and toxicity are emerging. Among them, there is evidence of adverse effects on the immune system. The aim of this work was to investigate if G could directly affect immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy donors were used as experimental model. PBMC were expose to G and stimulated with PMA/ionomycin, T helper (Th) cell differentiation and cytokine production were assessed by flow cytometry and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay, respectively. A reduction of Th1/Th2 ratio, mainly due to a decrease in Th1 cells, was observed following G exposure. Results show an enhancement of IL-4 and IL-17A production, and a reduction of IFN-g. Based on literature evidence that suggest G being an endocrine disruptor, we investigated the role of nuclear estrogen receptors (ER). ERa/ERb inhibition by ICI 182,780 abolished the effects of G on IFN-g and IL-4 release, suggesting a role of ER in the observed effects. To further characterize the mechanism of action of G, miRNAs, both in exosome and intracellular, were investigated. A statistically significant increase in miR-500a-5p was observed following G treatment. The blockage of miR-500a-5p, using a specific antagomir, prevented G-induced reduction of IFN-g production. Finally a relationship between miR-500a-5p up-regulation and ER was observed. Overall, these results suggest that G can directly act on T cells, altering T cell differentiation and cytokines production.",

            "text": "As for general toxicity, there is also evidence of adverse effects against the immune system. Indeed, the latter can be the target of several pesticides (17) (18) (19) . G-induced immunotoxicity could be the result of a direct action of the herbicide, or can be due to an indirect mechanism, secondary to endocrine, nervous system, or microbiota alterations (20) (21) (22) . Regarding mammals, evidence indicates the ability of G and G-based herbicides to alter immune responses and to induce inflammation (22) . More specifically, intranasal injection of G-rich air samples in mice enhanced eosinophils, neutrophils, and mast cells degranulation in lungs, suggesting an asthma-like pathology (23) . In this study, an activation of T helper (Th) 2 response, as reported by the higher production of Th2 type cytokines in lungs, namely IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IL-33, was observed. Roundup \u00ae was shown to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1b and TNF-a) in liver of rats exposed via feeding at the doses of 100 and 250 mg/kg bw/day (24) . Similarly, the exposure via gavage was able to increase the mRNA levels of IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, MAPK3, NF-kB, and caspase-3 in the jejunum of rats exposed to the doses of 50 and 500 mg/kg bw/day (25) . Authors hypothesized a role of microbiota in G-induced immunotoxicity, as a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Lactobacillus, while an enrichment in several potentially pathogenic bacteria were observed (25) . The same result was obtained by Qiu etal. (26) , which treating piglets with Roundup \u00ae in diet, observed increased mRNAs of IL-6 and NF-kB in the jejunum following the exposure to 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg bw/day. Beside animal studies, there are also few epidemiological studies supporting G-based herbicides affecting human immune system. The Agricultural Health Study demonstrated an association between G occupational exposure and current rhinitis and increased rhinitis episodes (27, 28) . This study revealed also an association between allergic and non-allergic wheezes among G sprayers (29) .",

Furthermore, Roundup LP Plus \u00ae was demonstrated to alter the metabolism of E. coli, that in turn impacted on the inflammatory immune response, inducing a higher production of TNF-a (31) .

            "text": "G shown a non-monotonic dose-response relationship in its toxic effects against Th. Many endocrine disruptors, and mainly estrogenic substances, display this characteristic (45) , strengthening the hypothesis of G considered as an endocrine disruptor. Some possible explanations to this phenomenon could be the cytotoxicity at high concentrations, the different receptor affinity, or receptor desensitization (45, 46) . To further investigate the mechanism underlying G immunotoxicity, a different expression of miRNAs in exosomes by PBMC following G exposure was investigated. MiRNAs are single-stranded RNAs of about 22 nucleotides, that function as post-transcriptional regulators, through the interference with mRNA processes (47) . They can affect both mRNA stability and target mRNA for the subsequent degradation (48) . The majority of miRNAs are localized in the intracellular compartment, however several miRNAs in various body fluids have been described (49) . Exosomes are miRNAs carriers (50), of great relevance in pharmacology and toxicology (51) . Notably, circulating miRNAs have been described as potential biomarkers of autoimmune and inflammatory disease (reviewed by 52). Considering the important role of miRNAs in the regulation of gene expression and their possible application as biomarkers and as cell-cell communication mechanism, we examined the differential expression of several miRNAs in farmers occupationally exposed to G (manuscript in preparation). Results presented in this work suggest miR-500a-5p as a possible target of G in immune cells. Only few studies investigated the effect of G on non-coding RNAs, mainly conducted in mice. Ji et al. (53) associated perinatal G exposure in mice with a differential miRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex (55 miRNAs up-regulated and 19 miRNAs down-regulated), mainly involved in neural development. Also, circular RNAs were affected, with 330 up-regulated and 333 down-regulated (54) . Supporting this evidence, more recently, perinatal G exposure in mice was associated with aberrant expression of lncRNAs, highlighting a link with impaired neuronal development (55) . Also changes in miRNA profile in female rat liver were assessed following G and G-based herbicide treatment, and interestingly these miRNAs were associated with carcinogenesis, like miR-17 and miR-22 (56) . Furthermore, an in vitro study performed on carp lymphocytes shown that Ginduced lymphocyte apoptosis was mediated by the regulation of miR-203 and PI3K/AKT pathway (57) . No studies examined the effect of G on miRNAs in human immune cells, in this regard this study represents the first evidence that G can affect human miRNAs expression linked to the immune system. In particular, a role of miR-500a could be demonstrated, linking miR-500a and lower IFN-g production. MiR-500a-5p is not a well-characterized miRNA; to date the few available evidence address a role in oxidative stress in breast cancer (58) and in the promotion of breast cancer cell proliferation (59) . It has also been described as oncogenic in colorectal cancer (60), as well as responsible for proliferation and metastasis of hepatocarcinoma (61) . Based on TargetScan (v7.2; targetscan.org), a useful database to predict miRNA target sites (62), hsa-miR-500a-5p could hypothetically inhibit several mRNAs involved in the differentiation of Th cells towards Th1, preventing it. Among possible targets there are STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), TBX21 (T-box 21; or T-bet), SOCS5 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 5) and ANXA1 (annexin A1), which are all positive regulators of Th1. The up-regulation of miR-500a could be indeed in line with the decrease in Th1 as demonstrated in the current study. Furthermore, we speculate on the existence of a dependance between miR-500a expression and ER, since its inhibition reflected in a lower expression of hsa-miR-500a-5p. Preliminary results indicate indeed a reduced expression of STAT1 following G exposure, which could be reversed by ICI (data not shown), indicating STAT1 as a relevant target to explain G immunotoxicity.",

All authors contributed to the article and approved the submitted version. FIGURE 5 | Role of ERa in G-induced intracellular expression of hsa-miR-500a-5p. PBMC (10 6 /mL) were treated with ICI 182,780 (1 \u00b5M) for 15 minutes, and subsequently with G (0.1 \u00b5g/mL) for 72 h. Total RNA was extracted, retrotranscribed, and hsa-miR-500a-5p detected through Real-Time PCR. Foldchanges (2 \u2212DDCt ) are reported, using hsa-RNU6-2 as negative control. Each dot represents the fold change of hsa-miR-500a-5p expression induced by G over control for each individual, whereas rhombuses represent the fold change of hsa-miR-500a-5p expression obtained from cells treated with ICI 182,780 and G over ICI-treated cells. Each value represents the mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 5 donors. Statistical analysis was performed with Paired t test, with *p < 0.05 vs G-treated cells. ",
