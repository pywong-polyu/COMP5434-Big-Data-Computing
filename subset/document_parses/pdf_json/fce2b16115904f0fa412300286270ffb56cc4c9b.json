The first strand focuses on the informal volunteering by individuals who support other individuals on a given problem without acting within an organizational context (Carson, 1999; Reed & Selbee, 2001) . The second strand focuses on self-organized civic activism in an area of civil society with an activity that is structured outside the non-profit sector (Pasi & Faehnle, 2017) . The third strand focuses on the emergence of hybrid organizations, the object of study in the present article.",

The management model also assumes that certain commercial activities are consistent with a defined objective (Rask et al., 2020) . Authors argue that hybridity combines characteristics of organizations belonging to the second and third sectors. Hybrid organizations can generate revenue and attract capital in different ways, and present both management models (Schmitz & Gl\u00e4nzel, 2016) . These organizations' purpose is to generate social impact by meeting the society's challenges without neglecting their financial sustainability (Battilana & Lee, 2014; Battilana, Lee, Walker, & Dorsey, 2012; Hoffman, Badiane, & Haigh, 2012 ).",

The residents of these organizations, aged between 60 and around 100 were at risk given the associated comorbidities.In this period of great uncertainty and doubt in the face of the unknown, measures and contingency plans were drawn up by third sector organizations to contain the virus and avoid further spread among residents and employees. However, material, human and financial resources were scarce. As a form of appeal and awareness, the third sector's demands would not be met without all the municipality organizations, regardless of their sector. They sought to collaborate, thus creating intersectoral partnerships.With the proper authorization of Ovar City Council, companies in the private sector redesigned their assembly and production lines to design free of charge the materials necessary to supply the local hospital and the IPSS of the municipality. The employees of these companies used their lunch break to continue production, given the recurrent demand for Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs).During the siege, the aim was not the monetary gain, but to alleviate the health crisis and meet local needs. Feeling useful became one of the primary motivations for the fourth sector's urgency in the municipality, although it could not be on the front line. For instance, two large private companies called Ramada Investimentos e Ind\u00fastria, S.A. (with head office in Ovar) and Simoldes Pl\u00e1sticos, S.A. (headquartered in Oliveira de Azem\u00e9is) had created a project along with the City Council and the IPSS of the municipality of Ovar called \"Projeto Armadura,\" which refers to the fourth sector. This project had a single objective to produce and distribute visors during the fence period, since, with the county closed, the shortage of material was increasing. This fourth sector initiative proved very productive since the Ramada Group supplied the special steel, which is the material needed to manufacture various materials. The Simoldes Group, which manufactures injection molds for the plastic industry, developed the mold needed to produce visors in seconds. The two companies worked together to manufacture the material, and the City Hall helped identify the municipality's needs. Since Ramada Group did not receive the authorization to produce and had steel material retained in warehouses, it managed, through this partnership, to supply the needed material to Simoldes Group, which started its activity immediately. Due to the partnership with the municipality, it was possible to obtain the proper authorizations and the follow-up of the entry and exit of the material and PPEs. When Ramada Group had the authorization to work still inside the sanitary fence, it helped in the process of management and distribution of the material to the IPSS, including Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Ovar, and other parties in the front line, such as hospital, security forces, firemen, among others. Besides, visors, surgical masks, surgical gowns, cuffs, and leggings acquired through other companies were provided free of charge.",

This way, it donated carton equipment, tables, and chairs to Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Ovar to guarantee more comfort to the residents. Being a multinational company, also allowed to support other organizations and carry out campaigns to acquire PPEs.Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Ovar, as a third sector organization heavily involved against the disease, demonstrates that, without the fourth sector, it would have been practically impossible to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the municipality and guarantee the safety of the community, especially the supported underprivileged populations.The fourth sector is critical when it is necessary to act quickly, given the different capacities of all community sectors, material, financial and human resources. This fact was evident in the immediate need of preventing the spread of the virus. Besides, the hybrid organizations that make up the fourth sector have revealed the ability to aim at different purposes, which has made it possible to support all the organizations that make up the third sector, regardless of their mission. Social vulnerability and the lack of a framework to sustain the impending crisis are two reasons to deal with the critical situation with the fourth sector's support.",
