The mean age of all patients was 64.8 \u00b1 14.3 years, and 56.9% were male. The rate of in-hospital mortality was 42.3% (n = 58), and the rate of one-year mortality was 51.1% (n = 70).

However, ICH is a condition that affects patients both neurologically and multi-systemically. Therefore, to improve outcomes, it is strongly recommended that the follow-up and treatment of patients with ICH occur in intensive care conditions or a stroke unit [22] . Additionally, it is important to keep the problem in perspective while predicting outcomes, rather than using only a neurologic evaluation. The advantage of the SAPS-II, APACHE-IV, and LODS scores used in ICUs is the evaluation of changes in the clinical condition of patients within the first 24 h. Clinical changes are evaluated according to the worst values; accordingly, they are thought to overestimate mortality [23] . APACHE-II is now routinely used in many ICUs and has good-to-excellent discriminative power outcomes. APACHE-IV is the recent and revised version of APACHE-II, according to specific disease groups. In many specific disease groups, including stroke, APACHE-IV has been shown to be superior to APACHE-II [24] . Although APACHE-II and SAPS-II scores were not designed for specific patient groups, they have good accuracy in patients with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke [25] [26] [27] . The SAPS-III score is based on the patient's assessment during the first hour of ICU admission [28] . Most of the data used in the SAPS-III score are derived from information before ICU admission, so in a previous study, it was hypothesized that the SAPS-III score could be used for ICU triage [29] . Based on this idea, we calculated the SAPS-III score for patients with ICH in the first hour of admission to both the ED and ICU.",

It was observed that SAPS-III-ED had lower discriminative power than SAPS-III-ICU because patients could rapidly deteriorate in the hours following admission. The performance of both SAPS-III scores calculated in the two treatment units was poor in patients with ICH when compared with other conventional intensive care severity scores. However, SAPS-III-ED and SAPS-III-ICU scores showed better performance compared with Essen-ICH, ICH, max-ICH, and ICH-FOS scores in predicting one-year mortality. ICH is a medical emergency, and early aggressive treatment is crucial. Therefore, treatment should start in the ED and the management plan should be conducted multidisciplinarily [4] . Following the first-line treatment in ED, these patients can be transferred to the ICU, neuro-ICU, acute stroke unit or a general ward according to their general clinical status. Patients who are followed up in ICUs or acute stroke units are suggested to have better outcomes than patients in general wards [22] . However, depending on the infrastructure of the treatment center and for the effective use of intensive care beds, it may be preferable to follow up certain patients in the wards. There is no present severity scoring system currently used in EDs for the triage of patients with ICH. Considering the possibility that patients with ICH can rapidly deteriorate within hours, the SAPS-III score may be recommended for use in EDs for triage after proper customization. For example, a patient with a good clinical condition, low-volume, but infratentorial bleeding should never be directed to a ward. On the other hand, a patient with a good clinical condition and low-volume cortical bleeding can be referred to a ward. However, the interpretation of this result needs to be used cautiously in clinical practice.",

In another study, both SAPS-II and GCS were found to be good predictors of mortality [31] . In the present study, variables that have been shown to have a substantial role in the outcomes of patients with ICH were also evaluated. It was found that one-year mortality rate was higher in patients who have lower GCS on the first admission and who become severely hypotensive requiring vasopressors (regardless of blood pressure-lowering therapy) within the first 24 h of admission. Further analysis showed that the need for mechanical ventilation, hematoma volume, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and hematoma originating from lobar and nonlobar regions together were found to be significant prognosticators of one-year mortality in patients with ICH. Neurosurgery (hematoma evacuation and/or EVD insertion) was observed to significantly reduce mortality in supraventricular hematomas [32] . In the same study, no difference was observed in terms of survival in patients with EVD implantation.

This number may seem to be relatively high; however, there are some issues that may have contributed to this result. In some studies, patients who received palliative treatment in ICUs and underwent early care limitations considering that the further treatment would be futile were not included in mortality calculations [11] . According to Turkish Criminal Law, withdrawal of life support and do-not-resuscitate orders are considered as passive euthanasia by jurists, so none of them are used [34] . Additionally, because of the lack of adequate palliative care centers in the country, the length of ICU stay of some patients is prolonged unnecessarily (ranging from 2 to 87 days in this study). Among the in-hospital deceased group, 22 patients stayed in the ICU for more than 20 days. This fact may contribute to a rise in the in-hospital mortality rates because they cannot be discharged from the ICU after the end of their intensive therapy. According to the results, 21 patients died in ICU because of hospital-acquired infections, and the mean hospital stay time of these patients was 38.9 \u00b1 22.7 days. Moreover, nine patients had been declared brain dead, and eight patients died because of the medical causes related to initial brain damage (Supplemental Table) . As in-hospital mortality is associated with the social insurance policy of the country, religiosity, ethnicity, hospital characteristics, discharge destinations (hospice, palliative care, home), end of life decisions, and patient selection bias, it would be appropriate to evaluate the mortality studies by considering these variables [35, 36] .",

Later, several ICH-specific, neurologic evaluation, and radiology-based prognostic scales (including max-ICH, Essen-ICH, and ICH-FOS) were created and tested for prognostication performance over the original ICH grading scale [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . There are very few studies comparing simple ICH-specific grading scales and routine ICU scoring systems. The original ICH score was found to have better discrimination for one-month mortality in patients with ICH [15] . A possible reason for this result could be that the authors excluded patients with comorbidities, such as renal failure or ischemic heart disease, and patients who necessitated neurosurgical interventions for ICH [15] . Under these circumstances, it would not be a surprise for APACHE-II to underscore while excluding these parameters. In the present study, although all three ICH-specific grading scales provided satisfactory results for predicting one-year mortality, the common intensive care severity scoring systems showed better performance.",

Second, although all these scores were calculated by a single researcher using the same calculator, when it comes to daily practice, bias due to differences in calculations among medical personnel cannot be excluded entirely. Therefore, these scores should not be used for decision-making, and the interpretation of this study needs to be used cautiously in clinical practice. Another limitation is that the study is monocentric and had a small sample size in comparison with nationwide studies; hence, it may not generally be applicable to a larger population. Although long-term mortality rates were evaluated, this study did not include the causes of death at the end of the first year and long-term functional outcomes. All causes of in-hospital death may have been affected by the previously mentioned reasons leading to prolonging hospital stay. Therefore, different from the previous studies, the most common cause of in-hospital mortality of ICH patients in this study is infections and infection-related situations (sepsis, MODS, etc.). Additionally, institutional and personal differences in management planning, including the decision for surgery, directing medical and pharmacological treatment, transferring patients to wards, stroke units, ICU, or neuro-ICU, should be considered.",
