Thus, these children may be at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or to develop severe COVID-19. 1, 2 Furthermore, it is unclear whether COVID-19 infection in these children increases the risk for having neurologic relapses or development of COVID-19-associated pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS). 1 These concerns and the lack of consensus guidelines led scientific societies to provide different and sometimes contradictory recommendations for school attendance and patient management. In addition, many hospitals opted for remote rather than face-to-face medical visits. However, there are no epidemiologic studies to assess whether this group of patients has in fact an increased susceptibility to develop COVID-19 or have poorer outcomes if they do. Furthermore, the consequences of the measures adopted to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in these children have not been evaluated.",

To rule out bias due to regional differences in COVID-19 incidence and the preventive measures instituted by local governments, control individuals were consecutively recruited at each regional center as follows: for each patient enrolled who was receiving immunosuppressants, the next child seen in the clinic who was close in age and had a neuroinflammatory disease but was not receiving immunosuppressants was invited to participate in the study. If this first control subject declined, the next consecutive potential control subject was recruited (eTable 1, links.lww. com/NXI/A654). We defined immunosuppressive treatment as any chronic treatment that impairs innate or adaptive immunity and therefore may confer a higher risk for infectious diseases. For the controls not receiving immunosuppressive treatment, immunomodulatory drugs were allowed (e.g., interferon beta-1a, acetate glatiramer, or IV immunoglobulins [IVIgs]) as these agents do not confer an increased susceptibility for infections.",

The absence of association between immunosuppression and development of COVID-19 was also observed when only the 36 patients with lymphopenia and/or B-cell depletion were compared with the 74 patients who did not receive immunosuppressants (3/36 vs 6/74, p = 1). Of these 36 patients, 23 (64%) had complete B-cell suppression due to rituximab, 7 of them with treatment-induced dysgammaglobulinemia, and another 5 with lymphopenia (2/5 also showed leucopenia). Another 13 (36%) patients without B-cell depletion had lymphopenia according to normal age range levels (median 700 lymphocytes/mm 3 , IQR 375-1071 lymphocytes/ mm 3 , 7/13 also showed leucopenia); they included 9 patients treated with fingolimod, 1 with dimethyl fumarate, 1 with mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide, 1 with abatacept, and 1 with allogenic bone marrow transplantation.",

This contrasts with a report in adult patients with MS in which anti-CD20 drugs were associated with a significantly increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. 8 Although the results of our study could have been related to the increased protection of these patients from SARS-CoV-2 during the lockdown period, this is unlikely as the frequency of COVID-19 remained very low even after resuming face-to-face school attendance.
