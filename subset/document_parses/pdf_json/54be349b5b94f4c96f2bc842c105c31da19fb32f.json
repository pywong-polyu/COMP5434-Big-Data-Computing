The majority of patients with positive serology underwent an additional serology test at least once during subsequent clinical follow-up. Patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection if they had two positive tests. Results: Eight patients out of the 72 screened (11.1%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in both serological tests. Of those who tested positive, 4 had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results before screening. All patients were asymptomatic or had a history of mild symptoms. All tested patients had persistently positive antibodies at a median follow-up time of 75 days (IQR, 44.5, 86.5 days). One patient had a positive PCR test at 75 days and a positive serology test at 120 days post infection. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was relatively high (11.1%) in our population. Although all patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, they mounted a strong humoral immune response that persisted for a few months despite being on triple immunosuppressants. These findings have positive implications regarding vaccination efficacy in this group.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is considered a public health emergency. Despite all efforts and policies to contain it, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) infection continued to spread rapidly. As of October 8, 2020, COVID-19 has led to over 1 million deaths and 3.5 million cases worldwide [1] Approximately 85% of cases will be mild, while 10% will have moderate disease requiring hospitalization, and 5% will have severe disease requiring ICU admission [2] As pediatric solid organ transplant recipients are considered a high-risk group and are prone to more severe viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, this pandemic has raised concerns among the transplant community about managing this vulnerable group. In the early days of the pandemic, COVID-19 was thought to be more severe among immunocompromised patients. The fear of more severe disease has limited kidney transplant surgeries to those that are urgent and has led to the closure of many living transplant programs [3] , including ours. This perceived risk in transplant patients is an extrapolation of data from other viruses. Unlike influenza and adenovirus [4] , SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to preferentially affect immunocompromised patients. There is emerging evidence that immunosuppressed children exhibit mild disease [5] [6] [7] . This mild disease course could be explained by the role of immunosuppressants in damping of the dysfunctional or hyperimmune response that occurs in the later stages of the infection, leading to lung tissue injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [8] . Although we are one year into the pandemic, little is known about the effect of COVID-19 on the pediatric kidney transplant (PKT) population.",

The difference in disease severity between adult and pediatric populations might be related to a more robust innate immune response and higher levels of interleukin-17 and interferon gamma in children [15] ,, which play an important role in early disease containment. This difference in disease severity could also be explained by the fact that children are more prone to recurrent viral infection that can cause epigenetic changes in their trained immune system, making it more efficient at fighting the virus [16] . Immunocompromised patients are always at a higher risk of contracting severe viral and bacterial infections. Understanding the host immune response of the kidney transplant population to SARS-CoV-2 infection is evolving but remains unclear.",

Two patients had readings above the detectable upper limits of the test (> 400 AU/ml). Although these levels are very high, no one truly knew how these levels translate into protection from the virus. These findings were unexpected, as we already know that compared to the regular population, transplant patients who developed infection have a blunted immune response and a low rate of seroconversion [27] .. The fact that our transplant patients mounted a strong humoral immune response to natural infection makes us believe that they will elicit the same, if not stronger, immune response with future vaccination when it becomes available for this age group. More interestingly, all patients who mounted rigorous immune responses to COVID-19 were still positive at a median time of 75 days (IQR, 69-83 days). One patient (case 2) was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG at 120 days. The fact that all our positive serology patients had a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive household members validates the positive serology results in our cohort. It also supports the hypothesis of possible household transmission among children that was addressed by Buonsenos et al [28] . The one patient (case 9) who had only one positive test was consider as negative. Of note, the parents' antibody titers from approximately the same time as those assessed their children were significantly lower than those in their children except in one patient. These findings are in contrast to what has been reported by Pierce et al., who showed that serum neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were higher in adults than in children [15] .",

All patients but one developed a humoral immune response to COVID-19. This high rate of seroconversion in the PKT population has been replicated in adults and a few pediatric studies. In a recently published work by Prendecki et al., they found a relatively high seroprevalence rate of 10.4% in a cohort of adult kidney transplant recipients [29] In another small cohort of the PKT population that included 31 patients, seroconversion was reported in only one patient who was completely asymptomatic, and 3 patients had intermediate positive results [30] . Two adult kidney transplant patients reported seroconversion between days 19 and 23 after the reduction of immunosuppressants [31] .. There was also documented seroconversion in another two adult kidney transplant patients who developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at 30 days post infection [32] . Moreover, a study performed by Hartzell et al. reported 100% seroconversion in 16 SARS-CoV-2positive adult kidney transplant patients [33] . Furthermore, Choi et al. also reported a 100% seroconversion rate in 5 adult KTR patients [34] . Some of the current adult transplant guidelines including the guidelines from the Canadian society of transplantation pediatric group [35] suggest reduction or complete withdrawal of immunosuppressants. However, this suggestion was challenged by multiple studies that showed the ability of CNI to inhibit in vitro viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 infection independent of its immunosuppressant effects [36] . Furthermore, cyclosporine was successfully used to treat cases of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (HLH) that overlaps with the cytokine release storm, which seems to be the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients [37] .",

However, similar to all pediatric kidney transplant studies, we were limited by a small sample size, especially in this highly protected group. Moreover, the results cannot be generalized to all PKT patients, as the majority of the patients enrolled were more than one year post transplantation and were on lowdose maintenance immunosuppressants. The immune assays used were IgG based, so acute infection could have been missed. Importantly, all samples obtained were from Saudi children who might have different immunological backgrounds that can affect the immunoassay performance characteristics. For all these mentioned reasons, further larger studies with wider geographical samples and longer durations of antibody titer follow-up are needed.",
