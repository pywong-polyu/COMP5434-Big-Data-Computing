Here we present for the first time that whey protein from human breastmilk effectively inhibited both SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V by blocking viral attachment, entry and even post-entry viral replication. Moreover, human whey protein inhibited infectious virus production proved by the plaque assay. We found that whey protein from different species such as cow and goat also showed anti-coronavirus properties. And commercial bovine milk also showed similar activity. Interestingly, the main antimicrobial components of breastmilk, such as Lactoferrin and IgA antibody, showed limited anti-coronavirus activity, indicating that other factors of breastmilk may play the important anticoronavirus role. Taken together, we reported that whey protein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and its related virus of GX_P2V. These results rule out whey protein as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection and replication and further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.",

Then, we washed the cells with PBS 5 times and infected SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus for 24h.

In our present study, we found that human breastmilk inhibited the infectivity of both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V, with EC50<0.2mg/ml.

Besides LF, specific immunoglobulins are also important for the host defense system (18) . It was reported that IgA antibody from the recovery patients blocks the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 (18) . As the human breastmilk samples were collected before the emergence of COVID-19, the breastmilk donors should have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA was negative in the human breastmilk samples used in the present study and antibodies directed against human IgA did not offset the inhibition of human breastmilk on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V. Therefore, the inhibition of whey protein on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is not due to the IgA antibody. Together, these results suggested that other mechanism may be responsible for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of whey protein, which merits further study.",

The dilution of virus titers from 0.16 mg/ml breastmilk treatment less than 100000 folds still showed infectious virus. These results confirmed that breastmilk also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 related coronavirus infection.The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by whey protein from different speciesTo rule out whether whey protein in breastmilk play the important role in the inhibition of viral infection, we inactivated the protein by high temperature of 90 \u00b0C for 10 mins and protease K digestion, respectively, and test their role in viral inhibition. As shown inFig.4A, the inhibition rate in breastmilk with treatment by heat and protease K showed limited inhibition of viral infection, indicating that whey protein none other factors in breastmilk has antiviral properties. Similar results were showed in A549 cell line(Fig.4B).To investigate if whey protein from other species could also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and GX-P2V infection, we selected cow and goat whey protein and performed the experiments. The Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at a MOI of 650 TCID50/well treated with serial 2-fold dilution of commercial bovine milk (Aptamil, Australia). As shown inFig.4C, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection could be inhibited by commercial bovine milk doses dependently.
