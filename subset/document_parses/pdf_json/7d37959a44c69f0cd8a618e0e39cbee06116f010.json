A study in Iceland that tested a random sample of individuals for SARS-CoV-2 reported that 0.9% individuals reported fever, 3.8% reported cough, and 0.6% reported a loss of smell or taste. 29 While not directly comparable, studies of influenza symptoms, which overlap with COVID-19 symptoms, provide an estimate of the general frequency of fever and cough in the population. Since the majority of the population tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. had moderate to severe symptoms, these probabilities provide a reasonable estimate of P(S1|untested). Cohort studies of influenza-like illness (fever and cough and/or sore throat) in prior years in the U.S. and the Netherlands have found weekly incidence of 1-4%. [30] [31] [32] Studies measuring over the entire influenza season have reported cumulative incidence of influenza-like illness ranging from approximately 7% to 17%. [33] [34] [35] Distribution of \uf061 To allow for state-level variation in P(test +|S1, untested) due to differing transmission dynamics in each state, our model allowed this probability to vary by state. We defined \uf061 as a truncated beta distribution ranging from 80% to 99% (median: 91%) such that \uf0610 < P(test + |S1, untested)/P(test +|tested) < \uf0611. We used an empirical state-specific estimate of P(test+ | tested) equal to the cumulative number of cases divided by the cumulative number of tests by April 18, 2020. The median of state-specific distributions of P(test+|S1, untested) ranged from 0.02 to 0.46, and in many states the medians were close to 0.1 (Appendix Table 2 ). This is consistent with a study in Iceland, which estimated that P(test+|S1) was 1% among those tested in population screening (N=3,579) and 2% among those tested in a random sample (N=271). 29 Distribution of \uf062 To allow for state-level variation in P(test +|S0, untested) due to differing transmission dynamics in each state, our model allowed this probability to vary by state. We defined \uf062 as a truncated beta distribution ranging from 0.2% to 32% (median: 5%) such that \uf062 0 < P(test + |S0, untested)/P(test +|tested) < \uf062 1. As described above, we used an empirical state-specific estimate of P(test +| tested). The median of state-specific distributions of P(test+|S0, untested) ranged from 0.001 to 0.023 (Appendix Table 2 ). A study in Iceland estimated that P(test+|S0) was 0.8% among mild symptomatic/asymptomatic individuals tested in population screening and 0.6% (N=10,797) among mild symptomatic/ asymptomatic individuals tested in a random sample (N=2,283). 29 One study in New York City screening 215 pregnant women admitted for delivery, regardless of symptoms, found that 13.7% of women without symptoms tested positive. 36 However, these estimates may not be representative of the general population because of differences in age and immunity of pregnant women.
