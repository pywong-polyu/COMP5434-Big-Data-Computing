            "text": "The incubation period of SARS is the time between infection of disease and onset of symptoms. Knowledge about the distribution of incubation times is crucial in determining the length of quarantine period and is an important parameter in modelling the spread and control of SARS. As the exact time of infection is unknown for most patients, the incubation time cannot be determined. What is observable is the serial interval which is the time from the onset of symptoms in an index case to the onset of symptoms in a subsequent case infected by the index case. By constructing a convolution likelihood based on the serial interval data, we are able to estimate the incubation distribution which is assumed to be Weibull, and justi\u00ffcations are given to support this choice over other distributions. The method is applied to data provided by the Ministry of Health of Singapore and the results justify the choice of a ten-day quarantine period. The indirect estimate obtained using the method of convolution likelihood is validated by means of comparison with a direct estimate obtained directly from a subset of patients for whom the incubation time can be ascertained. Despite its name, the proposed indirect estimate is actually more precise than the direct estimate because serial interval data are recorded for almost all patients, whereas exact incubation times can be determined for only a small subset. It is possible to obtain an even more e cient estimate by using the combined data but the improvement is not substantial.",

As a disease, SARS has a high case-fatality rate. According to the WHO, a total of 8422 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak. Of these, 916 died. Up to now, there is no de\u00ffnitive cure or vaccine for SARS. As a result, health o cials have to rely on isolation and quarantine as the two main preventive measures. The people to be isolated include the suspected, probable and con\u00ffrmed SARS cases so as to prevent further transmission of the disease. As people infected with SARS have to go through an incubation period before they become symptomatic, it is also important to quarantine people who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV, for example, the contacts of cases, so that they can be isolated as soon as they show possible signs of the disease. Obviously, the suitable length of the quarantine period is directly related to the length of the incubation period. The distribution of SARS incubation period is also an important input parameter in a mathematical model to describe the dynamics and spread of the disease and for assessing the potential impact of interventions.",

It is claimed that the simulation approach can be used to give frequency distribution and con\u00ffdence intervals for the various quantities of interest. The argument, is, however, awed from a statistical point of view. This is because the use of simulations only accounts for the Monte Carlo variation of simulations treating the observed sample as \u00ffxed but not the sampling variability that takes into account the randomness of samples. To be precise, suppose there are n patients in the sample and the incubation period of patient i could only be determined up to m i possible values t i1 ; : : : ; t imi .

By constructing a convolution likelihood based on the serial interval data in Singapore, we are able to estimate the incubation distribution parametrically. To be speci\u00ffc, the Weibull distribution is selected as a suitable distribution for SARS incubation from a four-parameter family of generalized F distributions (see Sections 2.2.7 and 3.9.1 of Reference [7] ) that contains the log-normal, log-logistic, gamma, Weibull and reciprocal Weibull distributions as special cases. Based on the resulting estimate, the choice of a 10-day incubation period in Singapore is well justi\u00ffed. The validity of the convolution likelihood estimate is demonstrated by means of comparison with a direct estimate obtained directly from a subset of patients for whom the incubation time can be ascertained. Whereas the direct estimate is only based on 50 incubation times, the convolution likelihood estimate is based on 198 serial intervals and hence is more precise. It is also possible to construct a maximum likelihood estimate based on the ascertained incubation times for the 50 patients plus the serial times for the remaining 148 patients.",

Note that we can only observe the sum s i , but not the components u i and t i . Assuming that the two components are statistically independent, the density of the sum s i is given by the convolution of the densities of u i and t i , and the incubation times t i are assumed to be independent and identically distributed according to a density f T (t). Furthermore, let d i be the duration between onset of symptoms and isolation for the spreader who transmitted the disease to patient i. We assume that a person infected with SARS will not transmit the disease to others before onset of symptoms and after isolation. Under this assumption, the time d i de\u00ffned earlier can be interpreted as the duration of infectiousness of the person who transmitted SARS to patient i. This is a reasonable assumption as there is no compelling evidence so far of transmission from asymptomatic persons [6] and isolation measure, if strictly adhered to, should be e ective in preventing transmission. To obtain the density of u i that is to be convoluted with that of t i , we condition on the duration of infectiousness d i of the spreaders. Assuming constant infectiousness throughout the duration d i , the conditional density f Ui (u i | d i ) of the infection time u i is uniformly distributed between 0 and d i . We have also assumed independence between the incubation times t i of patients and the duration times of their infectors so that the conditional distribution of t i given d i is still given by f T (t). Combining, the density of s i = u i + t i given the duration of infectiousness d i , is given by the convolution A simpler way to derive (1) proposed by a referee is to think in terms of interval censoring of the incubation times t i . Since s i = u i + t i , we have t i = s i \u2212 u i , that is to say, the incubation time t i is the di erence between the serial interval s i and the infection time u i . Now the infection time u i must be within the period of infectiousness, that is, between 0 and d i , it follows that the incubation time",

Assume t i \u223cWeibull ( 1 ; \u00ff 1 ) for i \u2208 D with corresponding mean 1 = 1 (1 + \u00ff \u22121 1 ) and t i \u223cWeibull ( 2 ; \u00ff 2 ) with mean 2 = 2 (1 + \u00ff \u22121 2 ) for i = \u2208 D.

Thus there is some evidence that there could be some di erence between the two underlying distributions but their means appear to be compatible. As commented by Donnelly et al. [4] , the ascertained incubation times are subject to 'biases in reporting, di erent routes of transmission, or varying infectious doses of the virus', and so the distribution of the ascertained incubation times may be somewhat di erent from the actual incubation distribution. This is another reason why the estimates\u02c6 (s D ; s D c );\u00ff(s D ; s D c ) based on serial interval data alone reported in Section 2 might be more reliable, but as explained in the last paragraph, the results do not change much if we use\u02c6 (t D ; s D c );\u00ff(t D ; s D c ) for this data set because of the small proportion of ascertained cases.",

It is known that (m 1 ; m 2 ) = (1; 1) corresponds to a log-logistic distribution for T , m 2 = \u221e corresponds to the generalized gamma distribution which further reduces to the gamma distribution if = 1. A Weibull distribution for T corresponds to an extreme value distribution for W and this corresponds to (m 1 ; m 2 ) = (1; \u221e). The log-normal distribution is obtained by letting (m 1 ; m 2 ) \u2192 (\u221e; \u221e).

When the three-parameter family is \u00fftted to the subset of 50 incubation times, the log-likelihood function of q, with \u00c1 and pro\u00ffled out, is given in Figure 6 .

By inverting the likelihood ratio test, an approximate 95 per cent con\u00ffdence interval for q is roughly from 0.06 to 1.83. Thus the Weibull distribution is compatible with the observed data but not so for the lognormal distribution. If the three-parameter family is \u00fftted to the combined data consisting of the observed incubation times for the 50 cases as well as the serial intervals for the remaining 148 cases, the maximum likelihood estimate of q is 0.57. Due to the use of additional data, the 95 per cent con\u00ffdence interval of q that results from test inversion is tighter and ranges from 0.07 to 1.15, which is again compatible with the Weibull but not the log-normal model.",

A consequence of this assumption is that given the duration of infectiousness of an index case, the times of infection of those infected by him=her are uniformly distributed. In other words, we are assuming that u i =d i are uniformly distributed in the unit interval. A Pearson chi-square test of the goodness of \u00fft of the uniform distribution is conducted using the subset of patients for whom the infection times u i , and hence also u i =d i , can be determined. Partitioning the unit interval into 5 equal sub-intervals, the value of the chi-square statistic is 4.22 on 4 degrees of freedom which is not statistically signi\u00ffcant (p value = 0:38). We do not expect the uniform assumption to be strictly true, as the clinicians we have spoken to believe that the viral load levels, and hence the infectiousness, of SARS patients will typically reach its peak in a number of days after onset of symptoms and then decrease. Nevertheless, we have obtained fairly reasonable estimate of the incubation distribution by using the uniform density f Ui (u i | d i ) = 1=d i to construct the convolution density of s i = u i + t i . The validity of the resulting convolution likelihood estimate has also been established through comparison with a direct estimate, see Figure 4 . In principle, we could assume that infections are transmitted by a symptomatic person according to a Poisson process with intensity function (u). It follows that given that there is an infection during the duration d, the infection time is distributed according to the normalized density rather than the uniform distribution.

For the SARS data in Singapore, the Weibull model seems to be more appropriate than other distributions like the log-normal and log-logistic. The validity of the indirect estimate obtained from serial interval data is established by way of comparison with a direct estimate based on the ascertained incubation times for a subset of patients. An advantage of the maximum convolution likelihood estimates of and \u00ff is that they are based on 198 serial intervals (SE = 0:27 and 0.16) and hence more precise than the direct estimates which are based on only 50 incubation times (SE = 0:38 and 0.32). It is possible to obtain a combined estimate that makes use of the incubation times for the 50 patients in the ascertained subset and the serial intervals for the remaining 148 cases. However, the resulting estimate is not that much di erent from that based on the full set of 198 serial intervals. The proposed method is general enough to allow non-uniform distribution for infection times and age dependence for incubation times but it appears that there is no strong reason for doing these.",

The standard errors are also similar. Thus using the ascertained incubation times t D = {t i ; i \u2208 D} instead of the serial intervals s D = {s i ; i \u2208 D} does not lead to substantial improvement in e ciency when we have additional data s D c = {s i ; i = \u2208 D}, and the two sets of estimates are equally good for practical purposes. A possible explanation for this is that there are only 50 cases in D compared with 148 cases in D c .",
