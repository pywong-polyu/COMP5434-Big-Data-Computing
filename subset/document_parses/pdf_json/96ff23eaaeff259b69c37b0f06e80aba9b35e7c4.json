The regulation of inflammation and angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in wound healing and tissue regeneration. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic roles of human adipose mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms. Exosomes inhibited LPS-induced inflammation by activating ROCK1 and PTEN expression. Moreover, microRNAs (miR-132 and miR-146a) released from exosomes upregulated the expression of pro-angiogenic genes and promoted proliferation activity and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Exosomal effects were verified using ROCK1/PTEN inhibitors for anti-inflammation and miR-132/miR-146a inhibitors for pro-angiogenesis. Our findings suggest that exosomes exert anti-inflammatory effects by targeting the ROCK1/PTEN pathway and exhibit pro-angiogenic effects via delivery of miR-132 and miR-146a. Taken together, these results suggest that exosomes may be promising therapeutic candidates for curing diseases involved in inflammation and angiogenesis.",

Stem cells act in their microenvironment and surrounding cells by differentiating into target cells or releasing cytokines, growth factors, and beneficial biomolecules 3 . Of these, the therapeutic effects of exosomes of paracrine factors have recently attracted significant interest in regenerative medicine because exosomes are much easier to handle than cells 4 . Recently, the major mechanism of stem cell therapy has been attributed to exosome-based paracrine effects rather than cell differentiation or replacement through migration and homing 5,6 . Exosomes have a variety of merits, including no tumorigenicity, low immune reactions, and fewer ethical issues 7 . More importantly, exosomes are safe agents for clinical trials as they are cell-based cell-free agents and do not induce side effects 8 . Exosomes are nano-sized (40-120 nm) membrane-bound extracellular vesicles that originate from the endocytic pathway of eukaryotic cells. Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by transferring biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and other non-coding RNAs 9 . Recently, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes have been extensively studied and shown to contribute to clinical application 10 . A variety of studies have shown that exosomes are effective in attenuating injury, improving neurological recovery, and facilitating wound regeneration [11] [12] [13] .",

These processes involve complex and specific interactions between diverse cell types, cytokines, mediators, and cell signaling 16 . Exosomes have been shown to inhibit excessive immune responses through various mechanisms, including the regulation of immune cells such as macrophages and T cells, indicating that exosomes have potential as therapeutic agents for inflammatory modulation 17,18 . Additionally, MSC-based cell therapies have been increasingly used to improve angiogenesis 19 . Recent studies have indicated that MSCs promote angiogenesis through exosomes 20 . For example, the transplantation of exosomes enhanced bone repair by improving angiogenesis in a rat model 21 . Our previous studies showed that human adipose tissue (AdMSC)-derived exosomes inhibit inflammation by promoting M2 macrophages and delivering miRNAs 22,23 . AdMSC-exosomes also enhanced wound healing by attenuating pro-inflammatory responses 24 . Understanding how AdMSC-exosomes communicate with target cells in their surrounding microenvironment is OPEN a major issue for diseases involving inflammation and angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic effects of AdMSC-exosomes using THP-1 cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We performed experiments to examine the modulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors by AdMSC-exosomes. ROCK1 (Rho associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1), which mediates immune cells, functions as a suppressor of inflammation by regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) 25 . PTEN also suppresses inflammation via the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway Subsequently, the expression of ROCK1 and PTEN by AdMSCexosomes in inflammation-stimulated environments was assessed. We also identified specific exosomal miRNAs that improve HUVEC function, including proliferation activity and tube formation.",

Induced cells were strongly differentiated into osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes as stained with von Kossa, safranin O, and oil red O, respectively (Fig. 1b) . To further confirm whether cultured cells were MSCs, a flow cytometry assay was used for the analysis of surface proteins.

These data indicate that interactions between reduced anti-angiogenic genes (vasohibin-1(VASH1), thrombosopondin-1(THBS1)) and enhanced miRNAs (miR-132, miR-146a) act as key factors in angiogenesis.

The results showed that tube formation by exosome-treated HUVECs was significantly enhanced, as shown in Fig. 4e . Taken together, our results show that AdMSC-derived exosomes promote angiogenesis of HUVECs by upregulating pro-angiogenic genes and downregulating anti-angiogenic genes.",

Next, the expression levels of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic genes were measured using real-time qPCR. Overall, the results showed that angiopoietin1(ANGPT1) and flk1(KDR) expression of pro-angiogenic genes were increased in the exosomes and inhibitor groups regardless of inhibitors (Fig. 5b) .

Importantly, the use of these vesicles can be free from many potential risks, such as immune rejection and tumor formation 30 . In this study, we evaluated the roles of AdMSC-derived exosomes and their potential to improve inflammation and angiogenesis. In particular, the underlying mechanisms were investigated, including signaling pathways and candidate miRNAs between exosomes and target cells. Liu et al. previously reported that the anti-inflammatory effects of MSC-derived exosomes were mediated by upregulating PTEN 31 . ROCK1, which functions as an inhibitor of inflammation, plays a critical role in the regulation of PTEN activation 32 . Thus, we aimed to elucidate the crosstalk between ROCK1 and PTEN by exosomes in an inflammation-induced environment. Our results revealed that AdMSC-derived exosomes suppressed LPS-induced inflammation via the ROCK1 and PTEN pathways. Moreover, we validated the exosomal effects on inflammatory responses using ROCK1 or PTEN inhibitors.",

Tissue regeneration is affected by fibroblasts, immune cells, MSCs, and endothelial cells, which upregulate pro-angiogenic factors to induce angiogenesis and inhibit inflammation 34 . Therefore, we investigated whether AdMSCderived exosomes enhance the proliferation and tube formation of HUVECs in vitro, which are significant for vascularization. Our results showed that AdMSC-derived exosomes markedly enhanced proliferation and tube formation in terms of angiogenesis in HUVECs. These results support that AdMSC-derived exosomes are an attractive therapeutic tool for promoting angiogenesis and wound repair. We next examined the mechanism responsible for the pro-angiogenic ability of AdMSC-derived exosomes in exosome-treated HUVECs. Generally, miRNAs function as negative regulators of gene expression. Specific miRNAs differentially regulate pro-or anti-angiogenic activities depending on cell or tissue types 35 . For example, miR-132 and miR-146a are known to be angiogenic enhancers 28, 36 : miR-132 induces angiogenesis and miR-146a promotes angiogenesis by enhancing the functionality of endothelial progenitor cells in mice 27, 37 . However, the functions of miR-132 and miR-146a in angiogenesis-related genes in HUVECs remain unclear. In this study, miR-132 and miR-146a were highly expressed in exosome-treated HUVECs. Subsequently, we confirmed that miR-132 and miR-146a bind thrombospondin-1(THBS1) and vasohibin-1(VASH1) of anti-angiogenic genes, respectively. To explore the effect of miR-132 and miR-146a on angiogenesis in more detail, we investigated the expression of angiogenesis-related genes using miR-132 and miR-146a inhibitors. We found that the expression of anti-angiogenic genes was remarkably reduced with exosome incubation, while that of the genes was reversed by miR-132 and miR-146a inhibitors. The inhibition of miR-132 and miR-146a leads to poor angiogenic ability of HUVECs. Based on our findings, we suggest that miR-132 and miR-146a are the principal players in the effects of AdMSC-derived exosomes on angiogenic activity, and exert their effect by inhibiting anti-angiogenic genes.",

However, other signaling regulators may also be associated with the ROCK1/ PTEN process by exosomes, and it is necessary to examine how other inflammatory signaling pathways regulate the immune response in depth. Many studies have shown that multiple miRNAs are involved in angiogenesis 38 . In this study, we predicted that specific miRNAs might modulate the angiogenesis of HUVECs by AdMSCderived exosomes. Indeed, we found that inhibition of miR-132 and miR-146a in HUVECs diminished their pro-angiogenic activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the regulation of anti-angiogenic genes by miR-132 and miR-146a transferred from AdMSC-derived exosomes.

In summary, we described a new finding of exosomal effects as immunosuppressant and angiogenic inducers as shown in Fig. 6 . Moreover, our results provide novel insights into the communication between target cells and AdMSC-derived exosomes. Therapy using exosomes could be a safer and more efficient cell-free therapy for promoting anti-inflammation and angiogenesis, which will provide a theoretical and experimental basis for new stem cell-based therapies to treat immune and vasculogenesis-related diseases. Recently, several studies have shown that physical or chemical pretreatment can increase exosomal effects 31, 39 . Future studies should determine if we can enhance the function of exosomes with small molecule compounds, and if the improved exosomes efficiently function in animal models. ",

The culture medium was exchanged every 3 or 4 days until the cells reached approximately 90% confluence. Before reaching 100% confluence, the cells were sub-cultured at a 1:3 or 1:4 ratios for cell expansion and further experiments. To obtain exosomes derived from AdMSCs, AdMSCs were cultured in DMEM containing 5% exosome-depleted FBS (Invitrogen). In this study, AdMSCs from 3 donors (33-, 26-and 29-year-old females) were used.",

The medium was changed every 3 or 4 days, and 10 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b23 (Lonza) was added to the cells for chondrogenesis. To confirm differentiation capacity, the differentiated cells were stained with von Kossa for osteogenesis, Oil Red O for adipogenesis, and Safranin-O for chondrogenesis. Images of the stained cells were obtained using an inverted phase microscope (Olympus-IX71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Isolation and characterization of exosomes from AdMSCs. Exosomes were isolated from the AdMSC supernatant using an exosome isolation kit (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the culture medium was harvested and centrifuged at 1500 \u00d7 g for 5 min to remove cell debris. Then, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh conical tube, and the ExoQuick-TC reagent was mixed with the supernatant (1:5 ratio). After inverting four times, the mixture was incubated overnight at 5 \u00b0C. The next day, the mixture was centrifuged at 1500\u00d7g for 30 min, and the supernatant was removed. The isolated exosomes were resuspended in PBS (Invitrogen). The exosomes were quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Invitrogen), followed by stored at -80 \u2103. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1011, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was used to observe the morphology of the exosomes. To examine the size distribution, Table S1 .
