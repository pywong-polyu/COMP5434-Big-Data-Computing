However, fine-grained spatiotemporal analysis of these policies' effectiveness is lacking. This paper collected the hourly meteorological and PM 2.5 data for three typical emission scenarios in Hubei, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Then, this study simulated the PM 2.5 concentration under the same meteorological conditions and different emission scenarios based on a reliable hourly spatiotemporal random forest model (R 2 exceeded 0.84). Finally, we investigated the fine-grained spatiotemporal impact of restricting factories, vehicles, and fireworks on PM 2.5 concentrations from the perspective of hours, days, regions, and land uses, excluding meteorological interference. On average, restricting factories and vehicles reduced the PM 2..07 \u00b5g/m 3 , respectively. Spatially, it had the highest and quickest impact on Hubei, with a 27.05 \u00b5g/m 3 decrease of PM 2.5 concentration and 17 day lag to begin to show significant decline. This was followed by YRD, which experienced a 23.52 \u00b5g/m 3 decrease on average and a 23 day lag. BTH was the least susceptible; the PM 2.5 concentration decreased by only 8.2 \u00b5g/m 3 . In addition, influenced by intensive human activities, the cultivated, urban, and rural lands experienced a larger decrease in PM 2.5 concentration. These empirical results revealed that restricting factories, vehicles, and fireworks is effective in alleviating air pollution and the effect showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The policymakers should further investigate influential factors of hourly PM 2.5 concentrations, combining with local geographical and social environment, and implement more effective and targeted policies to improve local air quality, especially for BTH and the air quality at morning and night.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Air pollution is a great challenge to human health worldwide.

Besides the physical damage, epidemiological and toxicological studies report that PM 2.5 pollution is associated with depression and anxiety symptoms [4, 5] and the oxidative stress and inflammation induced by PM 2.5 may cause brain injury [6, 7] .

Based on their research method, they can be divided into two categories-namely, the multivariate receptor and models and econometric analysis models [8] . The multivariate receptor models analyze the components of PM 2.5 from the perspective of chemistry and physics to identify its source. For instance, Wang et al. collected meteorological data and compositional data of PM 2.5 in a monitoring station located in Shanghai over a month [9] . The emission sources of PM 2.5 were identified using the positive matrix factorization method, including secondary nitrate, secondary sulfate, vehicular/industrial emissions, and coal combustion. Yu et al. recorded the hourly concentrations of 18 elements of PM 2.5 at an urban site of Nanjing during 2017 [10] . They found that some specific element's concentrations would increase when the traffic activities, fireworks, and sandstorm events occurred. Similar studies were conducted in Beijing, Guangzhou, and other major cities in China [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . These studies demonstrated that air pollution in China is one of the highest in the world. The possible sources consist of coal combustion, soil dust, traffic emissions, secondary inorganic aerosols, and emissions from industrial processes and wood combustion. Feng et al. and Wang et al. conducted PM 2.5 concentration monitoring experiments during the Spring Festival in Xinxiang and Xiamen, respectively [16, 17] . The chemical analysis results indicated that the burning of fireworks during the festival worsens air quality in a short period. This was also confirmed in the United States. Seidel et al. collected the systematic observations of 315 monitoring stations across the United States over multiple years and the results showed that during the Independence Day holiday, the hourly PM 2.5 concentration of one site adjacent to fireworks climbed to~500 \u00b5g/m 3 [18] . Although the multivariate receptor methods contribute much to the identification of the correlation between factories, vehicles, and fireworks with PM 2.5 , most of these studies were conducted in a local region with very limited monitoring equipment.

Xu et al. and Huang et al. collected statistical panel data of China over 10 years and used the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model to explore the driving factors of PM 2.5 [19, 20] . Cheng et al. and Luo et al. improved the spatial scale to the civic level and obtained many details of the driving forces [8, 21] . Aside from the STIRPAT model, other economic methods were also adopted to explore the driving forces. Ma et al. analyzed the driving factors of fog and haze in 152 cities in China using the spatial autoregressive model [22] . Wu et al. collected data from 74 cities with PM 2.5 monitoring stations in 2013 and 2014 and explored the determinants of PM 2.5 using the random effect model [23] . These studies demonstrated that on an economic development level, urbanization level, coal consumption, motor vehicles, and population size are key influencing factors of PM 2.5 . Wang et al. used a spatial panel Dubin model to investigate the relationship between PM 2.5 and six socioeconomic factors during 2015~2017 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) [24] . It was found that the urbanization rate has a negative effect on PM 2.5 , which may be due to the stricter environmental regulations than before. All of these studies demonstrated the urgency and importance in implementing emission control measures and evaluating their effectiveness. Although Zhang et al. and Ding et al. have confirmed the impact of the active clean air policies during 2013-2017 on reducing PM 2.5 , the spatiotemporal resolution in these studies were low, meaning the fine-grained spatiotemporal impact was not investigated [25, 26] . However, with different land uses, the PM 2.5 pollution level and socioeconomic condition varied; such variation leads to differences in the impact of human factors with changing land-use trends [27] . Since PM 2.5 concentration varies over the course of the whole day, the effect of restricting industries and traffic may also vary with different hours. In addition, whether the restriction of factories and vehicles can take effect on improving air quality immediately or whether this requires some time to show a significant effect is also valuable to investigate.

To fully recognize the spatiotemporal impact of the restriction of factories and motor vehicles on PM 2.5 , the meteorological interference must be eliminated. Therefore, studies on the modeled PM 2.5 pollution level under the same meteorological conditions but different emission conditions, such as open or total closure of factories and commuting, are required. First, the scenario of closing factories and vehicles, which is ordinarily impossible to realize, needs to be created. The opportunity to do this presented itself in late December 2019, when an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread across China [28] . Considering its strong infectious ability, Chinese provinces and regions carried out a level 1 response to major public health emergencies, which required people to stop attending school and going to work. Moreover, the factories were closed [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . These extreme response measures provided the emission scenario of factories being shut down and a reduction in travel. The remaining problem is how to retrieve the PM 2.5 concentration under the same meteorological condition but different emission scenarios. The widely used retrieval models include chemistry transport models (CTM), air pollution dispersion models, and statistical models. CTM retrieve PM 2.5 based on the transport mechanism and physical as well as chemistry reactions of air pollutants [35, 36] . Dispersion models, such as the Gaussian dispersion model and Lagrangian dispersion model, simulate the surface air quality according to the estimation of the impact of the point, line, volume, and area emission sources [37, 38] . For the purpose of comparing the impact of different emission scenarios on air pollution, both CTM and dispersion models require the corresponding meteorological data and concrete emission inventory of different time periods. However, due to the complex composition of emission sources, rapid technological update, and difficulty in obtaining relevant information, accurate and up-to-date emission inventory is difficult to collect. The most widely used emission inventory for China is the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory of China (MEIC, http://www.meicmodel.org/) and its newest version is 2015. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain the emission inventory under different time periods, meaning the CTM and dispersion models cannot be applied for retrieving air pollution under different emission scenarios. Therefore, this paper adopted the random forest (RF) model, which is a widely used statistical model in PM 2.5 retrieval studies with high accuracy, to simulate the PM 2.5 concentration under the same meteorological conditions but different emission scenarios [39] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 107, "end": 111, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 772, "end": 776, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1025, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1030, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1035, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1040, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1041, "end": 1045, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1050, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1055, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1568, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1572, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1794, "end": 1798, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1799, "end": 1802, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2877, "end": 2881, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The aim of this paper is to investigate the fine-grained spatiotemporal effect of the restrictions of factories, vehicles, and fireworks on air pollution. Hubei province, which is the worst hit province by COVID-19, together with the heavily contaminated region, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region were chosen as the study areas. The PM 2.5 concentration and meteorological data for three time periods were collected as follows: the COVID-19 isolation period (time period 1: 21 January 2020-20 February 2020), the previous month before the isolation (time period 2: 21 December 2019-20 January 2020), and the same period in the lunar calendar of last year (time period 3: 1 February 2019-3 March 2020). The three time periods represent three typical emission scenarios, namely, shutting down factories and vehicles (SD), normal commute (NC), and normal spring festival (NSF). The severe air pollution is not only a natural phenomenon, but also a man-made contamination caused by long-term unhealthy economic activities [22, 40, 41] . Thus, the influence of weather must be eliminated when studying the impact of emission control measures. This paper used the meteorological data and PM 2.5 concentration data during NSF and NC periods to develop two separate spatiotemporal random forest (STRF) models to simulate the correlation between meteorological factors and PM 2.5 concentration under the specific emission scenarios of the corresponding periods. Then, the meteorological data of the SD period was inputted in two STRF models to obtain the simulated PM 2.5 concentration under the weather condition of SD together with emission scenarios of NSF and NC. By comparing the measured PM 2.5 concentrations during SD with the simulated PM 2.5 concentration under NSF and NC emission scenarios, we determined the pollution difference brought by the change of emission scenarios and the impact of emission control measures, including shutting down factories and vehicles.

In addition, the \"Obs.\" column in Table 3 also shows the average PM 2.5 concentration of different regions and hours during the NSF and NC period. From the view of variations within a day, the PM 2.5 concentrations at 08:00 and 14:00 were lower than that at 02:00 and 20:00, which indicates that the air quality in the daytime was better than at night. The STRF models at 14:00 were the most accurate among the four hour models, with the highest R 2 of the whole study area reaching 0.88 and 0.89 for NSF and NC, respectively. The performance of the models at three other hours were similar, with the RMSE of the whole study area being around 20 and 19 \u00b5g/m 3 and MAE being around 13 and 12 \u00b5g/m 3 for NSF and NC, respectively. From the perspective of regions, air pollution was the most severe in BTH, followed by Hubei, and the air quality in YRD was the best. At the same time, the RMSE and MAE were larger in BTH than YRD and Hubei, which is due to the fact that more severe air pollution usually implies more complex emission sources and naturally, the PM 2.5 concentration was more difficult to make accurate predictions. Notably, for all models under different times and scenarios, the R 2 of the whole study area exceeded 0.84, indicating that the developed STRF models could explain over 84% of the PM 2.5 concentration variation. The high prediction accuracy of STRF models constructed a solid foundation for using the retrieval results of STRF models to serve as the simulated air pollution level under the meteorological conditions of SD and emission conditions of NC or NSF.

(a) From the perspective of the temporal analysis, Table 4 shows that compared with the NSF period, the emission control measures during the SD period reduced the concentrations of PM 2.5 by 18.57, 16.22, 25.00, and 19 .07 \u00b5g/m 3 at 02:00, 08:00, 14:00, and 20:00, respectively. The impact was largest at 14:00 and 20:00, followed by 02:00 and 08:00. The decrease in 08:00 was mainly due to the reduction of traffic flow during morning rush-hour, which has been confirmed to be an important contributor of the pollution at this time [10] . However, the restriction of factories and vehicles caused a larger decrease of PM 2.5 concentration at 14:00 and 20:00. This is owed much to the great reduction of human activities during the daytime. Zhou et al. found that human activities are complicated, including all kinds of industry, shopping, restaurant, entertainment, etc. These have led to industrial agglomeration and further generated various exhaust emissions and even cumulative emission, resulting in a greater impact on the concentration of pollution in the afternoon and at night [49] . Thus, during the SD period when human daytime outside activities were reduced, the PM 2.5 concentration of 14:00 and 20:00 declined significantly, especially for 14:00 when normally there are many human activities. Wang et al. also found that the factor of vehicular/industrial emissions contributed more in nighttime than in daytime and there was a peak in morning rush-hour. These are consistent with the results of this study. However, their results showed that the contribution of vehicular/industrial emissions was the least at around 14:00, which is contrary to the conclusion of this paper. This may be due to the fact that the data used in the study of Wang et al. were collected from the single urban monitoring station surrounded by commercial properties and residential dwellings, while this study considered more stations under various backgrounds, such as industrial and rural environments. Nevertheless, the obvious diurnal variation trend observed both in this paper and the study of Wang et al. illustrates that the influential factors of air pollution change with hours and the impact degree of each socioeconomic factor on air pollution is also varying. Thus, hourly analysis of the major components and sources are necessary to further alleviate air pollution. (b) From the perspective of spatial analysis, previous studies have shown that elevation and land use are vital influencing factors of PM 2.5 [50, 51] . In this paper, Table 4 and Figure 4 show a high correlation between the terrain characteristics, land uses, PM 2.5 pollution levels, and the spatial effects of shutting down factories and vehicles. In general, the low-lying areas (including Southeast BTH, Northern YRD, and Middle Hubei) are occupied with cultivated, urban, and rural land. In these areas, the air pollution was more severe and PM sd \u2212P M sd|ns f as well as ((PM sd \u2212P M sd|ns f )/P M sd|ns f \u00d7 100) were smaller. The severe air pollution in these areas was highly correlated with rapid economic development. Therefore, restricting factories and vehicles during SD effectively reduced the emission of air pollutants and thus had a great effect on the alleviation of air pollution. In contrast, the high-lying areas (including Northwest BTH, Southern YRD, and the west and east sides of Hubei) have grasslands and forest, inducing better air quality and larger PM sd \u2212P M sd|ns f and ((PM sd \u2212P M sd|ns f )/P M sd|ns f \u00d7 100), indicating that shutting down factories and vehicles during SD did not greatly affect these areas. This is consistent with the conclusions in the studies of Wang et al. and Lin et al., which illustrated that the increasing population and rapid urban expansion had an adverse impact on air quality [50, 51] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 305, "end": 332, "text": "18.57, 16.22, 25.00, and 19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 647, "end": 651, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1202, "end": 1206, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2631, "end": 2635, "text": "[50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2636, "end": 2639, "text": "51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3932, "end": 3936, "text": "[50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3937, "end": 3940, "text": "51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 172, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}, {"start": 2657, "end": 2664, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}, {"start": 2669, "end": 2677, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The spatial and temporal effects of shutting down factories and vehicles are complex and interweaving. First, the PM sd \u2212P M sd|ns f results in Table 4 show that the restriction of factories and vehicles during SD led to a decline of PM 2.5 concentration by 8.20, 23.52, and 27.05 \u00b5g/m 3 for BTH, YRD, and Hubei, respectively. All hourly results of PM sd \u2212P M sd|ns f in YRD and Hubei exceeded the MAE range, indicating that shutting down factories and vehicles during SD led to a significant decline in PM 2.5 concentration. The results indicate that the restriction of factories and vehicles during SD was generally effective in declining the PM 2.5 in BTH, YRD, and Hubei. However, the effect showed significant spatial heterogeneity across different regions. The PM 2.5 concentrations of Hubei declined more than that of YRD. This is in agreement with the trend illustrated in the study of Xu et al. that the impacts of private cars on PM 2.5 emissions decrease continuously from east to west [41] . However, the air pollution in BTH was more severe and PM sd \u2212P M sd|ns f was the largest. This may be explained by other important emission sources and unfavorable weather conditions. (1) Coal combustion is an important emission source of PM 2.5 in BTH. Andersson et al. and Zhou et al. have proved that the contribution of vehicle emissions was lower in BTH than southern cities; in contrast, coal combustion occupied a higher proportion of PM 2.5 in BTH [52, 53] . This is not surprising as coal combustion is commonly used for residential heating in BTH during winter, while there is no central heating for southern cities such as YRD and Hubei. Zhang et al. also proved that the residential sector is a notable contributor to PM 2.5 in northern China during heating season [25] . The residuals of coal combustion contribute a lot to the formation of PM 2.5 of BTH, meaning the effect of shutting down factories and vehicles was smaller in BTH than YRD and Hubei. (2) The synoptic patterns and meteorological elements are also vital inducements of the formation of severe haze in BTH. Compared with Hubei and YRD, with relatively flat terrain, BTH is high in the northwest and low in the southeast, inducing evident mountain-valley breeze circulation. Bei et al. have studied the impact of local circulation on air pollution [54] [55] [56] . During the daytime, the valley breeze (southerly or easterly wind) increases and the pollutants are transported from urban to mountain areas. At night, Beijing is affected by westerly wind down from Taihang Mountains and northerly wind down from Yanshan Mountains (mountain breeze), and pollutants are delivered back to urban areas. The mountain-valley breeze circulation facilitates the accumulation of pollutants, meaning the pollution level of BTH is affected by the total pollutant emissions that have accumulated over a long period of time, so shutting down factories and vehicles did not bring a significant decrease for the PM 2.5 of BTH.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 997, "end": 1001, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1464, "text": "[52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1468, "text": "53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1781, "end": 1785, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2332, "end": 2336, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2341, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2342, "end": 2346, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 151, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Second, according to the studies of Zhang et al. and Ding et al., which compared the air pollution between 2013 and 2017 in a coarse temporal resolution, the emission control policies significantly contributed to the declining of PM 2.5 concentrations and PM 2.5 -mortality during this period [25, 26] . This paper proved the effect of the emission control measures and further supplemented more detailed analysis of the daily variations of the effect. We found that there was a delay for the restriction of factories and vehicles in declining PM 2.5 concentrations. Figure 3 shows that the delay in shutting down factories and vehicles had a significant effect on the improvement of air quality during SD, and the delay time varied among different regions. For YRD, it took 23 days to observe the measured PM 2.5 concentration (PM sd ) as significantly less thanP M sd|ns f andP M sd|nc ; for Hubei, it took 17 days. Many studies have confirmed that a large part of PM 2.5 is formed by the anthropogenic emissions, and the meteorological condition, especially wind, plays an important role in the transport and dispersion of the air pollutant [57] . Considering that the discharge of pollutants greatly exceeds the environmental capacity, the daily pollutants cannot be purified in time. Therefore, PM 2.5 concentration is not only affected by the air pollutant emission amount of the current day (denoted as E(t)), but is also correlated with the cumulative emission amount during a previous period (denoted as d i=0 E(t \u2212 i)). After closing the factories and vehicles, the daily emissions E(t) were reduced a lot, however influenced by the air pollutants discharged in the preceding period and emissions from other sources, the cumulative emissions d i=0 E(t \u2212 i) were not reduced much in ratio. Thus, PM 2.5 concentration did not show an immediate great decrease. Obviously, the decline ratio of d i=0 E(t \u2212 i) is negatively correlated with d and as the number of days that factories and vehicles are closed increases, d i=0 E(t \u2212 i) decreases much more and the impact of closing factories and vehicles gradually increases. Hence, the phenomenon that there was a delay time in PM 2.5 to show a great decrease is shown in Figure 3 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 293, "end": 297, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 298, "end": 301, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1148, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 567, "end": 575, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 2225, "end": 2233, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The reason why the delay time is different in Hubei and YRD can be analyzed from three aspects. (1) The pollution situation is complex and different for Hubei and YRD. For one month before the outbreak of COVID-19, that is, the NC period, the average PM 2.5 concentration of Hubei was 75.83 \u00b5g/m 3 , which was higher than that of YRD (60.57 \u00b5g/m 3 ). This implies that the emission of pollutants in Hubei may be higher than that in YRD. According to the relative decline proportion shown in Figure 4b , the average decline proportion of PM 2.5 concentration in Hubei and the YRD region was 31.88% and 25.31%, respectively. This implies that the air pollution in Hubei was more serious than that in YRD and the contribution of vehicle and factory emissions to local pollution was higher. Therefore, the influence of the closure of factories and vehicles during SD was higher in Hubei and the delay time was shorter. (2) From the view of the topographic and climatic conditions, the natural conditions are different for Hubei and YRD region. A previous study has shown that wind is a key influencing factor of PM 2.5 as low wind speeds suppressed the removal of PM 2.5 and high frequency of wind of a proper direction can lead to low PM 2.5 concentration [25] . Figure 5 shows the distribution of wind speed and wind direction of Hubei and YRD during the SD period. The dominant wind direction in Hubei was the north wind, while the dominant wind direction in YRD was the northeast and northwest wind. It is worth noting that Hubei province is larger in the east-west span than the north-south span and there is no significant change of DEM in the north-south direction. However, the YRD region is longer in the north-south direction than the east-west direction and DEM shows a higher tendency from north to south. Under the dominant northwest and northeast wind, such terrain conditions of YRD mean that the timely spread outside of the air pollutant is difficult. Therefore, the PM 2.5 concentration of YRD is influenced by the cumulative emissions for a longer time (i.e., d is longer for YRD), hence d i=0 E(t \u2212 i) decreased more slowly. This is one of the reasons why the delay time of the YRD region was longer than that in the Hubei region. (3) The restriction degree of factories and vehicles was different. Hubei is the worst hit region by COVID-19 and the number and proportion of infectious cases in Hubei province, especially in Wuhan city, are significantly higher than those in other regions. According to the reports from provincial and municipal health commissions, by the end of 19:00, 7 February 2020, the cumulative number of infections in Hubei was 22,112, while the highest in the rest of the country was in Guangdong, with 1034 cases having been reported. The severe epidemic situation induced the Hubei government to adopt the strictest policies to restrict people going out and factories opening. Under this background, the public's sense of spontaneous home isolation is even stronger. All of these objective measures and subjective consciousness made human activities in Hubei decline to the greatest extent and the emission of air pollutants declined much more. Thus, the time it took for shutting down factories and vehicles to significantly affect the amount of air pollutants was shorter. The fireworks aggravated air pollution and the impact showed spatiotemporal heterogeneity. By collecting the PM2.5 concentration samples from specific sites before and after the Spring Festival and analyzing their chemical characteristics, Wang et al. and Feng et al. found that during the Spring Festival, the concentrations of K + , Mg 2+ , and Al resulting from firework displays increased significantly [16, 17] . However, limited by the spatial range of few monitoring stations, these studies could not analyze the spatial heterogeneity of the effect of fireworks. This paper analyzed the effect of fireworks on a larger spatial scale. According to the comparison of \u2212 | and \u2212 | in Table 4 , the fireworks improved the PM2.5 concentration by 10.94, 6.03, and 11.46 \u03bcg/m on average for BTH, YRD, and Hubei, respectively.

(2) The air quality is not only affected by the emissions of current day, but is also influenced by the cumulative emissions discharged in the previous period. Therefore, there was a delay in the time it took for the restriction of factories and vehicles to have a significant effect on improving air quality and the delay time for Hubei and YRD were 17 and 23 days, respectively. (3) The effect of restricting factories and vehicles shows obvious regional differences. Due to the discrepancies in the composition of PM 2.5 , the contribution ratio of industrial and vehicular emissions, and the geographic conditions, BTH, YRD, and Hubei experienced a 8.20, 23.52, and 27.05 \u00b5g/m 3 decrease of PM 2.5 concentration, respectively. On average, the air quality of Hubei was improved the most significantly and the fastest, followed by YRD. The air quality of BTH was improved the slightest because of the emissions from coal combustion and unfavorable meteorological conditions for air pollutants to be spread.

Similarly, the effect of the restriction of other emission sources, such as cooking and coal combustion, may also have hourly heterogeneity.

The strict restriction of factories and vehicles did not alleviate the air pollution immediately; instead, the air quality did not show significant improvement until several days later. Therefore, when there is a heavy haze, the government cannot expect the temporary restriction of industries and cars to make a great difference on the air quality in a short time. In contrast, the restriction of factories and vehicles must be insisted on for a long time to obtain a significant effect of improving air quality, including developing technologies of cleaning up exhaust gas from vehicles and factories and promoting the emission standards. Moreover, when there are adverse meteorological conditions, such as steady wind and temperature inversion, and heavy air pollution is induced, some short-acting measures need to be combined, such as using artificial precipitation to accelerate the sedimentation of pollutant.

(a) For 02:00, 08:00, 14:00, and 20:00, restricting factories and vehicles during SD caused PM 2.5 to decrease by18.57, 16.22, 25.00, and 19.07 \u00b5g/m 3 , respectively, on average. The effect was the least for BTH and the largest for YRD and Hubei at 14:00. Especially for Hubei province, the restriction of factories and vehicles during SD induced the PM 2.5 concentration at 14:00 to show a decrease of 36.28 \u00b5g/m 3 . (b) From the perspective of regions, restricting factories and vehicles decreased the PM 2.5 concentration by 8.20, 23.52, and 27.05 \u00b5g/m 3 for BTH, YRD, and Hubei, respectively, on average. The smallest PM sd \u2212P M sd|ns f were found in BTH and all values were within the MAE range. This finding illustrated that in BTH, the closure of factories and vehicles during SD did not significantly affect the improvement of air quality. On the contrary, all of the values of PM sd \u2212P M sd|ns f , in YRD and Hubei, they exceeded the MAE range according to the STRF model, indicating that the effect of shutting down factories and vehicles during SD was significant. (c) By comparing mean PM sd \u2212P M sd|nc with PM sd \u2212P M sd|ns f , it was found that the set off of fireworks increased PM 2.5 by 10.94, 6.03, and 11.46 \u00b5g/m 3 for BTH, YRD, and Hubei, respectively, on average.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "exhibits the temporal trend of the observed or predicted PM 2.5 concentration in the SD period under different emission scenarios. The black lines represent the observed PM 2.5 values (PM sd ) and the red and blue lines represent the predicted PM 2.5 values under NC and NSF (denoted byP M sd|nc andP M sd|ns f ), respectively. (a) The temporal trend of observed PM 2.5 concentration varied in different regions. For the BTH region, two peaks occurred around 26 January and 12 February, reaching almost 200 \u00b5g/m 3 . In contrast, the observed PM 2.5 concentrations PM sd gradually decreased until less than 50 \u00b5g/m 3 for YRD and Hubei, without any large peaks. (b) The difference between PM sd withP M sd|nc andP M sd|ns f differs in three regions. For BTH, in the days around two peaks, PM sd exceededP M sd|nc andP M sd|ns f ; the two accidental peaks were the main reason for the smaller mean PM sd \u2212P M sd|nc and PM sd \u2212P M sd|ns f results for BTH inTable 4. For YRD and Hubei,P M sd|nc and PM sd|ns f in YRD and BTH fluctuated at around 70 \u00b5g/m 3 on the whole, indicating that under the meteorological condition of the SD period, PM 2.5 concentrations were expected to be around 70 \u00b5g/m 3 under the emission scenarios of NC and NSF. Combined with the decreasing trend of observed PM 2.5 , it could be concluded that restricting factories and vehicles during SD gradually affected the air pollution level and reduced PM 2.5 concentration. The turning point was the time when PM sd started to show significantly lower values compared withP M sd|nc andP M sd|ns f . This was the time when the closure of factories and vehicles started to essentially decrease the air pollution level. The turning points for YRD and Hubei were different. For the YRD region, from 13 February, most PM sd were lower thanP M sd|nc andP M sd|ns f . For the Hubei region, the turning point was on 7 February.

The severe epidemic situation induced the Hubei government to adopt the strictest policies to restrict people going out and factories opening. Under this background, the public's sense of spontaneous home isolation is even stronger. All of these objective measures and subjective consciousness made human activities in Hubei decline to the greatest extent and the emission of air pollutants declined much more. Thus, the time it took for shutting down factories and vehicles to significantly affect the amount of air pollutants was shorter.
