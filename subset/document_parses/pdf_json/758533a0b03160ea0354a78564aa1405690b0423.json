            "text": "Seneca Valley virus (SVV), previously named Senecavirus A (SVA), is the only member of the Senecavirus genus in the Picornaviridae family. A typical SVV genome structure is L-VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1-2A-2B-2C-3A-3B-3C-3D. Both the 5 \u2032 and 3 \u2032 ends are untranslated regions (UTRs) (1) . Pigs infected with SVV primarily present with vesicular rash on the nose and coronary band vesicles (2) . In severe cases, limping and death occur due to acute myocarditis, heart degeneration, transient fever, and neurological pathology (3) . Although SVV was detected in samples as early as 1988 (4), it did not cause any obvious clinical symptoms in pigs before 2008. Sporadic outbreaks of obviously pathogenic SVV occurred between 2008 and 2014. Since 2015, large-scale outbreaks have appeared in the United States, Canada, Brazil, China, Thailand, and Vietnam (2) (3) (4) (5) . SVV has been detected in mice, houseflies, environmental equipment, and corridors in pig farms and was successfully isolated from mouse tissue samples (6) . However, there are no reports of SVV in buffalo. In this study, one SVV strain was first isolated from a buffalo farm in Guangdong, China. The virus was successfully cultured in BHK-21 and NA cells (mouseorigin), PK-15 and ST cells (pig-origin), Vero and Marc-145 cells (monkey-origin), and MDBK cells (bovine-origin). In addition, the viral genome was sequenced and characterized.",

Then, the harvested virus solution was identified by RT-PCR and subcultured. SVV was then purified by the virus plaque assay (8) . The appropriate plaques were collected and diluted with an appropriate amount of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Gibco TM ). Plaques identified as positive by RT-PCR were inoculated into PK-15 cells and BHK-21 cells, and then passaged and recorded.",

The typical cytopathic effect (CPE), including rounding of cells, refraction, cell death, shedding, and floating, were observed on BHK-21, PK-15, ST, and Vero cells after 36 h, but there was no CPE on another four cells until 96 h (Figure 1) . These phenomena indicated that rats, cattle, and monkeys might also be the host of SVV (8), but not dogs. According to previous studies, SVV is pathogenic and causes clinical symptoms in pigs, but it is unclear whether SVV infection could result in visible clinical symptoms in cattle (12) . Whether the species supporting replication of SVV in their related cell lines are competent hosts for the virus still needs further confirmation. More studies on related primary cell lines need to be done, such as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), avian influenza virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (13) (14) (15) .",

To date, the majority of studies on the genetic relationship analysis of SVV were based on its nucleotide sequence (17) (18) (19) , while some studies were based on amino acid sequence (20) or on the nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence simultaneously (21) . Because this is the first time to report SVV in buffalo, it is particularly important to investigate and analyze the origin and variation of the virus strain in detail. Therefore, we used both nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence data of SVV for genetic evolution analysis. Our results showed that the constructed genetic evolutionary tree based on the nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence of the virus showed a completely consistent trend: SVA/GD/China/2018 is located in the same branch as Sichuan HS-01 from Sichuan, China, indicating that the potential buffalo-derived strain originated from swine. However, the distance between Guangdong and Sichuan is more than 2,000 km long; therefore, further analysis and investigation about how it was transmitted are required.",

In contrast to other porcine strains, they have only one or two mutations. This finding reveals that the virus may have undergone adaptive changes in different hosts (20) ; however, further investigation is required to elucidate the role of these two residues. VP1 contains a hypervariable region with at least two antigenic sites located at both amino acid 140-160 and amino acid 200-213 sites (22) . It has been reported that 228K in VP1, 141-143LDV, and 143-148DGK in VP2 are the primary antigenic sites of FMDV (23) . None of these three motifs and antigenic sites of the SVA/GD/China/2018 strain have changed, indicating similar antigenicity and biological characteristics of this strain compared to others (24) .
