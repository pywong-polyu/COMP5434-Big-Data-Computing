While 65.7% of participants thought their institutions were adequately prepared, lack of testing for SARS-CoV-2, and scarcity of personal protective equipment were still a matter of concern for most of them. Overall surgical activity dropped by 68% (cranial by 54%, spine by 71%), and even emergencies decreased by 35%. COVID-19 prompted changes in communication in 74% of departments, 44% increased telemedicine by >50%.

The EANS Individual Membership Committee (EANS IMC) designed an online survey to investigate the challenges that neurosurgery as a specialty, and neurosurgeons as healthcare professionals and individuals, have faced during the initial wave of the pandemic. By collecting their witnesses, this study helped understanding the role of EANS towards its international neurosurgical community and anticipating the long-term effects of the pandemic.",

The research goal was to investigate and record the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on global neurosurgeons through acquisition of qualitative data. The questionnaire was prepared and distributed using the online platform SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.com, SurveyMonkey Inc., San Mateo, California, USA). The design and internal validation stage was conducted during the second half of March 2020, and the survey was opened to responders on April 3 rd , 2020. The survey was promoted by the EANS, its official sponsor, and distributed via E-mail to its members; additionally, a weblink to the survey was continuously displayed on the EANS Institutional website for a total of five consecutive weeks. Neurosurgeons receiving the survey were encouraged to inform colleagues and non-members by disseminating the weblink via social media and other means of interpersonal communication. Data evaluation was started on May 18 th , 2020. The estimated completion rate according to SurveyMonkey was 52%. This study was intended to reach at least comparable response rate (3 to 5% when calculated using standard distribution platforms excluding social media) and completion rate (70%) to recently published neurosurgical surveys (20) (21) (22) .",

The terms trainee and resident were both used in this survey to overcome possible international deviations regarding training programs. Hospitals were divided in 5 groups to cover national and international conditions: university hospitals, maximum care hospitals also known as nonacademic tertiary hospitals, military hospitals, town hospitals also known as general hospitals, and private hospitals and clinics. With respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, responders were asked to provide the average number of neurosurgical interventions performed from the start of the outbreak up until the completion of the survey. As such, the survey collected departmental data with the breakdown of cranial, spine and emergency procedures before and during the pandemic. Also, termination (and/or reduction to a minimum) of elective surgical and outpatient services, rotation of neurosurgical personnel to Emergency Department (ED) or ICU services, and rate of COVID-19 infected personnel were surveyed.",

Not surprisingly, the concerns raised by a large proportion of responders regarding the risks of triaging patients and rationing the neurosurgical offer are in keeping with those recently reported by others (2, 9, 12, 18, (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) . Furthermore, it should be noted that the extended lockdown period, and the justified patients' anxiety of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 when attending hospitals, might have delayed access to care for most pathological conditions. This finding had already been described for acute cardio-and cerebrovascular emergencies, hence the neurosurgical community must reflect on the dramatic consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality of timely managing otherwise treatable diseases, which could potentially escalate to more advanced, incurable stages (29) . Beside the clinical challenges of treating more advanced conditions, the dimensions of their economic and financial sequelae to public healthcare systems also remain unclear. Although this last aspect is outside the scope of the present survey, it represents one of the research questions eventually generated by the analysis of data collected.",

As many other professionals, neurosurgeons did assume substantial financial and organizational implications for their hospital and private practices. This might be directly linked to various factors, including the lack of working stability for those solely employed in private practice, the increased difficulties in accessing research funding (for instance due to research grants being diverted to other areas of COVID-19 research) for pure academics and surgeon-scientists, the need for redeployment of personnel and resources for those working in public hospitals.",

Although this study fulfilled its goal of being representative of EANS-affiliated neurosurgeons, one should be careful of generalizing those results to the entire international community of neurosurgeons. While the majority of questions were designed as multiple-choice, free text could be submitted in various subsections of the survey hence the total amount of information provided might be hardly comparable. Although the study design focused on the potential for the data collected to be representative of both the professional and individual aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the large number of responders would warrant scrutiny toward risk of biases. Since more than two hundred European and international neurosurgeons participated, this survey is subject to individual variations among participants, their personal circumstances, stressful working pattern and individual aversion to uncertainty might have heavily influenced their answers. Detailed demographics such as the seniority of responders according to the number of years of neurosurgical practice were not specifically inquired but could be extrapolated by the stratification based on the participants' working position (such as Chair, Consultant or Trainee). However, one should also consider that in pragmatic qualitative studies with an inductive approach (meant to explore the characteristics of the problem, not that of the subjects), representativeness is not the priority (36) . This was precisely the intention of this study: not to question official numbers or produce new ones, but simply to document the perceptions of neurosurgeons as professionals and individuals in order to help EANS assisting them better in the forthcoming of this healthcare crisis. Follow up surveys on mid-and long-term after-effects of the crisis have already been projected.",
