            "text": "1 Introduction: Sport Climbing and the 2020 Olympics While outdoor rock climbing has a diverse and lengthy global history, competitive sport climbing 1 is relatively new, with the earliest records of competitions being held on artificial walls in the 1980s [9] . The discipline of competitive sport climbing has since become increasingly bifurcated from more traditional rock climbing, not only though changes in ethics (i.e., concern with Leave No Trace and other moral constraints), purpose (i.e., immersion in and/or \"conquering\" of nature), and location (i.e., on natural vs. artificial walls), but also through the increase of active governing bodies, organizations, and institutional logics surrounding competitive sport climbing [2, 9] . Competitive sport climbing is seen as the \"rationalization\" or \"quantification\" of rock climbing [5, 9] , an assertion that has been made uniquely visible by the choice to include sport climbing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, and through the subsequent choice of scoring format.",

This proposal was then approved by International Olympic Committee (IOC) at the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, allowing sport climbing into the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games alongside skateboarding, baseball/softball, karate, and surfing [8] . This series of events followed a documented power struggle between the IOC and the IFSC, as the IFSC sought legitimization for sport climbing through Olympic inclusion [2] . Seeking greater levels of funding, professionalization, and notoriety-and having been less than successful with its solo ventures to do so-the IFSC \"allowed the IOC to obtain a degree of power over the sport and traded its autonomy to some extent\" to partially fulfill these aims [2, p. 1684]. Although Olympic sport climbing remains governed by the IFSC, the IOC has imposed certain organizational standards onto sport climbing, which have resulted in tensions of ethics and questions of the IFSC's organizational power in the broader climbing community [2] . 2 One of these frequently-questioned standards is the development of the IFSC sport climbing combined format, which was influenced by an IOC recommendation (Degun, as cited in [2] ).",

These disciplines include speed climbing, bouldering, and lead climbing. Speed climbing is a race-format event in which two athletes compete for the fastest time on a 15m fixed route [7] . Speed climbing rewards the fastest time but also rewards precision, as false starts or falls are automatic losses in finals [7] . Bouldering consists of athletes \"solving\" either four (in qualifications) or three (in finals) boulder \"problems\" roughly 4.5m in height, where they are rewarded for completing these climbs in the least number of attempts, with a halfway \"zone hold\" to further separate the field through partial attempts [7] . Climbing here is done unroped, one at a time, and without safety equipment save for padded mats. Bouldering rewards athleticism, strength, quick-thinking, and adaptability. Lead climbing is perhaps the event that most outwardly resembles traditional rock climbing. Athletes compete one at a time, roped, on a 15m wall on a progressively-difficult course [7] . The athlete to climb the highest wins the event; if two climbers reach the same point on the wall, the quickest athlete is rewarded (with a total available climbing time of six minutes) [7] . Lead climbing rewards endurance and precision-once an athlete falls, their attempt is over. In each discipline, athletes are assigned a ranked score [7] .",

This format brings each athlete's performance in all three disciplines together under one score-the combined format. The combined format remains controversial among the climbing community, and it was publicly denounced by numerous high-profile climbers, including eventual sport climbing Olympians Adam Ondra and Jakob Schubert [2, 3]. The controversy surrounds both the clustering of the three disciplines into one event, as well as the specific inclusion of speed climbing in the event in general. In particular, speed climbing is noted as the \"outlier discipline\" and the \"proverbial wrench in the whole system,\" as \"it's a discipline of climbing that resembles very little traits of outdoor climbing\" [3] .",

Whether or not speed climbing is a \"legitimate\" form of climbing is not relevant to the conversation of scoring, save from the cascade effect of scoring outcomes that came from its inclusion in the combined format. The interesting part of the question of whether or not speed climbing should be part of the combined format-or what happens to the scoring when it is-lies with the fact that traditionally, speed climbing has been dominated by athletes who are notably uncompetitive in the other two disciplines [3] . While there are similar discrepancies among individual athletes' skills in bouldering and lead climbing, there is more athlete crossover in those two disciplines than into the speed discipline. However, the announcement of the combined format resulted in many sport climbers taking seriously all three disciplines, and some very respectable all-around climbers have since emerged in both the women's and men's fields.",

The current scoring for the combined format uses a multiplicative system that takes into account a climber's ranked score (through \"overall ranking points\") in each discipline [6] . This multiplicative system was introduced in April of 2018 following an IFSC Rules Modification in advance of the debut of the Combined format at the 2018 IFSC Climbing World Championships in Innsbruck, Austria [3, 6] ). This scoring system has been noted as confusing and anti-climactic, and it was even publicly misunderstood as favouring all-around athletes at first glance [3, 4] . Despite the possible perception of a combined event being structured to reward consistency across disciplines, the multiplicative system works such that climbers are actually rewarded for being dominant in one discipline, as opposed to being all-around athletes. As Black Diamond [3] explains, \"[e]ven just one first place finish significantly increases your chances of having a low score, which [favours] the best climbers.\"",

Furthermore, it most sports announcers on television would probably not be comfortable discussing logarithms.

Unfortunately, at the same time, it could be argued that multiplying rankings tends to undervalue to a certain extent an all-around climber who is quite good but not outstanding in all three disciplines. This seems directly contrary to what should be the purpose of a combined event. Tables 1-4 illustrate how the outcomes would have differed in the 2020 Olympics in the two scoring systems. It should be emphasized that many of the final rankings are similar or roughly similar in both scoring systems.

However, it simple to generate a scoring table which lists the points awarded for each ranking in a discipline (e.g., rankings of 1-20 in the preliminaries and 1-8 in the finals). To avoid having to deal with fractions, the relevant logarithms or square roots could be multiplied by 100 or 1000, say, and then rounded to the nearest integer. (This of course would not affect the rankings obtained from these scores.) It should be noted that using a score table is common in other athletic events, e.g., the decathlon, where there are ten different \"performance tables,\" one for each event. The decathlon performance tables convert a time or distance into a numerical score for that event.",

These logarithmbased scores range from 0 to 347, while the square-root based scores range from 0 to 300, which seem to be a reasonable range of possible values. Of course, these scoring tables could is not athlete performance, but the effect of route-setting (the design and construction of the climbing problems and routes), especially in the bouldering rounds with reference to what has been called \"the Janja problem\" (i.e., that Garnbret so far exceeds the field in bouldering that building bouldering problems that achieve decent separation is difficult. We see this in the women's finals, where Garnbret topped two of the three problems and no one else topped a single problem.) We have intentionally limited the scope of our paper, and thus we do not discuss the effects of the individual-discipline scoring and competition rules, though there are likely interesting conversations to pick up about the differences in speed scoring between qualifications (best time) and finals (head-to-head knockout format), as well as bouldering (four boulder problems in qualifiers, three boulder problems in finals).",

It is important to clarify that we are not attempting to add to this conversation to detract from the accomplishments of the winners, but to speak to the disconnect between event aims and goals (i.e., a combined \"overall\" event) and scoring (i.e., scoring that rewards outstanding performance in one discipline).",

Instead, the IOC has granted an additional medal to each gender, and the IFSC has decided to run a speed-only event, and a second event combining bouldering and lead climbing [10] . While this does not completely remove the problem of calculating overall scoring across two disciplines, there is much more traditional overlap between bouldering and lead climbing than between speed and either of the other two disciplines. In part, this Paris 2024 two-event format should produce better and more interesting results in both speed climbing and in bouldering/lead climbing. Nevertheless, we wanted to attempt to respond to John Burgman's claim of \"I don't know if anybody has thought of a better system yet,\" with a possible alternative scoring system (namely, the square-root based system) that addresses the problems of over-valuing single-discipline wins and under-valuing cross-discipline consistency [11] .",

While we empathize with the inherent tensions in and complications of quantifying and rationalizing rock climbing in general, we don't believe that all possible sport climbing scoring formats would be equally as distracting as the multiplicative format. With an appropriate scoring system, competitive sport climbing can still be \"about the climbing.\" There are also numerous comments that could be made about the intricacies of each discipline's scoring formats, including how the effects of athlete injury (B. Mawem), speed false starts (Duffy) and slips (Narasaki), and unexpected bouldering performances (Ondra) affected the final rankings, particularly in the men's event. 8 Another factor to consider",
