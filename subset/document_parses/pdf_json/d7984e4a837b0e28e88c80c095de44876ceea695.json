            "text": "Population analysis of pharmacokinetic data for five differing dosage forms and routes for dexamethasone and betamethasone in 48 healthy nonpregnant Indian women was performed that accounted for a partial and complex crossover design. Single doses of 6 mg dexamethasone phosphate (DEX-P), betamethasone phosphate (BET-P), or 1:1 mixture of betamethasone phosphate and acetate (BET-PA) were administered orally (PO) or intramuscularly (IM). Plasma concentrations collected for two periods over 96 h were described with a two-compartment model with differing PO and IM first-order absorption inputs. Clearances and volumes were divided by the IM bioavailability F IM . The homogeneous ages, body weights, and ethnicity of the women obviated covariate analysis. Parameter estimates were obtained by the Laplace estimation method implemented in NONMEM 7.4. Typical values for dexamethasone were clearance (CL=F IM \u00de of 9.29 L/ h, steady-state volume (V ss =F IM \u00de of 56.4 L, IM absorption constant k aIM \u00f0 \u00deof 0.460 1/h and oral absorption constant (k aPO \u00de of 0.936 1/h. Betamethasone parameters were CL/F IM of 5.95 L/h, Vss=F IM of 72.4 L, k aIM of 0.971 1/h, and k aPO of 1.21 1/h. The PO to IM F values were close to 1.0 for both drugs. The terminal half-lives averaged about 7.5 h for DEX, 17 h for BET, and 78 h for BET from BET-PA with the latter reflecting very slow release of BET from the acetate ester. Overall, BET exhibited slower clearance, larger volume of distribution, faster absorption, and longer persistence than DEX. These data may be useful in considering exposures when substituting one form of corticosteroid for another.",

It is commonly administered as the sodium phosphate ester/salt and hydrolysis of the phosphate ester occurs within 1 h [5] . DEX is partly metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver [6] . DEX clearance (CL) after IV dosing is about 0.18 L/h/kg and steady-state volume (V ss ) is about 1.1 L/kg in healthy men [7, 8] . Betamethasone, the enantiomer of DEX, is also formulated as a sodium phosphate ester/salt that undergoes rapid hydrolysis after IV dosing yielding a BET CL of about 0.16 L/h/kg and V ss of about 1.3 L/kg [9] . As with DEX, only a few percent of the BET dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Both DEX and BET bind moderately (about 65%) to plasma proteins [10] . While the PK of the IM BET phosphate/acetate mixture was well-characterized in sheep over a 5-day sampling showing rapid and slow/depot release components [11] , previous PK studies in human subjects sampled blood only for limited periods and missed the complex PK and long terminal phase [12, 13] . These drugs exhibit increased clearances during pregnancy as described previously [10] .",

For sequences CE and EC each subject received two doses of BET (BET-P PO and BET-PA IM). To avoid assigning two sets of times since the last dose to one subject, the observation times since the first dose were used. Additionally, for the sequence CE the BET-PA exhibited a prolonged terminal phase extending beyond the 10 day washout period that was manifested as residual BET plasma concentrations at pre-dose times for the next period. Therefore, for sequence CE the time since the first dose was a natural choice. Model parameters were estimated by maximizing the likelihood of observations using the Laplace with Interaction method implemented in NONMEM 7.4 (ICON Clinical Research LLC, North Wales, PA), The data below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were handled using the Beal M3 method for which the likelihood objective Tables 2 and 3 Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics function is corrected by the probability of observations falling below the limit [15] . Evaluation of model performance were done by assessing change in the objective function value, standard errors of parameter estimates, goodness-of-fit plots, and visual predictive checks (VPC). The plots were obtained by R 4.0.0 packages (ggplot2, lattice, vpc) [16] using RStudio 1.1.383 [17] . Part of the NONMEM code is provided in the Supplemental Materials.",

We tested whether the presence of inter-occasion variability for CL/F IM improved model performance in a subpopulation of subjects with sequences CE or EC.

The simulated PK profiles for these three regimens are shown in Fig. 8 . The corresponding C max , C trough , and AUC values are listed in Supplementary  Table S2 . Both rapidly-absorbed forms of DEX and BET are eliminated after 72 h, but the BET-PA formulation exhibits significantly prolonged concentrations in plasma. The peak and AUC values are similar for DEX-P and BET-PA whereas the C max is twice and AUC is 1.5-fold higher for BET-P.",

Both DEX and BET are used and being further studied for treatment of women at risk of pre-term delivery, with IM dosing as the recommended route of administration [4] . Although a previous assessment used physiologicallybased PK modeling to compare the two steroids [10] , this study was the first that we could identify to provide a headto-head comparison of their PK in a direct cross-over study in human subjects, particularly reproductive-age women [14] . Secondly, the potential exists for use of either oral DEX or BET in the absence of availability of the injectable dosage forms. Thus, the comparison of the oral route of administration is of interest. The PK parameters for these drugs will be used in further comparison of several pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers including cortisol suppression and cell trafficking in the same volunteer subjects [14] . Notably, DEX and BET are enantiomers with the same logP, protein binding, and presumably absorption and metabolic pathways [10] and it is intriguing whether there are PK and PD differences for these important therapeutic agents. Lastly, the PK of BET from BET-PA had not been fully characterized in humans previously.",

The partial cross-over design of our study gave us an opportunity to compare the PK/PD of these corticosteroids in the same subjects allowing assessment due to substantial reduction in inter-individual variability. Owing to the expected prolonged disposition and actions of the IM BET-PA and the greater sensitivity of the LC-MS/MS methodology compared to older RIA and HPLC methods [5, [7] [8] [9] , the blood sampling was extended to 96 h after dosing. This allowed us to more accurately and definitively quantify the terminal phases of the poly-exponential disposition of DEX and BET following absorption after IM and PO administration. Fig. 3 In fact, the 10 day washout period and cross-over design allowed us to detect BET after 14 days (Fig. 3S ) and include such values in fittings of the BET-PA data. With the cross-over design of the study for BET, we assessed the sequence or period effect on PK and found a small improvement in the IIV. The PK profiles of the BET dosage forms were jointly well-fitted without this consideration.",

            "text": "Since both BET and DEX were administered IM and PO, the estimates of volumes and clearances are apparent. However, these compounds are dosed as highly-soluble ester/salts, DEX and probably BET fall in the Biopharmaceutics Classification System Class I as highly soluble and highly permeable [19] , the relative F of PO to IM phosphate forms were essentially 1.0 (Tables 3 and 4) , clearances are low offering very little first-pass metabolism, and thus it is likely that absorption was high or complete. Our clearance estimates are very similar to the values calculated using NCA for the same subjects of 6.5 L/h for BET and 9.5 L/h for DEX [14] . However, our CL=F IM , for BET was 50% of the value reported for healthy volunteers after IV injection of 10.7 L/h [9] . The analogous typical value for DEX was 57% of 16.3 L/h [8] . Another reported value of CL=F IM , for DEX in healthy male subjects was 18.2 L/h [18] . The difference between our estimates of CL=F IM and others may be related to the previous shorter durations of earlier PK studies that ranged 8-24 h compared to 96 h in our study. The lowest observed plasma concentrations in those studies were above 1 ng/ mL, while our terminal phases of DEX and BET fell below that value. While one previous report showed no sex difference in PK of DEX [8] , our female subjects likely had smaller body weights than male subjects in other studies. An ethnic difference cannot be ruled out, but an assessment of midazolam AUC values in Caucasian versus South Asian men showed a 27% higher clearance of this CYP3A4 compound in Asians [20] . However, DEX is partly metabolized by CYP3A4 in liver [6] and partly by 11bhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in kidney [21] . The mean terminal half-lives were very similar for IM and PO dosing both for DEX and BET, consistent with the NCA values [14] . However, our estimates were about twice the values obtained for healthy subjects receiving DEX-P and BET-P as IV injections. These previous t 1/2 values were 2.37 h for DEX [8] and 5.58 h for BET [9] . As in the case for CL/F IM , we attribute these differences to the shorter duration of these studies that were unable to capture a true terminal phase of elimination. The t 1/2 = 12.9 h reported for healthy subjects who received BET-PA IM was calculated from blood samples taken only up to 48 h [12] . Our estimate of the mean half-life of BET from BET-PA of 77.6 h is sixfold longer with the profiles showing a well-captured terminal phase ( Figure S3 ). For drugs with absorption phases and poly-exponential disposition, the MRT provides a better descriptor for mean duration of drug exposure than t 1/2 . The MRT values in Supplementary  Table S1 show much longer values for all forms of BET compared to DEX, with the former about twice that of the latter.",

This difference resulted in slight overprediction and underprediction of IIV in the VPC plots for these groups (Fig. 3 ). Since these subjects differed only Tables 3 and 4 Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics by route of administration, variability of terminal slopes is not likely to be explained by variability in clearances and volumes. Possibly some subjects exhibited flip-flop kinetics where the absorption process controls the terminal phase of plasma concentration profiles. However, an absorption time extending beyond 24 h is unlikely. In studies in rats, we reported an unusually strong avidity of DEX for liver that might result in greater uptake and slower release from the liver tissue following oral compared to IM dosing [22] . Our values for the central volumes of distribution (V p / F IM ) of BET and DEX are relatively large, especially compared to IV doses, while the peripheral volumes are fairly small. The large V p /F IM can be attributed to 'disappearance' of the true central or even plasma volume owing to the absorption phase of these drugs. Known as 'vanishing exponentials', an absorption phase can hide an early IV phase for poly-exponential disposition [23] . On the other hand, our V T /F IM value reflects a new finding of a small ''deep compartment'' that was detected using the extended sampling times and high sensitivity assay. Prolonged sampling has demonstrated a similar late terminal phase after IV DEX dosing in horses [24] .",

One study of the IM injection of BET-PA in pregnant women yielded k a = 3.1 1/h based on very sparse sampling [13] , whereas our analysis yielded fast and slow absorption components. Our model and data are also consistent with dual absorption findings for this dosage form in sheep where the early absorption t 1/2 was 0.3 h and the later one 13.2 h [11] . Previous studies report a t max for PO DEX-P at about 1.4 h [7] and IM DEX-P at about 1.8 h [25] . Absorption of both DEX-P and BET-P after PO ingestion was faster than after IM injection. It is likely that the highly soluble sodium phosphate ester/salts dissolve more quickly in the GI fluids and are exposed to a greater surface area for absorption compared to the IM dosage forms given in a concentrated solution of 4 mg/mL. Estimates of BET k a after IM injections of BET-P, allowed us to estimate the separate absorption/hydrolysis rate of BET from BET acetate at the IM injection site. Our estimate of k a = 0.00638 1/h is consistent with a very slow dissolution/hydrolysis/absorption process that is responsible for the prolonged terminal half-life of BET t 1/2 = 77.6 h and reflecting flip-flop kinetics.",

Moreover, most of older data are based on analytical assays that were not sensitive at the low concentrations. The majority of publications report only noncompartmental PK parameters. In a recent clinical study, 103 pregnant women received 11.4 mg of BET-PA IM QDx2 [26] . A two-compartment model with first-order absorption was used for population analysis. The typical values for a 70 kg subject were CL/F = 11.6 L/h, V p / F = 140 L, CL D /F = 4.54 L/h, V T /F = 159 L, and k a = 1.17 h -1 . While the first two parameters are approximately twice higher than our estimates for BET, the CL D /F and V T /F are about 30-fold higher than our values for nonpregnant women. The absorption rate constant is similar. Pregnancy and fetal distribution may account for part of these differences.",

The regimen with BET (12 mg IM QDx2) showed similar troughs to the DEX regimen (6 mg IM BIDx4), the peak concentrations and AUC values were almost twice higher (Supplementary Table S2 ). A profile for BET-PA (12 mg IM QDx2) had the C max values similar to ones for DEX-P, but the C trough and AUC values were lowest of all three regimens. These profiles need further interpretation in relation to changes in PK during pregnancy [10, 27, 28] and comparative fetal distribution, efficacies, and adverse effects of the two steroids in pregnant women.",

The PK parameters are considered more definitive than earlier studies owing to blood sample stabilization, the repeated assessments, intensive and extended duration of blood sampling, high sensitivity of the LC-MS/MS assay, and use of state-of-the-art pharmacometric data analysis methods. Simulations of three clinically relevant dosing regimens for DEX and BET based on these data showed that BET-PA provides the lowest overall maternal exposures. Finally, our estimates of individual PK parameters will be applied to a population PKPD model of DEX and BET effects on cortisol, glucose, and cell trafficking responses in the studied subject population [14] . source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.
