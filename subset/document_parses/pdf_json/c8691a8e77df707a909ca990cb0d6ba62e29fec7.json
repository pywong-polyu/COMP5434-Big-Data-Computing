Life expectancy is a widely used indicator that provides a clear and cross-nationally comparable picture of the population-level impacts of the pandemic on mortality. Methods: Life tables by sex were calculated for 29 countries, including most European countries, Chile and the USA, for 2015-2020. Life expectancy at birth and at age 60 years for 2020 were contextualized against recent trends between 2015 and 2019. Using decomposition techniques, we examined which specific age groups contributed to reductions in life expectancy in 2020 and to what extent reductions were attributable to official COVID-19 deaths.",

A widely used approach to quantify the burden of the pandemic using allcause mortality is through the analysis of excess mortality, defined as the number of deaths observed during the pandemic above a baseline of recent trends. 5, 6 Here we go beyond excess deaths and country-specific analyses and focus on the pressing issue of revealing the impacts of the pandemic on life expectancy from a cross-national perspective.",

This heterogeneity has become more prominent since 2010. Whereas some countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltics experienced significant gains in life expectancy in the past decade, 12 others witnessed noticeable slowdowns in the pace of improvements and, in some cases, stalls or even temporary reversal. 13 For example, life expectancy in the USA, 14 England & Wales and Scotland saw only limited gains in the last decade. 15, 16 These atypical trends have been linked to slower improvements in old-age mortality and increases in working-age death rates. 15 ",

Emerging evidence has highlighted the impacts of delayed treatments or avoidance of care-seeking for cancers or cardiovascular diseases 19, 20 resulting in increased mortality from these conditions, whereas lockdowns may have reduced the number of deaths due to accidents. 21 This study is the first to use an unprecedented collection of demographic data from 29 countries, representing most of Europe, Chile and the USA, to examine the impacts of the pandemic on life expectancy in 2020, contextualized against trends in 2015-2019. To enable reliable crossnational comparisons of life expectancy over the period 2015-2020, we harmonized death counts and population estimates from multiple sources, leveraging major ongoing efforts collecting data on all-cause mortality 22 and official COVID-19 deaths. 23 An interactive dashboard that accompanies our manuscript is available at https://covid19.demo graphicscience.ox.ac.uk/lifeexpectancy. Only countries with high-quality age-disaggregated all-cause mortality data were included to estimate life tables (see the 'Methods' section). We focus on the pressing questions of how much life expectancy changed in 2020 relative to the period 2015-2019 and whether the impact was different for males and females. Leveraging demographic decomposition methods, we examine which age groups contributed to changes in life expectancy in 2020 and to what extent the observed reductions in life expectancy were attributable to officially reported COVID-19 deaths.",

The STMF provides high-quality weekly death counts for 38 countries (at the time of writing) in both a harmonized and original format, but the completeness of these data varies by country. We processed the original input files and selected 29 countries for further analysis. We selected only those countries for which sex-specific death counts across at least 10 age groups were available for every week in 2020 (see Supplementary Table S1 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online). Death counts for the USA and England & Wales across the years 2015-2019 were only reported in extremely coarse age groups by the STMF, but were available in fine grouping for 2020. For both countries, we therefore utilized age-specific annual death counts as reported by the CDC 24 and the ONS 25 for the years prior to 2020. All-cause mortality data were supplemented with COVID-19 deaths from the COVerAGE-DB database for a subset of 18 countries (by sex) registered continuously since March 2020 until the end of the year. 23 COVerAGE-DB provides information about COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths as reported by statistical agencies for >100 countries, in a standardized format with harmonized age groups. Population estimates were retrieved from the UN for the years 2015-2020; and for the year 2020, we used age-specific mid-year population projections from World Population Prospects 2019 (WPP). 10 For England & Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, mid-year population estimates from HMD for the year 2018 were projected for 2019 and 2020 using stable population assumptions (see Supplementary Figure S1 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online). We opted against official projections because the WPP does not disaggregate the UK into its constituent countries and the oldest age group in ONS projections is 90 years.",

Thus, the longer reporting interval for leap-week years would, all things being equal, increase observed death counts by a factor of 371/364 \u00bc 1.9% over regular years.

The choice of the last open-ended interval may impact estimates of life expectancy depending on the proportion of the population surviving to this last interval. 30 To evaluate its impact, we further calculated life tables by grouping death counts estimated from the PCLM model age 100 years for countries where more granular age categorization was available (see Supplementary Figure S2 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online). Smaller populations were more sensitive to the choice of the last open-ended group. However, trends in life expectancy remained similar. From these life tables, life expectancy at birth and life expectancy conditional on surviving to age 60 years for males and females were extracted for each country by sex. We performed several sensitivity checks to ensure the robustness of our estimates including comparisons with alternative sources such as the UN and from the HMD for the period from 2015 to 2019, or their most recent year available (see Supplementary Figure S2 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online). Additionally, we compared full-year death counts in our estimates with those reported in the HMD for previous years (Supplementary Figure S3 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online). Most countries did not show deviations across sources, except for Austria, where the STMF underestimates death counts varying from 2% and 4% for females and males, respectively. We further calculated life expectancy using the death counts from both sources and WPP population estimates as exposures and found that the effect on life expectancy is negligible (<1%). For the USA, we also compared our life-expectancy estimates with those based on provisional data up to June 2020. 31 Our results show a sharper decrease in life expectancy than those based on mid-year estimates, in line with including the remaining months of 2020 that also saw persistent levels of excess mortality.",

This assumption may not be realistic in the context of COVID-19, as the pandemic may have indirectly affected other causes of death. However, previous evidence suggests that the net effect of interactions between causes of death are negligible in decomposition analysis. 35 Moreover, our results are likely to be unaffected by this assumption if COVID-19 deaths are considered 'excess'. In addition, in most countries, the contribution of official COVID-19 deaths to changes in life expectancy can be interpreted as a lower bound due to limited testing and the potential misclassification of COVID-19 deaths. An alternative to decomposition methods is to quantify 'Years of Life Lost' defined as the difference between an individual's age at death from COVID-19",

            "text": "In contrast, life expectancy declined in all countries for both sexes from 2019 to 2020, except for females in Finland and both sexes in Denmark and Norway ( Figure 2 ). With the exception of Spain, Slovenia, Estonia and Northern Ireland, life-expectancy losses were larger for males in 2020. The magnitude of these declines offset most gains in life expectancy in the 5 years prior to the pandemic. Out of 29 countries, females from 15 and males from 10 countries ended up with lower life expectancy at birth in 2020 than in 2015, which was already an exceptionally bad year for life expectancy due to an irregularly strong flu season. 13 Our results show that from 2019 to 2020, females in 8 countries and males in 11 lost >1 year of life expectancy at birth. As Figure 3 shows, the magnitudes of losses observed in 2020 have not been witnessed since World War II in many countries of Western Europe such as Spain, England & Wales, Italy, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Portugal, with data available for the full twentieth century (see also Supplementary Figure S4 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online for females). With the exception of Lithuania and Hungary, the losses observed in 2020 in Eastern European countries exceeded those observed after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. The biggest losses of 1.5 years or more of life expectancy at birth were documented among males in the USA, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Poland, and females in the USA and Spain. At age 60 years, the three countries with the largest losses in male remaining life expectancy were Poland, the USA and Spain, each losing >1.4 years. Remaining life expectancy for females in Spain, USA and Belgium declined by >1.2 years. Note that annual changes in life expectancy are subject to random fluctuations that are larger for smaller populations. Thus, the ranking of the countries is not only affected by the pandemic-induced mortality shock, but also by the inherent randomness of death counts, which are more sensitive for smaller populations. This is indicated in Figure 2 via 95% confidence intervals around the estimated drop in life expectancy. Mortality reductions are translated into gains in life expectancy at birth and can be attributed to specific age groups. Bars shown in Figure 4 indicate the contributions, in years, to changes in life expectancy in 2015-2019 and 2019-2020 by broad age groups and sex (finer age grouping in Supplementary Figure S5 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online). Between 2015 and 2019, mortality improvements in those aged 60 years consistently contributed to increasing life expectancy across countries. In several countries, life-expectancy gains in those aged >80 years surpassed those in the age group 60-79 years. For females in particular, mortality improvements in the 80-years age group contributed most to improvements in life expectancy between 2015 and 2019, whereas for men broadly mortality improvements in the 60-to 79-years age group were greater. Improvements below age 60 years contributed less, but progress was still observed in many countries, especially in Eastern Europe, except for the USA and Scotland, where life expectancy decreased due to worsening mortality at these ages.",

We deal with these potential issues by harmonizing and smoothing death counts with a PCLM that has been shown to provide reliable estimates of mortality for all countries in our study 26 and by adjusting the person-years exposed. In most STMF countries, deaths that take place in a given week are covered by >90% by the following two weeks (STMF metadata). Therefore, we expect the percentage of missing deaths in the last weeks of 2020 to be low. Moreover, according to the STMF metadata, some countries (such as Austria, England & Wales, Germany and the Netherlands) employ extrapolation procedures to correct for incompleteness to adjust for missing death counts in the preceding 1-3 weeks. We recognize nonetheless that late and/or under-registration may affect our estimates by underestimating losses in 2020. Therefore, our results should be interpreted as estimates of the lower bound of life-expectancy reductions in 2020. For official COVID-19 mortality figures, there are likely to be inaccuracies due to differences in classification and testing practices across countries. Although we are unable to precisely measure the extent to which these inaccuracies may affect our estimates to make adjustments (i.e. since misclassification can occur for different reasons), we err on the side of caution and interpret our results as a lower bound of the impact of COVID-19 deaths on changes in life expectancy.",

Nevertheless, we anticipate that the magnitude of these effects is likely to be small due to the broadly younger age profiles of migrants and previous evidence that suggests that mortality at younger ages is more likely to be affected by international migration. 38, 39 In 2020, as increased mortality occurred mostly at older ages, the effect of migration on our estimates is likely to be low.",

Among Western European countries, life-expectancy losses were also documented. To put this into perspective, the 2014-2015 strong flu season was regarded as an exceptionally bad year among high-income countries, causing drops in life expectancy. 13 The largest drop was observed in Italy with a loss of around half a year among males and females.

Despite having a younger population, the USA also has higher comorbidities in these age groups compared with European populations with greater vulnerability to COVID-19. 42, 43 Other factors, such as those linked to unevenness in healthcare access in the working-age population and structural racism, may also help to explain the increased mortality. Recent research from the USA, for example, shows that socially disadvantaged populations such as Blacks and Latinos experienced losses three times higher than those reported here at the national level. 9 Emerging evidence further indicates that non-COVID-19 excess mortality was concentrated in working ages. 44, 45 Although some of this likely reflects misclassification of COVID-19 deaths due to factors linked to poorer testing and healthcare access, our findings reflect a deepening during the pandemic of the US mid-life mortality crisis that has led to the stalling of life expectancy in recent years. 13, 14, 46 Countries in Eastern Europe (Lithuania, Bulgaria and Poland), as well as England & Wales and Scotland, where recent life-expectancy stalls due to deteriorating midlife mortality too have been noted, also saw increased mortality in the <60-years age group.

Losses in life expectancy are also likely to vary substantially between subgroups within countries. However, a lack of data currently limits direct and more disaggregated comparisons across a wider range of countries, but these are urgently needed to understand the full mortality impacts of the pandemic. This limitation is manifested in our study as we were only able to include two countries outside of Europe with reliable and complete information for 2020, and our analysis focused on national populations. To expand our analyses to a broader set of countries, data on all-cause mortality with detailed disaggregation by age and sex, and for deeper analysis other characteristics such as socio-economic status and ethnicity, are needed to assess the uneven mortality impacts of the pandemic. Nevertheless, we note that in settings with deficient or limited vital registration, the true mortality impacts of the pandemic may never fully be known and, at minimum, the use of data from such contexts would require further adjustments (e.g. for undercounting, age heaping) before use. Although COVID-19 might be seen as a transient shock to life expectancy, the evidence of potential long-term morbidity due to long COVID and impacts of delayed care for other illnesses 19, 20 as well as health effects and widening inequalities stemming from the social and economic disruption of the pandemic 47 suggest that the scars of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health may be longer-lasting.",
