Due to the rarity of adult RMS, limited information about biological features, prognostic factors, and response to chemotherapy are currently available. For this reason, the current management of adult RMS is often based on studies done in the pediatric setting. However, adult RMS differs from the childhood counterpart in terms of natural history, clinical behavior, and outcomes. In particular, adult RMS affects different body sites with a predilection for extremities [1] , while children RMS shows a propensity for head and neck (35%), genitourinary tract (22%), and extremities (18%) [2, 3] . In adult RMS, the most common site for metastasis is lungs (50%), followed by bone marrow, lymph nodes, and, less frequently, the brain [4, 5] . For children RMS, the most reported sites for metastasis are lungs (47%), which represent the only dissemination site for 18% of metastatic patients, followed by bone marrow (38%), bone (34%), and distant lymph nodes (26%) [6] .",

For localized disease, surgery remains the main option, however, tumor shrinkage may be achieved with anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemosensitivity is strongly related to the histological subtype, ranging from a good chemosensitivity for ERMS (embryonal RMS) and ARMS (alveolar RMS) to a poor sensitivity to systemic treatment in more aggressive histological entities such as pleomorphic RMS [16] . Postsurgery radiotherapy, regardless of the margin status, demonstrated to improve outcome in terms of local and distant recurrence as well as overall survival (OS) compared to patients with adult RMS that did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy [17] . Treatment of metastatic disease remains controversial. Pediatric protocol of polychemotherapy regimen (mainly based on the combination of ifosfamide, vincristine, and actinomycin \u00b1 maintenance chemotherapy with metronomic cyclophosphamide) has shown to provide little improvement in terms of ORR compared to adult-standard STS regimens (single-agent doxorubicin or ifosfamide-epirubicin). However, this protocol is not always suitable for adults due to its toxicity [18, 19] . Given the rarity and complexity of this disease, multidisciplinary management in referral centers is crucial to improve outcomes [20] .",

The histology reported the diagnosis of high grade sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma of the masseter parotid region of about 7 cm with positive surgical margins (bone), 60% Ki-67 positivity and one lymph node as site of micro-metastasis. Subsequently, the patient received an adjuvant IMRT radiotherapy treatment, 60 Gy divided in 30 fractions, that was completed in May 2019. In July 2019, the patient was referred to our Center with the appearance in the MRI of multiple nodules in the sternocleidomastoid muscle and subcutaneous carcinosis (Figure 1a ). The biopsy of the nodules confirmed the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. The CT scan showed a laterocervical lymphoadenopathy of 75 mm \u00d7 65 mm and several pulmonary and liver metastases. The multidisciplinary board suggested chemotherapy with doxorubicin 75 mg/m 2 day 1 every 3 weeks. The radiological evaluation after four cycles of treatment showed progression of the disease (Supplementary Figure S3) . Due to the persistence of a good performance status (PS ECOG 1), in December 2019, the patient received a second line of treatment with Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 on day 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks.

In particular, in RMS1 the expression of VIM, an EMT gene and a master regulator of cell architecture, was 2.88-fold higher with respect to control tissue. CDH1, an epithelial marker, was significantly upregulated (158.46 fold-higher, p < 0.05) with respect to control. TGFb, a major driver of EMT and a strong promoter of several tumor-associated pathways, was upregulated (2.80 fold-higher, p < 0.05) as well as SNAIL1 (3.07 fold-higher p < 0.05). The expression levels of both matrix-modifying enzymes MMP2 and MMP9 were 1.31 (p < 0.05) and 11,890.70 fold-higher, respectively. Moreover, the expression level of SLUG, an inducer of EMT, was upregulated with respect to control (5.87 fold-higher, p < 0.05). Furthermore, we observed the upregulation of some chemoresistance-related genes. In particular, as previously mentioned [23] , LAPTM4b, a gene which contributes to chemotherapy resistance, was upregulated (8.91 fold-higher) while the expression of LAPTM4a was comparable to the control. A significant upregulation of chemoresistance-associated genes TP53I3 (2.27 fold-higher p < 0.05), RAB22a (6.08 fold-higher p < 0.05) and S100p (88.5 fold-higher p < 0.05) was detected. Finally, the expression of CD109, a gene previously shown [24] to be a promising diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in myxofibrosarcoma, was 2.19 (p < 0.05) fold-higher than that of the control. In RMS2, the expression of VIM, CDH1, TGFb, MMP2, MMP9, and SLUG was significantly downregulated respect to control tissue, while SNAIL1 was upregulated (1.23 fold-higher, with a trend of significance) with respect to control. Moreover a significant downregulation of all investigated chemoresistance-associated genes was observed. In RMS3, the expression of VIM, CDH1, TGFb, SNAIL1, MMP9, and SLUG was significantly downregulated while MMP2 was upregulated (2.06 fold-higher, with a trend of significance) with respect to control tissue. Moreover, a significant downregulation of all investigated chemoresistance-associated genes was observed. Establishment of sclerosing RMS1 patient-derived primary culture was achieved ( Figure 6a ). The cell line continued to proliferate after culture passages. Morphological analysis was carried out on both patient-derived isolated cells cultured in standard monolayer ( Figure 6b ) and within collagen-based scaffolds (Figure 6c ). Hematoxylin and eosin-stained primary cells reviewed by an experienced sarcoma pathologist confirmed the establishment of RMS primary culture. Moreover, cytological analysis of MyoD1 in RMS patient-derived primary culture confirmed the expression of this marker in 70% (Figure 6d ) of isolated primary cells.",

Moreover, other EMT-related genes such as TGF-b, SNAIL1, SLUG, MMP2, and MMP9 were found upregulated, confirming the above suggestion. Upregulation of CDH1, a well-known epithelial marker, was also detected. Although a loss of function or downregulation of CDH1 has been associated with primary cancer and metastases [27] , it has also been found that CDH1 can be a trigger of tumor aggressiveness and metastases through the reversion of EMT to MET process [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .

We investigated the expression of a panel of tumor-associated markers known to be involved in different tumors. This analysis was carried out not only to confirm the establishment of RMS primary culture, but also the homogeneity between the original biological sample and primary culture over time. The results showed no alteration in any of the 52 genes of the panel. Since many of these markers are druggable and are used in daily clinical practice as predictive markers of response, these data represent an important indication of the possible therapeutic efficacy of some chemotherapeutic agents currently used for the management of STS patients. In particular, no alterations were detected in the expression of ALK, MTOR, KIT, PDGFRA, NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3, which are the targets of crizotinib, everolimus, imatinib, and larotrectenib, respectively. These results are suggestive of the refractoriness of these diseases to several treatments currently used for the management of other STS histotypes (e.g., anthracyclines, trabectedin or immunotherapy [39, 40] ) and support the clinical observation of the limited availability of therapeutic options and poor outcome of adult RMS patients. The observed results prompted us to deepen the investigation of molecular features of RMS1 lesion through a larger RNA-seq panel. The results (data not shown) detected a RAB3IP-HMGA2 gene rearrangement and a FGFR4 mutation, which could provide some new insight about the biology of this uncommon entity [25] . Impaired DNA mismatch repair system (MMR) leads to microsatellite instability, a condition of genetic hypermutability, which is associated with different tumors, most commonly endometrial and gastric tumors [41, 42] . Nevertheless, microsatellite instability wild type status resulting in both RMS tumor tissue (Supplementary Figure S2) and patientderived primary culture (Supplementary Figure S3) corroborated the above observation of RMS model fidelity. Additional studies confirmed that tumors with high MSI instability status correlate with high levels of PD1/PDL1 expression [43, 44] and represent predictive markers of response to immunotherapy [45] in several tumors including colorectal cancer [46, 47] , endometrial cancer [48] , gastric cancer [49] , follicular thyroid cancer [50] , and head and neck carcinoma [51] . For the above reasons, the analysis of microsatellite instability represents an important tool in clinical practice and could be also used as an indirect method for the investigation of MMR system alterations, therefore, identifying the likelihood of patient responsiveness to immunotherapy. As a result, this data provides evidence of the limited response to immunotherapy observed in many STS [52] .",

            "text": "Then, chemobiogram analysis on RMS1 patient-derived cells cultured both in standard monolayer culture and within 3D collagen-based scaffold showed the sensitivity of primary cells to some drugs currently used or under clinical evaluation for STS. In particular, RMS primary cells exposed to anthracycline-based regimens, the upfront treatment option in STS management including RMS, exhibited a high cytotoxic activity in both cell culture systems (Figure 7) . This is in contrast with the poor response of the patient to doxorubicin therapy (Supplementary Figure S4) ; however, this discrepancy could be explained by the gap that still exists between preclinical and clinical outcome. Indeed, patient-derived cell cultures could not completely recapitulate the tumor lesion microenvironment and behavior. This is in part due to the fact that primary cultures are not immortalized cells and, therefore, it is not possible to perform sequential treatments in order to assess the possible occurrence of chemoresistance [53] . Moreover, these results are consistent with daily clinical practice, confirming anthracycline-based regimens as a valuable option for the treatment of RMS. Moreover, the comparable cell viability among DOXO, DOXO/DACA and DOXO/CIS treatment groups in 2D provide evidences of the anthracycline efficacy in monoregimen. The same was observed in 3D culture system, in which DOXO efficacy was higher compared to DOXO/DACA and not significantly different compared to DOXO/CIS. The lower sensitivity of RMS cells to chemotherapy observed in 3D is explainable by the lower oxygen tension and molecules penetration within the collagen scaffold matrix. In this regard, we already showed that our 3D culture model enables the modeling of the tumor hypoxic state and the associated emergence of chemoresistance mechanisms [54] . The latter data is also observed with ETO and LENVA treatments group. In particular, ETO treatment group exhibited 25% cell death in 2D while it was not effective in 3D. LENVA treatment group exhibited 61% cell death in 2D while it was not effective in 3D. These data could also be linked to the mechanism of action of these drugs. Although we already demonstrated that our model is able to increase the expression of some STS associated-markers and to select a higher tumor cells percentage compared to standard 2D cultures [55] , we can speculate that the lower sensitivity of 3D cultured RMS cells could be linked to a decreased expression of the target of these drugs in 3D. This could be especially true for a multikinase inhibitor such as lenvatinib, which acts via the inhibition of multiple targets interfering with the vascular endothelial formation. We can hypothesize that a more aggressive microenvironment such as that of a 3D culture system compared to 2D is responsible for the decreased survival of some of the patient-derived endothelial cells, which could be involved in the activity of the lenvatinib drug. This could explain the decrease in sensitivity observed in 3D, however, further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanism of action of these drugs.",

In particular, LAPTM4b, a gene which seems to be involved in membrane trafficking of drugs such as anthracyclines, was upregulated while LAPTM4a was not. Although chemobiogram analysis (Figure 7) showed sensitivity to chemotherapy in both 2D and 3D RMS cultures, the above result is consistent with the clinical outcome observed in the patient, which showed a progression of disease after four cycles during the first line treatment with doxorubicin (Supplementary Figure S4) . These data suggest LAPTM4b as a predictive response marker in this histotype. More analyses are needed in order to confirm this data. Moreover, an upregulation of other chemoresistance-related genes such as TP53I3, RAB22a, and S100p was also detected. This data could in part explain the poor outcome of this specific entity to current chemotherapy. This is especially evident if comparing adult RMS to those observed in child counterparts.
