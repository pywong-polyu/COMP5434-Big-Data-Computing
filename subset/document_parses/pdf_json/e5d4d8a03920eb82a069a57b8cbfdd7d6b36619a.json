J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Abstract Background: Surface decontamination of hospital environments is essential to ensure the safety of health professionals and patients. This process is usually performed through active chemicals substances with high toxicity, and new decontamination technologies that do not leave residues have been currently used, such as UV-C light. Thus, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a portable UV-C light device on the viability of standard pathogenic strains and other microorganisms isolated from different surfaces of a public health hospital. Methods: In vitro decontamination was performed by applying Biosept Home\u00a9 UV-C to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica and Candida albicans. In real conditions, the application was made on different surfaces of a hospital. The device used in the experiment haa a 254nm UV-C light and a radiation intensity of 45.6 mW/cm 2 over a distance of 1cm from the surfaces. The light dose was 0.912 J/cm 2 for 20 seconds of application in both conditions (in vitro and hospital). Results: After in vitro decontamination with UV-C light no bacterial growth was observed, demonstrating 100% of bacterial inactivation under the conditions tested.",

The UV irradiation covers a wavelength ranging from 100 to 400nm. The subdivisions of this electromagnetic spectrum can be classified into three distinct areas, including Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) (100 to 280 nm), UV-B (280 to 315 nm), and UV-A (315 to 400 nm). The UV-C has been applied to the development of germicide light since it is capable of damaging the DNA and RNA of microorganisms through the formation of thymine/thymine dimers and, consequently, impairing the transcription and replication process [13] . However, the efficacy of UV-C light on surface decontamination decreases as the distance between the light source and the contaminated surface increases. The structure of the surface is another factor that may affect the efficiency of the decontamination process, and hard, smooth surfaces are ideal for UV-C decontamination [14, 15] . Several studies described the potential effects of UV-C on the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reduction of the contamination of the transfusion of platelet concentrates [1] [2] [3] , on the control of the dissemination of multidrug-resistant pathogens presented in the hospital environment [16, 17] , on the elimination of the foodborne pathogenic bacteria [18, 19] and viruses on the water as well [20] .

This device also achieved a high reduction in the microbial load on hospital surfaces. Overall, Biosept Home\u00a9 UV-C is a promising alternative for implementing disinfection protocols in hospitals and also in clinics (medical, dental, esthetic), reducing the risk of infection transmission.

The generation of bioaerosols and the contamination of hospital surfaces and instruments have been attributed to a high proportion of COVID-19 infection in healthcare environments. The disinfectant potential of UV-C on hospital surfaces has several advantages, including the effective sterilization of bioaerosols [21], facility to use, reduction of exposure time and user manipulation. The inactivation of the virus and a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, is an effective alternative to be applied in routine decontamination protocols on hospital and clinical surfaces. Given the alarming need to prevent the uncontrolled spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the effective decontamination capability of UV-C, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Biosept Home\u00a9 UV-C on the viability of standard pathogenic strains and other microorganisms isolated from different hospital surfaces.",

These microorganisms were chosen because they are used to test the efficiency of antimicrobial agents, have different cell wall structures and are associated with healthassociated infections. All microorganisms were grown in BHI broth (brain-heart infusion) in an oven at 37\u00baC for 24 hours. After growth, the samples were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 15 minutes and resuspended in PBS. The suspensions were quantified through the optical density, and the number of 10 8 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL was estimated[16].",
