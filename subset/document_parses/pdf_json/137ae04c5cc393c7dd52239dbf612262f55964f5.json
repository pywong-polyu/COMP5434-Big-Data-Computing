Sodium channel dysfunction represents a common pathogenetic pathway for these 2 clinical entities that may be involved as a mechanism of sudden death. In addition, mutations of ion channel or arrhythmiarelated genes are the most common defects found in patients experiencing sudden death in epilepsy. 5 Coexistence of epilepsy and BrS in a family with SCN5A mutation has been reported, suggesting that sodium channel mutation may be responsible for cardiac and cerebral manifestations, probably at different ages in the same individual and/or in the same family. 6 The latter underlines the importance of careful assessment of symptoms, detailed family history, and a thorough ECG analysis when evaluating patients with seizure-like symptoms.",

            "text": "BrS is recognized as a relevant cause of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and SCD among individuals with structurally normal hearts. Epilepsy can be associated with both cardiac arrhythmias and an increased risk of SCD. Uncontrolled epilepsy results in alterations of cardiac electrophysiology, potentially leading to arrhythmias owing to ictal discharges in brain regions controlling sympathetic and parasympathetic tone or life-threatening abnormalities of cardiac repolarization. 10 Non-seizure-related arrhythmias have also been observed in patients with epilepsy, which can be life-threatening and manifest as sudden cardiac death. 11 The role of AED in these circumstances is controversial and debated. In a community-based study, AED use was associated with an increased risk of SCD, and specifically with the use of sodium channel blocker agents. 11 The susceptibility to SCD in epilepsy might be the consequence of a shared genetic cause with arrhythmogenic syndromes. Indeed, both BrS and idiopathic epilepsy are associated with heterozygous mutations in ion channel genes. The role of channel dysfunction in the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy is well known, as variants of the cardiac sodium channel (ie, SCN4A, SCN5A, SCN10A, and SCN11A), gated potassium channel (ie, HCN1), and calcium channel (ie, EFHC1 and CACNA1A) are frequently documented. 12, 13 The most clinically relevant mutations are those affecting the voltage-gated sodium channel, which are expressed in various tissues and are involved in various clinical manifestations: brain (epilepsy), heart (cardiac arrhythmias), skeletal muscle (myotonia and periodic paralysis), peripheral nervous system (pain disorders). 14 Epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmias can be confused in the early stages of the diagnostic process when a syncope occurs as the first clinical manifestation. Once considered specific to epileptic phenomena, generalized tonic-clonic movements during loss of consciousness are commonly reported in cardiac syncope as well. This overlap in clinical manifestations can lead to misdiagnosis of life-threatening cardiac conditions and, as occurred in this case, to prescription of potentially harmful drugs.",

            "text": "Phenytoin can elicit type 1 Brugada ECG pattern at supratherapeutic blood levels, 9 but its proarrhythmic effect has never been documented. Phenytoin is a first-generation antiepileptic and a class IB antiarrhythmic drug used for the treatment of epilepsy. It acts by blocking the voltage-dependent sodium channels and, because of this particular activity, may exacerbate the voltage gradient between endocardium and epicardium, which could be lethal in BrS patients. Sodium channel blockade in a patient with BrS can lead to spontaneous, sustained ventricular arrhythmias, refractory to external cardioversion, resulting in cardiocirculatory collapse, as also reported by our group. 15, 16 Conclusion This case report demonstrates the deleterious effect of phenytoin administration in a patient with BrS, whose predisposing condition was initially overlooked. Patients with seizure-like events should always be carefully evaluated by a cardiologist to rule out an underlying condition, especially if a neurologic etiology is not clearly established. In cases of suspicious symptoms, a family history of sudden death, and/ or equivocal dubious ECG abnormalities, a sodium channel blocker test should be performed before initiating a specific drug treatment.",
