[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] In many high-income countries, ESD has not been well developed in practice with a lack of large-scale implementation. 9 In contrast, in the UK, considerable efforts have been made to implement ESD, although types of service differ across the country, and in some regions, ESD is still not offered at all. 10 Where ESD has been delivered, it is unclear whether benefits of the ESD intervention, as suggested in clinical trials, are achieved in practice.",

The Sentinel Stroke National Audit programme (SSNAP) is the national stroke register of England, Wales and Northern Ireland in which all acute admitting hospitals and postacute stroke teams are mandated to participate. 14 SSNAP has played a key role in monitoring performance and improving provision of acute stroke care. Collection of SSNAP data across the stroke care pathway now offers a unique opportunity to investigate the large-scale impact of postacute interventions such as ESD. The study reported here, and in a parallel paper exploring the effectiveness of ESD service models, investigates if trial-based benefits of ESD are realised in practice, with the aim to inform evidence based improvements. 15 Here, we focus on the impact of ESD on length of hospital stay.",

The ASCOF data report the average daily rate of delayed transfers of care per 100 000 population aged 18 years and over at local authority level. Data were aggregated up to National Health Service Trust level, using averages where multiple local authorities were associated with one National Health Service Trust. Again we focused on the scores produced during the latter part of the period of interest in line with the SSNAP hospital performance ratings. 20 In order to account for comparison between different groups of individual patients, we also included variables at the patient level. These were stroke patient characteristics, reflecting validated stroke case-mix models and collected as part of the SSNAP data set. These were age at admission, sex, prestroke independence, cardiovascular comorbidities, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission, type of stroke and modified Rankin Scale score at discharge from hospital. 21 22 Statistical analyses We employed a linear multilevel model framework for both study designs whereby patients (level 1) were clustered within admitting hospitals (level 2) in an approach consistent with previous observational studies of this type. 15 21-24 Within our multilevel models, we adjusted for a range of patient and hospital characteristics as covariates.

With adjustment using two different designs and alternative analyses for the differing case-mix, length of hospital stay remained longer for those who received ESD on their care pathway. This contrasts with findings from original ESD randomised controlled trials, in which a reduction in length of hospital stay was reported. 2 This is an important finding, particularly when considering implementation of ESD in practice. The promise of reducing length of hospital stay made ESD attractive with regard to cost savings and is likely to have contributed to widespread implementation in England. 10 11 The economic implications of ESD in the real world have previously been investigated through simulation modelling (informed by SSNAP data similar to data used here). 28 The authors reported an estimated mean length of hospital stay for ESD patients that was 8 days less than non-ESD patients and thereby derived cost savings associated with modelling increased use of ESD.",

Previous studies have also highlighted transfer problems relating to lack of joint working between health and social care. [29] [30] [31] Our parallel paper added to this debate by highlighting the importance of access to a social worker as part of the ESD team. 15 What was not possible to investigate in this study was whether access to ESD (despite an additional day in hospital) was associated with improved patient outcomes over the longer term.

Although numbers of patients were sufficient for the analysis undertaken, by focusing on specific regions of England, transferability of findings could be questioned, particularly outside England. Other limitations include potential sources of residual confounding and also reliance on SSNAP data being accurately reported by hospital teams. Length of hospital stay data are inherently variable, and while we tried to include a proxy measure for other sources of delays in discharge, analysis would have benefited from social care related patient level variables. 28 32 Patients also experienced a series of hospital stays (eg, transfer between acute and rehabilitation wards), relying on accurate transfer of SSNAP records between hospitals and resulting in us focusing on total length of hospital stay and ESD provision on a care pathway. 36 What this means is that the impact of ESD on a particular hospital may not be apparent, which may be of more interest to providers of hospital services.",

[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] This study investigated the impact of ESD in real-world settings and focused on length of hospital stay. ESD was not associated with a reduction in length of hospital stay as previously reported in clinical trials, although the increased average length of stay was just 1 day. This highlights the importance of investigating whether trial-based outcomes of interventions are realised in the real world. What Open access remains to be investigated and reported are the benefits of accessing ESD over the longer term. Also by focusing analysis on patients who would have been eligible, but did not receive ESD, we have highlighted an important gap in service provision. ",

Again, we controlled for patient characteristics, SSNAP admitting hospital score and average ASCOF rates for each admitting hospital. There was no significant interaction between receiving ESD and time period (p=0.79) so that the effect of ESD was similar in both time periods, despite more patients accessing ESD over time. Therefore, the main effect of ESD across both time periods was estimated to increase length of hospital stay by an average of 18.8% (95% CI 13.9% to 24.0%) compared with patients who did not receive ESD on their care pathway.
