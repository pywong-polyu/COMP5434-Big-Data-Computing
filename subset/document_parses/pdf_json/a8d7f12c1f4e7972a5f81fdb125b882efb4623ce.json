In nonclinical studies, cellular immune responses mediated by cytotoxic T cells may target vector-transduced cells, which could impact safety and efficacy. Here, we describe the bioanalytical validation of an interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3)-based Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISpot) assay for measuring T cell responses against viral antigens in cynomolgus monkeys. Since ELISpots performed with antigen-derived peptides offer a universal assay format, method performance characteristics were validated using widely available peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) responsive to cytomegalovirus peptides. The limit of detection and confirmatory cut point were established using statistical methods; precision, specificity, and linearity were confirmed. Monkey PBMCs from an AAV5 gene therapy study were then analyzed, using peptide pools spanning the vector capsid and transgene product. AAV5-specific T cell responses were detected only in 2 of 18 monkeys at Day 28, but not at Day 13 and 56 after vector administration, with no correlation to liver enzyme elevations or transgene expression levels. No transgene product-specific T cell responses occurred. In conclusion, while viral peptide-specific IFN-\u03b3 ELISpots can be successfully validated for monkey PBMCs, monitoring peripheral T cell responses in non-clinical AAV5 gene therapy studies was of limited value to interpret safety or efficacy.",

Adenovirus-associated virus (AAV)based vectors are commonly used for gene delivery to various target tissues and are generally well tolerated [9] . However, pre-existing as well as treatment-induced immune responses against both AAV capsids and encoded transgene products have been reported in the literature, which may negatively impact safety and efficacy of gene therapies [10] [11] [12] . Therefore, treatment-specific humoral and cellular immunity are closely monitored in both clinical and nonclinical studies in order to identify potential barriers to successful gene therapy outcomes [13] [14] [15] .",

Detection of cytokine secretion as a direct marker for T cell recognition of specific antigens is often preferable for ease of use [16, 17] . Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay and Enzyme-linked Immunospot (ELISpot) assays can both detect secreted cytokines, but they differ by either measuring bulk cytokine production or enumerating individual cytokine-producing cells, respectively. Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) is often used as a cytokine endpoint in ELISpot assays and has a wide range of biological functions in the context of an immune response, including the activation of macrophages, up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex I and II, and induction of IgG production from activated B cells. IFN-\u03b3 is mainly produced and secreted by activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, which constitute about 45-70% of PBMCs in human peripheral blood [18] [19] [20] [21] . PBMCs are easily isolated from blood using standardized procedures and can be obtained at any time during a study.",

The method has a relatively wide quantitative range and offers unique sensitivity by revealing cytokine secretion at the single-cell level. In recent years, its application has been adopted by the gene therapy field [29] . A number of clinical studies have used IFN-\u03b3 ELI-Spot assays to evaluate preexisting T cell immunity against multiple AAV serotypes [30, 31] . Other studies monitor for the development of cellular responses to the AAV capsid and transgene encoded protein following dose administration [1, 13, 32] . IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assays have also been used for preclinical evaluation of immunity to AAV vectors [33, 34] . However, there are limited studies to help standardize the bioanalytical assessment of method performance characteristics that are required for regulated clinical or nonclinical sample testing [19, 35, 36] . For instance, it is a matter of choice how to evaluate ELISpot detection cutoffs (limit of detection, LOD), whether to implement confirmatory cut points, or how to set assay acceptance criteria for precision during validation and sample analysis. In contrast, these types of questions have been addressed and standardized for traditional immunogenicity assays that detect total or neutralizing antibodies (TAbs or NAbs) as well as for quantitative ligand-binding assays used for assessment of biomarkers and pharmacokinetics [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Given their cell-based format, ELISpot assays most closely resemble assays used to detect NAbs, and we expect future regulatory guidance for ELISpots to reflect this fact.",

Industry white papers [43] [44] [45] [46] and some of the above mentioned guidance documents for regulated bioanalytical assays were considered wherever possible. The method was based on a commercial ELISpot assay kit for monkey IFN-\u03b3 detection, as cynomolgus monkeys are commonly used in non-clinical gene therapy studies to assess safety and efficacy. During assay establishment, basic assay parameters were optimized for image capture, cell density, detection antibody concentration, and stimuli concentration to achieve optimal performance for monkey PBMC samples (data not shown). Initial assay characterization included intra-and inter-assay precision and verification of a preliminary LOD. Formal assay validation confirmed intra-assay, inter-assay, and inter-analyst precision, linearity and specificity, and statistically derived an LOD and confirmatory cut point. The validated assay was considered fit-for-purpose and used in a monkey study to measure cellular immune responses to the AAV5 vector capsid and encoded transgene product following gene therapy administration.",

Monkey PBMCs were isolated from sodium heparin anticoagulated whole blood as previously described with some modifications [47] . Any potential stimulation factors were absent during PBMC isolation and storage, for example by avoiding exposure to FBS or other growth factors. This requirement was critical to avoid non-specific stimulation. Briefly, PBMCs were isolated from whole blood within 6 h after collection. Blood volume was diluted 1:1 with 1X Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ Free DPBS (14190-444, Gibco). For instance, 5 mL of blood should be gently mixed with 5 mL of 1X Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ Free DPBS. This mixture was layered onto room temperature Lympholyte\u00ae-Mammal (CL5120, Cedarlane) or other similar reagent at a 75% Lympholyte to DPBS-diluted blood volume ratio. To illustrate, 10 mL of diluted blood was layered onto 7.5 mL Lympholyte\u00ae-Mammal. Samples were centrifuged at 1270-1450 RCF for 30 min at room temperature with the brake off. The PBMCs were harvested after centrifugation, washed, diluted in either CryoABC (CTLC-ABC, Cellular Technology Limited) or CryoStor CS10 (07930, StemCell Technologies) serum-free freezing medium and aliquoted for freezing. PBMC aliquots were frozen slowly at \u221280\u00b0C in Mr. Frosty cell freezing containers (Thermo Scientific).

Human CEF (CMV, Epstein-Barr virus, Influenza virus) peptide pool (3615-1) was purchased from MabTech (Cincinnati, OH, USA). AAV5 peptide pools (15mers overlapping by either 10 or 11aa) with \u226580% purity were custom synthesized and ordered from JPT. Each AAV5 peptide pool (AAV5pp1 and AAV5pp2) consisted of~70-90 overlapping 15-mer peptides that were synthesized based on the sequence of AAV5 viral capsid protein 1 (VP1). AAV5 viral capsid protein 2 (VP2) and AAV5 viral capsid protein 3 (VP3) are also covered by these peptides pools since they are shorter version of VP1 with otherwise identical peptide sequences. Human immunodeficiency virus envelope (HIV) peptide pool (PM-HIV-ENV, JPT Peptide Technologies) was used as a non-responsive peptide pool control.

Meanwhile the stimuli were prepared at 2X and, to each well of a blocked ELISpot plate, 100 \u00b5l of 2X stimuli was added in triplicate for each PBMC sample to be tested. Briefly, the 2X concentrations of all stimuli were prepared as follows: peptide pool stimuli were diluted to either 4 \u00b5g/mL (0.5% DMSO) or 2 \u00b5g/mL (0.25% DMSO), 0.25 ug/mL for the PHA-L positive control, 0.2-0.5% DMSO for the unstimulated negative control, and CTL-Test media alone for the background negative control (containing medium only without PBMCs).

Plate development was stopped with a water wash and the plate was air-dried overnight at RT, avoiding exposure to light. Spots were enumerated using an automated spot counter (ImmunoSpot\u00ae CTL S6 Micro Analyzer; Cellular Technology Limited) within 24-96 h and spot counts are further analyzed as spot forming units (SFU) per well. The Immunospot settings used were a sensitivity of 145 or 187, background balance of 10, spot separation of 1-3, and spot size minimum of 0.0015 to maximum of 9.6296 or 9.6466 mm 2 .

To this end, PBMCs (viability \u2265 70%) from 18 animals were plated at 200,000 cells/well in triplicate wells in medium containing 0.25% DMSO (mock control) and tested once in a total of four assay runs performed by two different analysts. The triplicate mean responses in SFU/well for the DMSO mock responses were determined for all animals and used to statistically establish the LOD. One data point (71 SFU/well for Subject 7) was identified as a statistical outlier using the interquartile range method and thus excluded from the LOD analysis. The Shapiro-Wilk test using data from the remaining 17 animals showed that values were not normally distributed; therefore, the values were log 10 -transformed, resulting in a normal distribution ( Table 1 ). The LOD was then derived as the 95th percentile upper distribution limit using the formula: anti-log [grand mean + (1.645 \u00d7 SD) of log-transformed values] and rounded to the nearest whole number. The validated LOD was calculated as 15 SFU/well, which is equivalent to 75 SFU/million PBMCs. 3 Initial characterization of assay precision. PBMCs from three positive and one negative responders were stimulated with two CMV peptide pools (UL55 and UL83) in three different runs (two sets of triplicates per run) and responses were measured as SFU/well. A Intratriplicate %CVs were plotted against intra-triplicate mean SFU/well responses following UL55 (blue dots) and UL83 (red dots) peptide pool stimulation. B Intra assay %CVs were plotted against intra-assay mean SFU/well responses following UL55 (blue dots) and UL83 (red dots) peptide pool stimulation. C Inter-assay %CVs were plotted against the inter-assay mean SFU/well responses following UL55 (blue dots) and UL83 (red dots) peptide pool stimulation. In all panels, the horizontal dotted lines represent the pre-defined acceptable %CV limit, and the vertical dotted line represents the preliminary LOD value (10 SFU/well).

Using PBMCs from a medium to strong responder to CMV peptides UL83 (Animal 16), ELISpot was performed in triplicate wells in three different runs at seven different cell densities (from 400,000 to 6250 cells/well in runs 1 and 3, and 400,000-8188 cells/well in run 2).

Log 10 -transformed values were plotted for cell density on the x-axis and mean SFU/ well response under UL83 stimulation on the y-axis for each run.

There were only two monkeys (both in cohort 1) with cellular immune responses against AAV5 that were low-positive at Day 28 (which was the terminal time point in this cohort, thus no Day 56 result was available); the response was right at the LOD in one animal and remained within 1.5 times of the LOD in the second animal ( Table 6 ) While use of the antigen/mock response ratio was not necessary to adjudicate these positive responses, given that the mock stimulation in both animals remained below the LOD, one of the two animals also achieved a response ratio >1.69 (confirmatory cut point), thus additionally demonstrating the true-positive nature of the AAV5 response.

            "text": "Since no formal guidelines exist for ELISpot assays, we considered some of the recommendations from FDA guidance documents and industry white papers for immunogenicity and bioanalytical assays, wherever feasible [39, 40, 43-46, 49, 50] . Generally speaking, a fit-forpurpose ELISpot assay should be sensitive, precise, reproducible between operators, specific, and semi-quantitative; hence, these parameters constituted the focus points of our validation. In the literature, a human IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay using 45 healthy donors utilized 10 SFU/well with 200,000 PBMCs per well as a suitable cutoff for determining a test result to be positive or negative [19] . IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot studies in monkeys have shown low background signals under preimmune conditions (10-50 SFU/million PBMCs) and moderate precision (intra-and inter-assay CV of 21.9% and 24.7%, respectively) [51] . Even though our assay used a lower number of replicates than this previous study, we achieved even higher precision during validation, using three monkeys representing a range from low, medium to high responses to CMV (Table 3) . Nonetheless, we generally consider it acceptable for ELISpots to maintain intraassay assay CVs \u2264 30% for PBMC responses \u2265 30 SFU/ well. Responses below 30 SFU/well do not yield meaningful CV values and would be interpreted as \"low\", regardless of the exact numerical results (see below). In contrast, responses above 30 SFU/well may be further interpreted as \"medium\" or \"high\" and thus require precision to remain \u226430%CV. This semi-quantitative characterization of the magnitude of cellular immune response will enable a better correlation of ELISpot responses with other, orthogonal study assessments. It is therefore critical to validate ELISpot assay precision by including low, medium and high responses to antigenic peptides to cover the full range of potential test results. We propose that a low response in monkey PBMCs would be below 50 SFU/well (<250 SFU/million PBMC), a medium response would be within 50-200 SFU/well (250-1000 SFU/million PBMC), and a high response would be above 200 SFU/well (>1000 SFU/million PBMC). A statistical approach using parametric calculations was employed for validated LOD determination. The 95th percentile distribution limit, or 1.645 times the standard deviation over the mean was chosen to set the LOD, so that the targeted false-positive rate was 5%. This conservative approach is in accordance with screening cut point establishment recommended by regulatory guidance documents for other immunogenicity monitoring assays (FDA/CBER/ CDER Jan 2019) and results in a lower detection cutoff for positive responders compared to other approaches, such as defining the LOD as three times above the SFU of the unstimulated control [8, 31, 52] . Therefore, our approach allows for better detection of low positive responders, as illustrated by the non-clinical case study (Fig. 4) : The two positive responders in this study would have been missed by using a higher detection cutoff. This conservative approach was also deemed more appropriate over standard practice to detect the anticipated low T cell responses in monkeys, given that cellular immune responses in previous AAV studies have been reported as minimal [4, 8] . Despite using a different statistical approach, our LOD value corresponded well with other published validated LODs [36] .",

To discern peptide-specific responses in PBMC samples from high nonspecific background, we validated a confirmatory cut point using the responses ratio between a peptide-stimulated and mock-stimulated PBMC sample. This confirmatory cut point will only be used to determine the specificity of a peptide response, if both peptide and mock stimulation resulted in responses \u2265 LOD. In all other cases, a response to peptides \u2265 LOD will suffice to adjudicate the samples as positive, in order to preserve the maximal sensitivity of the assay.",

When employed for detection of gene therapy-directed cellular immune responses, the assay continued to show sensitive, precise, and specific performance. In this study, all animals developed anti-AAV5 antibodies after administration of the gene therapy vector (data not shown), thus confirming the induction of a humoral immune response against the capsid. T cell responses typically peak at 7-15 days after initial antigen stimulation, followed by memory cell formation for long-term immunity [54] . Memory T cells remain detectable in ELISpot assays, since they can be re-stimulated with peptide antigens. Surprisingly, we identified only 2 of 36 monkeys that were low positive on Day 28 post-dose for cellular immune responses against the AAV capsid. At the remaining time points (Day 13 and 56), no ELISpot responses were detected, suggesting that no significant T cell immune responses to AAV5 or TGP had been induced in most study animals. As a control, we frequently observed positive responses in PBMCs stimulated with CMV-derived UL55 or UL83 peptides, demonstrating that the assay can detect re-activated T cells against viral antigens.",

Interestingly, recent studies indicated that selectively enriching and expanding sub-populations of PBMCs prior to ELISpot testing can offer better resolution to identify cellular immune responses to AAV (Vandamme et al., [30] ; Verdera et al. [55] ). These innovative approaches could be valuable and should be considered for nextgeneration immune-monitoring assays used in nonclinical studies. ELISpot assays are typically performed in a 96-well or 384-well plates pre-coated with an anti IFN-\u03b3 antibody, making them well-suited for high-through-put applications. In our experience, the assay was highly reproducible across analysts, laboratory test sites, or run times for stimulation with both negative (DMSO-mock) and positive controls (PHA, UL55 or UL83 peptide). We noticed, however, that the substrate development time should be strictly kept at 3 min \u00b1 15 s to achieve uniform spot counts across different experiments. Data acquisition and analysis can be easily standardized from plate scanning to final result calculations. One limitation of ELISpot assays is that they require three consecutive days from start to finish, but the actual hands-on time per day decreases substantially after the first day.",

            "text": "Using the validated monkey IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay described herein, we found that there may not always be clear and direct impact of cellular immune responses on AAV gene therapy outcomes. We chose to focus on IFN-\u03b3 secretion, as this cytokine is a commonly used marker, broadly associated with many cellular immune responses. Simultaneous detection of multiple cytokines including Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and other analytes has advantages over single cytokine measurements, but we believe that this still requires a definitive identification of suitable markers with actual clinical relevance. In particular, TNF-\u03b1 may also be released in a non-antigen-specific fashion by pre-activated T cells, and even by non-T cells, such as NK or NKT cells among the PBMCs. In a recent AAV5 clinical study, it was demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1 monitoring, did not offer an advantage over IFN-\u03b3 monitoring, as neither of them consistently correlated with liver enzyme elevations. (Long et al., [10] , in revision, unpublished data on file at BioMarin). Therefore, further evaluation of the clinical relevance of TNF-\u03b1 or other cytokines is needed. Direct measurements of cytotoxicity markers (perforin or granzyme secretion) in ELISpots may be useful to supplement immune monitoring by IFN-\u03b3. Our preliminary experiments using human PBMCs, however, indicated that these markers are not released in sufficient quantity using the ELISpot assay format described herein (data not shown). In summary, we describe the comprehensive bioanalytical validation of a reliable method to measure IFN-\u03b3 secretion in monkey PBMCs, in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AAV gene therapies in nonclinical studies.",
