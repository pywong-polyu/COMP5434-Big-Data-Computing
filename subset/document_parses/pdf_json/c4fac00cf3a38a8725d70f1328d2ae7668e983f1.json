Methods Violent crime data from the Miami-Dade Central Records Bureau were analyzed. The Local Indicators of Spatial Association statistics and a space-time permutation statistic were used to identify clusters of violent crimes and outliers, and Global Moran's I tool was used to assess spatial patterning in violent crime. Neighborhood disadvantage data were obtained from the American Community Survey 5year estimates linked with arrest locations. Results Violent crime arrests fell by 7.1% in 2020. Arrests were concentrated in predominantly Black disadvantaged neighborhoods in the northern part, and similar results were produced for core clusters by the two cluster techniques with positive global Moran's I for all study years. Although accounting for only 17% of the county population, nearly half of violent crime arrests were for Black or African American. Males comprised most violent crime arrests. Conclusions Crime prevention and intervention efforts should be focused on both highrisk places and offenders.",

Of particular concern is the effect of the dual stress incited by \"facing a pandemic\" and \"shelter-inplace orders\" on mental health (Du et al., 2020) , raising concerns about the safety and well-being of people experiencing violence and abuse within relationships (Evans, 2020) . However, the evidence of \"shelter-in-place orders\" on crime has been mixed, with some studies reporting decreases in crime (Ashby, 2020; Boman and Gallupe, 2020) , while others report increases in specific types of crime such as homicide (Rosenfeld and Lopez, 2020) and domestic violence , with mixed findings regarding associated predictors (Campedelli et al., 2020a, b) . Reducing different types of violence is a priority of Healthy People 2030 (Healthy People 2020, 2019), and therefore represents an important area of criminological inquiry.",

For example, recent studies in the USA have documented important relationships between the pandemic and the reduction in crime, including with police activities (e.g., de-emphasizing certain types of crimes such as drugs) (Sisak et al., 2020) , and policing demands (Laufs and Waseem, 2020) . This combined may have contributed in a change in the opportunities for crime and fewer arrests (Melamed and Newall, 2020) , especially at the outset of the pandemic when people were ordered to shelter in place.",

            "text": "Previous investigated risk factors for crime include substance use, economic stress, financial stress, and food insecurity (Gibbs et al., 2018) , and many of these factors are likely to worsen in the context of a pandemic (Evans, 2020) , with increases in exposure to various types of strainful events (Agnew, 1992) and changes in routine activities (Cohen and Felson, 1979) . Furthermore, crime in one area can disproportionately impact on residents of adjacent communities' well-being (Kling, Liebman, and Katz, 2001) . Moreover, neighborhoods also have diverse features in relation to crime and crime types (e.g., burglary or gun violence) (Felson, Jiang and Xu, 2020; Moise, 2020c) . To note, one recent study observed that while burglaries declined during the COVID-19 pandemic for some US cities such as Austin, Los Angeles, Memphis, and San Francisco, they did not decrease for Boston or Louisville (Ashby, 2020) . Other researchers report an increase in auto theft in St. Louis and Chicago (McDonald and Balkin, 2020; Campedelli et al., 2020a, b) , while in Los Angeles, a reduction in crime (e.g., robbery, shoplifting, theft, and battery) was observed (Campedelli, Aziani and Favarin, 2020a) , suggesting that solutions for one neighborhood may be different from those for another neighborhood (Moise, 2020b) . Therefore, for those working towards prevention of violent crime, understanding time trends in crime during the pandemic and related consequences including knowledge of the geographic distribution of violent crime offenders is increasingly important, not only to improve community safety and health equity but also to improve the design of targeted place-based strategies (Braga and Schnell, 2013; Moise, 2020c) . Therefore, there is potential to use geospatial approaches to better understand the distribution of crime and crime types, and variation in the strength of neighborhood level predictors particularly neighborhood disadvantage across socioeconomically diverse communities such as those in Miami-Dade County, Florida. In this regard, social disorganization theory (Sampson and Groves, 1989; Sherman, Gartin and Buerger, 1989) continues to serve as an important theoretical perspective in explaining neighborhood crime. This coupled with advances in geospatial analyses has not just highlighted the concentration of crime at specific places (Weisburd, Morris and Groff, 2009; Moise, 2020c) , but also helped to identify factors common to those places with high levels of crime concentration. Yet, previous studies are limited to large-scale analyses, mainly cities, thereby potentially obfuscating the extent to which crime varies at a more fine-grained scale or unit of analysis (Campedelli et al., 2020a, b) . In our study area, prior work has linked arrestee factors and a neighborhood greenness index with weapon-related violent crime at the block group level. What is less clear is the nature of how the COVID-19 lockdown has affected violent crime or how neighborhood differences in violent crime arrestees vary or form patterns across socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. In addition, to our knowledge, no study has systematically assessed whether and how the relationship between violent crime and neighborhood disadvantage differs in Miami-Dade County, Florida-especially during the pandemic and its policy lockdowns. Studying this issue within Miami-Dade County is of particular interest and importance because of its (1) unique ethnic and racial makeup that has come to form concentrated racial and ethnic enclaves and (2) the county's long-standing history of violence, especially firearm violence (Zebib, Stoler, and Zakrison, 2017) .",

The second objective explores the relationship between neighborhood (census tracts) predictors and violent crime clusters using a socioeconomic status (SES) index.

Specifically, to create a SES index for each census tract, we obtained measures at the census tract from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. These measures were selected based on previously published criminology, public health, and health geography methods (Krieger et al., 2003; Krieger, 1992; Sampson, Raudenbush and Earls, 1997; Friedson and Sharkey, 2015) , and are representative of the occupational, income, wealth, and educational characteristics of residents in each census tract. Measures included the (1) percentage of persons in the labor force who are unemployed, (2) percentage of persons living below the poverty level, (3) median household income, (4) median value of owner-occupied dwellings, and (5) percentage of persons 25 years of age or older with less than a 12th grade education. In addition, we included the (6) percentage of persons 25 years of age or older completing four or more years of college, and (7) the percentage of households that average one or more persons per room. We then used principal component analysis to ascertain the weighting of each variable within the component, with \"individual component values estimated by summing the weighted scores to reach the component\" (Moise, 2019) . Finally, we standardized the continuous range of SES index scores to allow census tract to be scored on a 0-100 scale, with lower values indicating concentrated disadvantage and higher values indicated concentrated advantage at the component level.",
