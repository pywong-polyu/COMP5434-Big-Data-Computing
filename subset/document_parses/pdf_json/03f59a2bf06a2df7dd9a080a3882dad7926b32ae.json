In the first quarter of 2020, U.S. gross domestic output fell by 4.8% in annualized terms, a decline not seen since the Great Recession. This drop underestimates the full economic impact of the pandemic, as the severity of the crisis became fully apparent to the public and private sectors only in the last few weeks of March 2020. Moreover, the effect has been highly asymmetric: restaurants, entertainment, and travel services have suffered significantly more than food or technology services. Naturally, these declines reflect not only the supplyside disruptions due to the effect of government-mandated lockdowns, but also demand-side factors, including the collapse of global consumer demand and expectations of future government policy.

By supplyside disruptions we are referring to disruptions that prevented certain businesses from operating effectively during the pandemic, including disruptions in the production process, difficulties in delivering their product or service to the final customer, and reluctance of consumers to purchase the service due to fears of the pandemic. 1 Our starting point is the assumption that industries in which a higher fraction of the labor force can work remotely are likely to experience less-severe disruptions in their business operations. We build on prior research and construct a metric of industry exposure to the lockdowns using information on the share of the workforce that can work from home (Dingel and Neiman 2020; Alon et al. 2020) . Specifically, we follow Alon et al. (2020) and exploit data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) of 2017 and 2018, in which workers disclose the extent to which they are able to and have historically had experience working remotely. As noted by Alon et al. (2020) , occupations vary immensely in the proportion of workers who report that they are able to telecommute-ranging from 3% for transportation and material moving to 78% for computer programmers. We aggregate these survey responses to build measures of exposure across industries and groups of workers.",

For example, Software Publishers (NAICS 5112) have an exposure of just 0.38, since much of the production work can be done remotely.

Specifically, local governments typically deem certain industries as critical, namely those that provide \"essential infrastructure.\" Thus, we also manually classify some industries as \"critical.\" Since the definition of critical industries varies greatly across states, we aim to be conservative, classifying as critical those industries related to the production and sale of food and beverages, utilities, pharmacies, transportation, waste collection and disposal, 1 One could argue that the consumer reluctance is a demand-side effect. We disagree. Reluctance to consume inperson services in the pandemic did not result from a shift in consumer preferences or wealth effects. It resulted from firms' inability to deliver these services without the risk of infection. We label this a supply-side effect. That said, we cannot rule out the possibility that firms whose workers cannot easily work from home also faced above-average exposure to demand shocks triggered by the decline in aggregate demand. However, personal income actually rose during the recession across the board (due to personal transfers). As such, we believe that it is unlikely that demand-side forces are driving our findings. and some healthcare and financial services. Data on foot traffic from SafeGraph validate our construction: establishments in industries deemed critical experience significantly smaller declines in traffic than establishments in noncritical industries, while before the pandemic, from January to February 2020, trends in foot traffic in critical industries were nearly identical to those in noncritical industries. Armed with a measure of industry exposure to these supply-side disruptions, we can answer several important questions regarding the economic impact of the pandemic. Focusing on cross-sectional differences in the feasibility of remote work (COVID-19 work exposure) allows us to isolate the direct impact of the shutdown from other economic forces that would otherwise affect industries across the economy symmetrically.",

In terms of employment, we find that sectors with a larger fraction of workers who cannot work remotely-higher COVID-19 work exposureexperienced significantly larger declines in employment than sectors where more of the workforce can perform tasks remotely. The differences are economically sizable: an increase of one standard deviation in our COVID-19 work exposure measure is associated with an approximately 7% larger decline in employment since April of 2019. The effects of exposure are starker when we restrict the sample to noncritical industries (10%).

Given the delays in the availability of data on firms' real activity, we complement data on realized outcomes for 2020 with changes in a set of forward-looking variables that capture future expectations about fundamentals: revisions in analyst forecasts of expected revenue growth, the expected probability of default, and firm survey responses. We find that firms in sectors that are more likely to experience work disruptions also fare significantly worse in terms of these measures during the 2020 pandemic: an increase of one standard deviation in our COVID-19 exposure metric is associated with an 8% decline in analyst revenue forecasts for Q2 and an increase of 0.30 percentage points in the probability of default over the next 2 years. These magnitudes account for a significant share of cross-industry differences in outcomes during this period. Importantly, while financial analysts expect the worst effects to be short lived, our work exposure variable is still a significant predictor of differences in expected revenue growth over the next 2 years, though magnitudes are significantly muted over this longer time horizon. Similar patterns emerge in the differences in projected revenue for noncritical versus critical industries. While analysts project that the annual revenues of firms in noncritical industries will decline by 13%, 10%, and 8% for 2020, 2021, and 2022 , respectively, these same projected declines are 3.2%, 2.5%, and 2.3% for firms in critical industries. While the relationship between longer-run growth projections and exposure is slightly attenuated following positive vaccine news near the end of 2020, substantial differences persist throughout the pandemic period we study. Last, firm-level surveys confirm that our COVID-19 exposure measure is predictive of economic hardship during the pandemic: it is indicative of both employee layoffs and insufficient liquidity.",

A key advantage of financial market variables is that they are available at high frequencies. To this end, we use financial market data to construct a real-time indicator of supply-side disruptions. In particular, we use daily data on stock returns to construct a portfolio that is maximally exposed to the COVID-19 work disruption using the methodology of Fama and MacBeth (1973) . The resulting ''COVID-19\" factor has a long-short portfolio interpretation. It overweights industries whose workers cannot work remotely and underweights industries whose workers can perform their tasks from home.

            "text": "Comparing the performance of the stock market to the real economy in 2020 reveals an apparent disconnect. After falling sharply in late February and early March, the stock market almost fully recovers its losses by the middle of the summer. By contrast, the economy is still in a severe recession, as evidenced by high unemployment rates. Our measure sheds some light on this pattern: the composition of listed firms in the stock market is heavily tilted towards industries with low work exposure. As an illustration, we note that when industries are weighted by the market capitalization of listed firms the average industry has an exposure of only 66%, which is considerably lower than the 87% obtained by weighting the same set of industries according to a measure of employment which includes all firms (publicly and privately held) in the sector. Likewise, stock market indices that weigh industries according to the same measure of employment are almost 10 percentage points lower than a market capitalization-weighted index as of midyear, and around 6 percentage points lower as of December 2020. So far, our analysis indicates that the supply-side disruptions are economically large and are responsible for substantial heterogeneity in outcomes across sectors. Our results thus complement the work of Barrero et al. (2021) , which points out that COVID-19 is also a reallocation shock. The relative differences that we uncover validate this view: the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to having aggregate effects, leads to a reallocation of Review of Asset Pricing Studies / v 0 n 0 2021 resources away from sectors in which remote work is infeasible toward sectors where workers can continue to work remotely.",

Among all affected groups, we find that the employment status of female workers with young children and without a college degree is most sensitive: in the cross-section of workers, an increase of one standard deviation in our COVID-19 work exposure measure is associated with a 15% probability of nonemployment for these workers, which is more than three times the magnitude of the baseline coefficient.

            "text": "In response to the pandemic, the U.S. government authorized significant fiscal responses. A key component of the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a direct subsidy to firms that took the form of forgivable loans. Our exposure measure can also help judge the efficiency of this response: one might expect that larger amounts of aid would be allocated to the most exposed industries. Perhaps surprisingly, we find the opposite In particular, we find that almost all small firms applied for PPP financing. Importantly, however, PPP funds are allocated in proportion to total payroll expenses. Since higher-paid employees are more likely to be able to work remotely, tying financing to payroll expenses has the (likely unintended) consequence of allocating more federal funds to the least-affected sectors. For instance, firms in the professional and technical services sectors, one of the least-exposed sectors, received more than $12,400 per employee. By contrast, firms in the accommodation and food services sector, one of the most disrupted sectors, receive approximately $5,000 per worker. Using data at the individual loan level, we find that a change of one standard deviation in our measure of work exposure is associated with a 17% decline in the average loan size per employee. When we limit the sample to noncritical industries, this decline increases to 19%. This negative correlation between the amount of federal aid and the degree workers were affected by the pandemic is likely at odds with an optimal policy prescription (see, e.g. Guerrieri et al. 2020) but consistent with evidence from Granja et al. (2020) suggesting that PPP loans do not disproportionately flow to regions which are more adversely affected. Given the fact that lower-income workers have higher marginal propensities to consume, a more targeted intervention likely would have been a more efficient use of federal funds in stimulating aggregate output (see Kaplan and Violante 2018 , for a review of the literature).",

(2020) and Koren and Peto (2020) , who explore how the feasibility of remote work combined with measures of high physical proximity requirements relate to differential outcomes across workers. Though the first part of our analysis also explores worker-level outcomes, our primary focus is on firms. In contemporaneous work, Pagano, Wagner, and Zechner (2020) examine how the measure developed in Koren and Peto (2020) is related to differences in stock market performance and argue that \"pandemic risk\" is priced in the 2014-19 period. Our focus instead is on understanding ex post heterogeneity in economic outcomes. In this regard, we view our work as complementary.",

Our starting point is the simple premise that supply-side disruptions are likely to be more severe in occupations/industries for which workers have had little-to-no ability to telework or experience with telework in the past. Accordingly, our measure of industry exposure to work disruptions due to COVID-19 builds on Alon et al. (2020) , which uses data from the Leave and Job Flexibilities module of the ATUS in 2017 and 2018 (containing 10,040 observations in total) regarding workers' ability to work from home and past experiences with working from home. Our preferred measure utilizes responses to two different questions from the ATUS, though the module also includes several additional questions about reasons for and frequency of remote work. We obtain the ATUS microdata from Integrated Public Use Microdata Series. 3 Crucially, the survey draws a distinction between workers who are able to telecommute and those who are not, as opposed to those who regularly telecommute and those who do not, as the former is the relevant metric during a pandemic. 4 From these questions, we construct an occupation/ industry-level metric of the fraction of workers in each occupation that should, in principle, be able to work from home. The first major question asks for a yes/no reply to the following: \"As part of your (main) job, can you work at home?\" Using the survey's person weights, approximately 78% of households answer yes to this question. Alon et al. (2020) use this question to identify the share of workers in a given occupation that are able to telecommute and examine the share of workers in various demographic groups who are employed in occupations that can be performed from home.",

In our view, this question provides a sharper classification of workers who will more likely be able to perform the majority of their job responsibilities from home, as opposed to only a subset of tasks (e.g., answering emails/phone calls) remotely. For example, 64% of computer and information systems managers (Census occupation code 110) say that they can work from home, and 47% of them have worked days entirely from home. These same proportions are 59% and just 13%, respectively, for medical and health services managers (occupation 350), a group that, in our view, is a part of a population of workers who are more likely to be unable to work full time from home effectively. 5 We classify a surveyed worker as \"able to work from home\" if they answer \"yes\" to both questions above. We then compute measures of industry and occupation exposure by aggregating these survey responses across employees according to the industry and occupation codes that appear in the ATUS. Our measure of industry exposure is COVID \u00c0 19 Work Exposure I \u00bc 1 \u00c0 % of workers able to work from home I ; (1) which is computed as a weighted average of individual-level responses aggregated so as to be nationally representative using the person weights from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). If fewer than five survey respondents are directly employed in a given Census industry, we instead extrapolate using a weighted average of occupation-based measures. 6 Given that individuals' occupations likely provide a more accurate description of the types of tasks performed on a daily basis, relative to looking at the industry which employs them, we elect to use the occupation-based measure in person-level regressions below, though we obtain similar results if we use the industry-based measure. In general, we also find similar results if we use the more inclusive Alon et al. (2020) measure instead.",

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides guidelines to states about what kinds businesses should remain open. Keeping track of essential industries can enhance our analysis because it may be irrelevant if their workers can telecommute if a business is allowed to stay open. We start with Pennsylvania's guidelines largely because the state provides a list of essential industries at the four-digit NAICS (2017) level based on the CISA guidance. 8 These industries primarily correspond to the production and sale of food and beverages, utilities, pharmacies, transportation, waste collection and disposal, and some healthcare and financial services.",

First the classification of essential industries seems too coarse in certain cases. For instance, the NAICS code 4831, Deep Sea, Coastal, and Great Lakes Water Transportation, is listed as essential by Pennsylvania. While some of the firms in this industry are shipping companies, the largest firms in this industry are cruise ships, which clearly are not permitted to maintain business as usual in a pandemic. Second, the CISA list is overly inclusive in what types of industries are classified as providing critical infrastructure. We remove industries from the critical list that faced severe restrictions on operating at a scale close to or even higher than pre-pandemic baselines. For example, restaurants, restaurant suppliers, and airlines are permitted to remain open, but the volume of their business dramatically declines due to quarantines and heavy restrictions on domestic and international travel. While some restaurants remain open for curbside and/or takeout service, it is apparent that their activities are substantially restricted during lockdowns. We have also classified industries as noncritical if they are auxiliary to such firms (such as firms in NAICS code 4244, Grocery and Related Product Merchant Wholesalers, which largely deliver food supplies to restaurants). We exclude critical insustries from the bulk of our empirical analysis, and so we view our decision to narrow the scope of critical industries as conservative. 9 Table A .1 provides our list of critical industries.",

In the case of manufacturing, for example, the CISA guidelines state that the following workers should be deemed critical: \"Workers necessary for the manufacturing of metals (including steel and aluminum), industrial minerals, semiconductors, materials and products needed for medical supply chains and for supply chains associated with transportation, aerospace, energy, communications, information technology, food and agriculture, chemical manufacturing, nuclear facilities, wood products, commodities used as fuel for power generation facilities, the operation of dams, water and wastewater treatment, processing and reprocessing of solid waste, emergency services, and the defense industrial base.\" (p. 17).",

However, as most other manufacturing NAICS4 codes represent industries that manufacture both products that would fit into the above categories and those that would not, we have largely chosen to designate the remainder of the manufacturing industries as noncritical. 10 We are grateful to SafeGraph for making the data freely available to our research team and the broader community for COVID-19-related work.

For more than 5 million points of interest (POIs), we observe aggregated daily activity of users in the panel. As activity exhibits strong within-week seasonal patterns, we aggregate the data to the weekly level. Given our focus on workers' ability to telecommute, we focus on visits to POIs that last for 4 hours or more, which we will refer to as \"worker foot traffic.\" 11 For each four-digit industry, we compare activity in week t with a baseline level of average activity: the mean of weekly activity over the period beginning with the week of January 6-12 and ending with the week of February 10-16. In the baseline period, the median NAICS4 industry receives 18,705 worker visits per week, and the distribution of activity is highly right skewed, with the 90th, 95th and 99th percentiles having 560,000, 1.03 million, and 5.60 million hits, respectively. If our classification of industries that provide critical infrastructure is accurate, we would expect to see a significantly smaller decline in foot traffic in critical industries than in noncritical ones starting from the middle of March 2020, when COVID-19 awareness and state-mandated lockdowns go into effect. To test this hypothesis, we then aggregate foot traffic across all POIs to the NAICS4 level so as to match our critical industry classification. Specifically, we estimate log Total Worker Foot Traffic in Week t in Industry I Pre \u00c0 period Average Worker Foot Traffic of Industry I \u00bc a t \u00fe d t Critical Industry I \u00fe e I;t :",

Both sets of industries follow essentially identical trends in January and early February 2020, then experience a significant decline in foot traffic, which dramatically accelerates in the middle of March. Though the COVID-19 pandemic affects almost all establishments, we can see that the decline is smaller for industries classified as critical. Panel B examines the differences in traffic between the two industries by plotting the estimated coefficient d t in Equation (2) above. It shows that the decline in worker foot traffic is around 20% smaller for industries that we identified as providing critical infrastructure.

Panel C provides strong evidence in support of this hypothesis: a 1% increase in the fraction of workers who cannot work remotely is associated with 1%-1.5% higher foot traffic throughout the month of April. In contrast, exposure is not correlated with changes in foot traffic in noncritical industries during the same period, which is consistent with the requirement that all workers in noncritical industries work remotely regardless of feasibility constraints. Figure 2 plots the distribution of the COVID-19 work exposure measure for critical and noncritical NAICS4 industries. Note that most industries have relatively high values of COVID-19 work exposure, with averages of approximately 0.85 for critical and 0.87 for noncritical industries. More importantly, however, we see there is considerable dispersion in our measure: the crosssectional standard deviation is approximately 17%. The bulk of our paper explores the extent to which these cross-sectional differences are predictive of differential economic outcomes during the pandemic. Table 1 illustrates how our industry exposure measure is related to firm characteristics. Due to data availability, we include only publicly listed firms. Panel A shows results for all industries, while panel B shows the same measure for the noncritical industry subsample. Three patterns stand out. First, we see that firms in the high-exposure category tend to be larger. For instance, focusing on the subsample of noncritical industries, the median firm in the top quartile of the COVID-19 work exposure measure has 4,900 employees; by comparison, the median firm in the bottom quartile has 1,500 employees. Second, there is some evidence that firms in the least-exposed industries have more intangibles than firms in the most-exposed industries: firms in the least-exposed industries have higher market valuations (median Tobin's Q in noncritical industries of 2.3 for the most exposed versus 1.3 for the least exposed), have lower ratios of physical capital (property, plant and equipment [PPE]) to book assets (0.16 versus 0.58 for the least-and most-exposed industries, respectively), and spend significantly more on research and develoment (R&D) and selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) than firms in the most-exposed industries. 13 This is consistent with the view that firms with more intangibles have more jobs that can be done remotely than firms that rely more on physical assets. Last, firms in the most-exposed industries are more profitable in terms of bottom-line accounting measures (return on assets), but this difference is driven by higher spending on intangibles and/or fixed costs by firms in the least-exposed industries.",

As such, the variation in SG&A could also reflect differences in operating leverage (importance of fixed costs) or accounting practices. economic performance across industries and individual workers.

Since the sizes of these industries vary greatly, depending on the specification, we also present results in which we weight industries using total employment as of the baseline period used to calculate each growth rate. Last, we report results either using the full sample, or by excluding the critical industries listed in Table A .1. Table 2 and Figure 3 present our results. Examining panels A and B of the table, we see an economically and statistically significant correlation between our exposure measure and industry-wide declines in employment that is robust across different specifications. In particular, an increase of one standard deviation in our COVID-19 work exposure measure is associated with a 5.6% to 10.3% greater decline in employment. The magnitudes are comparable for monthly and annual growth rates and are larger when we exclude critical industries and weight industries by their total employment. These magnitudes are quite significant and comparable to either the average decline in employment during this period (14%) or the cross-sectional standard deviation (17%). In panel C, we also report the differences in average employment growth rates between industries which we classify as critical versus noncritical. On an employment-weighted basis, monthly declines in employment are more than 5 times larger in noncritical industries (-22.5%) relative to critical ones (-4.08%). Figure 4 , panel A, provides a more aggregated summary of the relationship between our exposure measure and BLS year-on-year employment growth.

Given that the average probability of default over these horizons is 0.26% and 1.38%, respectively, these magnitudes are quite substantial. We also observe that, consistent with earlier evidence, these increases in default risk are considerably higher for noncritical industries relative to critical industries. 17 Panel A reports the coefficient estimates for the regression of change in default probability for noncritical industries from February to May 2020 on COVID-19 work exposure (see Equation (8)) where the dependent variables are constructed using firm data from Compustat and the RMI Credit Research Database, aggregated to the NAICS4 level (t-statistics in parantheses).

Each week, the Census sends an electronic survey to a large sample of small businesses and reports statistics which are aggregated across respondents by NAICS3 sector. 18 The SBPS contains several questions on whether the firm is experiencing material hardship during the pandemic. We assume that a firm is experiencing a major disruption if it responds to the question \"Overall, how has business been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic?\" with an answer of \"large negative effect.\" At the mean level of exposure, 49% of firms indicate that the pandemic has had a large negative effect. Next, we consider whether a firm has reduced its employee headcount or hours in the last week, which is captured by answers of \"yes, decreased\" to the questions \"in the last week, did this business have a change in the number of paid employees?\" and \"in the last week, did this business have a change in the total number of hours worked by paid employees?\"",

Comparing these revenue realizations to their forecasts at the onset of the pandemic in Figure 5 , we note that analyst forecasts were fairly accurate regarding these aggregate effects for calendar year 2020.",

Further, the point estimates are somewhat larger for noncritical industries relative to critical industries. Focusing on the third column-which includes controls for worker gender, age, education, prior earnings, and firm size-an increase of one standard deviation in our measure is associated with a 4.5 percentage point increase in the probability of a worker in a noncritical industry being without employment in April 2020, compared to a 1.0 percentage point increase for a worker in a critical industry; the difference is, however, stastically not significantly different from zero.

Examining the results we note that none of the coefficients of interest are statistically different from zero. We next allow the coefficient b on the COVID-19 work exposure measure in Equation (9) to vary with worker characteristics Z i . In all specifications with interactions, we include dummies for all levels of the categorical variable of interest as controls. Doing so reveals how the employment status of different workers varies in response to the same level of work disruption due to In additional specifications, we verify that many of these patterns persist even if we include occupation and/or industry fixed effects, implying that we can detect similar differences even within occupations/industries. These results are suppressed for brevity and are available upon request. Table reports the coefficient estimates from the regression where we model the probability that a worker is employed in April (first three data columns) or February (last three column) 2020 as a function of COVID-19 work exposure and selected worker characteristics (see Equation (9)).

A one-standard-deviation increase in exposure is associated with a 9.2 percentage point increase in the likelihood of nonemployment for workers at the bottom quartile of the earnings distribution, as compared to just a 1.6 percentage point increase for workers in the top quartile. The fact that we see such a differential response of employment status to the feasibility of remote work for employees with different earnings levels has several possible interpretations. One possibility is that firms try to retain their most able-and highest paid-employees and reduce employment for workers of lower skill levels first. Moreover, in addition to these differences in slope coefficients, low-income workers tend to be less able to work remotely: average exposure is 1.0%, 3.2%, and 7.7% higher for workers in income quartile 1 relative to workers in quartiles 2, 3, and 4, respectively.",

Panels C and D condition on gender as well as college attainment and whether or not the household has at least one child under the age of 14. In both cases, we see that estimated sensitivities for women are large relative to those of men, though these differences are not always statistically significant. Workers without college degrees have higher estimated coefficients. In panel D, we observe that, while men with young children who work in noncritical industries have smaller coefficients than men without young children, the opposite appears to be the case for women with young children. The 7.7 percentage point difference in coefficients between men and women with young children is highly significant (t-statistic \u00bc 3.4). 22 Panel E shows that these gender differences do not merely reflect the gender pay gap. More importantly though, panel E reveals that the employment status of female workers is more sensitive to work disruptions than the status of male workers for all income levels. Panel F shows that the workers most adversely affected by work disruptions are female workers with young children and without a college degree. For this group, an increase of one standard deviation in our COVID-19 work exposure measure is associated with about a 15 percentage point increase in nonemployment, which is three times higher than the average response among all workers.",

Barrero et al. (2021) . These results also demonstrate that investors could construct significantly hedge portfolio exposure to future COVID-19 related uncertainty by taking a short position in our COVID-19 factor. 25 To better understand which parts of the portfolio are driving the returns, we form five value-weighted portfolios using information on exposure and critical-industry status. Figure 13 presents industry returns across different quintiles of exposure. The first portfolio includes all critical industries, while the remaining four portfolios sort noncritical firms into four groups according to our exposure measure. We choose the breakpoints so that approximately 25% of the market value of noncritical firms is associated with each bin as of February 14, 2020. Panel A shows cumulative returns since the start of 2020. The solid black line plots the value-weighted return of all companies included in our sample, and Panel B shows how stocks have performed relative to this market index since February 14. 26 We see that during the last 2 weeks of February, critical industries performed modestly better than other industries, and we do not see major differences across the portfolios sorted by COVID exposure. However, starting in early March, there are persistent, substantial differences in cumulative returns between firms with different (11) in blue, which correspond to cumulative returns to a long-short portfolio (weighted by exposure, see Fama and MacBeth [1973] ), here labeled as the COVID-19 factor. These implied portfolio returns are accumulated since the beginning of the year. The red line represents cumulative returns to the market portfolio during this period. Events are dated as if they occurred at the beginning of the trading day on the date of their announcement. levels of exposure, with returns being inversely related to exposure. The spreads between the most-and least-exposed industries peak at around 25% in mid-March and only shrink slightly into early June.

First, the most severe effects of the pandemic recession on overall activity are likely to be fairly transitory in nature, whereas stock prices capitalize the entire present discounted value of future profits of listed firms. Second, both short-and longterm interest rates have declined following large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus, a force that pushes valuations higher, ceteris paribus. Third, listed companies tend to be larger, and small firms are thought to be more exposed to the fallout from the virus.

As an alternative approach intended to more accurately reflect the industry mix of the broader nonfinancial corporate sector, we construct industry weights using NAICS4 employment totals as of 2017 from the Census Bureau's Statistics of U.S. Businesses database. 27 We construct a statistical test for the difference between the market valueweighted and employment means by appending two copies of the dataset, where each copy is associated with a distinct set of weights. We then run a pooled (weighted) regression of each industry outcome on an indicator variable equal to 1 for the copy using value weights and equal to 0 for the copy using employment weights, with standard errors clustered at the industry level.

When we weight industries according to their market values, average COVID-19 exposure is only 66%, 21 percentage points lower (t \u00bc 4.8) than the 87% mean which obtains when we instead use employment weights. The stock market is considerably less exposed to the supply-side shock than the overall economy; moreover, some larger companies (e.g., Amazon.com) have benefited substantially from the sectoral reallocations induced by the pandemic. As an example, the employment share for the information sector (NAICS 51) is only 3.5%, whereas this sector comprises 24% of the market cap of listed firms as of February 2020. Even within the broader (NAICS2) technology sector, the composition of firms is tilted towards less-exposed NAICS4 industries: employment-and market-cap-weighted exposures are 56% and 43%, respectively. A similar pattern emerges for manufacturing industries , which make up about 48% of the total market cap of nonfinancial industries included in our analysis (versus only about 11% of 27 Note that these are buy-and-hold indices.

As both of these sectors experienced larger market declines relative to overall market indices, our value-weighted index actually shows an even stronger rebound relative to others such as the S&P 500 index. employment). While the employment-weighted average exposure is 85%, the market-cap-weighted exposure of listed firms in these industries is 66%. Table 7 and Figure 16 report related weighted means for cumulative stock market returns and analyst forecast revisions at various horizons, measured at different dates during the pandemic. Figure 16 presents the same outcomes at a monthly frequency from Feburary 21st onwards. As of March 20th, near the market trough, the employment-weighted index is down by 39%, which is about 7.4 percentage points more than the market-cap-weighted index. This gap, which is statistically significant at all dates, widens to about 10 percentage points at the later horizons. We observe a similar picture for revenue forecast revisions (after allowing for some potential lag for analysts to update them). Across essentially all horizons, as of June 19, declines in the employment-weighted average forecasts are usually about 50% larger relative to the market-cap-weighted averages. For instance, the decline in the forecast for 2022 calendar revenue is 7.2% in the former versus 4.6% in the Table provides estimates of overall aggregated stock market performance and percentage revisions in analyst revenue forecasts from February 14, 2020 at various dates in 2020 under two different weighting schemes. First, we weight observations by total employment of publicly and privately held companies as of 2017. Then, we consider an alternative in which we weight each NAICS4 industry by the market cap of firms as of February 14, 2020. We then report the difference and a t-statistic on the difference between the two estimates, which is using a weighted regression with standard errors clustered at the NAICS4 level. Using these same weighting schemes, average COVID-19 Work Exposure is 87% when weighting by employment and 66% when weighting by market cap, where the difference of 21% is associated with a t-statistic of 4.8.",

            "text": "As state and local governments began to impose widespread lockdowns and social-distancing measures, policy makers were quick to respond with fiscal policies intended to limit the damage from the pandemic. While a formal treatment of optimal fiscal transfers is beyond the scope of this paper (see, e.g., Flynn, Patterson, and Sturm 2020, and references therein for a more formal treatment), economic intuition suggests that an optimal insurance policy would provide the highest amount of relief to the hardest-hit businesses-that is, the businesses most likely to cut investment, reduce employment, or shut down operations if they did not receive aid. Here, we explore whether the relief policies implemented in the first half of 2020 appear consistent with this objective. In March 2020, the U.S. Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which included the PPP. The PPP is a $669 billion loan program run by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and intended to help smaller firms during the crisis. This program is the largest component of the fiscal stimulus provided to firms in the U.S. In order to be eligible for PPP financing, firms have to meet a size threshold; according to SBA, any business that, prior to the crisis, had 500 or fewer U.S.-based employees or met SBA's alternative revenue/employment-based size standards is eligible to receive funds. 28 Approved loan amounts vary based on the applicant's average payroll costs, with a $100,000 annualized cap per employee and $10 million cap in total per firm. Most loan disbursements are capped at 2.5 times the firm's average monthly payrolls costs from 2019. SBA guarantees the loans but does not lend directly to firms; rather, firms apply for PPP loans from authorized lenders. Most importantly, SBA forgives the loan if the firm maintains its entire workforce for a minimum of 8 weeks and the loan is only used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest, or utility expenses. Thus PPP is effectively a fiscal transfer to firms. 29 The SBPS we discussed in Section 2.4 asks firms whether they applied for a PPP loan. In particular, the survey asks, \"Since March 13, 2020, has this business requested financial assistance from the following Federal Sources?\" We tabulate the fraction of responses in which the \"Paycheck Protection Program\" box is checked. We would expect that hardest-hit businesses are more likely to apply for PPP funding. The last column of Table 5 and panel F of Figure 7 show 28 In addition to firms, any self-employed person, sole proprietor, independent contractor, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, 501(c)(19) veterans' organization, or tribal business is eligible. Restrictions on size were relaxed for some firms in the Accommodations and Food Services sector (NAICS sector 72). Some firms who had currently or recently defaulted on SBA loans were deemed ineligible. 29 The government has recently taken steps to relax certain requirements of the PPP with the PPP Flexibility Act (PPPFA) passed in early June. Originally, businesses had to spend at least 75% of the loan on payroll alone, but the PPPFA lowered this threshold to 60%. Whereas before firms only had only 8 weeks to spend the entirety of the loan, the PPPFA extended the deadline to the end of 2020, giving firms the flexibility to wait and spend after they have reopened. that this is indeed the case: an increase of one standard deviation in exposure leads to a 3.6 percentage point increase in the likelihood of application. This magnitude is significant but pales in comparison to the intercept: a firm with the average level of exposure has a 75% probability of applying for PPP funds. It is clear that the vast majority of firms apply for PPP funding. But are funds allocated to the most exposed sectors? To answer this question, we examine the correlation between our exposure measure and the total disbursements from the PPP program through July 10, 2020. 30 We augment this information with information at the firm level released by the SBA, which gives a more detailed picture of how the money is allocated. For loans less than $150,000, the SBA reports the exact dollar value of the loan, while for loans larger than $150,000, they report a range of dollar values the loan falls within. The data also include a field called \"jobs saved,\" which we assume corresponds to the number of employees listed on the loan application form. 31 We interpolate the loan values that are not perfectly observed with the arithmetic mean of the endpoints of the bin. We validate this strategy by comparing our interpolated totals aggregated at the state level to published state-level totals, and while these values are quite close, the interpolated aggregates are biased upward relative to the published summary statistics for state-and industrylevel totals. To correct for this bias, we calculate the average percentage miss at the state level and use that to correct the values of the loans that are not perfectly observed. After this correction, our values almost exactly correspond to published totals, as is clear from Figure A .1 in the Appendix.",

However, this sector is one of those least exposed to the disruptions associated with the pandemic: according to our calculations, this sector has the highest fraction of workers who can work remotely. By contrast, more-exposed sectors receive significantly less funding from the PPP program; accommodation and food services and arts, entertainment, and recreation, two of the hardest-hit sectors, receive just $5,000 and $5,400 per worker, respectively.",

            "text": "Overall, we see that the least-affected sectors actually receive more PPP funds than the most-affected sectors. What explains this inefficient provision of insurance? We believe this stems from the fact that the PPP treats all firms identically once they pass its initial screening criteria. Since loans are forgivable, take-up rates for PPP are extremely high and most variation in total lending across eligible firms is driven by caps on benefit amounts. Average earnings per worker are considerably higher in sectors where working remotely is feasible (see, e.g. Dingel and Neiman 2020, and Section 2.1 above). Since benefit amounts are tied to average payroll, sectors with more white-collar workers (and thus higher average compensation) receive more aid per worker. In brief, tying the amount of aid to total payroll has the (likely unintended) consequence of directing a larger share of total spending per employee towards the least-exposed sectors. Table reports summary statistics on PPP loan disbursements by major NAICS sector, along with employment and payroll. Information is taken from the published data at the individual loan level. Payroll data are taken from microdata released by the SBA, which reports number of \"jobs saved\" associated with each loan. The raw employee number is a raw total of this value by sector, while the interpolated employee number is calculated by imputing zero/ missing values with industry \u00c2 loan-size bin averages. The final two columns express total loan disbursements on a per-employee basis by dividing total loan disbursements by each of these total employment figures.",

As we show in Figure 17 and Table 9 , industries that are better able to transition to remote work, and thus experience less supply-side disruption, receive far more dollars per worker than industries that are completely disrupted. An increase of one standard deviation in our exposure measure is associated with a 17.4% decrease in loan value per employee. In dollars, this corresponds to a loss of nearly $1,700 relative to an average loan value of $9,700. Equally striking is that there is no significant difference between the level of aid given to critical and noncritical industries, but the loan values for noncritical industries (which were more disrupted) are actually more sensitive to exposure than those for critical industries: an increase of one standard deviation in our measure is associated with an average decrease in loan value per employee of 13.2% for critical industries and 19.4% for noncritical industries.",

We have provided a measure of ex ante pandemic risk exposures and a list of critical industries that can be used to study a wide array of questions related to firm and worker outcomes during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. 32 Our exposure metrics are highly predictive of heterogeneity in outcomes during the pandemic. Specifically, sectors in which a higher fraction of the workforce is not able to work remotely have experienced significantly greater declines in employment, much larger reductions in expected revenue growth, worse stock market performance, and higher expected likelihood of default. Lower-paid workers, especially female workers with young children, are far more affected by these disruptions. Overall, our results uncover predictable differences in economic outcomes for both workers and firms depending on the ability of their industry to transition to remote work. Importantly, these cross-sectional differences are economically sizable and comparable to the magnitude of the aggregate response. Thus, our findings indicate that the pandemic has an economically significant cross-sectional component that is well captured by our exposure measure.

To the extent that government policy aims to insure firms by smoothing unexpected economic shocks, the PPP fell somewhat short of that goal.

Since higher-paid employees are more likely to be able to work remotely, tying financing to payroll expenses has the (likely unintended) consequence of allocating more federal funds per employee to the least-affected sectors. By restricting eligibility to the most (ex ante) vulnerable sectors, the program could have delivered a similar level of insurance at significantly lower cost.",

Regression coefficients are estimated via iteratively re-weighted least squares, as implemented in the MASS R package (Venables and Ripley, 2002) .
