Early recurrence, defined as tumor recurrence within 6 months of curative surgery, is associated with poor survival, requiring earlier detection and intervention. This study aimed to develop and validate a bedside model based on clinical parameters to predict early recurrence in CRLM patients and provide insight into post-operative surveillance strategies. Material and methods: A total of 202 consecutive CRLM patients undergoing curative surgeries between 2012 and 2019 were retrospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to the training (n \u00bc 150) and validation (n \u00bc 52) sets. Baseline information and radiological, pathological, and laboratory findings were extracted from medical records. Predictive factors for early recurrence were identified via a multivariate logistic-regression model to develop a predictive nomogram, which was validated for discrimination, calibration, and clinical application. Results: Liver-metastases number, lymph-node suspicion, neurovascular invasion, colon/rectum location, albumin and post-operative carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels (CA19-9) were independent predictive factors and were used to construct the nomogram for early recurrence after curative surgery. The area under the curve was 0.866 and 0.792 for internal and external validation, respectively. The model significantly outperformed the clinical risk score and Beppu's model in our data set. In the lift curve, the nomogram boosted the detection rate in post-operative surveillance by two-fold in the top 30% high-risk patients. Conclusion: Our model for early recurrence in CRLM patients after curative surgeries showed superior performance and could aid in the decision-making for selective follow-up strategies.",

In China, CRC is the fifth leading cause of cancer-specific mortality and the third in annual incidence [2] . The incidence of metastatic CRC is fairly high: a quarter present metastasis upon diagnosis, while a half develop metastasis later during the course of the disease [3, 4] . The liver is the most frequent site of metastasis [5] . For resectable CRC liver metastases (CRLM), hepatic excision is considered the most effective method to reach potential cure and long-term survival [6, 7] . Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy, owing to its simple, repeatable, and low-risk nature [4] , is popularized in unresectable CRLMs [8] [9] [10] . Moreover, multidisciplinary management and the introduction of neoadjuvant treatment are rapidly altering the landscape of CRLM therapy [11, 12] . Unfortunately, although no-evidence-ofdisease (NED) could be achieved in a number of patients, there exists great heterogeneity in their prognosis. Some could enjoy quality NED survival, while many develop CRC recurrence early after curative operation [13] [14] [15] .",

Post-operative surveillance should be individualized. For patients who are highly likely to develop ER, more radical surveillance strategies are critical for timely detection and intervention, instead of a routine check-up every 3-6 months after curative surgeries [20, 21] . Studies on liquid biopsy [15, 22, 23] and gene profiling [24] in predicting ER are rather preliminary and financially draining, and are miles away from routine practice. In addition, their clinical accuracy was not adequately presented. On the other hand, the predictive effect of a single clinical [25, 26] or radiological [27] parameter is also limited due to the complexity of CRLM patients' condition. Medical practitioners now lean more on experience rather than objective predictive tools. Thus, developing a predictive system that provides accuracy, usability, and cost-effectiveness is of critical importance.",

The exclusion criteria were as follows: recurrent CRLM; remnant lesions confirmed by post-operative radiological/ultrasound examination; noncompliance with routine post-operative surveillance; lost to follow-up; or incomplete medical record. The terminal event was ER, defined as a compromise of NED with radiological confirmation due to relapse of CRC (regional or distal) within 6 months after curative surgery where the state of NED was realized [13, 16] .",

Subsequently, a predictive nomogram was developed to visualize the aforementioned model, which was tested for discrimination, calibration, and performance against published models: Beppu et al. [28] developed a predictive nomogram in a comparable setting, in which synchronous disease, positive LN metastasis, number of tumors stratified at 1, 2-4, and >4, largest tumor size, extra-liver metastases, and preoperative CA19-9 >100 U/mL were included. Also, the clinical risk score (CRS) [29] has been widely adopted for the post-operative prognosis of CRLM patients and these models were used as comparison. Additionally, lift curves were used to investigate how nomogram-assisted post-operative surveillance will bring net benefit to patients in clinical practice. A two-tailed P-value of <0.05 was deemed statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 25, Chicago, IL, USA) and R software (Version 3.6.2).",

The time definition of 'early recurrence' in CRC has not been universally established for all stages of CRC, as prognosis differs greatly among different clinical stages [17, 18, 31, 32] . Clearly, due to the nature of terminal stage colorectal malignancy, a shorter interval should be considered. In the present study, ER was defined as CRC recurring within 6 months after curative surgery based on previous literature [13, 14] .

In logistic regression, more than four liver lesions showed the strongest statistical correlation with ER. Indeed, multiple intra-liver metastases not only represent worse tumor behavior, but also are surgically challenging. When multiple metastases are present, surgeons tend to resect 'the first' instead of the metastasis in the target area, causing remnant lesions. Besides, to remove all lesions, lobular or even extended lobe excision was used, which removes more liver volume [33] and provides little room for salvageability [34] .",

Instead, post-operative surveillance should be more individualized [50] not only in terms of the check-up interval, but also in surveillance means. Thus, we discussed how utilizing this nomogram will benefit timely relapse detection during post-operative surveillance. The lift curve is most frequently used in marketing to evaluate whether a selective model aids in the management strategies. For instance, a blind pick-up in a pool of customers containing 20% of active responders yields an $20% response rate (RR). When active responders are selectively picked via a classifier, a higher RR will be achieved. Using our nomogram as a classifier, a >2-fold increase in the detection (response) rate was seen in the top 30% of patients who were likely to develop ER (responders). In clinical interpretation, we expect a great increase in the detection rate when highly selective follow-up strategies are provided for high-risk patients using our model. Bhattacharyya et al. [51] reported a 3-month lag in detecting relapse using the sole method, while a combination of serum tumor markers and radiology boosts surveillance efficiency dramatically. Based on our findings, we recommend a more intensive surveillance protocol (e.g. hepatic MR and abdominal enhanced CT every other month, serum-tumor-marker tests every month, and introduction of PET-CT when post-operative recurrence is suspected) in high-risk populations.",
