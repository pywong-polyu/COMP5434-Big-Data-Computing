            "text": "Coronavirus disease is referred to as \"COVID-19\" and is caused by a novel respiratory virus [1] and this single-stranded RNA virus belongs to a Coronaviridae family [2, 3] . It was transmitted initially from animal-to-human and then human-to-human [1, 4] . The governments and public health organizations have adopted numerous measures worldwide to improve awareness, raise knowledge, and increase preventive practice to control COVID-19 transmission [5, 6] . It originated from China at the end of the year 2019 and subsequently circulated globally [7] . The first positive case reported of COVID-19 was by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on 2nd March 2020. Eventually, the number of positive cases was accelerated in a month, and it has become a big challenge for healthcare professionals [7] . As of 31 December 2020, 362,714 cases were registered in Saudi Arabia [8] . The government authorities of Saudi Arabia have focused on precautionary measures with general population interest [9] . These include lockdown, airport and border surveillance, quarantine of suspicious and infected patients, and infection control training for healthcare workers [10] . In addition, public places are at potential risk of spreading COVID-19 to family and friends, and colleagues [11] . Therefore, it became essential that the public know the disease and preventive practices suggested by health authorities. COVID-19 transmits through air droplets, contaminated surfaces, mucus membranes and secretions from the nose or mouth, or eyes, and close contact with infected persons [12, 13] . COVID-19 cases are usually symptomatic; however, recently, asymptomatic patients have also been reported, which has become a significant concern for health care professionals. Dry cough, fatigue, fever, dyspnea, and myalgia, commonly reported symptoms in COVID-19 positive individuals. Subsequently, an Italian study reported that there will be an alteration in smell and taste in individuals with COVID-19 [14] . Additional observed symptoms include abdominal pain, headache, diarrhea, and sore throat. The severe stage of COVID-19 is characterized by septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bleeding, coagulation disorders, and metabolic acidosis [15, 16] .",

These measures are very strictly acclaimed to control the spread of COVID-19 disease and to protect the people from this pandemic. Nevertheless, a lack of understanding of the COVID-19 risk factors among people has been observed worldwide [10, 17] . People's understanding and adherence to preventive measures play an essential part in controlling the contraction of COVID-19 [9] . Di Lorenzo and Di Trolio [16] opined that strict obedience to the rules proposed by health authorities might be useful in avoiding the transmission of COVID-19. This tractability depends on their awareness, perception, and preventive practice factors. Hence, there is a need for a survey to check for the perception, preventive practice, and oral health care perceptions in Saudi Arabia. Oral health care professionals are at potential risk of acquiring COVID-19 because most dental procedures are aerosol generated [5, 13, 18] . It also impacted the people whether to seek dental treatment during this COVID-19 pandemic or not. Nonetheless, there is no data available on the oral health care perceptions of the Saudi Arabian population. However, lack of awareness and inadequate understanding of the people at risk has led to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak of this disease, resulting in colossal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Henceforth, the study was aimed to evaluate perceptions and preventive practices regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and oral health care perceptions during the lockdown: a population-based cross-sectional survey from Saudi Arabia.",

This cross-sectional survey was conducted from 1 June 2020 to 31 July 2020 among the people from Saudi Arabia, and the self-administered questionnaire was sent through digital platforms online via google forms. The questionnaire comprised two main parts: first part consisted of demographic data including the region of residence (Riyadh, Al Baha, Makkah, Qassim, Northern Border region, Tabuk, Jazan, Asir, Hail, Madinah, Najran, Eastern, and Al Jouf), gender (male and female), nationality (Saudi and Non-Saudi), age in years (\u226420, 21-40, 41-60, >60), number of family members (\u22645 and >5), and monthly income of the family (\u226410 KSAR and >10 K Saudi riyal (SAR). The second part had three sections as follows: Six questions for perception (P), preventive practice (PRA), and three questions for oral health care perception (D), shown in Table 1 . A pilot survey was conducted among the team members that filled and reviewed all the questions. The changes were made accordingly prior to the distribution of the questionnaire among the participants. The responses obtained from the pilot study were not included in the final data analysis. The validation of the questionnaire was completed and translated into Arabic by a native speaker (AA) and edited prior to distribution. The translations were made accessible in English and Arabic languages. The participants made it an easy and understandable form. The effect of age, gender, nationality, number of family members, and monthly income was considered for evaluating P, PRA, and D regarding COVID-19. The questionnaire was sent as a link via social media to the Saudi Arabian population using Google form. The recruitment and consent to participate in the study followed the participants' willingness to complete the questionnaire. In the perception of the feasibility of analysis \"yes\" as a positive response and \"no\" as a negative response. Similarly, we followed the same criteria for all the domains. The mean percentages of the positive responses for all the questions were used for the measurement. The Chi-square tests were used for comparisons of percentages. All the demographic characteristics of participants were presented using summary statistics. The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 21.0. Armonk, NY, USA: IBM Corp); statistical significance was set at a 5% level. ",

Contrarily, our findings did not agree with the African-based population study [3] , where the authors found 73.5% of awareness regarding COVID-19 in their study population. Earlier, a similar survey in Saudi Arabian population was published in which the knowledge score was found to be 81.64%, which is less than the present study suggesting that the people of Saudi Arabian have a better understanding of the present scenario and are updating them with the COVID-19 knowledge [20] . Overall, 90% of the participants discerned that the incidence of COVID-19 could be minimized by staying at home and not meeting with others in public places during the lockdown period. This knowledge was significantly more in females than in males (p = 0.000). In addition, 89% of them knew about the symptoms of COVID-19. In a similar study by Honarvar et al. [21] in the Iranian population, it was found that only 4.8% of the participants were not aware of the symptoms of COVID-19, which suggests that the people of Saudi Arabia are more knowledgeable about the current global pandemic.",

In the present study, females were found to be more knowledgeable than males. Also, perception, preventive practice, and oral health care perception were more in females than males. Hence, more knowledge was associated with increased perception, more preventive practice, and oral health care perception in females in the present study. Honarvar et al. [21] studied the perception of COVID-19 among the Iranian population and found increased knowledge and preventive practice in females. Similar observations were made by Al-Hanawi et al. [20] , Brug et al. [22] , Bish and Michie [23] . In contrast, Ngwewondo et al. [19] have observed more preventive practice in males than females. Saudi participants were more knowledgeable than the non-Saudi participants in the present study (p > 0.05); nonetheless, perceptions were less among the Saudi participants than the non-Saudi participants. However, preventive practice and oral health care perception were more in Saudi participants than in the non-Saudi participants (p < 0.05). Hence, their increased knowledge was associated with higher preventive practice and oral health care perception. The perception was more in participants below 60 years of age. However, preventive practice and oral health care perception were found more in elderly participants over 60 years because older people are more prone to infectious diseases. The present study also observed more preventive practices in older people, and these findings are consistent with a Chinese study [18] and a Nigerian study [24] Zhang et al. [18] . This outcome explains that older people with or without comorbid diseases gained more preventive practices than other age groups. Similarly, increased age associated with an increased preventive approach was observed by Zhong et al. [18] , Al-Hanawi et al. [20] , and Lorfa et al. [24] in their respective studies. Honarvar et al. [22] have observed less knowledge and less preventive practice in the elderly age groups. Participants with less than five members were found to have more knowledge and oral health care perception, but the perception and preventive practice were found more in those with more than five family members. These differences were not statistically significant. None of the reported studies have reported family members' effect on perception and preventive practices regarding COVID-19 and oral health care perceptions during COVID-19. Perceptions, preventive practice, and oral health care perception were observed more in participants with a monthly income of more than 10 K, whereas perception was observed more in those with less than 10 K income (p = 0.000). Al-Hanawi et al. [20] have also found more awareness of COVID-19 in participants with higher income in their study.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak severely impacted the healthcare profession, especially in dentistry [6, 8] . This pandemic has changed dental care providers' opinions and opinions of dental care receivers [25] [26] [27] . Almost 50% of participants from an American study reported delaying their dental appointments due to the COVID-19 pandemic [28] . Only a few participants preferred to visit the dental operatory. Comparing the gender, nationality, monthly income, and the number of family members showed statistical significance. However, no prior study compared these factors on dental visit preference during COVID-19 lockdown from Saudi Arabia. Comparatively, most survey participants preferred to have a telephonic conversation with the dentist before a dental appointment. The health authority provides guidelines for safe and effective dental practice during this pandemic outbreak [29] . The use of personal protection equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators, face shields, eye protection, surgical masks, and protective clothing, is strictly recommended to avoid the contraction of COVID-19 in the dental operatory. It explains the need for a telemedicine model in such pandemic situations. A recent article by Benzian and Niederman [26] explained SAFER dentistry that could benefit both the patients and dental care providers. Focusing on the source of information regarding COVID-19 amongst the people is also plays an essential role in perception and preventive practices. In the present study, only 4% of the participants relied on the WHO website. In Alanazei et al. [30] study, 18% of the participants preferred the WHO website. However, Alanazei et al. [20] findings are not comparable because they used multiple options for the source of information utilized for COVID-19. It has also been reported that the different sources of information had copious associations with the assurance in managing with concern to COVID-19 [31] . Participants in the present study used a multiplicity of sources for information concerning the COVID-19. The Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health website was utilized by most participants (55%) in the study to know information on COVID-19. Alanezi et al. [30] also reported similar findings. The authors reported that 65% of the participants utilized the Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia, as a source of information. Furthermore, it explains the health authorities from Saudi Arabia were very successful in reaching people in the country with information regarding COVID-19 based on our study. Risk perceptions refer to people's spontaneous estimations of vulnerabilities they might be exposed to, with unwanted effects that the population associates with a precise cause [14, 32, 33] . Risk perception of a country means interpretations of the populations. Sharma et al. [34] used a fourth-generation multi-theory model (MTM) to explain and explore the hand-washing behavior among American college students.",

A recent study [37] reported that dental specialists showed adequate knowledge regarding preventive measures. Furthermore, a recent study [38] suggested that it is imperative to promote the infection control protocols among dental students through training programs to avoid the potential risk of COVID-19. Cori et al. [39] opined that government authorities' administration of risk communication is required to establish consciousness and rationality. A recent study [40] found a higher prevalence rate of anxiety, depression, sleep problems, stress, and psychological distress among the general population during this pandemic outbreak. However, in the present study, we have not evaluated the psychological aspects of the populations. There is a need to evaluate the stress levels among the general population in Saudi Arabia. Based on the present study findings, the authors opine that the perception of risk regarding COVID-19 might associate with perceptions about COVID-19 and that will impact preventive behavior.",

The population from illiterate and unprivileged groups did not participate in the study. Therefore, the findings from these segments of the society were not gathered in the present study. A total of 2013 people participated from various Saudi Arabia regions, and the majority were from the Riyadh region (33.7%), followed by the Asir region (21.5%). The region-based analysis was not done in the present study. There was a comparatively remarkable difference among participants from the various areas. However, this could also be a limitation of the study. To the best of our knowledge, the present study qualifies as the first reported study from Saudi Arabia to the best of our knowledge assessed the perception, preventive practices, and oral health practices among the population in Saudi Arabia with concern to COVID-19. Other limitations include study design, selfadministered questionnaire, convenience sampling, which cannot be generalized to the study findings. There was no equal distribution of the participants from various provinces of Saudi Arabia, and the majority of the study participants were from Riyadh and Asir.
