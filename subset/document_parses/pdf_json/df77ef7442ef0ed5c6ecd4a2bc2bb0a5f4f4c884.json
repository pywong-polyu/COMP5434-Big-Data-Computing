And no study emphasizes on the relationship between prediabetes and severity of COVID-19 until now. In our study, we observed that patients with hyperglycemia were more likely to be severe cases at the time of hospital admission with an odds ratio of 3.14 for diabetes and 2.36 for IFG compared to NFG. This is consistent with a recent meta-analysis of 31 reports with varied sample sizes (ranged from 21 to 1099) which found that patients with diabetes had a significantly increased odds (OR 2.61; 95% CI 2.05-3.33) of developing severe COVID-19 compared with patients free of diabetes (15) . Among 1,590 patients with COVID-19 across China, severe cases were found in 34.6% of patients with diabetes (45/130) and 14.3% of patients without diabetes (209/1,460) (4).

First, we did not know the exact type of diabetes and assumed that majority, if not all, should be type 2 diabetes. Second, HbA1c was not routinely measured at the time of hospital admission, particularly for those without diabetes, therefore, we could not evaluate the association between HbA1c and risk of adverse outcomes because of lack of data. Third, we did not have information on some confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and lifestyle factors, and residual confounding was possible as in any observational studies. Besides, only 30% (93 out of 312) of the participants had data available on BMI, and thus we could not adjust for BMI in the multivariable models. Fourth, although we have retrieved medication information, we still could not evaluate the impact of different types or combinations of antidiabetic drugs on the prognosis, which would require a much larger sample size. Fifth, we did not have information on glycemic control measures, kinetics of viral load and antibody titers during the follow-up, and more studies are still needed to understand the impact of those factors in the development of adverse outcomes. Finally, our study had limited sample size and all patients were Chinese recruited from 5 hospitals in Wuhan city by convenience sampling; furthermore, the prevalence rates of diabetes and IFG were higher than the rates in the general population or in patients with COVID-19 from national surveys of Chinese.
