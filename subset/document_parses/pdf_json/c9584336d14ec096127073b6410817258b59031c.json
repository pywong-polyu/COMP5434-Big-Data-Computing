Persons who did not meet the RP definition were labeled not recurrent (NR). However, not all persons received follow-up testing, and additional laboratory results were voluntarily reported. Duration of RT-PCR positivity was defined as the number of days from symptom onset until the last known positive RT-PCR in a respiratory specimen. Duration of RNA shedding was defined as the number of days from symptom onset until the second consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 result by RT-PCR among pregnant persons reported with a follow-up test.

A positive RT-PCR result alone without other information (data on symptom onset, cycle threshold, or viral culture) cannot distinguish infectious virus from noninfectious genomic fragments. Second, health departments were not required to send laboratory testing beyond the first positive result that occurred during pregnancy; these findings are from a convenience sample of pregnant persons with varied duration of follow-up and do not estimate the actual extent of recurrent positivity. Furthermore, persons with infections earlier in pregnancy might be more likely to be classified as RP, given that they can be followed longer and receive additional COVID-19 testing compared with persons with initial symptom onset later in pregnancy. Last, only 31.4% of our cohort (n = 2,062) had multiple test results, representing a small proportion of pregnant persons.",

            "text": "T he current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in substantial illness and death rates worldwide. Orthohantaviruses are zoonotic viruses responsible for another severe respiratory infectious disease in the Americas, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Although humans generally become infected with HPS through inhaling excreta generated by infected rodents, person-to-person transmission has been well documented in Argentina and Chile (1) (2) (3) . Humans become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and orthohantaviruses in similar ways, through inhaling contaminated aerosols, and can have onset of similar respiratory syndromes. Despite these similarities, the incubation period is shorter in COVID-19 patients (2-14 days) than in HPS patients (7-45 days) . Furthermore, at the time the case we describe was reported, the cumulative case-fatality rate for CO-VID-19 in Argentina was 2.7% (4); for HPS, it was 22%-40% (5).HPS is characterized by the onset of symptoms such as fever, myalgia, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, and sweating. Rapid progression to shock or respiratory distress can occur within hours. Symptom-basedWe describe a patient in Argentina with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Although both coronavirus disease and HPS can be fatal when not diagnosed and treated promptly, HPS is much more lethal. This case report may contribute to improved detection of co-infections in HPS-endemic regions.",
