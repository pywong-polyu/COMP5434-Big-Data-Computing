Corticosteroid therapy has, therefore, become an important pillar in COVID-19 treatment and is recommended by WHO, NIH, EMA and national guidelines [2, [16] [17] [18] . However, although corticosteroids suppress hyper inflammatory response, they also inhibit immune responses and pathogen clearance. Because COVID-19 is determined first by viral replication followed later by hyper inflammation, the timing of corticosteroid therapy is important [19, 20] . It has been shown that it is predominantly patients on respiratory support who benefit from corticosteroid therapy [14] ; in contrast treatment performed too early might be associated with increased mortality [21, 22] . Moreover, corticosteroid therapy is a known risk factor for influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) [23] .",

As the pandemic progressed, the number of patients with COVID-19 declined in the summer but rallied again in autumn and peaked in December during the so-called second wave (Fig. 2) . The number of CAPA cases also increased in late 2020 during this second wave. In July 2020, dexamethasone treatment (6 mg, once daily for 10 days) was introduced as the hospital-wide standard for the early treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients, based on international recommendations [2, 15] . We found an overall CAPA incidence of 9% (47/522) in our total cohort of COVID-19 ICU patients. Up to July, we diagnosed 4.5% patients with CAPA (n = 6/n = 134) and from July to December 10.6% (n = 41/n = 388). This sharp increase in CAPA cases was statistically significant (p = 0.049 chi square, RR 4.286, CI95% 1.779-9.234). Tocilizumab was not recommended at the time, and we found only 3 patients who had been or were being treated with it in the control cohort. Table 2 shows univariate comparisons of relevant endpoints for CAPA cases and controls. Sixty-four % of the CAPA cases died during their hospital stay, compared to 48% of the control patients. Parameters representing the severity of illness during disease course (LOS on ICU, SAPS maximum, IL-6 maximum, rates of severe ARDS) were in CAPA cases significantly higher than in controls. The results were stable in the sub-cohorts (Additional file 1: Table S4) . Table 3 shows univariate comparisons of potential risk factors for CAPA in cases and controls. CAPA cases were significantly more likely to receive invasive ventilation during risk period, had higher SAPS scores on admission, suffered from chronic kidney disease more Table S6 ).",

Two systematic meta-analyses found long-term corticosteroid treatment upon admission to be a relevant risk factor for CAPA [4, 9] . In our univariate analysis, we found an association between corticosteroid treatment before admission and CAPA. However, this risk factor was no independent factor in the multivariable model.

In a recently published French multicenter study, dexamethasone and anti-IL-6 together were associated with a threefold increased risk of CAPA [40] . However, they could not estimate the effect of dexamethasone alone. In the meta-analysis on the effect of corticosteroids on survival in critically ill COVID-19 patients, Sterne et al. argued that the optimal dose and duration of treatment could not be sufficiently assessed. They explicitly stated that it is unclear whether a lower dose of corticosteroids would be associated with lower benefit [15] .

Nevertheless, one study compared ventilated COVID-19 patients with non-COVID-19 ventilated patients and found an increased incidence overall of VAP (including CAPA) associated with COVID-19 [45] . Another author then suggested early prophylaxis with antifungal agents for critically ill COVID-19 patients [22] . Our data support the findings that the onset of CAPA is about one week after admission to the ICU [22, 24] . However, within our 13 analyzed ICUs we could not find an indication for an environmental factor. Eventually, appropriate strategies have to be found to decrease the risk of CAPA. Treating critical ill COVID-19 patients with antifungal agents upon ICU admission regardless other risk factors might not be an appropriate strategy.",

Whereas, a CAPA-associated mortality was found between 46 and 55% [8, 22, 43] , the overall estimated mortality among critically ill COVID-19 patients is approximately 40% [15, 46] . Even though our numbers are higher compared to previously published figures, they are within the given confidence intervals of their results. As a tertiary care center with specialized ECMO ICUs in a metropolitan area, we may have treated a selection of highly critical. This is demonstrated by the fact that 44% of our patients were transferred from external ICUs, and the SAPS on admission were on average as high as 41. Hence, the estimated mortality rates from our study appear plausible and support the current body of evidence on increased mortality from CAPA.",
