Through this work, we have committed ourselves to provide the communities we serve with sustainable, culturally relevant strategies to educate and provide redress for the multifaceted causes of the HIV epidemic. We seek to strengthen the collective response to COVID-19 among HIV researchers by urging them to consider using collective resources strategically with community partners during this public health crisis.",

Further, HIV is already associated with depression, loneliness and poor health outcomes among PLWHIV [7, 8] which may be exacerbated by social distancing guidelines. Dyadic considerations may include if serostatus concordant partners are living with HIV and undetectable, and concerns about intimate partner violence while sheltering in place [9] . At the institutional and community level, the closure of many businesses and CBOs may limit the supports available to those most in need. Indirect impacts of COVID-19 and social distancing, such as increased intimate partner violence, food insecurity, income insecurity, and economic shocks may further increase the needs and vulnerability of PLWHIV and those most as risk, as well as affect the priorities and focus of CBOs.",

Furthermore, CBOs provide vital support in connecting PLWHIV to ancillary services such as rapid re-housing for those experiencing homelessness or housing instability. This is especially important as those living with HIV and experiencing homelessness are at the nexus of two groups requiring additional precautions for COVID-19 [10] . During this public health crisis, many CBOs are struggling to ensure continuity of services for clients, while monitoring the safety of employees and responding to overwhelming requests for information and technical support. Lastly, inconsistent and unclear messaging from government officials throughout the emerging crisis continues to stress an already patchwork system of resources. As with the early HIV epidemic, widespread misinformation regarding COVID-19 is of great concern [11, 12] and the lack of personal protective equipment and unclear strategy for screening threatens to reduce confidence in populations of color which already report medical mistrust, particularly among PLWHIV [13] [14] [15] .
