In response, many liver transplantation programs unexpectedly came to an abrupt halt, significantly affecting the lives of living donors and recipients around the world. As the risk-benefit scale of liver transplantation has changed in the era of COVID-19, it is prudent to understand the impact of COVID-19 on those with underlying liver disease and those in need of a liver transplant. In this review, we discuss recommendations put forth by hepatology and transplant societies, summarize results from emerging studies, and propose strategies to appropriately risk stratify patients prior to transplantation.",

In a study of over 2,500 patients with COVID-19 in the United States, patients with chronic liver disease and COVID-19 were almost five times more likely to die than those without COVID-19 (relative risk [RR]=4.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.6-8.3, p<0.001). 5 Similarly, in a study of over 88,000 patients in the Veterans Affairs national healthcare system, COVID-19 infection was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in mortality in patients with cirrhosis and cirrhosis was associated with a 1.7-fold increase in mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. 6 Preliminary data suggest mortality attributable to COVID-19 is higher in patients with more advanced liver disease and is strongly correlated with Child-Pugh (CP) class. 7 Mortality rates were 12.2% in patients without cirrhosis compared to 23.9% in patients with CP Class A vs. 43.4% in patients with CP Class B, and 63% in those with CP class C. 7 In addition to baseline liver disease stage, analysis of an international registry of patients with chronic liver disease and COVID-19 found that age (odds ratio [OR] 1.02, 95% CI=1.01-1.04, p=0.011) and alcohol-related liver disease (OR 1.79, 95% CI=1.03-3.13, p=0.040) were also factors associated with death. 8 Conversely, Bajaj and colleagues 9 observed in a multicenter trial that, when matched for age and gender, patients with cirrhosis and COVID-19 may have similar mortality compared to patients with cirrhosis alone, although higher than in patients with COVID-19 without cirrhosis.",

            "text": "The initial paucity of data left clinicians uncertain about the impact of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Early single-center reports, limited by small sample sizes and restricted geographic domains, published variable mortality rates, leaving providers unsure about the safety of transplantation during this time. 10, 11 As a result, many transplant centers around the world were suspended during the initial wave of the pandemic. Lombardy, Italy was drastically affected by COVID-19, with hospitals required to expand the total number of ICU beds from 724 to 1,381 to accommodate patients with the virus. 12 Although authorities had not formally halted the transplant programs across Lombardy, there was a temporary decrease in liver transplantation due to several reasons, including an overwhelming influx of COVID-19 patients to ICU beds, redeployment of ICU doctors (leaving a paucity of specialists to care for liver transplant recipients), lack of data regarding the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 in recipients, and concerns regarding the safety of the procurement teams who may be exposed to potentially infected patients. 12 A similar decline in solid organ transplantation procedures was seen in France, with a 90.6% reduction in deceased donor transplantation since the COVID-19 outbreak. 13 Countries with large living donor programs were similarly affected. In a study conducted in India, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) were evaluated from March to June 2020 and compared to a pre-COVID period in 2019. LDLTs in COVID-19 times decreased to 58.9% of the previous year, with no significant difference in age, gender or indication of LDLT. One of twenty-three post-transplant recipients, three of seventy-one recipients and donors during evaluation, and eight of one hundred and twenty-five healthcare workers developed COVID-19 during this time, all with uneventful recovery. 14 Although transplantation rates initially decreased during the height of the pandemic, growing collaborations among researchers worldwide has since led to multicenter data on outcomes in SOT recipients and has improved risk stratification in this patient population. In a study of 482 SOT recipients from over 50 transplant centers, the 28-day mortality rate after COVID-19 diagnosis was 18.7%. In that study, independent risk factors for mortality included age >65 years (OR 3.0 95% CI=1.7-5.5, p<0.001), presence of congestive heart failure (OR 3.2, 95% CI=1.4-7.0, p=0.004), chronic lung disease (OR 2.5, 95% CI=1.2-5.2, p=0.018) and obesity (OR 1.9, 95%CI 1.0-3.4, p=0.039). 10 Immunosuppression was not found to be a risk factor for mortality. 10 Similar mortality rates and risk factors for death were identified in other large-sample studies. In a large, national cohort study performed in England, 597 of the 46,789 SOT (1.3%) recipients who tested positive for COVID-19 had a mortality rate of 25.8%. Increasing recipient age was the only variable independently associated with death after a positive COVID-19 test in that study. 15 As more data became available, the impact of COVID-19 was specifically evaluated in liver transplant recipients. In a prospective study of 19 European centers, 12 centers had registered 57 cases of liver transplant recipients who contracted COVID-19. 16 The most common symptoms were fever (79%), cough (55%), dyspnea (46%), fatigue or myalgia (56%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (33%). Immunosuppression was reduced in 22 recipients (37%) and discontinued in 4 (7%), but no impact on outcome was observed. The estimated case fatality rate was 12% (95% CI=5% to 24%), and notably five of the seven patients who died had a history of cancer. 16 Similar data were seen in a prospective nationwide study in Spain, which found fever and cough to be the most common symptoms of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients. 17 In that study, the mortality rate was 18%, which was lower than in the matched general population (standardized mortality ratio 95.5, 95% CI=94. 2-96.8 , p<0.0001), however, were more frequent in the liver transplant cohort. There was no difference in death between the two groups (19% in the liver transplant group vs. 27% in the non-transplant group, p=0.46), and in a propensity score matched analysis, liver transplant did not increase the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 (absolute risk difference 1.4%, 95% CI=7.7-10.4). Only age, serum creatinine, and non-liver cancer were associated with increased risk of death in the liver transplantation group. 18 A Swedish study also found older age, male sex, and greater body mass index at presentation to be associated with adverse outcomes. 19 With new potential treatment options, vaccinations, and emerging data on the safety of liver transplantation, more programs around the world have begun to reopen and increase their transplant volumes. The reopening of transplant programs in England was addressed by the National Health Services Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) unit. 20 Given the challenges faced by units vary by geographical location, organ type and local resource environments, NHSBT felt these considerations were best evaluated at the local level. As these challenges are in constant flux, especially with the new strains of the virus and multiple waves of the pandemic, the NHSBT has proposed guidelines to consider prior to reopening of programs. These include assessing the availability of adequate resources (multidisciplinary team input, number of ward beds, anesthesia availability, personal protective equipment, blood products, etc.) and microbiology and infection control policies meeting national standards. The impact of reopening transplant programs around the world, particularly with new strains of the virus emerging, has yet to be seen.",

During this time, clinical data and imaging from previous exception petitions (i.e. those with HCC) could be maintained if updated data could not be obtained. These policies were implemented by OPTN to help prevent unnecessary exposure to transplant recipients and living donors and to alleviate data burden for transplant centers during the initial wave of the pandemic. 23 However, in patients listed with HCC, Mehta and colleagues 24 recommend obtaining preoperative imaging at time of admission for liver transplant, if not done within 3 months, to ensure tumor characteristics meet standard liver transplant criteria.",

Preliminary data suggest a similar or even lower incidence of COVID-19 infection in transplanted patients to that of the general population. In a large Italian survey of 640 patients, the incidence of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients was only 1.25%, with 75% of patients developing only mild disease. 26 The impact of immunosuppression in COVID-19 is also not well known. Emerging data suggest that, while posttransplant immunosuppression may prolong viral shedding in patients with COVID-19, mortality from COVID-19 may not be substantially different than in the general population. 21 In a large multicenter cohort study, 151 patients with COVID-19 from 18 countries who had previously received a liver transplant were compared from a contemporaneous cohort of 627 patients with COVID-19 and without a history of liver transplant. After adjustment for age, sex, creatinine, obesity, hypertension, diabetes or ethnicity, liver transplantation did not significantly increase the risk of death in patients with SARS-COV2 (absolute risk difference 1.4%, 95% CI=-7.7 to 10.4, p=0.764). 18 Rather, age, serum creatinine and non-liver cancer were associated with death among liver transplant recipients. 18 Another prospective nationwide study of 111 liver transplant recipients in Spain with COVID-19 also demonstrated that chronic exposure to immunosuppressive agents did not increase standardized mortality rates. However, findings did suggest that high doses of mycophenolate could increase the risk of severe COVID-19 among hospitalized liver transplant patients. 17 With the evidence and data that are available, AASLD and EASL recommend not changing immunosuppressive regimens in post-transplant patients without COVID-19, while emphasizing general precautionary measures such as maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding travel. 21, 22 In post-transplant patients with COVID-19, adjustment of immunosuppression should be individualized with severity of COVID-19 weighed against risk of graft rejection. Minimizing immunosuppression, particularly antimetabolite medications, should be considered as would be done with contraction of other infections. 21 Potential treatment options for COVID-19 are under review, but the effect of these medications on liver transplant recipients remains unknown. Given the paucity of data, close monitoring is recommended for possible drug-drug interactions and adverse reactions. 27",

Webb et al. 18 also found that increased age and presence of comorbidities carry more risk than the liver transplantation itself. In a multicenter trial of 151 adult liver transplant recipients from 18 countries and 627 patients who had not undergone liver transplantation, there was no difference in proportion of patients hospitalized (124 [82%] patients in the liver transplant cohort vs. 474 [76%] in the comparison cohort, p=0.106), or who required intensive care (47 [31%] vs. 185 [30%], p=0.837).
