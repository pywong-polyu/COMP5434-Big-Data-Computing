In addition, a new method for determining the required quality score of different types of products is proposed based on their loss factors and purchasing costs. The model aims to minimize total cost imposed by purchasing fresh products, opening warehouses, holding inventories, operational activities, and transportation. Two sets of examples, including small and medium-sized problems, are implemented by general algebraic modeling language (GAMS) software to evaluate the model. Then, Benders decomposition (BD) algorithm is applied to tackle the complexity of solving large-sized instances. The results of both GAMS and BD are compared in terms of objective function values and computational time to demonstrate the efficiency of the BD algorithm. Finally, the model is applied in a real case study involving an apple supply chain to obtain managerial insights.",

These characteristics put restrictions on logistic decisions and make deep concerns over resource depletion and the occurrence of agricultural wastes and losses. According to Widodo et al. (2006) , 20-60% of agro-products are wasted along supply chains in any country. Therefore, designing efficient inventory and transportation systems for perishable products plays a vital role in cost-saving and freshness-keeping (Coelho and Laporte 2014) .

For these purposes, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated considering several operational constraints. Then, the model is linearized and transformed to mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and solved by GAMS/CPLEX solver in small and medium sizes.

(2017) analyzed tradeoffs between economic and environmental benefits of an agro-food closed-loop supply chain with location-allocation decisions and production planning. They attempted to valorize agro-wastes by applying recycling concepts. Ghezavati et al. (2017) proposed a mathematical model for a distribution planning system considering the freshness and ripeness of products. They proposed BD algorithm to solve their problem in a reasonable time. Orjuela-Castro et al. (2017) presented a MILP model for a multi-product facility location problem. They aim to minimize the costs of transportation, installation, and fruit losses and show how intermediate logistics platforms affect fruit losses. Soto-Silva et al. (2017) formulated a two-stage agro-supply chain model for a case study in Chile. The first stage contains particular decisions on supplier selection and transportation planning and the second stage associates with establishing different types of cold chambers to store products and transportation planning. Allaoui et al. (2018) proposed a two-stage programming model for a sustainable agro-food supply chain. In the first stage, a hybrid analytic hierarchy process with an ordered weighted averaging method was used for assigning weights to sustainable indicators. In the second stage, a multi-objective mathematical model was proposed with respect to the results in the first stage. Paam et al. (2018) proposed an agro-supply chain model to optimize the shelf lives of apples with different quality grades in cold storage rooms. Liu et al. (2018) studied optimal purchase decisions and inventory retrieval policies for a single-product finite period agro-supply chain to maximize total profit under fluctuating prices. Jonkman et al. (2019) investigated the impacts of location-allocation, inventory, and transportation decisions on an agro-food supply chain under uncertain conditions. Liu et al. (2019) developed a transportation model for fresh agricultural products considering the impacts of ethephon concentration, time, and temperature on the maturity of soluble solids. They used ant colony algorithm to solve their model. Onggo et al. (2019) assessed stochastic demand in a multi-period inventory routing problem and attempted to minimize inventory, transportation, and shortage costs. They used a local metaheuristic algorithm to tackle the complexity of their model. Paam et al. (2019) proposed a new model for inventory management optimization in an apple supply chain. They analyzed the effects of two scenarios in storage rooms on fruit losses. Yu et al. (2019) investigated the impacts of horizontal and vertical integration on the quantity/quality losses and retailer profits.",

In spite of their primary step towards sustainability of agro-products, it lacks an in-depth discussion on adjustment of storage conditions and its effects on inventory decisions. However, practical accessibility gave us valuable insights to design a mathematical model for adjusting storage conditions according to costs imposed on the system and its effects on the durability of agro-products.

Therefore, this study aims to manage the quality of agro-products by giving scores to producers and accordingly selecting them.

Afterwards, we reformulate it to a MILP model and propose BD algorithm to solve it. Figure 1 is meant to show the process of this paper. Figure 2 is a perspective of the proposed agro-supply chain, including producers, warehouses, and a wholesaler. Fresh products should be purchased from the producers who gain the required score based on their quality grades. This approach satisfies the required quality of products to be kept for a long time in cold chambers, which is more profitable for the system. The products are shipped to the warehouses by the private fleet. The reason is that producers, either small or medium sizes, are often located in rural and sparsely populated areas. The long distances between orchards and facilities and busy harvest seasons require the producers to provide flexible operating by their private fleet. The processing operations should carry before the storage of products, by which products are sorted based on their varieties, sizes, etc. Then, each type of products regardless of their sizes, color, etc., are kept in a cold storage room, and the temperature conditions should be adjusted to optimize the shelf life of products. Afterward, the products are delivered to the wholesaler to satisfy customers' demands. Herein, transportation decisions are made by warehouses. In total, the proposed model aims to minimize the total cost of the agro-supply chain model while satisfying the constraints.",

Therefore, it is necessary to apply efficient solution procedures to overcome the computational burden. BD algorithm is known as one of the powerful algorithms to tackle the complexity of NP-hard problems. BD algorithm uses the concept of \"divide and conquers\" to reformulate the original problem into a master problem (MP) and dual subproblem ( The primary steps of the BD algorithm work iteratively by outer linearization and relaxation. In other words, the original problem is decomposed into an MP and subproblem (SP). The MP is a pure integer problem and includes integer and binary variables. The MP is solved and puts its solutions among the SP. In this step, the SP turns into DSP to make the feasible solution space independent from integer solutions. Then the DSP is solved, and its optimal bounded solutions/ unbounded solutions are added as feasibility/optimality cutting planes into the MP. This procedure reduces the computational time compared to the original problem. The convergence of BD comes from closing upper and lower bounds obtained from solving the DSP and MP, respectively.

It should be noted, for 3  3  3  3  3  5  3   Max  25  20  20  3  3  10  3 large sized-instances, the CPLEX solver cannot find optimal solutions and releases an \"OUT OF MEMORY\" error. In these cases, BD can be utilized to cope with complexity and reach optimal solutions in a reasonable time. Figure 4 demonstrates the changes of computational time for BD and CPLEX solver, in which BD outperforms CPLEX solver, especially in medium and large-sized instances. According to the results, the computational time of the CPLEX solver increases whatever the size of the problem increases. This affirms the efficiency of BD in solving the model in a reasonable time. Besides, the average gap between the upper bounds of BD and the CPLEX solver is about 0.01684. It turns out BD converges to optimal solutions with a near-zero gap. In order to verify the efficiency of BD and its convergence, three instances in small, medium, and large sizes are derived from GAMS/CPLEX solver and presented as follows: Figure 5 shows that BD provides optimality convergence in less than 17 iterations for a small-sized test (no. p5). Figure 6 shows that BD provides optimality convergence in less than 12 iterations for a medium-sized test (no. p8). Figure 7 demonstrates that BD provides optimality convergence in less than 23 iterations for a large-sized test problem (no. p14).",

The company decides to establish warehouses at four potential locations, namely Tehran, Fars, Isfahan, and Razavi Khorasan, and activate cold chambers under proper temperature conditions. They often purchase different varieties of apples from producers who truck products by private vehicle fleet and located in Tehran, Alborz, Isfahan, West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan, and Semnan provinces. The company purchases good storage apples based on quality characters (i.e., texture, cosmetic appearance) to remain for a while in warehouses and satisfy the wholesaler's demands in different months of a year. Tables 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 represent input data related to cold storage construction projects (www.damoon-co.com) and purchasing, transportation, and storage planning for eight months. The average demand is obtained based on historical data when the company faces shortages, and also demands should be met by any variety of apples. In addition, the purchasing cost of apples with different quality grades are available in fruit and vegetable fields organization in Iran, and information about temperature conditions in cold chambers are available in (https://pdfsara.ir/containerstorage-services-atmospheric-plan/).",

Clearly, there are many reasons affecting the selling price of products and may lead to fluctuation in demands. Changes in the selling price of products may be caused by specific economic conditions (e.g., economic impacts of COVID-19 outbreak), irreversible damage during production (e.g., frost, floods), etc. The customers' demand may be triggered by these factors or changes in taste and expectation, thereby becoming lesser or higher. From this point of view, it is vital to assess the model behavior during changes in parameters D it and C Q i js . In addition, this paper gives four vehicle types for fruits transportation and two cold storage rooms for 500 or 1000 Tons of apples that may change. The containers of different capacities can easily fit onto different forms of trucks and provide other options for transportation planning. Besides, redesign of cold rooms of less capacity may affect the feasibility of the problem. Finally, two remaining parameters are inventory holding costs and operational costs, which may be changed by embracing new technologies, identifying inefficiencies and unused services, etc. Therefore, this section provides an overview of the changes and their impacts to revise the plan after the occurrence. The results are summarized in Table 17 .",

Indeed, it is Fig. 9 Impacts of the changes on operational costs necessary to adjust capacity to match it with the changes in demands. We suppose that the available capacity of warehouses or producers is not sufficient in response to increased demands, therefore, the model becomes infeasible. In this case, the capacity of either warehouses or producers may step up to meet the demand. In addition, it is expected to purchase fewer products and avoid overstocks when demand decreases. This may cause a decrease in purchasing costs, operational costs, and inventory holding costs. Besides, a 50% increase in H W c leads to a 34.63% increase in the total cost. This indicates the importance of temperature condition adjustment and its impacts on the total cost. For further investigation, the effects of the changes in parameters H W c, C Q i js , D it on operational costs, inventory holding costs, and purchasing costs are presented as follows: Figure 9 demonstrates the effects of the changes on operational costs.",

Hence, in this paper, a multi-product multi-period MINLP model has been developed for an agro-supply chain contributing to purchase, facility location, and transportation decisions. Forasmuch as adjustment of temperature condition affects the quality of products and consequently their shelf lives, this study determines proper temperature conditions based on the varieties of products. This model aims to minimize the total cost of the supply chain considering several operational constraints. The primary step to solve the proposed model is to linearize the MINLP model and reformulate it into a MILP problem. Then, three sets of numerical examples, small, medium, and large sizes, have been presented to evaluate the performance of the mathematical model. The problem was coded in GAMS software and executed for small and medium test problems. Whatever the size of the problem increases, the computational time increases and the problem becomes difficult to solve. Therefore, BD algorithm has been implemented to tackle the complexity of the problem. Then GAMS/CPLEX solver and BD were compared in terms of objective function values and computational time. The results depict the convergence of BD to optimal solutions in a reasonable time.",
