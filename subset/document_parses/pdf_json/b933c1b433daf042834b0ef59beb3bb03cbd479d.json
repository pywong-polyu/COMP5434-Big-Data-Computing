Monitoring signs and symptoms with checklists or aids called decision support tools may help nursing home staff to detect infection in residents, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We plan to conduct a survey exploring views and experiences of how infections are detected and managed in practice by nurses, care workers and managers in nursing homes in England and Sweden. Methods and analysis An international cross-sectional descriptive survey, using a pretested questionnaire, will be used to explore nurses, care workers and managers views and experiences of how infections are detected and managed in practice in nursing homes. Data will be analysed descriptively and univariate associations between personal and organisational factors explored. This will help identify important factors related to awareness, knowledge, attitudes, belief and skills likely to affect future implementation of a decision support tool for the early detection of infection in nursing home residents. Ethics and dissemination This study was approved using the self-certification process at the University of Surrey and Link\u00f6ping University ethics committee (Approval 2018/514-32) in 2018. Study findings will be disseminated through community/stakeholder/service user engagement events in each country, publication in academic peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. A LAY summary will be provided to participants who indicate they would like to receive this information. This is the first stage of a plan of work to revise and evaluate the Early Detection of Infection Scale (EDIS) tool and its effect on managing infections and reducing unplanned hospital admissions in nursing home residents. Implementation of the EDIS tool may have important implications for the healthcare economy; this will be explored in cost-benefit analyses as the work progresses.",

The assessment of body temperature uses a new approach based on the difference from baseline, the so-called 'DiffTemp ' instead of predecided values for fever, ie, >38\u00b0C. 23 Recording 'Diff-Temp' as part of EDIS enables a more targeted approach focusing on specific aspects of behaviour and functional status. However, as EDIS is still undergoing ongoing development, it is yet to be to be widely adopted in Sweden. This is the first stage of a plan of work to evaluate a complex intervention, 24 the intervention being the use of the EDIS tool in nursing homes in England and more widely in Sweden.",

Exploring nurses, care workers and managers' views and experiences of how infections are detected and managed in practice is an important first step to understanding enabling and reinforcing factors related to successful adoption, implementation and maintenance of the EDIS tool. This survey will identify the potential barriers, support and improve understanding of resources needed to implement and maintain EDIS in daily clinical practice not only in England, but also more widely in Sweden. 24 25 Using principles of normalisation process theory, a conceptual framework to analyse implementation process, and inform recommendations to guide implementation work, 25 a sequential programme of work is planned. It is well recognised that the most challenging aspect of complex intervention research is implementation and 'normalisation' of the intervention; therefore, this study has an important role to play in gathering contextual information regarding how the intervention may be received and delivered in practice in each country.",
