However, in terms of price and availability for children with IS from lowresource settings, imACTH treatment is not a clear choice. Additionally, oP is frequently associated with side effects such as irritability, and its efficacy is \u223c40-50%, presumably due to late presentation and predominantly symptomatic etiology (12) . Currently, corticosteroids, including oP, pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (ivMP), and dexamethasone are the options being used and evaluated for IS treatment, and the search for relatively cheaper alternatives with similar efficacy is ongoing (12) (13) (14) (15) .",

Recently, oral methylprednisolone (oMP) at least 500 mg/day/5 days is recommended for treating MS relapses, and its efficiency is not inferior to that of ivMP (16) (17) (18) . Furthermore, adjunctive oMP (1.6 mg/kg/day for 3 days) also reduced the occurrence or severity of renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis in hospitalized children who had a high risk of renal scar formation (19) . Hence, we hypothesized that oMP may be beneficial and effective for children with IS, and the current comparative study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy (short-and intermediary-term) and safety of oMP in IS compared with the standard imACTH and oP therapies.",

ACTH is preferred but is expensive and difficult to obtain in some countries. Several trials and meta-analyses have confirmed that high-dose oP (40-60 mg/day) is not inferior to ACTH and is a more cost-effective treatment for IS (16, 17, 21, 22) . However, the response time to spasm control, duration, and the relapse rate varied widely across studies (16, 17, 23) . Thus, we conducted an open-label observational study to investigate the effectiveness of oMP, imACTH, and oP for the treatment of IS. One important reason for the variable response rates is the differences in the underlying etiologies (i.e., structural, metabolic, and genetic), as Japanese children respond well to pyridoxine when administered as a first line therapy (24, 25) . The large prospective nature of this study ensured that the baseline characteristics were comparable among the three groups, which enabled greater power to distinguish the effectiveness of different treatment options.",

(23) reported that highdose ACTH (>140 IU/m 2 /day) was associated with a greater early response rate than oP by analyzing the multicenter database of the National Infantile Spasms Consortium, whereas Wanigasinghe et al. found that the time required for spasm cessation was quicker in children treated with oP compared with imACTH at a dose of 40-60 IU every other day (3.85 vs. 8.65 days) in the SLISS trial. In this study, the total number of days required for spasm control was \u223c8 days in children treated with oP and imACTH (25-40 IU/d). In addition, oP and imACTH showed no significant difference in the time until a response in 3/5 randomized controlled trials, and the mean time to spasm cessation ranged from 3 to 8 days in a metaanalysis conducted by Kuo et al. (21) . The lead time to treatment affects intermediary-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (6) . The time from spasm onset to initiation of treatment was 15 days in a study conducted by Wirrell et al. (23) and \u223c1 month in our current study. Thus, we believe that the difference in the time until spasm cessation may have resulted from the variability of the lead time to treatment and the dose of hormones in individual studies. Children with IS should receive hormone therapy as soon as possible.",

However, no such finding was observed in this work, and the intermediary-term efficacy of oMP was comparable to that of oP and imACTH. The potential reason may be related to the long period of relatively high doses of oMP used in the current study, while ivMP was pulsed for only 3 days followed by oP for 2-4 weeks. oMP and oP are considerably less expensive, more available and convenient options in resourcelimited settings compared with imACTH. In combination with the advantage of achieving electroclinical remission earlier than oP, oMP represents a novel treatment option for IS.",

In this study, there was no statistically significant difference in adverse effects among the three groups. As the reversible side effects of prolonged steroid therapy are known (31, 32) , none of the children stopped treatment due to side effects, and side effects gradually disappeared when hormone treatments were discontinued, whereas increased appetite and gastrointestinal upset were more common with oP. In addition, the cost of imACTH regimen is \u223c40 times of oMP in low-setting regions. These results suggest that oMP is well tolerated and can be considered a safe and effective alternative treatment for IS.",

First, as this is a non-blinded, uncontrolled observational study, complete randomization and blindness cannot be achieved, which will impact the study's efficacy. Second, the reliance on parental reporting of spasms may not be accurate without performing 24-h EEG to substantiate complete cessation of spasms. Lastly, both imACTH and ivMP therapies had limited effectiveness in IS with structural etiologies (14) , and the association of response rates with the differences in the underlying etiologies was not assessed because of the large number of subjects in the unknown category (66.67-70.09%).",

More importantly, the time to achieve spasm cessation of oMP was lower than that of imACTH and oP. This should guide pediatricians worldwide, especially in regions where ACTH or vigabatrin remains unavailable, in choosing to use oMP as a form of first-line treatment for newly diagnosed IS. The impact of this finding is enormous, particularly concerning the convenience, affordability, and lack of irreversible side effects of oMP.",
