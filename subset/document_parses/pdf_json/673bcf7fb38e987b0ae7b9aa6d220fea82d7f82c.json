During this emergency, procedures and workflow were adapted to provide the safest possible environment for both the surgical team and the patients. Pediatric surgical activities were reorganized during the COVID-19 pandemic at the \"Vittore Buzzi\" Children's Hospital, which is a pediatric/maternal hospital located in Milan (Lombardy Region), Italy. Resources were optimized in order to maintain high levels of care and quality of assistance. During the COVID-19 emergency, the pediatric surgical department at the \"Vittore Buzzi\" Children's Hospital became an acute care surgical service. For the reorganization of surgical activities, institutional protocols were adapted in order to preserve the pediatric-specific characteristics of our service; five crucial points were specifically addressed. The pediatric surgical procedures carried out during the initial two months of the Italian lockdown are also reported. Continuity of care was maintained for children affected by severe diseases, such as tumors and neurosurgical conditions, whose treatment could not be deferred. Telemedicine and telecommunication were adopted as quick-support modalities for preand post-operative care. This reorganization allowed us to preserve the \"pediatric specificity\" and all care-related procedures offered at this high-quality/high-volume surgical care referral center.",

The reason for this lower susceptibility is unknown, although several hypotheses have been put forward [2, 15, 16] : First, children have a more active innate immune response, and this first line of defense against pathogens responds immediately to foreign invaders; the simultaneous presence of other viruses in the mucosa of the lungs and airways, which are common in young children, may also limit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 through direct virus-to-virus interactions and competition; their respiratory tract is healthier because they have not been exposed to as much cigarette smoke and air pollution as adults; and children participate in fewer outdoor activities and undertake less international travel. Moreover, they usually have fewer underlying disorders and stronger self-healing capabilities. Importantly, differences in the distribution, maturation, and functioning of the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) have also been reported.",

Generally speaking, we optimized resources in order to maintain the highest levels of care and quality of assistance while limiting infectious risks for our pediatric patients and their families. However, considering the importance of the association between emergency care and perspective care, we strove not to neglect the primary care of fragile and chronic patients. In the following section, we have detailed the five principal steps that we undertook.",

Infants and very young children are known to have increased vulnerability to environmental and other injuries because of their size, immature anatomy and physiology, and differing pharmacodynamics. Specific organ development determines the different patterns of disease that occur in childhood and affects drug treatments and responses to them [17] [18] [19] [20] . Therefore, children require age-appropriate pathophysiological and cognitive management, and they should not be considered \"little adults\" [17] . It is of utmost importance to preserve, even in this period, suitable pediatric treatments for children affected with congenital malformations, tumors, rare diseases, neurological impairment, or acquired surgical pathologies. Professionals with appropriate and dedicated skills are required to guarantee the best quality of care. Starting from the very beginning of the COVID-19 emergency, the pediatric network lost beds, nurses, and doctors at each hospital to support the necessary assistance required to care for the massive number of adult COVID-19 patients. In our pediatric surgical department, dedicated patient management was guaranteed, although all elective surgical interventions, deferrable endoscopic procedures, and outpatient activities were cancelled according to regional and governmental indications and according to the recommendations of the Italian Society of Pediatric Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic (disclosed but not published). Patient reception was guaranteed mainly through Emergency Department (ED) access. Although at our hospital, seven pediatric intensive care beds were commandeered to support the regional emergency network for adults, critical pediatric assistance and activities were guaranteed.",

The COVID-19 pandemic compelled the conversion of our pediatric surgical department into an acute care surgical department. These adaptations were feasible thanks to the presence of a multidisciplinary team at different levels of \"intensity of care\". The changes necessitated by the COVID-19 emergency most likely modified or worsened the disease course of many patients, with a higher risk of delayed diagnosis and increased morbidity (this should be analyzed in the future). We realize that our efforts to provide a high level of \"emergency care\" were not adequately accompanied by \"perspective care\" philosophy, which is a cornerstone of pediatric surgical care. While understanding the extreme gravity of the emergency that has garnered everyone's attention, we are worried about the loss of \"perspective care\", an indispensable component of the management of \"fragile\" children, e.g., newborns with complex congenital malformations and children/adolescents with chronic pathologies for which the continuity of dedicated care is imperative. For these patients, home isolation and postponed scheduled outpatient appointments could lead to disease aggravation and delays in treatment. Even under emergency conditions, when resources are shifted to critical areas, \"pediatric specificity\" and all pediatric-care-related particularities should not be overlooked.",
