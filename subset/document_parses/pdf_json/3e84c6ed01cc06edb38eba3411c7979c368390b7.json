We discuss the factors that limit subgroup analysis in cost-effectiveness analysis and propose more thorough and transparent reporting. There are many issues that may limit whether subgroup analysis can be robustly included in cost-effectiveness analysis, including challenges with prespecifying and justifying subgroup analysis, identifying subgroups that can be implemented (identified and targeted) in practice, resource and data requirements, and statistical and ethical concerns. These affect every stage of the design, development and reporting of cost-effectiveness analyses. It may not always be possible to include and report relevant subgroups in cost effectiveness, e.g. due to data limitations. Reasons for not conducting subgroup analysis may be heterogeneous, and the consequences of not acknowledging patient heterogeneity can be substantial. We recommend that when potentially relevant subgroups have not been included in a cost-effectiveness analysis, authors report this and discuss their rationale and the limitations of this. Greater transparency of subgroup reporting should provide a starting point to overcoming these challenges in future research.",

Cost-effectiveness analysis often uses population averages, which can hide differences between subgroups who may receive a healthcare intervention [1] . An intervention may appear cost effective across a sample but not be cost effective for one or more subgroups (e.g. if it has an unfavourable adverse effect profile, reduced efficacy, or for other reasons), and vice versa. This could result in inefficient decision making for specific subgroups, risking a suboptimal distribution of resources and unnecessary harm to patients and/or patients missing out on health benefits. Subsequently, acknowledging patient heterogeneity could increase efficiency and result in population health gains. Subgroup analyses are imperative if cost-effectiveness estimates are to reflect patient heterogeneity with the purposes of affecting decision making. However, a review identified that subgroup analyses were reported in a minority (19%) of published cost-effectiveness analysis [5] . Moreover, the review concluded that over half of the reported subgroup analyses had the potential to affect decision making (i.e. subgroups had different conclusions regarding cost effectiveness when the cost per QALY was compared with the average). However, as noted above, this would depend on the balance of priorities and objectives and broader evidence in a specific decision-making context.",

The paper focuses on subgroups that are meaningful for decision making, although it is recognised that subgroups may be useful for academic purposes even if they cannot be used in decision making and clinical practice (e.g. if they cannot be targeted in practice). This paper outlines and discusses the key factors that may limit subgroup analysis in cost-effectiveness studies. Understanding these issues will be useful to researchers, reviewers, and decision makers alike. It goes on to suggest changes to the reporting of subgroup analysis, to enhance transparency and to prompt future research if relevant.",

Similarly, commonly used economic evaluation checklists emphasise the need to prespecify, explain and justify subgroups [7] [8] [9] . However, it has been noted that across guidelines there is a lack of clarity with respect to sources of heterogeneity that should be considered and acceptable methods and justification for subgroup analysis [3, 10, 11] .

Economic evaluation has a wider range of parameters and, subsequently, the consideration of patient heterogeneity needs to extend to other parameters, including resource use, health state utility and baseline risk [1, 4] . Researchers need to think more broadly about how patient characteristics may impact the results of cost-effectiveness analysis, rather than restricting to what has been used in clinical effectiveness analysis. Given the complexity of subgroup analysis in cost-effectiveness evaluations, defining clear rules around what a subgroup analysis should be and what evidence is needed to justify it would be challenging and potentially restrictive, but this lack of clear guidance for subgroups may be off-putting to researchers. Note the lack of clear guidance is not specific to economic evaluation. Wijn et al. reviewed guidance for subgroup effects of medical treatments, which covered industry, health technology assessment agencies, academic/non-profit organisations and regulatory bodies [13] . They found there were significant differences across the available guidance.",

The thought process for defining potential subgroups is complicated, even before considering which subgroups may have expected differences in cost effectiveness. Researchers need to review a long list of potential patient characteristics and then think about interactions between characteristics and potential confounders (e.g. geographical heterogeneity). Once sources of patient heterogeneity have been considered, researchers need to consider whether and how they may influence multiple parameters of economic evaluation (e.g. baseline risk, treatment effect, resource use, utility). Not all heterogeneity will be observable when a treatment decision is made, i.e. it may be observed over time, and, subsequently, not all subgroups are informative for cost-effectiveness estimates for the purposes of decision making [4] . For example, patients may respond differently to an intervention, which cannot be predicted at the time of decision making. However, this heterogeneity, rather than informing a subgroup, can be factored into cost-effectiveness analysis by exploring stopping rules, with a recent example in chronic migraines [4, 14] . The investigation of patient heterogeneity will vary in complexity and feasibility across disease areas and intervention types. For example, there may be circumstances in which an intervention does not have a known and clear mechanism of action, which likely prevents any justification for subgroups based on treatment effect.",

Equity concerns arise if an intervention is not cost effective across all subgroups [16] . They will vary depending on the source of heterogeneity, as well as how it affects cost effectiveness (by which parameters), the strength of the underlying justification and the potential impact on health inequalities. Whether something is ethical may depend on whether the subgroup impacts cost effectiveness via treatment effect, or by another parameter (e.g. resource use) [1, 4] . For example, Grutters et al. note that policy based on 'race' may be acceptable if it ties to biological mechanisms [1] . Furthermore, race, like other aspects of patient heterogeneity, can be defined in different ways and may be closely related to other terms that mean something different (e.g. ethnicity) [17] . Another example is sex and gender [18] . Choice of precise demographic characteristics to collect, and their definitions, is likely to affect whether the subgroup is ethical to decision makers. There are many types of subgroup that may cause concern, examples include a subgroup eligible for expensive downstream treatment that appears less cost effective because of this; subgroups that are simply based on waiting until a patient has progressed to a more severe health state; or subgroups based on protected characteristics. Espinoza et al. discussed the exclusion of age and sex from their analysis, as differentiating according to these characteristics could incur criticism related to ethics [6] . A review of national guidelines found that only the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) lists equity constraints on subgroups (i.e. subgroups are not considered if they focus on social characteristics or location) [3, 19] . A separate review, which looked at subgroup analysis reporting in published economic evaluations, did not identify any papers discussing equity in relation to chosen subgroups [20] . The authors noted that subgroup analysis was more common in US studies, which could be reflective of reduced regulations and restrictions related to equity in decision making [20] .",

For example, there is evidence that some public health interventions (e.g. workplace smoking bans) increase inequality, but if the average effect is favourable, these results may be hidden [22] .

Not all interventions can be targeted at subgroups of patients, e.g. training interventions for healthcare professionals are unlikely to be implementable for a precise subgroup only. Subgroup size, as well as affecting budget impact, may affect whether subgroup policies are adhered to in practice. For example, if a small subgroup is recommended as being unsuitable for a treatment, such guidance may not always be followed in practice. Furthermore, the number of subgroups can be important, since if there are many subgroups all with different recommendations, this can create organisational challenges, limiting feasibility. Implementing varying recommendations for subgroups across organisations may be more or less feasible depending on a range of factors, e.g. the time available to make and explain a treatment choice to a patient. External pressures on healthcare systems and periods of great change (e.g. the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) that result in constantly changing subgroup recommendations may also be a challenge organisationally. Patients have multiple characteristics that vary simultaneously, which creates a challenge as subgroups based on multiple characteristics can be even harder to identify and justify [25] . An example of subgroups based on multiple characteristics is presented by Burn et al., who examined based on both age and sex for a cost-effectiveness analysis of total knee replacement [26] . Univariate-based subgroup analyses are more commonly reported in cost-effectiveness studies but are potentially an oversimplification as interactions between characteristics may be important [20] . Overlap between subgroups needs to be avoided (e.g. people who fit into multiple groups). When there are multiple alternative subgroup specifications being considered, Espinoza et al. propose a framework using expected net health benefit with current and perfect information to guide selection (optimal subgroup definition) [6] . Finally, Sculpher noted the importance of considering whether patients could sway measurement to meet subgroup criteria to access a treatment [4] .",

Espinoza et al. discussed that health care decision making has been hesitant to adopt subgroup analysis due to statistical concerns around power and multiple testing [6] . Typically, clinical trials are powered to identify significant average treatment effects across the sample; subsequently, any subgroup analysis is likely to be underpowered. Inadequate power can result in false negatives, whereby subgroups do not appear to be important or significant due to a lack of statistical power [25] . Multiplicity becomes an issue as when multiple subgroups are compared, identifying a difference between subgroups can occur by chance (a type 1 error) [27, 28] , i.e. there is a risk for false positive results. Petticrew et al. summarise historical examples of subgroups that have resulted in harmful decisions, such as limiting aspirin use for the prevention of heart disease in women [21] . Given these concerns, researchers may be cautious that evidence is not sufficient to identify subgroups, or that apparent subgroups have been identified by chance and therefore do not reflect reality. Successful replication of the subgroup results using multiple data sources has been noted as one option to increase the credibility of results; however, as noted below, there are often significant data limitations affecting analyses [15] . As factitious subgroups might arise due to these statistical issues, a robust justification and underlying rationale for subgroups is especially imperative as it can mitigate some of these concerns. Furthermore, when using estimates from meta-analysis to inform baseline risk or other parameters, researchers need to be wary of ecological fallacy [29] . This can occur when average patient characteristics are regressed against average outcomes across studies (rather than within studies), and any association found with this aggregate data may not apply to individuals within the studies.",

Subgroup analyses can be conducted irrespective of model design, although simulation models may be able to handle the complexities of heterogeneity more efficiently compared with cohort models [1] . Such models are data hungry and data availability is a concern for researchers [30] . Modelling often relies on the use of published evidence (e.g. systematic reviews and meta-analysis); however, as noted in the Cochrane handbook, insufficient details and a lack of consistency in source materials affect the feasibility of subgroup analyses in systematic reviews [31] . Selective reporting may affect the availability of evidence to inform to economic evaluation. A review comparison of randomised controlled trial (RCT) protocols and articles found that 12% of publications did not report subgroup analyses that were in the relevant protocol and 26% reported subgroup analyses that were not prespecified in protocols [32] .

The authors did not identify any subgroup effects; however, this may be indicative of an insufficient sample size rather than a lack of significant subgroups. Hoch et al. investigated the cost effectiveness of assertive community treatment and found differences in cost effectiveness between subgroups based on race, and differences in uncertainty estimates between subgroups that were attributed to subgroup sample sizes [34] .

Post-launch, real-world data may offer some advantages for subgroup analysis in cost-effectiveness studies, as wider populations are considered and subgroup analysis can reflect groups targeted in practice. A recent example in asthma demonstrates the use of real-world data to inform subgroups beyond trial data (with a focus on older populations) [37] . Research used to inform economic evaluation (e.g. trials or observational studies) can only collect a limited number of patient characteristics. Sculpher and Gafni note this is an issue in identifying preference heterogeneity, as the range of sociodemographic data collected can be limited [38] . Additionally, health economists will not always be involved in the design of data collection, which may limit the identification of patient heterogeneity that is specifically relevant to economic evaluation. Further complicating factors exist. For example, self-reported data may be subject to response bias, which may differ according to participant characteristics [39] .

The process of defining subgroups may be more transparent in technology appraisal if bodies place an emphasis on robust subgroup identification and reporting. NICE are currently conducting a review and consultation of their methods of health technology appraisal and in the case for change describe that committees must be able to exclude subgroups for whom a technology is not cost effective even when it appears cost effective across the whole wider population [41] . While this is imperative for efficiency and for revealing true population health gains, in circumstances in which an intervention appears cost effective across a whole population, there may currently be little incentive to investigate subgroups in which treatment is not cost effective. For instance, manufacturers funding an economic evaluation may have an interest in positive outcomes that will maximise (prioritise) profit, and researchers without conflicts of interest may still be keener to publish favourable results [42] . Fletcher et al. present an example of a health technology assessment case study in Alzheimer's disease to demonstrate the importance of subgroup analyses in cost-effectiveness analyses [15] . Although it cannot be evidenced, media reporting of health technology assessment recommendations adds extra complexity, as recommendations restricted to a particular subgroup of the patient population may be unpopular as it may be judged to be inequitable or unfair.",

Without knowing whether Fig. 1 Overview of subgroup considerations subgroups were considered and, if so, why they were ruled out, other researchers in the area will be unable to learn from this and decision makers may fail to recognise a key limitation of the evidence base. When subgroup analyses are reliant on building a stronger/more comprehensive evidence base, we hope that increased transparency in reporting will help to achieve this.",
