According to the World Food Program (WFP), 271.8 million people were acutely food insecure due to the destructive impact of COVID-19 pandemic across the world. Similarly, around 20%-30% population of Pakistan, that is, 40-62 million people, has been suffering from acute food insecurity due to the pandemic, and other socio-economic and environmental/climatic issues. The highly vulnerable groups include daily wage class, refugees, and people living in droughtaffected areas, locust-affected areas and areas with winterized emergency.

The pandemic created severe impediments to the economic activity resulting in drastic changes in the livelihoods of people and the situations of food security and nutrition. Increasing rates of globalization, and international travel and trade are primarily responsible for the outbreak of the virus across the world. Moreover, the situations of lockdowns and restricted movements within and across the countries have manifested a drastic effect on the local, national, and international markets, resulting in truncated global economic activity. The situation is even worse in the underdeveloped, and countries with low socioeconomic growth further exacerbating the already fragile agri-food systems and consequently, the livelihoods of the people. According to the Global Report on Food Crises 2020, around 135 million people are suffering from \"crisis\" level of acute food insecurity situation which needs immediate attention. It is further stated in the report that over 183 million people have been facing the \"stressed\" level of acute food insecurity, and are at a high threat of moving into the \"crisis\" phase (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO], 2020a; Food Security Information Network [FSIN] , 2020).",

It is estimated that around 53 million people in Pakistan live below the poverty line. Likewise, 20%-30% population in Pakistan is already suffering from food insecurity and the economic experts believe that the number of food insecure people will rise in Pakistan in 2021 due to the evolving nature of the current pandemic. It has also been reported by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics that the Consumer Price Index has been increased in Pakistan by 8.2% between May 2019 and May 2020. Moreover, food inflation has also been increased by 13.73% in the rural areas and 10.94% in the urban areas during this pandemic era (FAO, 2020a, 2020b; Noreen et al., 2020) . The food insecurity maps provided by FAO, describing the food insecurity situation in Pakistan, are provided in Figure 1a ,b. Therefore, it is direly needed to carefully monitor the next production season in Pakistan as high risk of production losses has been predicted. Recently, the World Food Programme (WFP), and FAO collaborated for a food security and nutrition analysis aimed at stocktaking of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihood, food security, agricultural supply chain, prices of food commodities, market conditions, and management strategies along with suitable measures for mitigating the effects of this pandemic on the food insecure groups. The findings of the analysis revealed that close to 36.43 million people are highly vulnerable to food insecurity owing to both natural and manmade hazards, including the ongoing pandemic. Also, around 49 million people (25%) are moderately food insecure, while 21 million (10%) households are severely food insecure in Pakistan (OCHA, 2020; WFP, 2020b). The demographic groups most susceptible to the COVID-19 pandemic are the daily wage class (accounting for 22% of all the wage earners), refugees, internally displaced persons, senior citizens, and persons with preexisting medical conditions, as well as low-income urban households, market-dependent rural communities, and child-headed households.",

The COVID-19 response plan has been aimed at providing food security and livelihood protection to the demographic groups highly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FSAWG designed the response plan by focusing on the prevalent needs of the pandemic-and disaster-affected communities, and the inability to meet and protect their livelihood and food-associated needs. Another focal point of the designed response plan was augmenting the efforts of the Government of Pakistan for meeting the food consumption needs and other necessities of the pandemic-affected community groups. The plan is primarily based on the assistance of vulnerable groups through a combination of cash/food/ food production, as well as agriculture-based livelihood protection assistance, that will aid in enabling the people to not only improve and protect their livelihoods but revitalize and recommence their productive activities as well. The key objectives of the response plan include ensuring food security, provision of effective cash/food/other facility transfer platforms, technical assistance in agriculture, livestock, and animal health maintenance, quick dispatching of response facilities, and avoiding the humanitarian emergency among vulnerable groups. A generalized description of response plan of Pakistan to improve the food security situation by maintaining the food systems and provision of nutrition services has been provided in Table 2 (Wazir, 2020) .",

Moreover, the policies of the government to stabilize the functionality of agrifood systems in Pakistan have also been discussed in this treatise.

Hence, it is highly imperative that the risks associated with the failure to deliver an equitable response to all the vulnerable groups be identified. This has the potential to markedly improve the livelihood sustenance, ensuring food security, and self-reliance. Government should ensure the provision of proper transportation and storage systems to mitigate the food losses, promote the export of value-added fruit and vegetable products which can be a good source of foreign exchange, subsidize farmers by providing essential inputs like seeds, pesticides and fertilizers in order to prevent economic losses, so that the existing food supply chain management can be strengthened and the future food crises can be prevented.",
