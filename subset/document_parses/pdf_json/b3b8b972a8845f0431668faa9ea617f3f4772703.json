            "text": "An emerging element in psychiatry is the gut-brain-axis, the bi-directional communication pathways between the gut microbiome and the brain. A prominent hypothesis, mostly based on preclinical studies, is that individual differences in the gut microbiome composition and druginduced dysbiosis may be associated with vulnerability to psychiatric disorders including substance use disorder. However, most studies used small sample size, ignored individual differences, or used animal models with limited relevance to addiction. Here, we test the hypothesis that pre-existing microbiome composition and drug-induced changes in microbiome composition can predict addiction-like behaviors using an advanced animal model of extended access to cocaine self-administration in a large cohort of heterogenous stock (HS) rats. Adult male and female HS rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine under short (2h/day) and long access (6h/day) for ~7 weeks under various schedule of reinforcement to identify individuals that are resistant or vulnerable to addiction-like behaviors and fecal samples were collected before the first session and after the last session to assess differences in the microbiome composition. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) identified sex-dependent and sex-independent differences at the phylum, order, and species level that are differentially abundant in resistant vs. vulnerable individuals, including high level of actinobacteria both before the first exposure to cocaine and after 7 weeks of cocaine self-administration in resistant animals. Predictions of functional gene content using PICRUSt revealed differential regulation of short-chain fatty acid processing in the vulnerable group after self-administration. These results identify microbiome constituents as well as metabolic pathways that are associated with resistance or vulnerability to addiction-like behaviors in rats. Identification of microbes and tangential metabolic pathways involved in cocaine resilience/vulnerability may represent an innovative strategy for the development of novel biomarkers and medication for the treatment of cocaine use disorder.",

Over 2 million people are estimated to have CUD in the US and during the current COVID crisis, cocaine use and cocaine related overdose deaths have multiplied (Wainwright et al., 2020; SAMHSA, 2017) . Currently, there are no approved medications for the treatment of cocaine use disorder and the factors that contribute to CUD are not well understood (Cano Fischer et al., 2015; Simpson et al., 1999. Genetics, socioeconomic status, and other outside factors are known to play a role in addiction liability; novel approaches to investigate contributing factors are necessary to better understand and treat CUD.",

In other drugs of abuse, depletion of the microbiome in opioids did not alter behavior, but alter the neuronal ensembles in states of intoxication and withdrawal (Simpson et al., 2020b) . The severity of drug intake has been correlated with distinct microbiome profiles in alcoholics (Mutlu et al., 2012; Leclercq et al., 2017) . Alcohol has also been demonstrated to differentially impact key microbiota in a sex specific manner known for immunoregulatory roles such as Turcibacter and Clostridium (Caslin et al., 2019) . Psychiatric disorders that are often co-morbid (and contribute to) drug use have also been associated with alterations of the gut microbiome, such as depression (Limbana et al., 2020) , anxiety (Yang et al., 2019) , and related immunological states (Peirce and Alvina, 2019).

Responses on the inactive lever (left) were recorded but did not have scheduled consequences.

Sex emerged as a potential predictive indicator of drug intake and resilience. Males displayed increased ratios of protective microbes, while females expressed fewer protective microbes and consumed more cocaine as the study progressed. When subdivided by addiction index, Resistant individuals had higher abundance of beneficial microbiome constituents compared to the Vulnerable group. The behavioral stratification by addiction index in the HS strain of rat allows for better comparison of addiction liability in a strain with significant variation in drug taking behavior. Resistant animals exhibited decreased intake at ShA and LgA timepoints, decreased progressive ratio responding, which models motivation to obtain drug (Stafford et al., 1998) , and decreased levels of intake in a model of compulsivity (shock) (Johnson and Kenny, 2010).

Bifidobacterium has been shown to be enriched in individuals that were protected from liver cirrhosis in alcohol dependent individuals (Dubinkina et al., 2017) , and supplementation of Bifidobacterium was associated with improvement in alcohol-induced liver injury (Kirpich et al., 2008) .

Similarly, mice exposed to cocaine have been demonstrated to have increased levels of Turcibacter (Chivero et al., 2019) .

            "text": "In addition to addiction index, observed differences in intake based on sex is vital in the development of effective novel treatments. Even though men are more likely to use illicit drugs than women, women are just as likely to develop substance use disorders. It has been hypothesized that women may also have increased susceptibility to relapse and craving compared their male counterparts (Robbins et al., 1999; Hitschfeld et al., 2015) . In this study, cocaine intake was higher in females at LgA than males toward the end of the testing phase. While progressive ratio was not significantly increased in females compared to males (PR2), it trended toward significance (p=0.052). Baseline microbiome differences were observed at the phylum level, including increased abundance of Actinobacteria in males compared to females, and decreased Tenericutes and Spiroachetes in males compared to females. Differences in Actinobacteria and Tenericutes were lost after long access exposure to cocaine, and a reversal in abundance in Spiroachetes was observed in males at the LgA timepoint. Beneficial butyrate producers were more abundant in males compared to females prior to drug exposure, which was reversed after drug exposure. After drug exposure, males exhibited increased abundance in known opportunists (Spiroachetes, Treponema) compared to females. While not causal in nature, potential differential microbiome constituents may play a role in the observed behavioral differences in this study. Further manipulations are needed to tease apart the contributions of sex to the microbiome in the context of drug taking behavior.",

Furthermore, in contrast to the Vulnerable group, the Resistant group exhibited increased abundances of known butyrate producing microbes prior to drug exposure. Efforts to identify microbes and downstream metabolic pathways that may confer resistance will enable the development of potential treatments for CUD that are applicable to both sexes. Spiroachetes (p=0.245) were all not elevated in either group; Actinobacteria relative abundance is increased in the Resistant group compared to the Vulnerable group before drug exposure (p=0.025). B) Stacked bar plots demonstrating the relative abundance at the phylum level. C) Taxonomic cladograms obtained from linear discriminant analysis effect side (LEfSe) shows bacterial constituents that are more abundant in either the Resistant (red) or Vulnerable (green) groups. Linear discriminant effect size of the cladogram is plotted as bar charts to the right. According to the two-way ANOVA there was no main effect difference between males and females at the ShA timepoint, but there was a significant effect of time (p < 0.001, F(9,300)=5.853), and an effect of group (p < 0.001, F(1, 260) =18.2. According to the two-way ANOVA after the LgA timepoint there was a significant main effect (time x sex) (p=0.003, F(13, 334) =2.74), there was also an effect of time (p<0.001, F(13,390) =9.195) and an effect of sex (p=0.045, F(1,30)=4.365. The Bonferroni posthoc revealed a significant difference between female and male rewards at day 12 (p=0.018) and day 14 (p=0.035). A student's t-test of the progressive ratio at all three timepoints revealed no significant differences between males and females; however, there was a trend toward significance at PR2 (p=0.052) B) Baseline phylum analysis identified males exhibited higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria (p<0.001, t=3.491) and lower relative abundance of Tenericutes (p=0.024, t=2.327) and Spirochetes (p=0.034, t=2.710) at the baseline timepoint. C) Phylum analysis after long access showed that males also exhibited higher relative abundance of Spirochetes (p=0.034, t=2.710) following Long Access, as well as a trend toward increased relative abundance of Cyanobacteria (p=0.061). The difference observed in Tenericutes at the baseline timepoint was not observed after long access (p=0.450). Actinobacteria was no longer at higher abundance (p=0.469) in males.
