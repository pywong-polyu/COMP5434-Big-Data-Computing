In this paper, an Internet of ings (IoT)-based sports information collection system which is specifically designed and developed for the healthcare domain specifically in the snow and ice sports is proposed. e physiological parameters such as body temperature, ECG, blood pressure, blood sugar, and blood oxygen saturation are captured through various monitoring devices. ese physiological parameters are transmitted to the mobile device by the wireless module and mobile device that receives and displays these physiological parameters. A complete hardware design of the whole ice and snow sports health and sports information acquisition system, which is based on the Internet of ings, is given, and then, there is the overall design scheme of the system, such as adopted modular design for the system, attitude measurement unit, UWB positioning unit, data storage, and communication unit, respectively. e measurement results of the professional medical equipment are compared with those of acquisition equipment in real environment of ice and sports. ese results have verified accuracy of data collected by acquisition equipment and meet the design requirements of the proposed system.",

In terms of health results and effectiveness of intervention programs, accurate quantification of physical exercise and physical health is very important [4] [5] [6] . Document [7] proposed the design and implementation of mobile medical monitoring client on Android platform. Document [8] designed and implemented a set of mobile Internet multiparameter health monitoring service systems to realize multiparameter measurement. Literature [9, 10] puts forward an open and reconfigurable wireless sensor network, which can transmit ECG, blood oxygen saturation SpO2, pulse wave, and other data amounts to remote service stations with different equipment configurations according to different diseases at different stages. Literature [11] uses piezoresistive triaxle acceleration sensor to measure the relationship between human motion acceleration and energy consumption. e acceleration of human body in daily activities such as sitting and walking can be measured, and then the relationship between acceleration value and energy consumption of human body movement can be obtained through experiments. Literature [12] proposes the fact that the acceleration sensor is fixed on the leg and the acceleration sensor can automatically detect the posture when the fibular nerve is stimulated and then analyze the walking posture of people.",

In order to achieve better expansion functions, microprocessor chips with stronger computing power, larger Flash storage space, and more peripheral interfaces can be selected. In this case, the MEMS sensor of the multifunctional attitude measurement unit selects three-axis accelerometer ADXL355, three single-axis gyroscopes ADXRS453, and three-axis magnetometer AK09970N, while the processor chip selects STM32F407VGT6. e hardware design of this scheme is shown in Figure 4 . e three MEMS sensors selected by the unit all support SPI communication, and the three-axis accelerometer ADXL355 and the single-axis gyroscope ADXRS453 have the same communication timing and phase. ese two MEMS sensors can be directly connected with the SPI interface on the microprocessor chip.
