The rodent coronaviruses, such as the various strains of MHV, provided rodent models for various human diseases. The demonstration that the agent that caused SARS was a novel coronavirus, and the subsequent investigations of the outbreak that indicated that the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) almost certainly entered the human population through zoonotic spread in wild animal markets in China, and subsequently underwent adaptation to humans, greatly increased the interest in this group and spurred efforts to identify and isolate coronaviruses from a large number of species in an attempt to identify the source of the SARS-CoV. These investigations, and the advent of sensitive RT-PCR-based methods (Stephensen et al., 1999) to detect novel as well as known coronaviruses, identified a large number of new coronaviruses in a relatively short period of time. Particularly interesting are the recent findings that bats, a large and diverse group of mammals that account for approximately 20% of extant mammalian species, represent a large and previously unrecognized source of novel coronaviruses, including viruses closely related to the SARS-CoV (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005a; Dominguez et al., 2007; Vijaykrishna et al., 2007) .

Protocols are also included for the propagation of DBT, 17CL-1, and L2 cells used for growing and titrating MHV, and for the growth of BHK-R cells [a line of BHK cells transformed with a cDNA-encoding murine CEACAM1a, the MHV receptor (Dveksler et al., 1991) ]. 17Cl-1 and DBT cells are both commonly used to propagate MHV. 17CL-1 cells typically grow MHV to two-fold greater titers than DBT cells, often reaching titers of 1 \u00d7 10 9 for MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59). However, the progression of the infection throughout the culture is more variable, and occasionally low-multiplicity infections fail to spread. Most strains of MHV produce a characteristic cytopathogenic effect (CPE) that is characterized by cell fusion. Both the higher titer and the occasional failure of the infection to spread throughout the culture in 17CL-1 cells are probably related to the fact that cell fusion in response to MHV infection is slower in 17CL-1 cells than in DBT cells and proceeds less rapidly as the cultures become more acidic over time. Plaque titrations to determine infectious virus titer can be performed with L2, DBT, or 17CL-1 cells. We routinely use L2 cells for this purpose, since MHV produces slightly larger and clearer plaques in these cells than in the other two cell lines.

Serial dilutions of a virus stock are prepared and inoculated onto replicate cell cultures, often in multiwell format (e.g., 96-well plastic plates). After an appropriate incubation period, wells are scored as either infected or noninfected after microscopic observation for cytopathogenic effect, and a tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) is calculated. In this assay, the distribution of virus into the wells follows a Poisson distribution, since some wells have a probability of receiving more than one infectious virus particle. The relationship between pfu and TCID 50 is as follows: TCID 50 \u00d7 0.7 gives you the equivalent titer in pfu/ml. An advantage of endpoint dilution assay is that it can be easily adapted to viruses that do not produce clear cytopathogenic effects by utilizing immunofluorescent staining for viral antigens, or by using other indicators of viral infection such as hemadsorption.

The negative-stained EM appearance of these viruses is that of round enveloped particles, approximately 100 to 160 nm in diameter, bearing bulbous spike proteins on the lipid envelope that give the virus particle an appearance somewhat reminiscent of a crown, thus giving this group of virus its name. Further EM studies of infected cells revealed that coronaviruses bud through intracellular membranes in the ERGIC-Golgi and are subsequently released from the infected cell by exocytosis. Coronavirus particles contain four or five proteins: a nucleocapsid protein (N); a triple membrane-spanning protein, M; a small membrane protein with ion channel activity, E (Wilson et al., 2004) ; and a spike protein (S) that makes up the characteristic bulbous peplomer and functions to bind to host cell receptors and mediate virus entry to the cytoplasm. In addition, most but not all members of the Group IIa coronaviruses contain a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein, which makes up a second, somewhat shorter spike protein on these viruses. The virus particles contain a helical nucleocapsid made up of the N protein and a large single-stranded, positivesense, nonsegmented RNA genome, between 27 and 32 kbp in length.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1012, "end": 1033, "text": "(Wilson et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background Information"}, {"text": "The genus Coronavirus is one of two genera in the Coronaviridae family, the other being Torovirus.

This classification is supported by phylogenetic analyses based on sequence similarity and genetic organization common to each of the subgroups.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background Information"}, {"text": "A large number of molecular biologic and sequencing studies established that the coronaviruses share a common genetic organization and mode of replication. Infected cells contain a set of 6 to 9 virus-specific polyadenylated RNAs that make up a 3 co-terminal nested set, with the largest member of this set being the genome RNA and the remaining RNAs representing subgenomic mRNAs. The subgenomic RNAs encode the structural proteins enumerated above in a characteristic order: HE (if present)-S-E-M-N. In addition to these structural genes, coronavirus subgenomic RNAs encode accessory proteins that are not essential for viral replication. They generally modulate cellular responses to infection and are specific for each coronavirus subgroup. The replicase proteins are encoded in the 5 two-thirds of the genome. This region contains two very long partially overlapping open reading frames that are translated by a ribosomal frame shifting mechanism. The \u223c750-kDa primary translation product is cotranslationally autocatalytically cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that encode the machinery needed for RNA replication and transcription. Many of the coronaviruses are associated with respiratory or enteric diseases, although some viruses replicate and cause disease at other sites, including the liver, spleen, and central nervous system. Most of the coronaviruses are relatively species specific, only infecting their natural host and cell cultures derived from that host or a closely related host species. However, there are several examples of coronaviruses jumping species, with SARS-CoV being the most well known example. SARS-CoV is thought to have originated in bats, where SARS-like CoVs have been identified, and then transmitted to civets and raccoon dogs in wild animal markets in Southern China, from which they were subsequently transmitted to humans (Lau et al., 2010) . During this chain of transmission, several key adaptations to the new host occurred (Li et al., 2005a,b) . CCoV and FeCoV provide another exception to the high degree of species specificity of coronaviruses, in that both viruses are able to grow in feline cells. Phylogenetic analysis of the group Ia coronaviruses, CCoV, FeCoV, and TGEV, suggest a complex set of recombination events has given rise to these viruses from a common ancestor, likely explaining the ability of both CCoV and FeCoV to infect feline cells (Wesseling et al., 1994; Lorusso et al., 2008) . The species specificity of coronaviruses is controlled by the ectodomain of the S protein, and can be altered by creating chimeric S proteins that contain the ectodomain of a distantly related CoV (Kuo et al., 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1878, "end": 1896, "text": "(Lau et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1983, "end": 2003, "text": "(Li et al., 2005a,b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2416, "end": 2440, "text": "(Wesseling et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2441, "end": 2462, "text": "Lorusso et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2662, "end": 2680, "text": "(Kuo et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background Information"}, {"text": "Many of the newly identified coronaviruses have not been successfully propagated in cell culture as yet, and are only known through RT-PCR sequencing.

Two approaches, targeted recombination (Kuo et al., 2000) and in vitro cDNA assembly (Yount et al., 2002; Youn et al., 2005) , which have been employed to perform reverse genetics in coronaviruses, are described here. Other reverse genetic systems have been developed for various coron-aviruses. These employ recombinant vaccinia viruses, essentially as cloning vectors carrying a coronavirus genome (Casais et al., 2001; Thiel et al., 2001) , or use a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) as a cloning vector (Almazan et al., 2000) . Each of these systems has advantages and disadvantages. The in vitro cDNA assembly system has the advantage of ease of manipulation in terms of introducing mutations, since the genome has been cloned in seven separate cDNA fragments. The corresponding disadvantage is that the plasmids carrying these cDNAs must be maintained and ligated and subsequently transcribed in vitro to regenerate infectious virus. Vaccinia virusbased systems are easy to maintain, but it is slightly more cumbersome to generate mutant recombinant viruses using this system, and it exposes personnel to the added risk of working with vaccinia virus. The BAC-based system established for TGEV contains a single cDNA representing the entire TGEV genome, and has the advantage that the genome is under the control of a CMV promoter, allowing virus to be regenerated by simple transfection into permissive cells rather than relying on in vitro transcription and electroporation of the resulting RNA into permissive cells. This is balanced by the awkwardness of introducing mutations into the 31-kbp CoV insert in the BAC.

We generally do not use cells that have been carried in cell culture more than 20 passages after defrosting, to try to minimize variability. For plaque assays, it is important to seed cells at a consistent concentration and to allow them to reach confluence. Once cells have reached confluence they should be used that day. Holding them an additional day will depress the titer and result in smaller plaques. A second critical parameter for the plaque assay is avoiding drying out the monolayer, either during washing the monolayers or viral adsorption, steps 3 and 4 respectively in Basic Protocol 1. For this reason, we generally will wash the monolayers only in groups of four 6-well plates, and similarly start the viral adsorption four plates at a time.

Another critical step is, when adding the agarose overlay medium to the plates (Basic Protocol 1, step 6), to be sure to mix the virus inoculum with the overlay medium before the overlay hardens. Failure to do so will result in residual liquid between the overlay medium and the agarose, which will produce cometshaped plaques that are hard to count. The critical parameter for the end-point dilution assay is the density of the cells at the time of infection. We have found that seeding the cells at 50,000 cells per well the evening prior to the assay has worked well in our hands.

One strain of MHV, MHV-A59, grows to very high titer (10 8 to 10 9 plaque-forming units/ml); most other strains commonly used (MHV-3, MHV-2, MHV-1, and MHV-JHM) achieve titers between 10 6 and 10 8 pfu/ml), and some strains, such as MHV-Yale, grow to still lower titers (10 5 to 10 6 pfu/ml). Especially for viruses that grow relatively poorly, it is important that the cell monolayers not be confluent when they are infected. We generally infect culture flasks that are 50% to 75% confluent, depending upon the strain of MHV we are growing. In Basic Protocol 2, we give a range of multiplicities of infection for growing stock virus, from 0.1 to 0.0001. The multiplicity of infection, the confluence of the monolayer, and the speed at which virus infection spreads through the cell monolayer are related variables. Generally, viruses that reach high titer replicate more quickly, and thus the infection spreads through the monolayer more rapidly. Hence, a lower multiplicity of infection can be used for these viruses. For viruses that spread somewhat more slowly, it is best to use multiplicities of infection toward the higher portion of this range. The density of the cells used to grow the stock should be adjusted for the estimated amount of time it will take for 90% or more of the cells to develop cytopathogenic effect, with cells infected at relatively low densities (\u223c50% confluence) if the infection is expected to take 3 days; cell monolayers that are \u223c75% confluent are generally used for infections that are expected to take 48 hr or less.

It is often advisable, therefore, to titer the virus to be purified to be certain it has grown reasonably well.

For viruses that do not grow as vigorously, we generally start with a minimum of 216 ml of clarified infected tissue culture supernatant, and preferably with 432 ml or more. For volumes larger than 216 ml, it is necessary to pellet the virus through a pad (Basic Protocol 3, steps 1 to 3), and after pouring off the supernatant liquid, including the pad, a second 216 ml can pelleted through a fresh pad in the same tube. The pellet from both centrifugations can then be resuspended in buffer and virus purified by density-gradient centrifugation. It is important to be careful when preparing density gradients and overlaying the sample onto the gradients. It is important to disturb the gradient as little as possible in moving centrifuge tubes into and out of the centrifuge buckets.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mouse hepatitis virus purification"}, {"text": "There are several critical points in utilizing the cDNA assembly reverse genetic system for coronaviruses. First, several of the large cDNAs have a tendency to undergo deletion when grown in E. coli if care is not taken in making plasmid preps. For this reason, we always grow the bacteria containing these plasmids at 30 \u2022 C (Support Protocol 2) and check that the inserts are the correct size prior to use. We maintain DNA stocks of each plasmid that worked successfully, as well as glycerol stocks of the bacteria, so that we can retransform with a plasmid that we know to be correct. A second critical parameter relates to the ligation of the gel-purified cDNAs. We always monitor each ligation step by agarose electrophoresis. If a ligation has not gone to completion, we add additional ligase and continue the incubation for an additional 6 to 24 hr. Gel-purified cDNA fragments should be stored at \u221270 \u2022 C for no longer than 8 weeks for best results at the ligation step. It is also important to use relatively fresh ligase. We recommend that you avoid using ligase that has been on hand for greater than 4 weeks. In vitro transcription kits can lose activity during storage in the freezer. We keep our T7 polymerase in a Stratacooler (Stratagene) and take care that it is kept cold when taken out of the freezer. It is essential to have a good transcription reaction and to avoid RNA degradation; therefore, good technique is called for. We monitor the transcription reaction by gel electrophoresis to be sure that we have synthesized very large RNA transcripts. Finally, when making recombinant viruses containing mutations, it is possible to recover undesired wild-type contaminants. To minimize the likelihood of this occurring, we keep all of the reagents and buffers that we use for transcription and electroporation segregated and in small aliquots. The electroporations are performed in a hood that is only used for uninfected cells, and we always perform a negative control electroporation that has not received any RNA to monitor for contamination. It is essential to partially sequence any viruses recovered to ascertain that you have recovered the desired virus and not a contaminant. The sequencing should cover any mutations that you have introduced and regions containing marker mutations. For efficient electroporation, BHK-R cells need to be growing well, and the density of the BHK-R cells should be 50% to 80% of confluency prior to harvesting.
