The new virus that caused this epidemic was named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has now become a global catastrophe. As of Apri1 30, 2020, about 3.1 million cases have been confirmed and about 220,000 deaths were caused by COVID-19 around the world. 1 Recent data suggest that most people with COVID-19 have common comorbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. 2 Diabetes is one of the leading causes of morbidity, which results in huge health and financial burden worldwide. 3 Diabetes is a primary risk factor for the development of severe pneumonia This article is protected by copyright.

The first aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments, and major outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with different degrees of hyperglycemia. The second aim was to assess the association between different degrees of hyperglycemia and the risk of all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19.",

These results were independent of major cardiovascular risk factors including age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, blood total cholesterol, using antihypertensive drugs, using lipidlowering agents, admission to ICU, and using invasive mechanical ventilation. However, the relative risk of mortality among patients with known diabetes became higher than in those with newly diagnosed diabetes after adjustment for using glucose-lowering drugs before hospital admission and during hospitalization, and using corticosteroid. This can be speculated that COVID-19 patients with known diabetes using glucose-lowering drugs to control blood sugar might have a protective effect on the death risk.",

Patients with hyperglycemia up to diabetes and patients with asymptomatic diabetes contributed equally to the all-cause mortality risk, and both had a higher risk of mortality than patients with known diabetes as compared with patients with normal glucose (Online Table 1 ).

There are some mechanisms that newly diagnosed diabetes and/or known diabetes might play a role in COVID-19 infection and poor prognosis. Hyperglycemia and a history of diabetes are independent predictors of mortality and morbidity in patients with SARS. 6 It could be that these patients have a state of metabolic inflammation that predisposes them to an enhanced release of cytokines. For COVID-19, a cytokine storm that showed greatly elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines has been implicated in the multi-organ failure in patients with severe diseases. 29 Metabolic inflammation caused by hyperglycemia can also damage the immune system, reducing the body's ability to cope with infection, impairing the healing process and prolonging recovery time. An animal model shows that the complication of type 2 diabetes causes an immune disorder and enhances disease severity following MERS-CoV infection. 30 On the other hand, ACE2 has been confirmed as the receptor for the coronavirus spike protein. ACE2 has protective effects primarily regarding inflammation. COVID-19 infection reduces ACE2 expression, which induces cellular damage, hyperinflammation, and respiratory failure. 19 Acute hyperglycemia has been shown to upregulate ACE2 expression on This article is protected by copyright.

The relatively rich clinical data and numerous events also strengthen the results. There are some limitations to this study. First, our analyses adjusted for some confounding factors, however, unmeasured factors, such as body mass index, beta cell autoantibodies, could not be evaluated because there was relatively insufficient maintenance in an early stage of the epidemic outbreak and most sickest patients or patients who died during hospitalization did not measure height and weight. Second, not all patients had HbA1c tests, which may have some impacts on the accuracy of our blood glucose grouping. Third, using fasting glucose \u22657.0 mmol/L and HbA1c \u22656.5% as cutpoints to newly diagnose diabetes might have a potential misclassification bias because a significant rise in blood glucose for stress as hypoxia and inflammation was found among patients after COVID-19. We used this definition to call more attention to clinical screening and treatment among COVID-19 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes at hospital admission.",

Moreover, the present study was the first one to show that COVID-19 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes based on the first laboratory measurement after hospital admission had the highest risk of mortality compared with COVID-19 patients with known diabetes, hyperglycemia and normal glucose, and this association was independent of major cardiovascular risk factors.Several earlier studies have shown a link between a history of diabetes and COVID-19. Two studies in Wuhan indicated that 20% of 41 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (median age of 49 years)17 and 10.1% of 138 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (median age of 56 years) 9 had a history of diabetes. According to the Chinese National Diabetes Survey in 2017, the prevalence of diabetes among people over 20 years old was 12.8% (6.0% of known diabetes and 6.8% of asymptomatic/newly diagnosed diabetes), and the prevalence of diabetes among people of 60-69 years old was 28.8% (14.9% of known diabetes and 13.9% of newly diagnosed diabetes).18 The present study indicated that 21.6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients reported a history of diabetes, 20.8% of COVID-19 patients were newly diagnosed as diabetes (fasting glucose \u22657.0 mmol/L and/or HbA1c \u22656.5%), and 28.4% of COVID-19",

Patients with known diabetes and newly diagnosed diabetes were more likely to use antihypertensive drugs, glucoselowering medicines during hospital admission, lipid-lowering agents, corticosteroid treatment, oxygen support, and stay longer at hospital compared with patients with normal glucose or slight hyperglycemia. During a mean follow-up period of 29.5 days (range 1-70 days), 39 inpatients died. The results for the multivariate-adjusted Cox models for all-cause mortality in different glucose categories are shown in Table 4 and Figure 1.
