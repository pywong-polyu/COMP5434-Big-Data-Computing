            "text": "Plasmodium knowlesi, a model malaria parasite, is responsible for a significant portion of zoonotic malaria cases in Southeast Asia and must be controlled to avoid disease severity and fatalities. However, little is known about the host-parasite interactions and molecular mechanisms in play during the course of P. knowlesi malaria infections, which also may be relevant across Plasmodium species. Here we contrast P. knowlesi sporozoite-initiated infections in Macaca mulatta and Macaca fascicularis using whole blood RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis. These macaque hosts are evolutionarily close, yet malaria-na\u00efve M. mulatta will succumb to blood-stage infection without treatment, whereas malaria-na\u00efve M. fascicularis controls parasitemia without treatment. This comparative analysis reveals transcriptomic differences as early as the liver phase of infection, in the form of signaling pathways that are activated in M. fascicularis, but not M. mulatta. Additionally, while most immune responses are initially similar during the acute stage of the blood infection, significant differences arise subsequently. The observed differences point to prolonged inflammation and anti-inflammatory effects of IL10 in M. mulatta, while M. fascicularis undergoes a transcriptional makeover towards cell proliferation, consistent with its recovery. Together, these findings suggest that timely detection of P. knowlesi in M. fascicularis, coupled with control of inflammation while initiating the replenishment of key cell populations, helps contain the infection. Overall, this study points to specific genes and pathways that could be investigated as a basis for new drug targets that support recovery from acute malaria.",

While immunity and vaccine research is advancing in the context of controlled human malaria infection studies initiated with sporozoites [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , performing these longitudinal molecular studies with human volunteers has its logistical and ethical challenges 21 , and immediate treatment of blood-stage infections has been a standard requirement.",

Nonhuman primate (NHP) macaque models are much closer to humans, and the clinical presentation of malaria and immune responses are more similar between humans and macaques [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . As a consequence, macaques have become important alternatives to rodent models for explaining different host-pathogen interactions, not only for malaria, but also for various diseases including those caused by HIV/SIV and COVID 30, 31 .

Our investigations yielded a large collection of datasets and analyses from over 30 macaque infections and controls, including frequent samplings of blood and bone marrow 34, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . The first two simian malaria parasite species are excellent models of corresponding human infections by the parasites P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively 28, 44 , while P. knowlesi reflects aspects of both, depending on the question 29, 45 . Plasmodium cynomolgi and P. knowlesi infect both humans and NHPs and constitute zoonotic public health concerns in Southeast Asia, where humans and macaque species coexist 7,46-49 . Comparative longitudinal macaque infection studies of the type performed by our consortium can help focus analyses on significant molecular features that play crucial roles in determining the course of the disease. Furthermore, because host-pathogen interactions in macaques can closely mimic those in humans, findings from macaques have great potential for establishing a rational basis for new therapeutic targets and interventions, including host-directed therapies.",

Namely, Mf co-evolved with P. knowlesi within a large geographical area of Southeast Asia, whereas the distribution of Mm overlaps with P. knowlesi only slightly ( Figure S2 ). Arguably as a consequence, Mf shows signs of the disease but survives with a low-level infection that can become chronic, whereas Mm becomes severely ill with escalating life-threatening parasitemia and succumbs unless treated 32, 33, 53, 54 . The molecular and physiological basis of this stark difference is unknown. We found that the peripheral blood transcriptional responses have many similarities between the two species, but subtle differences are significant with regard to the observed outcomes. In particular, our analysis suggests that Mf initiates its transcriptomic response earlier than Mm and with some favorable adjustments around the time of the acute blood-stage infection that could contribute to the control of parasitemia and help enable the recovery of Mf.",

As expected, gene expression repertoires and levels changed in both monkey species during the course of experimentally introduced P. knowlesi sporozoite infections, both as the P. knowlesi parasites multiplied within hepatocytes and following their cyclical replication in host RBCs and parasitemia patency (Fig. 1A , 6 days post inoculation \"dpi\" onwards). To characterize these changes, we compared RNA-seq data generated from samples acquired from both macaque species at baseline and at specific infection time points (TPs). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the whole-blood gene expression patterns ( Fig. 2A) shows a clear separation of the two species, as well as between samples taken before infection (TP1 and TP2) and during the fast rise and approach of peaking parasitemia (TP4 and TP5, respectively 8 and 10 dpi). Samples taken shortly after the inoculation of sporozoites, during the pre-patent period (TP3, 3 dpi), cluster mostly with Figure S3 ) demonstrates dominance of inter-individual variability over short-term transcriptomic changes during the initial phase of the infection. It is worth noting that the same PC2 axis crisply separates pre-infection (TP1, TP2) and acute infection (TP4, TP5) samples for both host species even though the disease progression is different, suggesting fundamentally similar transcriptional responses. To gain deeper insights into the details of PC2, we identified enriched Gene Ontology (GO) gene sets along this axis (Fig. 2B) . The most enriched gene sets are associated with defense and innate immune responses (p \u2248 10 \u221270 ) and with a response to cytokine and biotic stimuli ( Figure S4 ).",

We hypothesized that there might be a relationship between the evolutionary divergence of homologous Mm and Mf genes and their expression profiles in the two hosts, since such divergence could be explained by evolutionary pressure and possibly underpin the differences in the control of parasitemia and in the different outcomes observed www.nature.com/scientificreports/ between the species. To test this hypothesis, we estimated the evolutionary distance between homologous genes in the two species (Table S9 ) and compared the similarity scores of DRGs at each time point. The evolutionary hypothesis was ultimately rejected given a gene similarity score of all genes that was not significantly different (Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value > 0.1) from that of the three sets of DRGs (Fig. 3) . However, it is interesting to note that genes involved in regulation of immune system processes were overrepresented in the outliers at each time point, with a hypergeometric p-value of 3.9 \u00d7 10 \u221218 and 3.29-fold over-enrichment in the Gene set enrichment analysis indicates distinctive gene expression profiles between the species by TP5. To identify well-defined, significantly enriched gene sets with respect to P. knowlesi infection, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using significant DEGs (adjusted p < 0.01, log2 (absolute fold change) > 1) at each time point. We used Hallmark gene sets from the Molecular Signature database 55 for an overview analysis (Table S1 ) followed by a detailed analysis using GO annotated biological pathways. Intriguingly, by TP3 a few DEGs were identified that only showed significant enrichment in the Mf. Although the number of DEGs is similar in both species, Mf has several Hallmark gene sets significantly enriched (Table S1 ). Importantly, these results suggest that by 3 dpi, when parasites solely reside in the liver, Mf is already mounting interferon (IFN)-mediated immune responses (IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3) against the parasite. Relevant genes involved in the response include IRF7, CCL22, CXCL12 and PML. In-depth GO analysis ( Figure S6 ) indicates that the IFN responses are characterized by pathways known to regulate viral genome replication and the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling pathway, known to indicate the presence of foreign genetic material. Differences between the two species are less evident by TP4, when parasitemia is rising. Then, both species show pronounced enrichment for IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 immune responses and several signaling pathways, including NF\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 ( Figure S7 , Table S1 ).",

Connectors show changes in rank for each gene set between the two TPs. Red shading indicates increases in rank and hence decreased enrichment from left (TP4) to right (TP5). Blue shading indicates decreases in rank and thus increased enrichment from TP4 to TP5. Color shades are proportional to relative changes in rank considering all gene sets (not just the ones shown). For instance, the darker shade of red for p53 pathway in panel D represents a sharp decrease in rank. (E): Violin plots of rank differences, representing the importance of gene sets, between TP4 and TP5 in the two host species. The vertical axis represents the distribution of rank differences between TP4 and TP5 for GO gene sets in Mm and Mf. Each data point in the two distributions represents one GO gene set (see Methods for details). The transition from TP4 to TP5 in Mm is characterized by a distribution (shown in purple) with 0 mean and a broad, rather than narrow distribution, which corresponds to relatively small changes in the importance of most gene sets. By contrast, the distribution of ranks in Mf (shown in green) has a much narrower distribution at the mean, with heavy tails, indicating many more changes in rank, overall. Both red and blue domains represent pathways that are important in Mm during both TP4 and TP5. In Mf, the red domain represents pathways that were not important at TP4 (higher ranked/lower enrichment) but become more important at TP5 (lower ranked/higher enrichment), while the blue domain represents pathways that were important at TP4 but become less important at TP5. The striking difference between these distributions demonstrates that Mf alters and refocuses its gene expression profile between TP4 and TP5 towards cell proliferation, etc. In contrast, Mm's gene expression remains almost unchanged, still emphasizing the immune response. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Interestingly, some of the adaptive immune pathways previously only identified in Mf at TP4 (Figures S8) are evident in Mm at TP5 ( Figure S9 ). Beyond these differences, the two hosts have some pathways in common at TP5, mostly associated with immune responses to inflammation and metabolic pathways regulating cell cycle and protein modification.",

The immune responses in Mf are still evident at TP5, but gene expression in this species notably shifts toward cell proliferation and cell division functions, highlighted by DNA replication, chromosome segregation, organelle fission and localization pathways. One of the noticeable enrichment changes in Mf is in the p53 pathway (Fig. 4D) , with the timely enrichment of this stress response pathway by TP4, and its ceased enrichment by TP5. This observation can be regarded as a precursor for DNA replication, cell division and cell proliferation pathways 56 . Moreover, we were able to extract more information about previously identified cell cycle related pathways (Fig. 4E) . Myeloid leukocyte differentiation hints at upregulation of specific cell populations in Mf. It is worth noticing that Mf downregulates cytokine production while upregulating Th1 cell cytokine production, which is a part of the adaptive immune response. Enrichment of the JAK-STAT pathway ( Figure S7 ) in Mm along with its cross-regulation with both IL10 and IL6 suggests duplicated efforts 57 . Differential expression of the SOCS3 gene in both Mm and Mf suggests upregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway but the two-fold regulation could mean impaired functionality in Mm. Overall, as discussed further below, the GSEA reveals a prominent difference in molecular responses that might be responsible for the diverse outcomes of the two macaque hosts.",

This earlier response is consistent with the conclusions of Peterson et al. 51 from their analysis of clinical, parasitological and immune response data for these infected animals. Interestingly, in Mm, a strong enrichment of Ca 2+ ion transport might be playing an important role in pathogen survival as it maintains Ca 2+ homeostasis and aids the parasite's Ca 2+ -based signaling, which is critical for parasite growth and differentiation within infected RBCs, and their egress and invasion of new host RBCs during the blood stage of the disease 58 . The transition from TP4 to TP5 highlights key differences in immune responses between the two species. Gene expression at TP4 has significant similarities between the two species, although there are some key differences. Then the species' responses diverge. Figures 4, S7 and S10 demonstrate that while Mm does not seem to change its response much, Mf mounts a radical makeover in expression profiles in important pathways between TP4 and TP5, and these changes appear to be among the most crucial differences observed between the two species. In contrast to Mf 's response, Mm displays fairly small changes among the most enriched gene sets during the transition from TP4 to TP5, exceptions being an increased focus on hypoxiarelated genes and decreased importance of E2F target genes at TP5.",

The IFN\u03b3-inducible genes are carefully orchestrated by the transcription factors STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 to respond appropriately to the specific needs of the cell. This immune response is complemented by the IL-6 regulated JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway, which controls cytokines like erythropoietin, thrombopoietin and G-CSF and thereby may be involved in dealing with pathological conditions like anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia or, alternatively, the generation of antibodies through B-cell and plasma cell differentiation. The innate immune system in the host spearheads the immune response not only by developing protective immunity but also by aiding the host in dealing with pathogenesis 74 , and the initial pro-inflammatory response attempts to clear the infection. However, when elevated and prolonged, inflammation leads to physiological deterioration and increasing severity of various pathological conditions. The fact that pro-inflammatory genes of the IFN\u03b3 pathway are more strongly elevated at TP4 in Mm than Mf suggests prolonged inflammation only in Mm, despite similar levels of parasitemia in both species at that time point. IL-10 is a chief anti-inflammatory receptor and affects various pathways to inhibit inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-1 and TNF\u03b1. Substantial upregulation of IL-10 combined with enriched B-cell subpopulations (Pro B and Pre B) at this phase of infection is again suggestive of Mm's attempt to stem the inflammation and fight the infection. In contrast, the presence of significantly enriched non-classical monocytes along with differentially expressed TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2 and CCL3L3 is indicative of a direct response to the pathogen via the MyD88-MEK pathway 75 . Non-classical monocytes are known to produce more TNF\u03b1 and less IL10, and timing of their enrichment might be crucial for the outcome.",

Mm continues with its prolonged immune response with proinflammatory signatures, while Mf initiates a program of cell proliferation with the transcription of multiple genes involved in DNA replication and repair, mitosis, and cell cycle progression; all these suggest the onset of a recovery phase in the Mf. Enrichment of HSPCs in their G2M phase could support replenishment of lost cells and reinforcement of the immune response. Notably in Mf, the p53 pathway is significantly downregulated at TP5 in comparison to TP4, consistent with the goal of preventing p53 targets from hindering these cell proliferation pathways 76 . The gene TP53 is known to be activated in response to DNA damage and oxidative stress. It assists in apoptosis of damaged RBCs and maintains adult stem cell niches. In patients with malaria, TP53 has been shown to modulate inflammatory responses to infection 77 . Hypoxia activates this p53 signaling, and, indeed, hypoxia levels were higher in Mm than Mf, suggesting that higher hypoxia levels, sustained for a prolonged time, may contribute to the extended stress response of the p53 pathway. If so, the p53 pathway might be an important yardstick for inflammation. Sustained inflammation and delay in upregulation of cell development pathways in Mm is in fact revealing with regards to the mechanistic explanation for Mm's deterioration, compared to Mf 's resilience and recovery, with the added major concern that infected Mm are rapidly running out of healthy, uninfected RBCs.",

Not surprisingly, it also has shortcomings, which are by and large due to the infrequency of sampling in our longitudinal study, which in turn was dictated by regulatory blood draw limitations. Since most of the differentiating factors between the two macaque species point to the critical timing of pathogen detection and the timely switch of Mf 's transcriptomics program toward recovery, an iterative longitudinal study with denser sampling around these times would most likely allow more refined and definitive claims. Such experiments are warranted, particularly since our study results highlight promising prospects that one might use for the development of future anti-malarial treatments and vaccines. Many potential adjuvants for anti-malarial vaccines are under investigation, which mostly seek to target PRR signaling via TLR agonists 82 . Our analysis provides further mechanistic support for the application of such vaccines. During the later phases of the infection, IL10-and p53-related pathways could provide interesting drug targets. While it might be challenging to control IL10 due to its numerous roles, targeting p53 has already been demonstrated to attenuate malarial inflammation and protect from fever 77 .",

            "text": "Other comparative studies investigating P. coatneyi infections in the two macaque species, Mm and Mf, have shed light on differences in the pathology caused by this parasite species 83, 84 . Unlike the current sporozoiteinitiated infection study, however, these studies were based on the inoculation of blood-stage parasites. Raja et al. specifically indicate that cryopreserved P. coatneyi infected RBCs were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and passaged once in intact (non-splenectomized) animals 83 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ isolate (Hackeri strain) used in our published reports was confirmed by the CDC to have been passaged only in intact animals, where it caused disease including severe infections 40, 85 , as documented previously 32, 33, 86 . The difference is important, because passage of P. coatneyi in splenectomized animals results in the circulation of schizonts 26 that, according to electron microscopy, lack knob protrusions (unpublished data), suggesting the possibility of reduced SICAvar gene expression 87 , cytoadhesion, tissue sequestration, and virulence. Future comparative studies of P. coatneyi-an excellent model for P. falciparum-or P. cynomolgi-a model for P. vivax-that begin with sporozoites in the two macaque species would be of high interest. Considering how closely related the two macaque species in our analysis are, one might have envisioned some simple switch in the expression of a few genes to result in the two disparate fates following P. knowlesi infection. Instead, our comparative analysis demonstrates that the differences in responses are rather subtle but widely distributed within a macaque species. In fact, the main and dramatic host species-specific difference we detected lies in the timing of responses, with Mf moving faster to identify the infection and trigger immune responses that can suppress the infection and support their recovery. This insight, if independently validated, is important for the development of potential new interventions as it suggests the need to search for means permitting the host to have enough time early on to generate a strong and effective immune response.",

The animals were observed daily during baseline periods, when inoculated with sporozoites, and throughout the infection. Female monkeys were excluded to avoid confounding effects of menstruation. Blood samples were collected at pre-defined TPs between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. for both hosts, when the P. knowlesi cycle presents predominantly-if not exclusively-ring forms in circulation (Fig. 1) . The Mf experiment underwent an initial unsuccessful sporozoite inoculation, and a new preinfection baseline (TP2B) was established. The sporozoite re-inoculation was conducted approximately 80 days after the failed inoculation, and as shown in Figure S13 , the failed inoculation did not have any apparent effect on the subjects and the observed transcriptomes. All pre-infection samples were used to establish baseline expression. The present study describes a secondary data analysis, while experimental details are described in Peterson et al. 51 . Nonetheless, all experiments involving NHPs were performed at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC), an AAALAC International-accredited facility.

Pre-infection samples TP1 and TP2 (before infection) form species-specific clusters that are separate from the samples at TP4 and TP5, reflecting peaking parasitemia.

The analysis of transcriptional modules yielded general agreement with our prior results, along with some surprising new insights (Figs. 7, S11-S12; Tables S4-S6). TP3 shows significant enrichment of IFN modules in Mf (M10.1, M15.127 and M8.3; Fig. 7). Type-1 IFN module M8.3 suggests induction of anti-pathogen effector genes like MX1 in addition to IFN modules M15.127 and M10.1, which may indicate immunopathology with host-pathogen interactions. M15.127 and M10.1 also point to a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP), specifically, double-stranded RNA. Mm meanwhile shows a relatively modest enrichment of module M15.113, which is related to IL-1-mediated inflammation (Figure S11). TP4 shows much similarity between the two hosts with respect to inflammation, IFN and cytokine-related modules (M13.16, M13.1, M10.1, M13.17, M15.127, M15.64, M15.86 and M8.3). However, some modules show distinguishing features. Down-regulation of the B-cell module M13.27 suggests possible inhibition of T cells with downregulation of CD96 and LY9. Among the erythrocyte modules, the difference in M13.30 suggests a relative difference in hematopoiesis by megakaryocyte erythroid progenitor markers like BLVRB, SLC25A39, HBM and HBQ1. The prostanoids module M8.2 suggests differences in platelet activation through enrichment of genes like PPBP, GP9, and others. Certain cell cycle related modules also suggest differentiating biological behaviors between the two hosts. Mm shows downregulation of a mitosis-related module (M13.32), while its upregulation in Mf suggests cell division. Mf exhibits several enriched cell cycle-related modules that become even more significant at TP5 (M12.15, M13.32, M15.110, M16.60 and M16.92). At TP5, Mm still expresses enriched IFN modules that are now",

Mm shows enrichment of progenitor cells for both NK and B cells. By TP5, Mm exhibits enrichment of erythrocytes and neutrophils as well. The Mm may amplify cytokine signaling using NK cells. Activation of intermediate monocytes suggests their involvement in dealing with oxidative stress created by the infection.
