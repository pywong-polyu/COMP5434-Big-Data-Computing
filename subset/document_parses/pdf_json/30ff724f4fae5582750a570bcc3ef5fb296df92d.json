Among these, self-assembled micellar formulations named ISCOMs (immune stimulating complexes) show a great ability to trigger powerful immunological responses against infectious pathogens. Here, a nanoadjuvant preparation, based on saponins from Quillaja brasiliensis, was evaluated together with an experimental Zika virus (ZIKV) vaccine (IQB80-zEDIII) and compared to an equivalent vaccine with alum as the standard adjuvant. The preparations were administered to mice in two doses (on days zero and 14) and immune responses were evaluated on day 28 post-priming. Serum levels of anti-Zika virus IgG, IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c, IgG3 were significantly increased by the nanoadjuvant vaccine, compared to the mice that received the alum-adjuvanted vaccine or the unadjuvanted vaccine. In addition, a robust production of neutralizing antibodies and in vitro splenocyte proliferative responses were observed in mice immunized with IQB80-zEDIII nanoformulated vaccine. Therefore, the IQB80-zEDIII recombinant preparation seems to be a suitable candidate vaccine for ZIKV. Overall, this study identified saponin-based delivery systems as an adequate adjuvant for recombinant ZIKV vaccines and has important implications for recombinant protein-based vaccine formulations against other flaviviruses and possibly enveloped viruses.",

In order to prevent the consequences of such infections, a variety of ZIKV vaccines have been developed and evaluated in experimental animal models (2) , though none has been licensed to date. Some groups of investigators have focused on the ZIKV E protein as an immunogen. ZIKV E is an envelope glycoprotein that is major protein responsible for the induction of protective immunity (3, 4) . This is a transmembrane protein with three extracellular domains (DI, DII, and DIII), in which DIII has been shown to induce the most potent neutralizing activity against ZIKV, without inducing undesirable antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (4) .",

Currently, nanotechnology is being employed in response to the need for new adjuvant and delivery systems that can increase cellular and humoral immune responses. The use of nanoadjuvants in vaccine formulations allows enhanced immunogenicity and antigen stability, as well as targeted delivery and slow release (10) . In this context, one group of adjuvants, the saponin-based adjuvants (SBA), has been proposed as an alternative to classical adjuvants for the design of new vaccines due to the ability of these compounds to trigger Th1 responses (9, (11) (12) (13) . Recently, two vaccines that employ recombinant proteins as antigens were licensed for human use; one is a vaccine against herpes zoster (Shingrix TM ); another is against malaria (Mosquirix TM ). Both vaccine formulations contain QS-21, a saponin from Quillaja saponaria, as an adjuvant (8) .",

            "text": "One critical issue concerning the use of saponins as vaccine adjuvants is their toxicity (14) . For this reason, nanoadjuvants, such as immmunostimulating complexes or ISCOMs, have been formulated due to their reduced toxicities (8, 13, 15) . Our research group previously reported that nanoadjuvants from Q. brasiliensis saponins are safe adjuvants in preclinical experiments (16) . Furthermore, these nanoparticles are efficiently internalized by dendritic cells, promote high antibody titers, enhance delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and stimulate the proliferation of Th1 lymphocyte subsets (17) . Moreover, these nanoadjuvants, in the absence of antigen (ISCOM-matrices), generate a local and transient immunocompetent environment, with overexpression of cytokine and chemokine genes related to inflammation (18) . Notably, the recombinant spike protein antigen, recently recovered from SARS-CoV-2, was formulated with a Q. saponaria saponin-based nanoadjuvant (Matrix-M). This putative vaccine is currently in phase 1/2 clinical trials as a possible candidate for fighting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (19, 20) .",

Although ISCOMs induce strong and persistent T cell responses (13, 28) , such complexes are particularly acknowledged for their powerful adjuvant effect on the stimulation of B-cell responses and antibody production. In particular, immunization with SBA promotes high-affinity antibodies (25) (as noted and further discussed in this work) and enhanced frequencies of antigen-specific memory B cells (13) , resulting in higher frequencies of responding memory B cells and higher titers of protective neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we believe that the immunization of zEDIII with IQB80 shapes germinal centers (GC), where the expansion, selection, and affinity maturation of zEDIII-specific B cells takes place during primary immune responses (29) . Figure 4A shows the levels of anti-zEDIII IgG at day 28 post priming. A highly significant increase in anti-zEDIII IgG was verified in mice immunized with the IQB80 (10 \u00b5g) when compared with mice immunized with zEDIII without adjuvant (p < 0.0001). This increase was >27-fold. The group of mice immunized with the alum adjuvanted-zEDIII preparation also presented an increase in levels of anti-zEDIII IgG; however, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.0762). The increase in IgG levels in mice that received the alum-adjuvanted vaccine was 3.8-fold superior in relation to mice that received antigen only. Interestingly, the levels of antibodies detected in mice immunized with antigen only did not differ significantly from the group receiving 5 times less antigen in the nanoadjuvant formulation (IQB80 2 \u00b5g) (p > 0.9999), while still being able to trigger humoral immune responses.",

In addition, these responses are superior to those generated in mice inoculated with the alum-adjuvanted vaccine or IQB80 (2 \u00b5g). In mice, Th1 responses are usually associated with enhanced isotype switching to IgG2a/2c and IgG3 (which are promoted by INF-\u03b3), whereas Th2 responses stimulate the production of IgG1 (which is promoted by IL-4) (30) . In this context, and although not conclusive, the isotype pattern elicited by IQB80 indicates that it is capable of inducing an antibody response with a Th1-type bias, as evidenced by the high levels of IgG2c and the production of IgG3.

Herein, we showed that antibodies elicited by the studied IQB80 formulations have a higher avidity than the antibodies elicited by alum formulations. Based on this, we propose that the humoral immune response elicited by Q. brasiliensis nanoadjuvants may trigger a more adequate immune response to combat ZIKV infections. High-avidity antibodies might improve immune protection, through improved recognition of virus particles, even at low viral loads, and trigger effector functions as neutralization, opsonization and complement activation. Thus, vaccine formulations with Q. brasiliensis nanoadjuvants may improve vaccine efficacy providing more robust protection as well as the potential for cross-protection, particularly important for vaccines against highly variable pathogens, such as RNA viruses (40, 41) .",

As stated previously, IQB80 formulations showed no hemolysis in vitro and regarding in vivo toxicity, no signs of local toxicity (local swelling, loss of hair, and piloerection) was detected after subcutaneous administration of the two vaccine doses. This issue had already been addressed previously by our group, demonstrating the reduced toxicity of Q. brasiliensis saponins when compared to Q. saponaria saponins (especially Quil A R , a commercial saponin fraction of Q. saponaria). This was demonstrated using several in vitro assays (hemolytic activities, cell viability, brine shrimp lethality) as well as in vitro acute toxicity tests, that Q. brasiliensis saponins (QB-90 or QB-80) (17, 25, 26, 42) . In addition to reduced toxicity, when these compounds were assembled as micellar formulations (ISCOM or ISCOM matrices), the hemolytic, cytotoxic and brine shrimp lethal activities were abolished (17, 18) . As such, the saponins of Q. brasiliensis appear to be appealing alternatives to vaccines that may require a strong stimulation of the immune system.",

In particular, neutralizing antibodies, induced by ZIKV vaccines, may provide infection avoidance (54), while T cells secrete cytokines to further promote antibody production or directly kill infected cells (55) . In the current study, the saponin-based nanoadjuvant enhanced the production of anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibodies, which are important for stimulating protection. In addition, lymphoproliferative responses were observed after in vitro stimulation with either the vaccine antigen (zEDIII) or inactivated ZIKV. Using the zEDIII protein as antigen, results show that the IQB80 nanoadjuvant enhanced the immunogenicity of zEDIII, when compared with the unadjuvanted vaccine. In addition, significant anti-ZIKV-specific immune responses were observed in mice immunized with IQB80 nanoadjuvant when compared with alum-adjuvanted mice.",

In addition, the formulation of the nanoadjuvanted vaccine was shown to be safe, with a quick and easily preparation. Moreover, the nanoadjuvant proved to be safe in terms of toxicity. No signs indicative of distress (lethality, local swelling, loss of hair, and piloerection) were observed following the inoculation of any of the preparations evaluated in one or two doses of the immunogens.",

Additionally, this nanoadjuvanted formula was able to induce neutralizing antibodies, as well as antibodies of high avidity. The nanoformulation promoted a positive in vitro cell proliferation response to recombinant zEDIII, as well as to an inactivated ZIKV antigen. Moreover, the magnitude of immune responses in alum-adjuvanted mice was lower than in the group that was immunized with the nanoadjuvant. Overall, this study identified saponin-based nanoadjuvants as a suitable adjuvant for ZIKV recombinant vaccines; findings have important implications for subunit vaccines against enveloped viruses, including other flaviviruses. Furthermore, this is a potent adjuvant obtained from renewable sources, which seems to compare favorably with other available alternatives.",
