SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus disease-19 in humans, has rapidly spread worldwide and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 [4] . Moreover, at that time, the first reports of sporadic SARS-CoV-2 infection in dogs and cats after suspected human-to-animal transmission [2, 5, 6] became public.",

Domestic and wild felids, ferrets, Syrian hamsters, mink, gorillas, and macaques have been found to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and transmission to cohoused animals was reported in these species [11] . By contrast, dogs were shown to have a lower susceptibility than cats [3, 12] ; however, in both species, natural SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported [2, 5] .",

Both assays were run on an ABI PRISM 7500 Fast Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using 4 \u00b5L of TNA and a TaqMan \u00ae Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a RT-qPCR protocol designed by the Swiss Federal Institute for Virology and Immunology (IVI, Mittelh\u00e4usern, Switzerland) [31] . Negative RT-qPCR controls (RNase-DNase-free water, AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), a negative extraction control (PBS), and a positive RT-qPCR control (in-vitro transcribed RNA control containing three concatenated sequences of RdRp, E, and nucleocapsid (N) SARS-Cov-2 genes: RNA_Wuhan_RdRp-E-N, provided by the IVI) were added in every run [32] .",

One of the 24 cats (ID 225) showed reactivity above the positive cut-off value in the RBD-ELISA, with an OD value of 1.08 (positive cut-off at 0.78). However, this result could not be confirmed by either the sVNT or at the University of Utrecht, where the sample was negative in S1 ELISA and pseudotyped VNT, but also yielded positive RBD-ELISA results. The RBD-ELISA and sVNT results obtained at the Clinical Laboratory in Zurich are shown in Figures 4 and 5 , respectively.",

Dogs and cats are among the most popular companion animal species; they often live in close contact with their owners and can contract SARS-CoV-2 [2, 16, 21, 44] . Experimental studies have shown that cats, unlike dogs, can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to cohoused cats via direct contact or aerosols [3, 45, 46] . This gives reason to assume that cat-to-human transmission is also a possibility [47] . Proof of virus transmission from SARS-CoV-2 infected pet animals to humans, however, will be difficult to obtain, due to limitations on study design and for ethical reasons [48, 49] .

Nevertheless, human-to-animal transmission can also occur in unknowingly COVID-19-affected households, e.g., in households with presymptomatic or asymptomatic humans. A meta-analysis which screened 2454 articles that included 663 positive humans, of which 111 were asymptomatic, found the proportion of asymptomatic infections among humans to be as high as 17% (95% CI: 14% to 20%) [52] . Although asymptomatic patients were found to infect slightly fewer contacts than symptomatic patients, the risk of transmission was still significant [53] . Wide-scale monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections in companion animals in areas with high incidences among humans during the early phase of the pandemic was the chosen approach in the present study to broadly monitor this novel viral infection from a One Health perspective.",

However, the regions where the animals resided were hotspot areas during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., during the time of sampling. In the study cohort, 18 of the 1137 enrolled animals (1.6%) had reported contact with COVID-19-affected humans and 92 animals (8.1%) showed signs of respiratory disease, which, in humans, would be considered consistent with COVID-19 infection. The fact that only animals that were presented to veterinary clinics were enrolled must be considered when interpreting the results. Indeed, animals undergoing an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection could potentially be underrepresented in the study population, since mainly diseased animals are presented to veterinary clinics, with few exceptions (76% of animals in this study's population were reported as sick). Under natural conditions, the periods of potential virus shedding of infected animals might coincide with the time of self-isolation of the owners who might therefore have been unable to present the animals to a veterinarian, missing the early phase of a SARS-CoV-2 infection for sampling. When presented after the owners' isolation period, the animals might have already overcome the shedding period and developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; however, only a small number of serum samples were available for this study. In experimental studies, it was shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is cleared within the first 14 days after infection in cats and within 6 days in dogs [3, 54] . A study investigating COVID-19-affected households showed RT-qPCR positivity in a cat 32 days, and in two dogs 9 days after the owners' COVID-19 diagnosis [21] . However, only limited data are available on shedding periods and patterns in companion animals. Our study comprised fewer cats than dogs, which might be explained by a lower representation of cats in the clinics or due to differences in patients' compliance during the sampling procedure. Nonetheless, our prevalence results can be regarded as representative of the pet cat and dog populations in areas with high COVID-19 incidences among humans during the first wave of the pandemic.",

One Italian cat living in a COVID-19-affected household in Piedmont tested positive in RT-qPCR (1/260; 0.38%, 95% CI: 0.01-2.1%). The cat's oropharyngeal swab sample, which was confirmed as positive by the Swiss reference laboratory, yielded high CT values ranging from 37 to 42, which represent a low viral load. Nonetheless, active infection in this cat was confirmed by the presence of antibodies five and six months after the positive RT-qPCR result. The viral load in this cat was too low for assessment of the viral sequence and comparison with SARS-CoV-2 isolated in humans in Piedmont at the time [42] . None of the 95 German cats tested positive in RT-qPCR. These results are in line with previous studies showing zero prevalence in the detection of viral RNA in Italy (180 samples from cats) [16] and throughout Europe, North America, and Asia (2466 samples from cats) during the early pandemic [18] .",

The dog showed CT values of 36.6 and 43 in both RT-qPCR assays performed at the Clinical Laboratory from the oropharyngeal swab; however, the sample was not confirmed at the Swiss Federal Institute for Virology and Immunology. This discrepancy can be explained by loss of RNA integrity by repeated freeze-thaw cycles and during transport. Additionally, variations between laboratories and the performed assays can affect the results, especially in samples with low viral RNA loads. These low viral RNA loads could be due to the timing of sampling; alternatively, they might represent contamination. This specific dog was presented due to vomiting, but neither vomit, feces, nor subsequent serum were available for analysis. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection of the gastrointestinal tract and possible contamination of the oropharyngeal mucosa due to vomiting cannot be excluded, and the cause of these questionable positive results remains unclear.",

The results of the molecular detection of the virus are in contrast with those of the serological testing, where one of the 118 canine serum samples analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies and neutralizing activity (1/94; 1.1%; 95% CI: 0.02-5.7%) was found to be positive.

In the RBD-ELISA assay, the positive cut-off for cats was set at an OD value of 0.78, which was calculated as the mean OD value of pre-COVID-19 cat samples plus the six-fold standard deviation [30] . The high reactivity in one cat sample (ID 225) could not be confirmed by the surrogate virus neutralization test or by the tests performed at the University of Utrecht, which investigated binding to the S1 protein and virus neutralization. Therefore, the sample was interpreted as negative. However, the RBD-ELISA in Utrecht also yielded a positive result in this specimen. These concordant findings gave reason to further investigate the underlying cause of the high reactivity in the RBD-ELISA. However, the ELISA using SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD protein, which were applied by the University of Utrecht, had previously been investigated for cross-reactivity with antibodies against FCoV, and no cross-reactivity was reported [25] . In accordance with our results showing 23/24 FCoV antibody-positive cats having a reactivity below the positive cut-off value in the RBD-ELISA, the positive signal in the sample from cat ID 225 seems unlikely to illustrate cross-reactivity to FCoV antibodies; the FCoV IFA titer of this specimen was 1:400. However, an interference with anti-coronavirus-antibodies cannot be fully excluded. Viruses in the Coronaviridae family have demonstrated their ability for interspecies transmission, and recombination events have been illustrated in the past [55] [56] [57] . An antibody response to a yet-unknown feline coronavirus, although unlikely, needs to be considered. Alternatively, a virus of the genus betacoronavirus present in this cat after transspecies transmission could also be imagined as a possibility for the increased reactivity of this sample in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ELISA. Therefore, we recommend that a positive result from a feline serum sample in SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ELISA should be confirmed by at least one other assay, for example, a virus neutralization test.",

Therefore, two cut-off values were set by the authors: samples with an OD value above 0.3 were categorized as suspicious, and samples with an OD value above 0.5 were categorized as highly suspicious. However, all samples were further tested with the sVNT, and samples testing suspicious and highly suspicious in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ELISA were sent to the University of Utrecht for confirmatory testing for antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S1-RBD protein and neutralizing activity. Three samples with suspicious OD values in the RBD-ELISA (OD 0.38-0.5) were confirmed positive by neither sVNT nor by the tests at the University of Utrecht. In these samples, a possible cross-reactivity with antibodies against the canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), another betacoronavirus, and against the canine coronavirus (CCoV, genus Alphacoronavirus), which might also be cross-reactive with the FCoV [58] , cannot be excluded. However, the confirmatory tests applied at the University of Utrecht were evaluated for cross-reactivity against CRCoV (positive samples in proxy antigen: bovine coronavirus S1) and CCoV (positive samples in proxy antigen: FCoV type II S1), and no cross-reactivity for the SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD protein was reported in those samples [25] .",

Positive and questionable positive samples were further analyzed by RT-qPCR targeting the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. If positive or questionable positive after both RT-qPCR assays, the results were confirmed by the reference laboratory of Switzerland, the Swiss Federal Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI) and stated as positive if the cycle threshold (CT) values resulted \u226438.",
