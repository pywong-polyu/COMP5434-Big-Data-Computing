Methods: Participants were enrolled from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during 1999 to 2014. Baseline variables were acquired from questionnaires and examinations. Death status were ascertained from National Death Index records. Cox proportional hazards models with cubic spines were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and cancer mortality. Results: A total of 42038 participants were enrolled in the study with a median 8.13 years of follow-up. Older people and women tend to have a higher BUN/Cre ratio. After multivariable adjustment, BUN/Cre ratio between 11.43 and 14.64 was associated with the lowest all-cause mortality compared with the participants with the lowest quartile (HR 0.83 [0.76, 0.91]; p < 0.001). The highest quartile of BUN/Cre ratio was associated with the lowest risk of cancer mortality (HR 0.64 [0.53, 0.78]; p < 0.001). Restricted cubic splines showed BUN/Cre was nonlinearly associated with all-cause mortality and linearly associated with cancer mortality. Conclusions: This study confirmed a U-shape relationship between BUN/Cre ratio and all-cause mortality in the general population.",

Besides, a higher BUN/ Cre ratio was linearly associated with the lower risk of cancer mortality. BUN and Cre are the end products of nitrogen metabolism in human body, whose change reflect the renal function, nutritional and metabolic status. BUN/ Cre ratio is one of the common indices used to separate pre-renal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis, with a threshold of 20 [11] . Previous studies have found that a higher BUN/Cre ratio was associated with the worse prognosis in HF [4, 12] , stroke [13] , upper gastrointestinal bleeding [14] , hemodialysis [15] , and septic shock [8] . Recently, it was reported that BUN/Cre ratio was a predictor of disease severity and survival of COVIPD-19 patients [9, 16] . In general population, BUN/Cre ratio was negatively associated with the incidence of stroke [17] . Yuya et al reported that the median BUN/Cre ratio in the general population was 15.0 (12.9-17.6) [12] . We have found a U-shape association between BUN/Cre ratio and all-cause mortality in general population. When BUN/Cre ratio was between 11.43 and 14.64, it was associated with the lowest risk of mortality. This range may represent an ideal protein intake and metabolism in human. Higher levels of BUN/Cre reflect a more active neurohormonal system, contributing to adverse prognosis [18] . While low BUN/Cre ratio levels may be related to inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction after acute renal injury [19] .",

A retrospective study reported that elevated Cre was related to increased mortality in patients with malignant fibroblastic and myofibroblast sarcomas [20] and liposarcoma [21] . However, studies on BUN/Cre ratio and cancer-related mortality are scarce and the mechanism deserves further exploration. The relationship between BUN/Cre ratio and cardiovascular-specific mortality disappeared after adjusting for multiple covariates. We hypothesized that BUN/Cre ratio predict the prognosis of heart failure by reflecting the change of volume load. As cardiovascular disease-related mortality is a relatively broad concept, further work should focus on the concrete cardiovascular disease.",
