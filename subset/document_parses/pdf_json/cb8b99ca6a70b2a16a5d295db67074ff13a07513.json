            "text": "Over the last eighteen months, a number of spread models of COVID have been developed (See for instance [1] [2] [3] [4] ). They represent valuable inputs for elaborating efficient testing strategies. One question of interest, addressed in these models, and much relevant technologically, is the influence of testing frequency and test sensitivity on the spread rate mitigation of the disease. RT-PCR is the most sensitive test [5] , but, being time-consuming and costly, it cannot be performed at high frequencies and thus may miss a significant number of contaminated cases. On the other hand, antigen tests (such as BinaxNow), are much less sensitive [6] , but being low cost and simpler to deploy, can be performed more frequently. Models proposed different trade-offs. From these modelling studies, one may suggest, although no quantitative analysis has been done yet, that the development of new molecular tests, as sensitive as RT-PCR, and whose costs and simplicity of use are comparable to antigen tests, could substantially alleviate the situation. In this spirit, a number of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) have recently been proposed [7] , following up an effort initiated one decade ago [8] . Most of these NAATs are based on isothermal amplification, in particular Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), for which, now, a large documentation is available [9] . RT-LAMP reaction takes place at constant temperature (65\u00b0C) and thus does not need thermocycling machines [10] [11] . However, to reach performances comparable to the gold standard (RT-PCR), nucleic acid extraction is required. Today, extraction is traditionally made in spin column-based RNA extraction. The process, involving centrifugation and a number of pipetting steps, is difficult to accommodate with the low-cost Point of Care (POC) constraints. To circumvent the difficulty, several RT-LAMP tests, targeting the POC market, have reduced sample preparation to heating or chemical treatment [12] [13][14] [15] . These simplifications are indeed interesting from a POC viewpoint, but in all cases, and unsurprisingly, they led to a drop of the sensitivity [16] . By standing significantly below the gold standard, and slightly above the antigen test, the question of the competitive positioning of these tests in the diagnostic landscape, is raised.",

The main novelties are the integration of a solid phase extraction on the device and the lyophilization, on it, of all components needed to perform RTamplification. The idea is that solid phase extraction (with fluids driven by capillarity forces, instead of centrifugal forces) allows to reach high sensitivities, while freeze-drying facilitates transportation and storage. In a recent work [17] , we tested the concept on a laboratory all-paper system. Since then, we engineered a compact device, called COVIDISC, in which we modified the design and the way how fluids are manipulated, keeping the biological process the same and the cost at a low level. Here we investigate the clinical performances of a series of prototypes of this device. The goal of the present work is thus to assess the clinical performances of this new test, i.e. its sensitivity and specificity, based on a cohort of patients spanning a broad range of viral loads.",

The device performs SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (Orf1a/b gene) [18] and human 18S RNA detection, thus integrating a positive control [19] . Silica membranes, cut in form of small disks, are placed in lodgings located in the upper plastic disk. These membranes are dedicated to perform nucleic acid extraction. They are called 'capture membranes'. A large absorbing pad is placed on the lower plastic disk. It is dedicated to pull, by capillarity, the fluids through the capture membranes, during the extraction step. A removable funnel guides the fluids and inhibits contamination. In another lodging, a capsule contains two additional membranes, called detection or reaction membranes (or disks). In them, the RT-LAMP reagents are freeze-dried. The time-life of the lyophylisate is several months (data not shown). One lyophylisate includes the SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP mix, deposited on the circular membrane, and the other contains the human 18S RNA RT-LAMP mix, deposited on the square-shaped membrane. Both membranes are placed in a removable capsule (see Suppl Figure 1A ). The description of the RT-LAMP reaction mix composition and the freeze-drying process can be found in [17] ",

After the sample injection is achieved, the funnel is removed, and the membranes are rinsed with 400\u00b5L of a 70% ethanol solution, further dried at 65\u00b0C for 15 min. Then the disc is rotated, bringing the two extraction or capture membranes (one for the sample, the other for the positive control), in contact with the two reaction membranes. The nucleic acids captured in the extraction membranes are eluted into the reaction membranes, using an aqueous solution. The eluates, driven by capillarity, imbibe the reaction membranes, and thus hydrate the freeze-dried RT-LAMP reagents. After heating at 65\u00b0C for 45 minutes, the capsule is removed, placed on a visualization device, composed of a blue LED screen and an orange filter (Blue Light Transilluminatorsc) and imaged with a low-cost USB camera (Dino-Lite). To avoid issues raised by the colorimetric phenol-red LAMP products (acidic conditions of samples leading to false positives) [20] , we coupled our RT-LAMP reaction to a specific fluorescent-probe-based method developed by Ball et al. [21] , called QUASR. A simple fluorescent reader and a smartphone camera are then sufficient for reading the result of the test. With the sample and buffer manipulations included, a total time of, approximately, one hour is needed to perform the test.",

In algorithm 1, we define, for each image of the reaction membrane, a quantity equal to the average to the 1% highest intensity levels. By comparing this quantity to the background intensity, we declare the test positive or negative. We checked that the results were not critically dependent of the fraction of percentiles we choose, within a range between 0.1% and 5%. This algorithm, based in the intensity levels, attempts to mimic the direct naked-eyes readout, which is possible with our system, thanks to the high fluorescence intensity of the positive cases, provided by the QUASR technique. Data obtained with Algorithm 1 is shown in Fig 2, the detail being given in Supplementary Materials, 'Image analysis with Algorithm 1'). In Algorithm 2, we define a Covidness scores by analyzing the intensity level distributions emitted by each reaction membrane.

In brief, what we show here is that COVIDISC performs as well as RT-PCR platforms. We may add that the device integrates extraction and amplification, uses reagents freeze-dried on the device, and is low cost (the production cost, reagents included, is estimated to 5 \u20ac). Important to note, it could also be used with saliva (see Supplementary Figure 2C ). These characteristics suggest that COVIDISC could be deployed on a much larger scale than the gold standard (RT-PCR), and, in the meantime, offer a sensitivity orders of magnitude better than antigen tests (in terms of viral load). Although quantifying the impact of such a test, in a manner shown in [2] , has not been made yet, one may suggest that COVIDISC conveys, at least potentially, an opportunity to bend the curves of the kinetics of contamination in a more effective manner than the existing technologies.",
