In recent years, medical imaging has been increasingly employed to investigate patterns of neural activity associated with coding activity. However, such studies have focused on advanced undergraduates and professionals. In a human study of 31 participants, we use functional nearinfrared spectroscopy to measure the neural activity associated with introductory programming. In a controlled, contrast-based experiment, we relate brain activity when coding to that of reading natural language or mentally rotating objects (a spatial visualization task). Our primary result is that all three taskscoding, prose reading, and mental rotation-are mentally distinct for novices. However, while those tasks are neurally distinct, we find more significant differences between prose and coding than between mental rotation and coding. Intriguingly, we generally find more activation in areas of the brain associated with spatial ability and task difficulty for novice coding compared to that reported in studies with more expert developers. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we also find a neural activation pattern predictive of programming performance 11 weeks later. While preliminary, these findings both expand on previous results (e.g., relating expertise to a similarity between coding and prose reading) and also provide a new understanding of the cognitive processes underlying novice programming.",

Critically, however, to the best of our knowledge all of the software engineering neuroimaging studies thus far have only studied programming experts that are either professionals or students with multiple years of experience (e.g., [2, Sec. 3.3] ). Tantalizingly, one study [3] found that coding became more neurologically similar to reading for programmers with even greater expertise. However, to realize the potential of neuroimaging for understanding software engineering expertise, we must also directly observe true novices. Studying novice programmers is critical for exploring how cognitive processes for coding evolve. In this paper, we seek to close this gap by presenting the first neuroimaging study of novice programmers during code comprehension (cf. [2] , [3] ).",

First, we must create experimental stimuli that are amenable for novices with little to no previous coding experience; the coding stimuli in previous neuroimaging studies all involve constructs (e.g., trees [6] ) or software engineering tasks (e.g., code review [3] ) unfamiliar to novices. Second, we must pay particular care to recruit participants with equivalent programming expertise; even in an introductory course, some students have substantially more programming experience than others. Finally, we propose and use an experimental protocol that follows up with participants months later to assess their programming progression using a written assessment; to our knowledge, no previous neuroimaging studies in software engineering have involved time-delayed outcome measurements.",

We conduct these scans during the first third of the class. We compare participants' brain activation patterns while coding to those while reading prose or using spatial reasoning (i.e., mentally rotating 3D objects). We also use a written assessment at the arXiv:2102.12376v2 [cs.SE] 8 Mar 2021 Experiment Like reading? Like spatial Novices? reasoning? Siegmund et al. (2014) [1] ? Siegmund et al. (2017) [2] ? Floyd et al. (2017) [3] ? Huang et al. (2019) [6] ? end of the semester to conduct a preliminary exploration of an aspect of learning, assessing if novices' brain activation patterns while coding can predict their future programming ability. We find that, for novices, coding is a working memory intensive task that is neurally distinct from both a spatial task and prose reading (p < 0.01, q < 0.05). Unlike previous work with experts which generally reports strong similarities between coding and reading [1] - [3] , we observe more significant and substantial differences between coding and reading than we do for coding and spatial tasks. This indicates that novices rely heavily on visiospatial cognitive processes while coding. Finally, we observe that particular activation patterns at the beginning of a course can predict how well students perform on a final programming assessment 11 weeks later; in general, the less similar the activation patterns are between coding and mental rotation, the better an individual performs (r = 0.48, p = 0.006). This may indicate that novices who use more problem-solving intensive strategies at the beginning of the semester (i.e., find programming more challenging) make less progress. We also compare our results to those of previous neuroimaging studies with more expert software engineers, and we close with a discussion of the implications of our results on introductory programming pedagogy and future software engineering research.",

Importantly, fNIRS offers higher spatial resolution than EEG, and higher temporal resolution than fMRI, which is important for studies relating a brain region's contribution to a specific task. Finally, fNIRS can be used in more natural and ecologicallyvalid environments (e.g., standard desktop computer use, etc.) compared to alternatives like fMRI (which requires participants to lie still in a small tube and also complicates the use of keyboards [7] ).

First, fNIRS experiments typically involve participants completing tasks (e.g., mentally rotating objects or solving programming problems) while time-series data is recorded. Carefully controlled experiments are necessary, in which the activity observed during one task is contrasted against the activity observed during another. This allows confounding brain activations (e.g., motor cortex activity from moving the lungs to breathe) to be eliminated from consideration.",

As a result, the hemodynamic response can typically be studied only in experiments with brief stimuli (e.g., under 30 seconds per question). Furthermore, fNIRS is only able to penetrate a few centimeters down into the brain. More specifically, the near-infrared light can reach a depth that is roughly half the distance between a transmitter-receiver pair, depending on the wavelengths and light intensities used [18] .",

Loosely, the frontal lobe is at the front of each hemisphere, the temporal lobe is on the side of each hemisphere, the parietal lobe is at the top of each hemisphere, and the occipital lobe is at the back of each hemisphere. Activation is called bilateral if both hemispheres are activated and lateralized if one hemisphere activates disproportionately. Throughout this paper, we will use various schema to refer to locations on the cerebrum's cortex, the brain's outer layer of neural tissue. One such schema is Brodmann Areas, an anatomical classification system for the cortex [23] . Broadmann areas (BAs) divide the cortex into 52 bilateral regions based on architectural neurological features. Many BAs also have associated neurological functions. For instance, BAs 41 and 42 are associated with auditory processing. We will also sometimes refer to regions by their common names or location on a lobe. Three important regions mentioned in this paper are Wernicke's area (left hemisphere, back of the parietal lobe), Broca's area (left hemisphere, lower frontal lobe), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or DLPFC (bilateral in the frontal lobe). Wernicke's and Broca's areas are strongly associated with language functions while the DLPFC is associated with working memory.",

Values closer to \u22128 and +8 represent stronger activation contrasts between the two tasks, and only areas with significant contrast (p < 0.01) after correction for multiple comparisons (q < 0.05) are reported. Finally, we note that contrast tests are directional: a significant contrast in Task A > Task B does not imply that the inverse contrast Task B > Task A will also produce significant results. This is because the differences in the inverse contrast may be too small to be statistically significant.",

During the written post-test, participants completed a validated language-agnostic programming assessment. All participants were enrolled in the same 15-week introductory programming course. The initial fNIRS scans were held during the first third of the semester while the written post-test was held during the last week of the semester. This design allows the controlled exploration of the relationships and contrasts between reading, coding, and spatial reasoning for novice programmers. It also opens a preliminary investigation of neurological factors that might be predictive for programming.

It has fiber-optic cables which transmit light from the device to sensors connected to the participant's cap. These sensors are either transmitters that emit light or receivers that detect light. As a result, fNIRS collects a participant's hemodynamic response only along a set of pre-defined channels between transmitters and receivers. The location, number, and coverage of these channels is determined by the cap design. We used a probe configuration similar to that used in Huang et al. [40] with dense coverage of transmitter-receiver pairs in the occipital, frontotemporal, and frontal regions. In total, 15 receiver and 30 transmitter fibers were used, yielding 55 channels from which data were collected, covering Broadmann areas 6-9, 17-19, 21, 22, 39-41, and 44-47 . The data from these channels were then analyzed using both NIRS Brain AnalyzIR Toolbox [41] and custom scripts written in MATLAB.

The signal-to-noise ratio was calculated as a ratio between the absolute signal mean and standard deviation, with a threshold set at 0.9. As a result, 16 blocks were excluded from further analysis (see Section III-B for a discussion of our experimental block setup).

First, when coding, participants exhibit more bilateral frontal activation than while mentally rotating objects. This comparative activation is in the DLPFC and the premotor cortex (BAs 6 and 46), areas commonly as- Fig. 7 : Activation Contrast between Programming and Reading: Red indicates regions more activated during coding while blue indicates regions more activated during reading.

Similarly, we observe comparatively high coding activation in the right angular gyrus, a region also connected with spatial reasoning [51] .

While general logic has been studied, particular paradigms, such as circuit design, may be processed differently by humans, potentially suggesting alternate training or tool-support approaches. Other experimental protocol paradigms are also relatively unexplored: almost all software engineering neuroimaging research consists of showing fixed, static stimuli. Even relatively foundational experimental structures in Psychology, such as priming, masking, and recall are unexplored.

Cooper et al. and Bockmon et al. ran studies with high school and university programmers, finding that those who participated in additional spatial training performed better on a final programming test [62] , [65] . Margulieux's spatial encoding strategy (SpES) framework relates the cogitative processes behind spatial ability and learning to program [24] . SpES hypothesizes that strong spatial reasoning ability helps novice programmers use general strategies for mentally encoding non-verbal information.",

While Floyd et al. found that coding and prose tasks are more similar in terms of neural activity for senior undergraduate than for mid-level undergraduates [3] (i.e., as programmers become more experienced), our results provide evidence that the pattern continues: as programmers become less experienced, programming and reading show less cognitive similarity (RQ1, RQ2).",

In a study of 31 participants, we use fNIRS to compare the neural activity for introductory programming, reading and spatial reasoning tasks in a controlled, contrastbased experiment. We find that all three tasks -coding, prose reading, and mental rotation -are mentally distinct for novices. This clarifies previous findings that they may be more similar in experts [3] or for complex data structures [40] . However, while those tasks are neurally distinct, we find more significant and substantial differences between prose and coding than between mental rotation and coding. Intriguingly, we find generally more activation in areas of the brain associated with spatial ability and task difficulty while coding compared to that reported studies with more expert developers. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we find that certain patterns of neural activity at the start of the semester are predictive of end-of-semester outcomes, opening the door for future experiments to model such phenomena more directly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to focus specifically on novice programmers and to make use of a significant time-delayed outcomes assessment. While preliminary, these findings both elaborate on previous results (e.g., relating expertise to a similarity between coding and prose reading) and also provide a new understanding the cognitive processes underlying novice programming.",
