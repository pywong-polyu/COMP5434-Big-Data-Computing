Specifically, we consider the perspective of a home care agency that must decide the number of caregivers to hire (staffing) and the allocation of hired caregivers to different types of services (capacity planning) in each day within a specified planning horizon. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with staffing (i.e., employment), capacity allocation, over-staffing, and under-staffing. We propose two-stage stochastic programming (SP) and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approaches to model and solve this problem considering two types of decision-makers, namely an everything in advance decision-maker (EA) and a flexible adjustment decision-maker (FA). In the EA models, we determine the staffing and capacity allocation decisions in the first stage before observing the demand. In the FA models, we decide the staffing decisions in the first stage. Then, we determine the capacity allocation decisions based on demand realizations in the second stage.",

First, it is a complex combinatorial optimization problem that requires deciding the number of different (cross-trained) caregivers to be hired and allocating (i.e., assigning) the capacity of hired caregivers to different types of services simultaneously. Second, there is significant variability in demand for home care services and service duration. In addition, our analysis of real-life data from a home care service provider suggest that there is a wide range of possible probability distributions for modeling the variability in the demand, indicating distributional ambiguity, i.e., uncertainty in probability distribution (see this analysis in Section 2).",

Specifically, given sets of service types, days in the planning horizon, and caregivers and their types (i.e., training), our models solves the following decisions problems simultaneously (a) a staffing problem that determines the number of caregivers to hire within the planning horizon, and (b) an allocation problem that determines the allocation of caregivers capacities (i.e., daily service hours) to service types during the planning horizon. We consider two types of decision-makers: Everything in Advance (EA) and Flexible Adjustment (FA) decision-makers. The (EA) decision-maker decides the number of caregivers to hire and their daily capacity allocation to service types at the start of the planning horizon before the demand and service time are realized. In contrast, the (FA) decision-maker decides the number of caregivers to hire at the beginning of the planning horizon.

One of the main challenges that Pinetree Care and other home care companies face when making staffing and capacity allocation decisions is the uncertainty in service demand and duration.

The master problem (20) employs scenario-based constraints (20d)-(20f) and the sub-problem generates demand and service time scenarios and optimality cuts from the worst-case distribution. The algorithm proceeds as follows. At each iteration, we first solve the master problem, which includes only a subset of demand and service time scenarios, and obtain the optimal solution (i.e., hiring decisions). Thus, by considering a subset of demand and service time scenarios, the master problem is a relaxation of the original problem and thus provides a lower bound on the optimal value of F-DHSCP. Then, given the optimal solution from the master problem, we identify demand d * d * d * and service time s * s * s * scenarios by solving the sub-problem. Note that solutions of the master problem are feasible to the original problem, then by solving the sub-problem using these solutions, we obtain an upper bound. Third, we pass the identified demand and service time scenarios to the master problem on an as-needed basis, along with introducing relevant second-stage variables and constraints. Then, we solve the master problem again with the new information (a larger set of scenarios O) from the sub-problems. This process continues until the gap between the lower and upper bound on the optimal value of the problem obtained in each iteration satisfies a predetermined termination tolerance (note that we set this tolerance to 0.02). Recall that the F-DHSCP formulation's recourse (second-stage) problem is feasible for every feasible first-stage decision and ((d, s) \u2208 U). Thus, we do not need to add any feasibility cuts (Zeng & Zhao, 2013) . Moreover, we only have a finite number of scenarios.",

First, both models hire more caregivers under range 2 than range 1. This makes sense because, in range 2, both the volume and variability of the demand are higher. Second, it is clear that both models hire more caregivers as the understaffing cost increases from 1 to 25. However, the number of hired caregivers stabilize after c u l,t = 10. Third, when c u l,t \u2264 5 (i.e., low under-staffing cost), both models hire approximately the same number of caregivers. In contrast, when c u l,t > 5, the E-DHSCP models hire more caregivers than the E-SP model to mitigate excessive under-staffing. These results indicate that c u l,t = 10 may be a suitable penalty cost of under-staffing for (EA) decision-makers. We observe a different pattern when we fix c u l,t = 10 and increase the penalty for over-staffing c o l,t from 1 to {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}. Specifically, as shown in Figure 3b both models hire less caregivers as increasing c o l,t . And the number of hired caregivers stabilize after c o l,t = 10. Next, we analyze the detailed staffing patterns under cost structure (c u l,t , c o l,t ) = (10, 1) presented in Figure K .2 (see Appendix K). First, if there are only cross-trained caregivers (Instance 10), all models tend to hire all types of caregivers. Second, if there are both specialized and cross-trained caregivers (Instance 7), the E-SP model tend to hire specialized caregivers under both demand ranges while the E-DHSCP model hire a mixture of specialized and crosstrained caregivers. In addition, the E-DHSCP model hire more cross-trained caregivers under demand range 2 than under demand range 1. This could indicate that cross-trained caregivers are more favorable under a higher variation level.",

First, we solve each instance and obtain the optimal first-stage decisions. Second, we fix the obtained first-stage decisions, then re-optimize the second stage of the SP using the following sets of N = 10, 000 out-of-sample data to compute the second stage cost (i.e., under-staffing plus over-staffing costs).

First, let us analyze simulation results under Set 1 (i.e., perfect distributional information case). Figure L.1 in Appendix L.1 presents histograms of the out-of-sample total cost, second-stage costs, and under-staffing. It is clear from this figure that the E-DHSCP model yields a higher total cost and lower secondstage cost than the E-SP model on average and at all quantiles. This makes sense because, as we discussed in Section 8.5.1, the E-DHSCP tends to hire more caregivers to hedge against under-staffing (reflected by significantly lower under-staffing on average and all quantile than the E-SP model in Figure L.1c) . However, this results in a higher fixed cost associated with hiring more caregivers. Next, we investigate the value of distributional robustness from the perspective of out-ofsample disappointment, which measures the extent to which the out-of-sample cost exceeds the model's optimal value (Van Parys et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020) . Following Shehadeh (2020) and Wang et al. (2020) , we define the out-of-sample disappointment as max 0, Vout\u2212Vopt Vopt \u00d7 100%, where V opt and V out are as the model's optimal value and the out-of-sample objective value, respectively. A disappointment of zero indicates that the model's optimal value is equal to or larger than the out-of-sample (actual) cost, suggesting that the model is more conservative and avoids underestimating costs. In contrast, a larger disappointment implies a higher level of over-optimism because, in this case, the actual cost (V out ) of implementing the optimal solution of a model is larger than the estimated cost (V opt ). These results confirm that the DRO model provides a more robust estimate of the actual cost that we will incur in practice. In a decision-making context where the goal is to minimize expenses, disappointments are more harmful than positive surprises (overestimated costs).",

Second, when c u l,t \u2264 3, both models hire approximately the same number of caregivers. In contrast, when c u l,t > 3 the F-DHSCP models hire more caregivers than the E-SP models. These results indicate that c u l,t = 5 may be a suitable penalty cost of under-staffing for the (FA) decision-makers. We observe a different pattern when we fix c u l,t = 5 and increase the penalty for over-staffing c o k,t from 2 to {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Specifically, as shown in Figure 6b both models hire less caregivers as c o k,t increases. And the number of hired caregivers stabilize after c o k,t = 3. Next, we analyze the detailed staffing patterns under cost structure (c u l,t , c o k,t ) = (5, 2) presented in Figure M .2 (see Appendix M). Compared with EA models, both F-SP and F-DHSCP models prefer cross-trained caregivers under two demand ranges for Instance 7. Figure 7a , the F-DHSCP model yields a lower total cost than the F-SP model on average and at all quantiles.

To address uncertainty in service duration and the demand for home service, we proposed and analyzed SP and DRO models considering two types of decision-makers, namely everything in advance decision-maker (for which we proposed E-SP and E-DHSCP models) and a flexible adjustment decision-maker (FA) (for which we proposed (F-SP and F-DHSCP). We derive equivalent MILP reformulations of the proposed nonlinear E-DHSCP model for the EA decision-maker that can be implemented and efficiently solved using off-the-shelf optimization software.

Hence, we have (E.1). \u03c1 l,t \u2264 min k:l\u2208R k (c k,l,t \u2212 \u03bb k,t ) (E.1)As we consider a maximization problem in (15) and d l,t s l,t > 0 always holds, it is always optimal to increase \u03c1 l,t in the feasible region. Hence, we have \u03c1 * l,t = min k:l\u2208R k (c k,l,t \u2212 \u03bb k,t ) or \u03c1 * l,t = c u l,t . Then, according to constraints (15d), we have c k,l,t \u2212 \u03bb k,t \u2265 c k,l,t \u2212 c o k,t .

Finally. we have that \u03c1 l,t \u2265 min k:l\u2208R k (c k,l,t \u2212 c o k,t ) in the optimal solution.Appendix F. Proof of Proposition 5Proof. Observe from the objective of problem (16) that variable \u03b1 l,t are multiplied by parameters \u00b5 d l,t and variables d l,t , for all l \u2208 [L], t \u2208 [T ]. And so, for fixed \u03b2 and x, the joint contribution \u03b1 and d to the objective of problem (16) equals:where K is a non-negative term that equal to:First, we suppose that \u03b1 l,t > 0. If \u03b1 l,t > s l,t c u l,t where c u l,t is the upper bound of \u03c1 l,t . The optimal solution of d * l,t will be d l,t . In this case, \u03b1 l,t contributes to the objective value of problem (16) i.e., \u03b1 l,t improves the objective value of problem (16). It follows that without loss of optimality \u03b1 l,t = s l,t c u l,t is valid upper bound on variables \u03b1 l,t . Second, we suppose that \u03b1 l,t < 0. If \u03b1 l,t < \u2212s l,t |\u03c1 l,t | which leads to s l,t \u03c1 l,t \u2212 \u03b1 l,t \u2265 0, the optimal solution of d * l,t always is d l,t . In this case, \u03b1 l,t contributes to the objective value of problem (16) i.e., \u03b1 l,t improves the objective value of problem (16). It follows that without loss of optimality \u03b1 l,t = \u2212s l,t |\u03c1 l,t | is valid lower bound on variables \u03b1 l,t .Follow the same proof process, we can prove the \u03b2 l,t and \u03b2 l,t , defined in (24), are respectively valid upper and lower bounds on variable \u03b2 l,t . In this section, we show the convergence results of SAA formulation (G.1). without spacial mention, we will use the termination MIP Gap 1 % (We allowed all instances to run for one day, however, the MIP Gaps of some instances remained at around 1 %).
