Six countries reported TBE incidences of \u22655 cases/100,000, defined as highly endemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Possible factors contributing to this surge may include increased participation in outdoor activities in endemic regions and increased tick counts/tick activity.",

Consequently, parts of Europe put in place public health policies to contain the spread of the virus. Recent reports from Switzerland (Steffen et al., 2020) and Germany (Ulrich et al., 2021) documented substantial reductions in almost all recorded infectious diseases in 2020 as compared to earlier years. In these countries, one of the only infectious diseases to see an increase during this period was tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) (Steffen et al., 2020; Ulrich et al., 2021) . In this report, we used data from the health departments of various European countries to investigate the prevalence of select infectious diseases under surveillance during 2020, and further explored the trend in TBE cases from 1995 through 2020.",

Tick abundance is related to environmental conditions, including land use, weather, host reservoirs, and climate change, and can be very focal (S\u00fcss et al., 2008 ). An earlier occurrence of spring can accelerate tick development (Jaenson et al., 2012) . Additionally, milder winters permit winter activity of ticks and may increase population of hosts to sustain greater tick populations (S\u00fcss et al., 2008 Brugger, 2020, 2021) . Interestingly, a 225% increase in visitor frequency to public green spaces, including national parks and public gardens, was reported in the Google Mobility Report of May 2020 for Germany (Schweizer et al., 2021) .",

Long-lasting morbidity from TBE, limiting function and quality of life, are seen in up to 30% of those hospitalised with TBE (Bogovi\u010d et al., 2018; Kohlmaier et al., 2021) . With no curative treatment available, vaccination remains the most effective method to prevent infection, with reported effectiveness rates of 95-99% (Heinz et al., 2013; Erber et al., 2021) . The WHO recommends TBE vaccination for adults and children in highly endemic (\u22655 cases/100,000 population/year) areas and targeted vaccination in specific geographical locations or when participating in at-risk outdoor activities (World Health Organization, 2011). Compliance with TBE vaccination is low in many European countries (Erber and Schmitt, 2018) . Thus, increasing awareness and education regarding vaccination against TBE for those travelling to or residing in endemic areas are critical interventions for addressing this growing public health issue.",
