A large-scale international survey of chaplains suggested a broad range of chaplains' experiences in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic (Snowden, 2021) . A considerable portion of respondents found that they could have been better deployed (30.94% in Europe, 26.65% in North America, 16.31% in Australia). Overall, a sizable minority said their organizations misunderstood their potential contributions to COVID-19 patients (28.35%). Additionally, on average, participating chaplains felt their role was neither clear nor unclear to them during the pandemic. Qualitative findings reflected diverging themes in chaplains' experiences such as being seen as unimportant, optional, and being professionally isolated, compared to those who were viewed as essential, well-integrated, and valued in their healthcare institutions' COVID-19 response Jones et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2021) . However, further attention is needed to unpack the complex and interconnected factors that may have underlain and precipitated the state of chaplaincy during COVID-19, such as the roles of hospital administration, chaplain leaders, chaplain practitioners, interprofessional teams, and the larger healthcare delivery systems. A systemic understanding of these dynamics is still lacking.",

We aimed to identify expert perception on chaplain leadership factors that may have influenced how valued and integrated chaplains' contributions were in health care during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We asked panelists to respond to these specific research questions: Based on their research and expertise, what were the chaplain leadership factors, elements, or characteristics that stood out as having the most potential to shape (a) the integration of chaplains, and (b) the value (or perceived value) of chaplains' contributions during the COVID-19 pandemic? What leadership actions did chaplains take-or could have taken-to promote the value of chaplain contributions and the integration of spiritual care and chaplaincy in health care during the pandemic?",

Professional confidence of chaplaincy leaders and chaplains emerged as one of the most discussed leadership factors, with a high level of consensus regarding its importance. Chaplain leaders' ability to function with selfassurance and with an assured standing among other health care professionals may be related to the broader issue of professionalism in chaplaincy. As one panelist put it, professionalism entailed specialized training qualifications and professional development: \"if someone was actually really clear about their skills and capabilities, which I think gave them a real sense of confidence in their professional standing and credibility, [as well as] constant honing all of these skills, [they had higher self-assurance]\u2026 I think that obviously more research needs to be done in this area, but it did seem to us that these\u2026 really stood out and made the chaplains say they were perceived as more credible and therefore more fully integrated into the institution's COVID-19 response.\" (Reference 16) Panelists emphasized the critical importance for chaplains to lead and act from such a place of confidence, professionalism, and credibility. For leaders, it may have manifested in asserting how the value and contributions of chaplains fit in the bigger picture of care delivery with greater confidence and clarity. These characteristics would have had positive effects before, while planning for, and during the pandemic response.",

And so, transferring that over to [the] interdisciplinary team conversations and leadership management conversations, I think probably just came naturally to them.\" (Reference 59) Conversely, panelists noted that chaplains' confidence might be weakened by not seeing tangible effects and outcomes of their interventions (especially compared to other health care disciplines) and not having a clear language for describing who they are, what they do, and the outcomes that are associated with the care they provide. Moreover, confidence may have also stemmed from the fact that chaplains regularly encounter and provide care in crisis situations, regardless of a pandemic. Thus, it may have helped them to be assured in their capacity to deal with the COVID-19 crisis, thinking, \"you know we look after people in crises, and this is just another crisis.\" (Reference 77) Experts pointed out that other factors may have challenged chaplains' capacity to show up with confidence during the pandemic, such as their own anxiety about vulnerable partners, or a lack of clarity about their roles or chaplaincy operating protocols during the pandemic. Moreover, there are variations in how chaplains' confidence and professionalism are experienced and viewed by hospital administrators. This may especially be the case in areas with mixed spiritual care models where some chaplains are employed and endorsed by denominations, some are employed by health services as professionals, and some are volunteers.",

And so, they were quite happy engaging with the Chief Executive without blinking.\" (Reference 80) Other experts added that a useful way to unpack what is often viewed as \"big personality\" is to consider it as a leadership quality, perhaps related to confidence and trusting one's ability to engage with executives readily.

For example, it was noted, \"the institution management's understanding of the role of spiritual care was important to give chaplaincy the opportunity to contribute and be available to patients and staff; \u2026 [it] really gave them the opportunity to fill gaps for both staff and patients, so [relieving] the isolation of patients by really being surrogate family for patients and also for staff by being someone who was able to just sit there and listen.\" (Reference 77) Therefore, chaplain leaders' ability to clearly articulate and convincingly demonstrate the returns on investmentboth tangible and intangible-in deploying chaplains was likely to be a determining factor in whether the administration was advocating for, maintaining, or even developing chaplaincy services amidst the crisis. Naturally, this work of shaping perceptions had started long before COVID-19 in most institutions.

However, another panelist also noted that chaplains and chaplain leaders were able to use their professional authority and creatively step into the gaps which developed during the evolving crisis. \"[They] were able to develop their position during the pandemic in a very positive way. \u2026 [It was] about creatively linking up with what was going on; \u2026 what [was] possible and reaching out within the space available to [them] . \u2026 What are [they] able to do within the space that is available?

Chaplains under that leadership \u2026 perceived whether or not their leaders were prepared for unforeseen situations or were really thrown off by this. And all of those factors impacted how well chaplains did from an effectiveness perspective, and I think will impact what happens going forward.\" (Reference 72) Finally, the importance of chaplain leaders' capacity to communicate about fast-evolving decisions and changes and to use these as opportunities to advocate for their chaplaincy team seemed critically impactful on chaplains. A panelist called attention to \"how well did chaplain and wider system leadership communicate pandemic factors and changes and did they communicate the why. \u2026 that seemed to really impact how chaplains felt about their leadership. Did chaplains see their leadership advocating for them being essential? That seemed to really impact chaplain emotions and then chaplain self-care.\" (Reference 72) Innovation and Creativity. Experts identified innovation as a vital factor that influenced the extent of chaplains' contributions. As one panelist noted, \"the things that stood out for me and the research we're doing was where the chaplains showed up and were innovative in response to needs, and that's been observed by a number of us.\" (Reference 59) Thus, leadership that promoted innovation and creativity by astutely recognizing and creating new possibilities may have played a key role. When chaplains were empowered to try new things freely and deliver innovative solutions responsive to what was occurring in the organization, their contributions were clear and valued. Panelists referenced examples of chaplains finding creative ways to communicate and connect with COVID-19 patients and their loved ones (e.g., virtual spiritual care, virtual hugs, touching the bed instead of touching the patient). Innovation was especially vital to provide end-of-life and bereavement care. As one panelist described, \"when it came to patients and close family kin, it was about upholding burial ceremonies, especially among the Muslims, and tending to grief and existential questions, even though this was done within the requirements (the host of rules that you couldn't go in without wearing a mask), and a lot of innovation was conducted here.\" (Reference 50) Supporting healthcare workers was identified as another critical area in which leaders had to face challenges, spot gaps to fill, and seize opportunities to innovate. It increased the perceived value of chaplaincy when chaplains proactively and creatively sought to encourage staff in practical ways, remain available and connected to them, and be a calm and listening presence. Finally, coming up with and implementing creative solutions also asked leaders, as mentioned above, to use their professional authority and take advantage of the space available to them.",

One panelist explained, \"the models of leadership that I found most impressive and valuable and that made a difference was a sort of visionary flexibility, a dynamic ability to revisit what the ultimate aim was, as opposed to trying to keep delivering the same process. \u2026 The freedom to think that way, we can have a leadership model that allows that freedom and sees it as a good practice rather than eccentric practice is helpful.\" (Reference 80) It reflected the need for leadership approaches that encourage a flexible mindset and freedom to innovate and experiment with novel solutions and processes.",

This visibility was further enhanced when chaplains showed up with innovative responses to needs, making their contributions clear and valued. One panelist also connected visibility and professional confidence, \"the whole theme of visibility related for me to that whole area of professionalism too. \u2026 And it actually takes a level of confidence and clarity about your role to engage appropriately in a multidisciplinary team.\" (Reference 16) Moreover, this type of visibility may have created favorable conditions for ongoing advocacy for spiritual care as essential and a standard part of patient care before and during the pandemic.

One panelist wondered if spiritual intelligence involves \"perhaps even [a] transcendent way of knowing that we're trying to not only develop within individuals but also to help institutions understand as a vital part of the health of human beings.\" (Reference 83) Successful chaplain leaders may have incorporated spiritual intelligence in their ways of engaging with others and caring for the organization.",

During the pandemic, cultural and religious responsiveness was especially vital when serving spiritually and religiously diverse populations, including persons increasingly identifying as not religious or spiritual, or not mainstream Christian, providing end-of-life care, holding burial ceremonies for various faith traditions, and tending to spiritual, religious, and existential questions of patients and staff. Panelists also discussed the dynamics of racial and religious differences-both among patients and chaplains-as these were experienced in their different demographic and cultural contexts. For instance, in the United States, chaplaincy leaders and chaplains faced the waves of the dual pandemic of COVID-19 and racism and the need to address both in their settings.
