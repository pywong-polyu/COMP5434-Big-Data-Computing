This trial was a well-designed, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 500 persons per arm. Currently, it is the second largest trial that assesses the effect of ivermectin on COVID-19 outcomes. Although still underpowered due to a lower percentage of events than expected, this trial did not detect a significant effect of ivermectin on preventing hospitalization nor the need for mechanical ventilatory support 7 . The only other randomized controlled trial considered to be at a low risk for bias in all the systematic reviews also found that ivermectin had no beneficial effect on time-to-recovery (Lopez-Medina et al., table 1). Both these trials were peer-reviewed and published in reputable journals. All the other trials were either much smaller, not placebo-controlled and/or not double-blinded. Furthermore 5 out of 11 studies included are unpublished and merely posted on pre-print websites (Table 1) . M a n u s c r i p t 3",

Of all the studies included in the Hill et al. review, this study had the biggest effect size. When this study, with a 90% reduction in mortality, is excluded from analysis, no beneficial effect of ivermectin is seen. We thus have two well conducted randomized controlled trials with a low risk of bias which show no effect of ivermectin and a number of other trials either unpublished or at a high risk of bias which show a beneficial effect of ivermectin. In this situation we consider it inappropriate to use meta-analysis methodology to pool these results. We should limit our evaluation of ivermectin to the evidence derived from high quality studies. Another high quality randomized controlled trial, the United Kingdom's Principle outpatient trial, has already enrolled 5000 patients in its ivermectin arm and results are expected soon 9 .",
