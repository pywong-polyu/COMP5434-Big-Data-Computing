However, most of these vaccines require a second homologous booster dose. This has raised fundamental questions and challenges for LMICs such as Nigeria. These challenges centered around Nigeria's need to reduce the cost associated with vaccination, increasing vaccination acceptance, and the fluctuating supplies of vaccines.

In addition, the strategy will ensure that more people are vaccinated across the world and might be the magic wand needed to reduce the global inequalities in vaccine availability (13) . Deming and Lyke (15) reported that the mix and match vaccination strategy improved the neutralization of variants (16) and the induction of spike protein-specific CD8+ T cells beyond what was achieved via homologous vaccinations (17) . Furthermore, Barros-Martins et al. (16) and Schmidt et al. (17) believed that the heterologous combination of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as primer dose and Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine as booster dose resulted in 20 to >60fold greater titers of neutralizing antibodies (IgG and IgA) against the alpha, beta, or gamma variants of the SARS-CoV-2. However, we believe that antibody and T-cell measurements in these studies do not correspond to real-life protection against the SARS-CoV-2 as these studies were only designed to assess the elicited immune responses after mixing vaccines (13) .",

The WHO therefore wanted more research conducted and evidence gathered before it could recommend mix and match for the COVID-19 vaccines. Some of the potential risk associated with mix-matching COVID-19 vaccines includes the regulatory complications and the possibility of increased adverse event following immunization (AEFI). During the first phase of the vaccinations using the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, Nigeria recorded 14,550 cases of mild to moderate AEFI, with 148 cases considered to be severe (8) .",

Furthermore, we strongly believe that whilst many countries may adopt the COVID-19 vaccine mixing strategy, Nigeria should not adopt the approach as Nigeria still has over 200 million unvaccinated citizens. So, Nigeria should ONLY use the Moderna vaccine for previously unvaccinated persons.",
