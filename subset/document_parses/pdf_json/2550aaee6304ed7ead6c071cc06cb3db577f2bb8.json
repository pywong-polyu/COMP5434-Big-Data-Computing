Medical practitioners have anecdotally reported encounters with patient-held misinformation, but to date we lack evidence that quantifies this phenomenon. We surveyed licensed practitioners in the state of North Carolina to better understand how often patients mention MM in the clinical setting, and if medical practitioners are trained to engage with patients in these specific conversations. We administered an anonymous, online survey to physicians and physician assistants licensed to practice in the state of North Carolina. Questions focused on demographics, clinical encounters with MM, and training to discuss MM with patients. We received over 2800 responses and analyzed 2183 after removing ineligible responses. Our results showed that most respondents encountered MM from patients (94.2% (2047/ 2183)), with no significant differences between clinical specialty, time spent in practice, or community type. When asked about specific training, 18% (380/2081) reported formal experiences and 39% (807/289) reported informal experiences. MM has been salient due to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, it was present before and will remain after the pandemic. Given that MM is widespread but practitioners lack training on engaging patients in these conversations, a sustained effort to specifically train current and future practitioners on how to engage patients about MM would be an important step toward mitigating the spread of MM.",

            "text": "connection with health, health care, or medicine, we can refer to the phenomenon as medical misinformation (MM) . MM may also be called health-related misinformation. 3 The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the public salience of MM. This was evident not only in news headlines 4 but also in commentary and perspective pieces in scientific journals. 5, 6 The consequences of MM pose challenges for both patients and the overall public, which is especially prominent in public knowledge of vaccines, statins, and the COVID-19 pandemic. [7] [8] [9] Social science has responded to misinformation in various ways, such as monitoring inaccurate claims in media outlets 2,10 or studying misperception correction. 11, 12 Regarding MM specifically, Wang et al. recently published a systematic review focusing on the spread of health-related misinformation through social media, 3 and Kouzy et al. analyzed specific tweets on COVID-19 to track misinformation on the pandemic. 13 In addition to peer-reviewed literature, we can point to anecdotal reports and small sample studies of practitioner concern about MM, and encouragement for health care professionals to engage with patients on this topic now appears in a variety of sources. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Despite this attention to MM, we have been unable to find sufficient population-level evidence of how often medical practitioners encounter MM directly from patients in while clinical settings. We also do not know the extent to which clinicians have received training to engage patients in conversations regarding misinformation, such as lectures, webinars, workshops, or informal advice from mentors. Available literature largely has not reported on clinician preparation for such situations. To obtain baseline data for how often MM is a factor in practitioner-patient exchanges, we surveyed practitioners licensed with a state medical board in North Carolina, USA. North Carolina is a diverse state on many levels. Geographically, residents live in mountain, coastal, or piedmont regions. In these regions, rural, urban, or suburban communities are found. The medical workforce of North Carolina is also diverse, not only across specialties but also among the different types of practitioners: physicians, physician assistants (PAs), nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, etc. All of these practitioners speak with patients on a daily basis. For these reasons, North Carolina serves as an excellent microcosm to examine the exchange of MM between patients and practitioners.",

Practitioners in the Duke Academy for Health Professions Education and Academic Development initially assessed survey usability and functionality prior to fielding with our target population. We received permission to administer the survey to all licensed practitioners in the state of North Carolina from the North Carolina Medical Board (NCMB) and contacted practitioners via email. Duke University School of Medicine staff administered the survey over 3 weeks in May 2020 using RedCap. The Duke Health Institutional Review Board designated the survey as exempted research.

Practitioners in multiple specialties report encounters with MM, and the percentage reporting MM across specialties ranged from 87% to 100% (Table 2) , which is greater than those who do not report MM. We acknowledge that we are presenting a comparison without an accompanying P-value. As explained in the Methods, Fisher's exact test is preferred for this comparison, but due to the large number of specialty categories, the test was too computationally intensive and did not converge in a reasonable timeframe. The chi-square test is not valid due to the small cell sizes in the \"no\" category for many of the specialties.",

            "text": "We sought to assess if North Carolina medical practitioners encounter MM from patients in the clinical setting. Results show this was the case: such experience is almost universal among our respondents, with 94.2% reporting encounters with patient MM within the previous year. We provided our respondents with several broad topics and asked them to recall if patients referred to inaccurate medical information on these topics. We chose our specific topics based on a combination of factors. In May 2020, we wanted to assess how often practitioners were hearing misinformation regarding COVID given its status as a new disease. A long and documented history of vaccine misinformation exists, 16, 17 and misinformation regarding statins has been rising based on anecdotal reports from physicians. 18 Finally, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by patients is well-established in the United States and other countries, 24, 25 and the approach of integrative medicine combines conventional medicine with complementary therapies. 24 However, the evidence supporting CAM treatments is often not as strong as that for conventional treatments due to several inherent challenges with researching CAM. 25 These include, but are not limited to, participant bias in clinical trials, 26 distinguishing therapeutic vs placebo effects, 25,26 a lack of supporting pilot data, 27 and the association of CAM treatments with nonspecific effects, such as the provider-patient relationship. 25 This lag in evidence-based efficacy may serve as a breeding ground for misinformation about the effectiveness of CAM treatments. 28 The topic of vaccines had the most frequent recollection of misinformation among our respondents. This may reflect either the strong roots that vaccine misinformation has in the United States, the large number of family medicine and pediatric practitioners that responded to our survey, or a combination of both. Given that our survey was administered in May of 2020 and asked for recollections of MM within the previous year, it is unlikely that misinformation related to the COVID-19 vaccines was the prominent source. We were interested to see the diversity of specialties represented in our respondents (Table 2 ) and the universal agreement regarding reported encounters with MM. Because this is a pilot study, we cannot provide a valid statistical test of significance to say the reported percentage of those who encounter MM than those who do not is significant, but our data clearly show those who do report it is greater than those who do not. A larger study would likely provide enough data to determine statistical significance on this issue. The proliferation of MM has become more wellknown as a problem in the medical field in recent years. However, we are not aware of any studies that attempt to distinguish if different specialties of practice are subject to different types of MM. This would be an interesting area for follow-up studies as it could inform potential training avenues. For example, suppose multiple departments in an academic medical facility would like to create a webinar focused on MM. Such a webinar can cover general considerations, but specific examples would likely be more effective for each department. For example, the cardiology group is likely to see more examples of MM related to statin use than the neurology group.",

Although most respondents encountered MM with patients, only a small minority received training on how to engage patients in this context (Table  3 ). More respondents indicated that they received education about MM during informal instruction. This finding could be due to the direct interactions with patients in these settings.

Many patients may have difficulty navigating the sheer volume of healthrelated information due to poor health literacy, but this online landscape is complicated by biased search algorithms, confirmation bias, politics, and intentional spread of disinformation. As Trethewey et al. and Sturgill 19, 20 have both noted, health care practitioners have the unique opportunity to direct patients to high quality, evidence-based medical information. Wu and McCormick 21 write that practitioners have a professional obligation to correct patient-held MM due to the combination of scientific training and licensure to practice medicine. We have shown that patients do in fact discuss MM in the clinical encounter. When we add this to the data from Kouzy et al. 13 showing that the highest levels of COVID misinformation in tweets were from informal personal/group accounts, this strengthens the argument that the process of mitigating MM calls for a focus on patient-provider encounters. Patients likely believe MM for a variety of reasons, but one critical factor may be their need for hope, 29 particularly in dire medical circumstances. If medical practitioners, current and future, are only trained in strict evidence-based methods without knowing tactics to discuss MM with patients, the potential for patient confusion and mistrust between patients and practitioners may only grow. We believe focused training on MM must include an historical perspective on misinformation and a summary of patient psychology, coupled with practical application. As educators, we also advocate the incorporation of MM awareness into undergraduate medical education and in other health professions training, which can be easily done with standardized patient scenarios.",
