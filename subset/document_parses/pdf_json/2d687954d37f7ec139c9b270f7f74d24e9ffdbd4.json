            "text": "Understanding the trajectory of the daily numbers of deaths in people with CoVID-19 is essential to decisions on the response to the CoVID-19 pandemic. Estimating this trajectory from data on numbers of deaths is complicated by the delay between deaths occurring and their being reported to the authorities. In England, Public Health England receives death reports from a number of sources and the reporting delay is typically several days, but can be several weeks. Delayed reporting results in considerable uncertainty about the number of deaths that occurred on the most recent days. In this article, we estimate the number of deaths per day in each of five age strata within seven English regions. We use a Bayesian hierarchical model that involves a submodel for the number of deaths per day and a submodel for the reporting delay distribution. This model accounts for reporting-day effects and longer-term changes over time in the delay distribution. We show how the model can be fitted in a computationally efficient way when the delay distribution is same in multiple strata, e.g. over a wide range of ages.",

            "text": "CoVID-19 appeared in the UK in early 2020, with its first case, imported from China, reported on the 30th January, and the first CoVID-linked death announced on the 6th March. Over the last few months the pandemic has spread in the community, hospitals and care homes. As at 5th September 2020, around 300,000 cases have been lab-confirmed and of these over 40,000 have died. The lock-down introduced on the 23rd of March has drastically reduced transmission, although the process of easing it is proving very challenging. Underlying the governmental response is surveillance information on a number of epidemiological indicators. In particular, trends in the number of deaths have been crucial to monitoring the burden of CoVID-19 as well as to informing models reconstructing and predicting the pandemic. However, information on these trends is affected by delayed reporting. While the number of deaths in people with lab-confirmed CoVID-19 infection peaked on 9th April, the number of reports of such deaths peaked 13 days later, on 22nd April. This is because deaths are rarely reported to the authorities on the day they occur, and some deaths take weeks to be reported. This results in righttruncated data: deaths occurring on day t are only observed if their reporting delay d is such that day t + d is earlier than the day up to which data are available [3] . This right-truncation makes it difficult to establish the true pattern of the numbers of deaths occurring over time and, in particular, to identify quickly any increase in the most recent days. The process of estimating the number of deaths that occurred on each day from the numbers of deaths that have so far been reported is referred to as 'nowcasting'. In this article, we nowcast the number of deaths in people with CoVID-19 both for the whole of England and separately for seven English regions, and we break down these numbers by five age strata: 0-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years and \u2265 75 years. To produce these nowcasts, we jointly model the distributions of reporting delays, the observed numbers of reported deaths and the actual numbers of deaths in each of the age strata within a region.",

DBS deaths result from the daily tracing of CoVID-19 positive tests reported to PHE through the Second Generation Surveillance System in the NHS Spine to identify individuals who might have died in the previous 24 hours in any setting. HPT data include deaths notified by PHE HPT during outbreak management, primarily in non-hospital settings (e.g. care homes).

We chose 22nd March because the first reports from DBS became available on 21st March and some of the deaths reported on 21st would have been reported earlier had DBS been used earlier. At 29th June there were a total of 37529 confirmed reports of deaths that occurred between 22nd March and 29th June. Figure 1a shows the number of deaths that occurred on each day and had been reported by 29th June. The effect of reporting delay is particularly evident in the last three days: while the numbers of deaths per day in the week up to 25th June were between 50 and 100, the numbers for 27th, 28th and 29th June were 12, 9 and 0. Figure 1b shows the number of deaths that were reported on each day. It can be seen that the number of reports tends to be lower on Sundays and Mondays, probably due to some staff not working during the weekend. This is particularly so in more recent weeks. In addition, the number of reports over a single Tuesday-to-Saturday period varies considerably from day to day. It is particularly low, for example, on 26th May. Figure 2 shows a simple estimate (see [3] for method) of the distribution of reporting delay by age strata, calculated using data from the whole of England and assuming that the delay distribution is the same for all times of death. This distribution is conditional on the delay being at most 42 days. Forty-two days was chosen because 2 . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a perpetuity.",

For example, of the 12 deaths that occurred on 27th June and had been reported by 29th June, nine were in the \u2265 75 strata. The estimated proportion of deaths reported within two days in this strata is 0.60. Therefore, the actual number of deaths in this strata can be estimated as 9/0.60 = 15. However, this estimate does not account for any dependence of the delay distribution on the day of death. Delays may length or shorten over calendar time and may depend (as Figure 1b suggests) on the weekday on which the death occurred. Also, while the numbers of deaths occurring on each day are likely to change smoothly over calendar time, this estimate makes no use of information about the numbers of deaths that occurred on the preceding and succeeding days, with the result that it can be very different from the estimates for those days. In addition, simple confidence interval calculations [3] underestimate uncertainty, unless the delay distribution really is the same for all times of death.",

By modelling the expected number of deaths per day in each stratum as a smooth function of time, it allows the estimate of the number of deaths that occurred on one day to borrow information about the numbers of deaths that occurred on the preceding and succeeding days.

First, we model weekday reporting effects in a more realistic fashion. As mentioned above, fewer deaths are reported on Sundays and Mondays, and the strength of this weekend effect changes over time. Second, we account for correlation between the numbers of reports made on the same day about individuals who died on different days. If, for example, the data suggests that an unusually low proportion of those deaths that occurred between two and seven days ago have been reported today, it is likely that few of the deaths that occurred yesterday and today will have yet been reported. Third, we describe a computationally efficient way to constrain the delay distribution to be the same in multiple strata. This is particularly useful if the delay distribution can be expected to be the same across a wide range of ages.

For the CoVID-19 data, it is reasonable to assume the delay distributions are equal in strata s = 2, 3 and 4, i.e. individuals aged 45-74. We considered two alternative adaptations of the model to impose the constraint that the delay distribution is the same in some group S of strata (where S = {2, 3, 4} for the CoVID-19 data). The first adapted model sets the parameters and splines \u03b7 sj , \u03c8 sd , g W st and g C st that determine the delay distribution in stratum s to be equal for all s \u2208 S. We denote the common values by a dot, so \u03b7 sj = \u03b7 \u2022j , \u03c8 sd = \u03c8 \u2022d , g st = g W \u2022t and g st = g C \u2022t .

As expected, the hazard of reporting is lower on Sundays and Mondays than on other days. It is also somewhat higher on Fridays than on the remaining days. Figure 4 shows the posterior mean and pointwise 95% posterior credible interval (CI) of g W st , the change in the weekend reporting effect over calendar time. The change is substantial: the posterior mean of g W st decreases from around 0.7 at the end of March to around \u22120.9 at the end of June. Since the posterior mean of \u03b7 57 is \u22121.2, this means that the odds ratio of reporting on a Sunday relative to a Saturday is estimated to be around exp(\u22121.2+0.7) = 0.6 in late March but around exp(\u22121.2 \u2212 0.9) = 0.12 in late June. Figures S2-S5 show the corresponding results for the 0-44 and 45-74 age groups. These are similar to those in the \u2265 75 stratum, except that the credible intervals for the 0-44 stratum are wider, reflecting the smaller numbers of deaths, and hence less information, in this stratum. Figure 5 shows the posterior mean and pointwise 95% posterior CI of the calendartime effect on the delay distribution in the \u2265 75 age stratum. The reporting delays become shorter between 22nd March and the middle of April (the peak of the epidemic), and then lengthen again. In the most recent period, they appear to be shortening again. The pattern is similar in the 45-74 group (see Figure S7 ). In the 0-44 stratum, the delays also shorten between 22nd March and mid-April, but do not lengthen again after mid-April ( Figure S6 ). is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

For ease of viewing, we show only the most recent 21 days (see Figures S9-13 for the whole period from March 31st). In the \u2265 75 stratum, nine and eight deaths occurred on 27th and 28th June, respectively, and were reported by 29th June. The corresponding estimated numbers of deaths on those two days are 63 and 66, respectively. Hence, it is estimated that only 9/63 = 14% of the deaths that occurred on Saturday 27th June had been reported within two days, and only 12% of deaths that occurred on Sunday 28th June had been reported within one day. These numbers may seem low, considering that Figure 2 shows that, on average, around 26% of deaths in this stratum are reported within one day and around 60% are reported within two days. There are likely to be two reasons for this. First, reporting is much lower on Sundays and Mondays than during the rest of the week, especially in the most recent period.

Figure S14 provides some support for this way of modelling the calendartime effect, suggesting that it is indeed additive on the probit scale, at least for delays of two or more days.

This would be captured by our model through \u03b7 7 = \u2212\u221e, but would not be captured by the spline h st , because h ts is a function of the weekday on which the individual died, rather than the weekday on which this death might be reported (see Appendix for further explanation). That weekday affects hazard of reporting is demonstrated by Figure 9 , which shows the estimated distribution of delay by weekday of death. The probability of reporting within one day is approximately the same for deaths occurring on any of Monday to Friday, but is lower for deaths occurring on Saturday or Sunday. The probability of reporting within two days is the same for deaths occurring on Monday to Thursday, but lower for those occurring on Friday and Saturday (and to some extent Sunday). For reporting within three days, the probability is the same for deaths on Monday to Wednesday, but lower for Thursday to Saturday.",

As data accumulates over a longer period of time, it may become desirable to use data only from the most recent period, e.g. the last T = 90 days.

We adjusted for delays of up to D = 42 days. S&E adjusted for delays of up to only D = 14 days. Overall, around 97% of deaths that are reported within 42 days are reported within 14 days, and so this restriction may be reasonable. We distinguished between delays of d and d + 1 days all the way up to d = 14 days, grouping longer delays into weeks. S&E, on the other hand, grouped together all delays of more than seven days. This reduces the computation time, but has the drawback that some information is discarded. Specifically, data on deaths that occurred between 8 and 13 days ago and that have been reported with delays of more than seven days are ignored. As well as potentially reducing statistical efficiency, this discarding of information allows the estimate of the number of deaths that occurred on any of these days to be lower than the number so far observed to have occurred on that day. It was for these reasons that we waited until 15 days before grouping delays and thereafter grouped them into weeks rather than into a single group.",

Suppose deaths are never reported on Sundays but are reported on all other days of the week, and suppose day t is a Sunday. For someone who died on day t, the probability of being reported on day t equals zero, and hence q t0 equals zero, but their (expected) probability q t1 of being reported by the end of the following day would be non-zero, say q t1 = c t . So, from equation (10) we have that probit(0) = probit(q * 0 ) + h t and probit(c t ) = probit(q * 1 ) + h t . Since c t > 0, it follows that q * 1 > q * 0 . On the other hand, for someone who died on day t \u2212 1, which was Saturday, the (expected) probability q t\u22121,0 of being reported on day t \u2212 1 would be non-zero, say q t\u22121,0 = c t\u22121 , and their probability of being reported by the end of the following day would be no greater, i.e. q t\u22121,1 = q t\u22121,0 = c t\u22121 . So, from equation (10) we have that probit(c t\u22121 ) = probit(q * 0 )+h t\u22121 and probit(c t\u22121 ) = probit(q * 1 )+h t\u22121 .
