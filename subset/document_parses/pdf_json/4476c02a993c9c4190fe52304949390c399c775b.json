            "text": "Purpose: Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is an effective treatment prescribed to children with sleep disordered breathing (SDB); however, PAP adherence remains challenging. Given that COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact sleep and daily life, the aim of this study was to evaluate longitudinal trajectory of PAP usage in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective study. Children aged 1-18 years with SDB prescribed PAP at The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada) were evaluated for PAP adherence. Demographics, medical history and PAP adherence data during four consecutive 3-month time periods from December 2019 to December 2020 were collected. These four time periods included i) prior to COVID-19 lockdown, ii) during the first three months of lockdown, iii) summer and iv) return to school period. Percentage of days where PAP was used for \u22654 hours and average nightly usage of PAP were primary outcomes. Results: A total of 149 children (61.7% male, mean (\u00b1SD) age=12.8 \u00b1 4.1 years, BMI (\u00b1SD) z-score=1.45\u00b11.43) were enrolled. Compared to prior to lockdown, the median (IQR) of percentage of PAP usage \u22654 hours and average nightly usage of PAP declined significantly during the summer and return to school periods (p<0.001 for all). By the end of the return to school period, only 69/149 (46%) showed sustained PAP usage and 80/149 (54%) had decreased PAP usage. Obesity was a risk factor for a decline in PAP usage after returning to school (\u03b2=\u221215.36, p=0.03). Conclusion: Compared to COVID-19 pre-pandemic PAP usage, there was a significant decline in PAP usage across COVID-19 pandemic. There is critical under usage of PAP in children diagnosed with SDB, resulting in an urgent need to address barriers to mitigate poor adherence to PAP long-term. Targeted strategies are required to optimize PAP adherence in children with SDB.",

            "text": "Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi-level positive airway pressure (Bi-level PAP) is commonly prescribed to children in the home with chronic respiratory disorders including sleep disordered breathing (SDB), chronic lung disease and neuromuscular weakness. 1,2 SDB encompasses obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA) and/or nocturnal hypoventilation (NH). 3, 4 Consistent PAP use is highly efficacious for eliminating the nightly SDB and associated with several health benefits including better mood, improvements in neurocognitive and behavioral function, enhanced academic performance, improved quality of life and reductions in cardio-metabolic risk in children. [4] [5] [6] Although PAP is an effective treatment for SDB, adherence remains a significant challenge with less than 50% of children using PAP more than 4 hours a night, thereby reducing the effectiveness of PAP. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Interestingly, these observations are reported across all ages and developmental stages in children. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Factors positively influencing PAP adherence include underlying medical diagnosis (children with developmental delay were more likely to be adherent with PAP than those without a developmental delay diagnosis), practical caregiver support, patient engagement programs, time since PAP was initially prescribed, having a family member on PAP therapy as a \"role model\", physical design of the PAP machine and perceiving benefits of PAP use. 11, [14] [15] [16] Given the challenges of PAP adherence, there are concerns regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on PAP adherence. 17 It is now well documented that access and delivery of medical care has changed dramatically from in-person office visits to virtual care as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. 18 Specifically, within sleep medicine, COVID-19 pandemic has impacted access to polysomnograms (PSG) eg, reduction of available in laboratory PSG and reduction in home sleep testing; pivoted inperson clinic visits to virtual visits and delays in receiving therapeutic interventions. 19, 20 Interestingly, a study of 7485 adults in France showed that CPAP adherence improved during a one-month period of the COVID-19 lockdown compared to one-month prior to the lockdown from an average of 386 minutes per night prior to the lockdown to 401 minutes per night during lockdown, resulting in a 3.9% increase in adherence. 21 A cross-sectional study of CPAP adherence in 101 adults with OSA showed that CPAP adherence significantly improved during a 40-day period of the COVID-19 lockdown compared to a 6-month period prior to the lockdown. 22 Factors associated with improved PAP adherence included good CPAP adherers prior to lockdown, the female gender and younger age. 22 Similarly, in our own center, we recently published data on 151 children with SDB prescribed PAP therapy with objective data showing that 63% of children with SDB in fact had increased PAP adherence during the first 3 months of lockdown compared to 3 months prior to lockdown; specifically, 1) an increase in the median of percentage of days of PAP usage for \u2265 4 hours (76.7 versus 62.0%, p = 0.02) and 2) average nightly PAP usage (406.0 versus 367.0 minutes, p = 0.006) respectively. 23 However, there is emerging data that highlights significant changes in sleep schedule, physical activity behaviours and mental health of children and caregivers., 24, 25 which together may adversely affect longer-term pediatric PAP adherence. We hypothesized that despite the increase in PAP adherence observed in our cohort immediately during the lockdown period, 23 PAP adherence would subsequently decrease over time to usage observed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare PAP adherence at four distinct 3-month time periods which included prior to COVID-19 lockdown, during the first three months of lockdown, summer period (no school) and return to school.",

Specifically, the study population consisted of all children who were prescribed PAP at home prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada and continued to be prescribed PAP over the subsequent year. We did not deselect or exclude any patients based on their PAP usage at the time. Adherence to PAP was evaluated performed during four consecutive 3-month time periods as follows: 1) prior to COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada (December 18, 2019-March 16, 2020); 2) during the first three months of the pandemic (March 17-June 14, 2020), with the COVID-19 lockdown, declared on March 17th, 2020 in Ontario, Canada; 3) summer (June 15-September 13, 2020) and 4) return to school (September 14-December 12, 2020). Children were excluded if 1) PAP adherence download data was not available during all four distinct time periods and 2) Children were asked to terminate PAP by their medical provider during this time period. Objective PAP usage was obtained via PAP device data reports acquired remotely. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed which included baseline demographics (age, gender, height, weight and body mass index (BMI)), medical history such as primary diagnosis, comorbidities, allergies, medications, type of SDB, history of adenotonsillectomy (AT), type of PAP therapy, duration of initiation of PAP therapy, independent PAP user (eg able to apply and use PAP at home independently of parental/caregiver support as determined by the respiratory therapist following the child's PAP adherence patterns), and PAP adherence data. Obesity was characterized by a BMI more than or equal to the 95th percentile for gender and age. 26 ",

Our principal finding demonstrated that 1) PAP adherence in children with SDB decreased across 9 months period after the start of COVID-19 lockdown, where 54% showed an overall decrease in PAP usage by the end of the 9-month period; 2) Dependent PAP users had significantly higher PAP usage compared to independent PAP users; 3) Children with underlying medical conditions had greater number of days of PAP usage; and 4) Obesity was a risk factor for a decline in PAP usage. Risk factors associated with decline in PAP use are well documented which includes independent status and lack of support from family or health-care team, 11, 15, 28, 29 discomfort of the PAP device (mask leak, PAP pressure and tubing), 8, 16, 29 negative experiences or attitude with PAP, 28 difficulty adapting, 28 and a lack of subjective symptom improvement 16, 28, 29 as well as fear or embarrassment regarding treatment. 28 Our study showed a significant further decline from baseline PAP usage during specific time periods of the COVID-19 pandemic which suggest that there are additional risk factors during this time periods.",

            "text": "However, of concern, our data showed that there was a further decline in PAP usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reasons for changes in PAP adherence over time in our cohort are likely to be multifactorial including attendance of in-person versus online school as well as COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive measurements. 24, 25, [31] [32] [33] [34] These changes have impacted sleep routine schedules while also resulting in poorer quality of sleep, decreased physical activity, increase in sedentary behavior and screen time as well as adverse psychological and mental health effects on children and caregivers. 24, 25, 31 A recent study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 24 hours movement behaviors of 2661 Canadian students in grades 7-11 (43.4% male) over a one year period in Montral, Quebec, Canada. 32 The study demonstrated that the variability in the 24 hour movement behaviors were consistent with the restrictive measures imposed by the government as well as the COVID-19 pandemic direct and indirect effects. 32 It was observed that most children and adolescents had highest percentage of increased recreational screen time (68%) with the highest percentage (55%) of decreased physical activity between March 13 to June 2020, which was consistent with the timing of the COVID-19 lockdown that started on March 13, 2020 that led to severe restrictive measures and high schools closures with remote learning. Moreover, 49% of the participants reported a decrease in their sleep duration and 47% of them experienced poor sleep quality during this time, 32 factors which may have impacted PAP use in our cohort. Other factors that may have influenced PAP adherence may include seasonal variation as adolescents have earlier bedtimes in the winter and spring compared to later bedtimes in the summer. [34] [35] [36] A recent study among adults with OSA also demonstrated that seasonal changes were associated with CPAP adherence. 37 In this study, adults who were adherent to CPAP (eg, 70% of PAP use for \u2265 4 hours over a one-year period) showed both a lower percentage of CPAP use for \u2265 4 hours daily and daily duration of CPAP use during the summer compared to other seasons. Among adults who were nonadherent to CPAP, the percentage of CPAP use for \u2265 4 hours daily was greater in the spring compared to other seasons, with the daily duration of CPAP use being the shortest in the summer and longest in the winter. 37 Our results showed a similar trend with PAP usage during the pandemic, where children showed lower PAP usage in the summer compared to the spring and winter months. Despite overall decreases in PAP adherence over time, dependent PAP users had significantly higher usage of PAP compared to independent PAP users which concurs with previously reported data in 240 children (median age 7.9 years) of which 103 (42.9%) children had developmental disabilities. 38 Furthermore, a retrospective study of CPAP adherence in 140 children (aged 12.0 \u00b1 5.7 years old) over a one-year period showed CPAP adherence was higher in those with developmental delay, possibly due to their physical or intellectual disability resulting in a reduced ability to remove the CPAP mask and increased caregiver support. Moreover, during the pandemic, parental perception and beliefs of PAP necessity for those with neurodevelopmental disabilities may have increased. 11 We found that obesity was a risk factor for decreased PAP usage over time, similar to a previous 10-year multicentred retrospective review that evaluated longitudinal PAP adherence among 622 children aged 0-18 years old, which showed that children with obesity or metabolic syndrome were more likely to decline PAP therapy (OR =2.077 [95% CI 1.110-3.888]). 39 The reasons for these findings are unclear; however, there is one study suggesting lack of perceived benefits of PAP in this population may contribute to decreased use. 16 Of concern, obesity is an independent risk factor for susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 which is related to worsening outcomes including increased risk of hospitalization, critical care admission and mortality. 40, 41 The potential mechanisms include chronic inflammation, impairment of respiratory function and pulmonary perfusion, impaired immune response and underlying cardiorespiratory diseases. 40, 41 Additionally, OSA has been reported as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. 42 A study of 445 adults with COVID-19 (aged 55.1\u00b18.0 years old, 81.8% male and 8.5% diagnosed OSA) demonstrated that OSA is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 and associated with higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalization (OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.02 to 8.39, p=0.045). 42 Therefore, children with obesity, diagnosed SDB and poor PAP adherence are likely at greater risk for worsening COVID-19 outcomes and heightened awareness among physicians is paramount for early education, counselling and necessary interventions to encourage long-term PAP adherence.",

            "text": "Other risk factors for consideration includes both access and delivery of health care which has significantly pivoted and changed worldwide during the current COVID-19 pandemic. From mid-March 2020, there has been an observed 80% decrease in office visits and 56-fold increase in virtual care visits. 18 The benefits of telemedicine including telediagnosis, teletherapy, telemonitoring and teleconsultation have reduced waiting times, transportation time, visit costs and lowered infections rates, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] which may also better accomodate schedules of families while reducing the need to take time off work or arranging for childcare. However, the disadvantages of telemedicine includes the inability to perform most physical examinations or procedures, difficulty establishing new therapeutic relationships which are especially important for sustaining PAP use and reinforcing education around sleep hygiene issues particularly during adolescence, dealing with certain complex mental health issues, difficulty with interpreting body language and nonverbal clues, and lacking the full degree of comfort and support that can be provided in person as well as privacy and continuity of care concerns. 18 For children with SDB, in-person visits are vital to troubleshoot PAP related issues such as adequate mask fittings, equipment issues and additional face-to-face education with both caregivers and children themselves. 44 Importantly, direct interactions can emphasize the critical role of the caregiver especially in the adolescent population. The strengths of this study include a large time frame for longitudinal follow-up during consecutive 3-month periods to compare changes in PAP adherence through the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the heterogeneity of participants suggests that these results can be generalizable across paediatric cohorts of children with SDB using PAP therapy. Our results were also presented as group level means, which may result in individual changes to be missed; however by performing repeated measures ANOVA analyses, such limitations of group level means were minimized as our findings considered both within-subject variation and between-group effects. Additionally, we were able to obtain objective data from PAP devices which have been validated to be accurate. Our study highlights that longitudinal PAP adherence requires a long-term approach with frequent education and counselling, clinical monitoring, treatment strategies or other targeted behavioral interventions, 29 parental engagement, 16, 29 social support 29 and peer-driven intervention 49 to prevent further decline in PAP use of children with SDB.",

            "text": "There are some notable limitations to our study which require consideration. Factors influencing PAP adherence across all four distinct time periods were not available. These factors include bed time, wake time, sleep duration and sleep disturbance, as well as psychosocial factors, mental health, family functioning, change in caregiver schedules, all of which can influence PAP usage. Moreover, given the retrospective nature of our study, we do not have information on the COVID-19 positivity status of our participants. During clinic visits, we were able to ask 100/149 participants whether they had tested positive for COVID-19 and we know that 2/100 did state they had been positive, where one child continued to use PAP throughout all four time periods, and the second child stopped using PAP upon returning to school. However, this information was not confirmed by reviewing results of PCR testing and we also do not know the timing of the COVID-19 positive testing in relation to obtaining the PAP data. Moreover, we do not know whether any family members tested positive for COVID-19. Our study is also limited as we did not collect and therefore were unable to compare the PAP usage across a one-year period prior to COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we were not able to identify additional factors as to why children stopped using PAP as we do not have detailed survey or qualitative data available. However, these data highlight the importance of future research to identify and mitigate the factors associated with decreased PAP usage in children with SDB.",

PAP adherence has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, there was decline in PAP adherence over time during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to pre-pandemic levels, leaving many children untreated for SDB. Our study emphasized the need for physicians to detail the barriers and facilitators in order to provide targeted therapeutic interventions for reinforcing long-term PAP adherence in children with SDB. Future multicentered studies should address whether behavioral and/or additional virtual care modifications can be utilized and optimized to improve long-term PAP adherence and clinical outcomes in children with SDB during both the pandemic and beyond.",
