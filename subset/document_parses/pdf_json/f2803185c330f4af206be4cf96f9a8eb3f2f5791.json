The sequence of the virus is the central information; sequences are analyzed from a biological dimension describing the virus species and the host environment, a technological dimension describing the sequencing technology, an organizational dimension describing the project which was responsible for producing the sequence, and an analytical dimension describing properties of the sequence, such as known annotations and variants.

For what concerns SARS-CoV-2, we also include sequences from COG-UK (21) and NMDC (http://nmdc.cn/). GenBank and COG-UK data are made publicly available and can be freely downloaded and re-distributed. Special arrangements have been agreed with GISAID (8; 19) , resulting in a GISAID-enabled version of ViruSurf. Due to constraints imposed by GISAID, the database exposed in this version lacks the original sequences, certain metadata and nucleotide variants; moreover, GISAID requires their dataset not to be merged with other datasets. Hence, the two versions of ViruSurf should be used separately, and a certain amount of integration effort must be carried out by the user. Table 1 . Summary of ViruSurf content as of August 4th, 2020. For each taxon name (identified by a taxon ID and rank) and each source, we specify the number of distinct sequences and the reference genome; we also provide the average number of annotations, nucleotide variants and amino acid variants per sequence. The GISAID-only entry refers to those GISAID sequences that are not also present in the other three sources. Although the origin sources provide well-organized data portals (NCBI Virus (11) , the COVID-19 Data Portal https://www.covid19dataportal.org/, and GISAID EpiCoV data browser), these do not allow for an integrated search over multiple sources, nor they provide fast selection using sequence variants. A number of other integrated interfaces are being developed in alternative research contexts: UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser (9); 2019nCoVR (24) at the Chinese National Genomics Data Center; VirusDIP (22) at the China National GeneBank; CovSeq (13); CARD (18) . Compared to other resources, ViruSurf has much stronger query and search capabilities; we use the power of conceptual modeling to structure metadata and to organize data integration and curation; we support search queries allowing to combine filters on metadata, nucleotide and amino acid mutations in an effective and scalable way, treating all of them as first-class citizens.

Usually, such data are taken from the RefSeq entry for the given virus (e.g., NC 045512 for SARS-CoV-2). For each imported sequence, the pipeline starts by computing the optimal global alignment to the reference by means of the dynamic programming Needleman-Wunsch (NW) algorithm (14) . The time and space complexity of NW is quadratic in the length of the aligned sequences, which often hinders its adoption in genomics, but viral sequences are relatively short, thus we can use NW rather than faster heuristic methods. We configured the algorithm to use an affine gap penalty, so as to favor longer gaps which are very frequent at the ends of sequences.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 476, "end": 480, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Annotation and Variant Calling"}, {"text": "Once the alignment is computed, all the differences from the reference sequence are collected in the form of variants (substitutions, insertions or deletions).

Instead, when an aligned codon contains any IUPAC character ambiguously representing a set of bases (https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/iupac.html), it is translated into the X (unknown) amino acid, which automatically becomes a variant. Note that queries selecting known amino acids are not impacted; unknown amino acids are usually not of interest.
