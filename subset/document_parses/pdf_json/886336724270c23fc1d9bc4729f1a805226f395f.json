Most of the world's largest drugmakers and some of the smaller ones have turned to local Chinese drug contractors with niche specialties and a cheaper pool of scientists to deliver less costly drug trials and to gain access to China's large pool of patients. CROs in China that specialize in late stages of research, including clinical trials, have an annual revenue of about $200million, or less than 3 percent of the global CRO market. They are expected to expand at a rate of approximately 18 percent annually, with forecasts predicting an amount of $360 million by 2020. Hence, multinational CROs, including US-based Covance Inc. (CVD.N) and Charles River Laboratories International Inc. (CRL.N), are aiming to be far bigger players in this country. China, India, and other emerging markets are expected to help offset tepid CRO growth in other parts of the world. However, Brazil is now seen as another emerging potent market. China's CROs largely came into being after the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and developed a drug regulation system under China's State Food Drug Administration (SFDA). This increasingly competitive sector has at a minimum 138 CROs, 67 of which are (as of November of 2019) certified as being GLP by the Chinese government.",

When you add the GST plus travel cost to India for monitoring studies, the net savings is barely perceptible.

It is also important to make sure these modified protocols fit into the facility SOPs and that there are the technical capabilities to conduct these studies. Once agreement is reached on the new protocols, strain of animals (rodents), and animal source, a sponsor would have the CRO begin a short-duration (1 to 2 weeks) toxicology study in rodents. The sponsor would select and provide a compound for which there has already been generated short-duration toxicology/ADME data in rodents, perhaps a compound from a well-characterized class, or a terminated chemical series. The CRO conducts a rat study with limited histopathology, clinical pathology, and live-phase parameters and determines exposure levels on the first study day and on the final day. Once the CRO generates a summary report, the sponsor can compare data to the previous data. It is possible to assess overall the quality of the study, time to completion, and costs and, most importantly, evaluate the quality of animals available to these facilities and identify any issues with the source of these animals. If there are any issues, such as parasitic infestation or lung lesions because of the type of bedding (rice husk), then the opportunity exists to discuss and resolve the issues with the facilities.

Also, the CRO would conduct a dose form assay, develop a bioanalytical method, and complete final reports. In addition to conducting the study, the CRO should demonstrate project planning and should follow timelines. The sponsor representatives should visit the CRO during the live phase and monitor the study. If special techniques need to be developed (e.g., brain trimming), that work should be established early, and the sponsor should plan on an independent peer review by the sponsor's pathologist. Also, the sponsor should conduct a QA inspection at the end of the study (during the draft report phase), and a QA audit report with action items should be submitted to the CRO.
