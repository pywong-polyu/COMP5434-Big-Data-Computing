A computed tomography (CT) scan showed extensive ischemia of both cerebral hemispheres and incipient entrapment of the brain stem. CT angiography revealed occlusion of the middle cerebral artery on both sides, as well as sinus vein thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and transverse sinus on both sides. No intracranial hemorrhage was detected. Initial platelet count was 55 x 10 9 /L, and d-dimer level was 31 \u00b5g/mL. Activated partial thromboplastin time (22 s) and fibrinogen (378 mg/dL) were within a normal range. Antiplatelet factor 4 (anti-PF4)/heparin antibodies were detected (3.48 optical density [OD] units; negative <0.3 OD). Modified heparin-induced platelet activation assay was positive. The patient received IVIG therapy and argatroban. Brain death was determined on day 3 of hospitalization. After multidisciplinary discussion, we decided to evaluate the patient for organ donation. A standard assessment of the suitability of the patient as an organ donor including chest radiography, bronchoscopy, transthoracic echo, abdominal sonography, and standard laboratory diagnostics was undertaken. Despite a slightly increased creatinine level of 79.2 \u00b5mol/L (reference \u226470.4 \u00b5mol/L) diagnostic findings were normal; abdominal sonography especially showed no significant findings. Therefore, a further CT scan was not performed. The donor was reported to Eurotransplant. The recipient centers showed reluctance because of the VITT diagnosis. Finally, matched recipients were identified for the heart, liver, and kidneys. The patient underwent a multiple organ allograft recovery with argatroban infusion immediately before aortic crossclamping. At the back table, a tumor-suspected lesion at the left kidney and an infarction at the right kidney were noticed. Pathologic workup using frozen sections revealed an angiomyolipoma in the left kidney and fresh infarction",

Furthermore, an intraluminal blood clot was detected in the liver after organ procurement. A thorough radiologic assessment of the organs with multiphase CT angiography before organ retrieval could be useful to detect hypoperfusion or infarct in organs.
