            "text": "Treating chronic symptoms for pain and movement disorders with neuromodulation therapies involves fine-tuning of programming parameters over several visits to achieve and maintain symptom relief. This, together with challenges in access to trained specialists, has led to a growing need for an integrated wireless remote care platform for neuromodulation devices. In March of 2021, we launched the first neuromodulation device with an integrated remote programming platform. Here, we summarize the biodesign steps taken to identify the unmet patient need, invent, implement, and test the new technology, and finally gain market approval for the remote care platform. Specifically, we illustrate how agile development aligned with the evolving regulatory requirements can enable patient-centric digital health technology in neuromodulation, such as the remote care platform. The three steps of the biodesign process applied for remote care platform development are: (1) Identify, (2) Invent, and (3) Implement. First, we identified the unmet patient needs through market research and voice-of-customer (VOC) process. Next, during the concept generation phase of the invention step, we integrated the results from the VOC into defining requirements for prototype development. Subsequently, in the concept screening phase, ten subjects with PD participated in a clinical pilot study aimed at characterizing the safety of the remote care prototype. Lastly, during the implementation step, lessons learned from the pilot experience were integrated into final product development as new features. Following final product development, we completed usability testing to validate the full remote care system and collected preliminary data from the limited market release experience. The VOC data, during prototype development, helped us identify thresholds for video quality and needs priorities for clinicians and patients. During the pilot study, one subject reported anticipated remote-care-related adverse events that were resolved without sequelae. For usability analysis following final product development, the failure rates for task completion for both user groups were about 1%. Lastly, during the initial 4 weeks of the limited market release experience, a total of 858 remote care sessions were conducted with a 93% success rate. Overall, we developed a remote care platform by adopting a user-centric approach. Although the system intended to address pre-COVID19 challenges associated with disease management, the unforeseen overlap of the study with the pandemic elevated the importance of such a system and an innovative development process enabled us to advance a patient-centric platform to gain regulatory approval and successfully launch the remote care platform to market.",

            "text": "Neuromodulation therapies, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation, involve electrical stimulation of a neural target within a circuit to modulate OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ neural activity 1-4 . DBS is currently approved to treat movement disorders, including essential tremor, and Parkinson's disease (PD) 5,6 . For the treatment of pain, SCS is approved for chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs, and DRG stimulation is approved for chronic, intractable pain of the lower limbs due to complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) 7-9 . Although, technologies within neuromodulation (ex: lead geometry, battery performance, novel waveforms, and imaging techniques) are evolving rapidly 10 , treating chronic symptoms for pain and movement disorders still involves iterative fine-tuning of programming parameters. Stimulation programming depends on disease state and symptom profile and programming is an iterative process due to patient and response heterogeneity [11] [12] [13] . Additionally, trained specialists and care centers are typically located in dense cities, posing challenges for patients navigating urban transport systems or residing in distant areas. The need for iterative personalized programming evaluation coupled with travel challenges contribute to care access burden for patients and caregivers [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

In an initial kick-off meeting with 9 clinician experts in neuromodulation, we worked through process maps and task-based scenarios to effectively identify user needs and pain-points. The goal of the initial formative evaluation during kick-off was to assess usability of the video-conferencing feature of the remote care application using qualitative feedback at variable levels of network quality. We tested prototype versions of the Clinician Programmer (CP) and Patient Controller (PC) applications for this activity with clinicians. Three pairs of CP-PC devices were programmed with varying levels of network throttling to determine the minimum acceptable video quality. Log files from the video-conferencing feature and usability survey data along with like/dislike tags were collected. For subsequent VOC activities, we conducted one-on-one sessions using tools from the structured quality functional deployment (QFD) approach to determine clinician and patient needs prioritization 25 . Twelve clinicians and 17 patients participated in this activity. Process maps included questions about (1) Patient scheduling, (2) Visit initiation/ system and device check, (3) Evaluation of therapy and patient outcomes with existing program, (4) Therapy adjustments and patient response, and (5) Documentation/follow-up visit plan. Individual and group needs statements were ranked by each clinician, normalized into scores, and averaged across the responders to determine overall hierarchy (Table 2 ). Clinician prioritization of each individual need was computed by multiplying the normalized within group ranking value with the ranking value the clinician assigned to the group as a whole, with the total of all needs equaling 100. (2) We designed an initial prototype version of the platform in parallel with collecting voice-of-customer data and tested its feasibility in a real-world setting through a pilot study; (3) We integrated lessons learned from the study into a second iteration of development focused on new feature integration and usability analysis; (4) Lastly, we gained FDA approval for the remote care platform and collected preliminary data for the limited market release experience. Processes to ensure quality were followed during the development process. Following planning activities, user needs were translated into customer, system, and product requirements. Designs aligned with established requirements were reviewed periodically during technical meetings. Additionally, we conducted risk management, hazard analysis and cybersecurity assessment prior to verification and validation to ensure that the remote care platform prototype met the required quality standards. b. Concept Screening (Pilot Experience): After prototype development, we conducted a pilot study in Australia to characterize safety, determine feasibility and collect real-world data to inform future improvements on the remote care platform. The study, focused on the DBS experience, was approved by the UnitingCare Health Human Research Ethics Committee. All subjects provided written informed consent which discussed potential risks and benefits of the device, study procedures, and compliance with review and follow up, prior to enrollment into the study (anzctr.org.au: ACTRN12619001660178).",

The expert programmers assumed the role of being the in-person or remote clinician. Subjects were independently evaluated and programmed first by the in-person clinician and then by the remote clinician who was located in a different room or off-site. However, to ensure safety, the in-person clinician remained with the subjects during evaluation by the remote clinician in case any adverse events (AEs) occurred. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the standard-of-care (SOC) group (n = 5) or the remote care (RC) group (n = 5), and only one set of parameters (either SOC or RC) was activated on the subject's implantable pulse generator (IPG).

Additionally, all communication between the CP and PC is protected via Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 encryption. The remote care platform is architected to use the patient's controller application (Remote Care PC application) as a proxy for receiving therapy commands sent by the clinician's programming application (Remote Care CP application) over a network connection.

The remote clinician also tested the feasibility of this system with successful connections from variable settings (a different room in the clinic, a remote urban and a rural setting). The primary objective of the study was to characterize the safety of remote-care-related AEs; therefore, a group-level comparison between the RC and SOC groups was not within the scope of this study. During the primary endpoint duration, only one subject reported remote-care-related AEs, specifically due to loss of connectivity between the CP and PC devices. The AEs experienced by this subject were anticipated, categorized as worsening of the clinical condition, and resolved without sequalae. Protected recovery program in the prototype version of the platform, employed in study, was defined as the last saved checkpoint on the IPG. For this patient, the checkpoint was saved with DBS off, resulting in the observed adverse event.

The platform was uniquely architected to leverage existing mobile platforms without the need for any extra hardware components, enabling a shallow learning curve for patients and clinicians. External sensors, such as built-in mobile cameras, enabled high-resolution audio-video sessions and facilitated real-time evaluation of symptoms. Our development efforts were iterative; we identified an unmet patient need with respect to care access burden, designed the initial technology for use in the pilot study and subsequently, integrated features informed by lessons learned in the study to advance towards a patient-centric remote care platform that was further evaluated with a preliminary limited market release experience. In the study, issues related to connectivity were most common among the technical concerns related to the platform. In response, the PRP feature was refined to address unanticipated network interruptions, and a color-coded network monitor was added to the UI to mitigate the need for robustness of system connectivity. Additionally, nuances of system usability were refined for a more robust and comfortable remote care experience. Usability testing, pilot testing, and real-world adoption demonstrate that the system provides a mechanism for patients to access diagnostic or treatment services for their neuromodulation system when they do not have access to inperson services. Further, use of the system may be expected to provide rapid treatment in cases where in-person treatment is delayed (ex: patients needing to travel long distances to see their care provider).",

However, currently, there is a need for digital solutions that can extend care beyond the clinic to address growing care-access burden and to evaluate patient concerns in real-world scenarios. Previous systems that have attempted to remotely connect patients and clinicians are cumbersome and often contain multiple components. Most systems only provide a video platform, requiring the patient to adjust their own programming settings within previously programmed parameter ranges. Other platforms, such as the PINS and SceneRay systems recently investigated in China, require multiple hardware components to integrate the video interaction with therapy adjustments 28, 29 . In contrast, our remote care system leverages existing mobile technology to initiate an audio/video interaction simultaneously to activating a data channel for sending therapy commands. Though two channels are activated to ensure safety of data while in rest or transit, the users only need to interact with a single interface, minimizing overall burden of use. Moreover, our platform can be used with patient's personal mobile devices (ex: personal iPhone) further minimizing the user burden of multiple device management. Currently, there are no other remote care systems that are completely wireless, and enable simultaneous modulation and monitoring as demonstrated in the platform presented here 28, 29 . Novel technical features integrated in the remote care system described, and the overall user experience, are focused on empowering the patient during the remote session: (1) Patient-initiated process ensures that the patient is always in control of their therapy; (2) Addition of remote care features on existing interface allows for seamless adoption of the new platform; (3) Safety-first foundation of the system is architected with multiple layers of security to adequately protect patient data and session communication; (4) Color-coded indication about session connectivity is presented with the network monitor to communicate the quality of the connection; (5) Ability for the clinician to comprehensively prescribe programming changes remotely to account for fluctuating symptoms and side-effects; and (6) A fail-safe mechanism with the PRP feature that can be customized by the clinician to ensure that patient is on optimal settings regardless of unanticipated communication loss during the session.",
