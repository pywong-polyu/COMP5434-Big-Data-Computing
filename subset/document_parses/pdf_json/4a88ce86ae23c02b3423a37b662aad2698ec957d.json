In the United States, local controls wax and wane over time, often poorly coordinated across polities (e.g., states). New York may surge while Florida does not, but, later, this flips, generating repeated outbreaks varying among locations. Mathematical models are essential tools to monitor and control epidemics such as COVID-19 (2-6), but they can also sharpen intuition about emergent epidemiological phenomena. While spatial processes are increasingly incorporated into epidemiological theory (7) , as is temporal variation in disease transmission (4, 5, 8) , their combined effect is underappreciated. Yet spatiotemporal variation is pervasive in epidemics; COVID-19 is no exception. Data for the United States (e.g., https://rt.live/) suggest R t has fluctuated in wave-like fashions, with peaks at different times in different states. We show that infectious individuals moving among populations with asynchronous temporal dynamics in transmission can permit disease persistence when extirpation would otherwise occur, based on local estimates of transmission: Global average R t over time may exceed 1, despite time-averaged R t < 1 locally, everywhere. Moreover, even when extirpation is unlikely, spatiotemporally heterogeneous transmission, coupled with movement, can accelerate epidemic spread.",

We consider 1) effective local control, where local transmission dynamics imply eradication, were locations isolated; and 2) ineffective local control, where local transmission dynamics generate varying but sustained spread. Fig. 1 shows these two scenarios for local populations, either synchronous or asynchronous in their time-varying control efforts, with sinusoidal local transmission. Given effective local control (local r \u0305 < 0; time-averaged R t < 1), the disease cycles due to fluctuating transmission rates, but declines overall in isolated populations. The same holds for synchronized populations connected by movement (Fig. 1C) . But, with poor coordination (asynchrony), the disease instead spreads (Fig. 1D) . Merely changing the relative timing of local controls reverses global outcomes. Either synchronizing policies or cutting movement between local populations drives the disease extinct.",

In this example, early in the epidemic (i.e., S i = N i ), asynchrony increases the net change over the cycle from 0.073 d \u22121 to 0.099 d \u22121 (the average weekly increase goes from 67 to 100%); this boost in infectious spread is evident after a few cycles.",

Intuitively, why does this occur? Immigration of infectious individuals into a location during periods when R t < 1 (a \"sink\" location, e.g., during lockdowns) maintains prevalence greater than expected, and those locations can then surge to greater prevalence when they switch to R t > 1 (a \"source,\" when lockdowns ease). If different localities enter and leave lockdown at different times, they, in effect, take turns sourcing and receiving immigrants, fueling disease spread reciprocally. Prevalence increases with the time that populations differ in R t , explaining why prevalence increases with asynchrony. Longer cycle lengths (for given asynchrony) further elevate disease spread. Such effects are known in population ecology under the rubric of the \"inflationary effect\" (9, 10), emerging from spatiotemporal variation among populations coupled by movement-quintessential features of pandemics.",

Sinusoidal transmission dynamics alternate between increasing (r max > 0; R t > 1) and declining prevalence (r min < 0; R t < 1). Two populations (dashed; solid) exactly (A) in-phase (\u03a9 = 0) and (B) out of phase (\u03a9 = 1). Number of infectious individuals in each population over time with effective control for (C) synchronous and (D) asynchronous populations, and for ineffective control with (E) synchronous and (F) asynchronous populations (note log scale). Populations differ only in timing of transmission dynamics. Movement rate m = 0.005 d \u22121 . For other parameters, see Materials and Methods. from ref. 14, \u03d5 = 0.87. We chose \u03bc = 0.015 d \u22121 to match the best estimates of infection fatality rate (= (1 -\u03d5)\u03bc/(\u03bc + \u03b3) \u2248 0.6%; ref. 15). Thus, r max = 0.248 (0.17 to 0.23; ref. 5), r min = \u22120.277, and r\u0305 = \u22120.0145 d \u22121 ; R t = \u03b2 i /(\u03b3 + (1 -\u03d5)\u03bc) fluctuates between 1.77 (2.4 to 4; refs. 3, 5, 11) and 0.14. For r\u0305 > 0, \u03b2 varies between 0.67 and 0.12 d \u22121 , respectively, with other parameters unchanged. Thus, r max = 0.348, r min = \u22120.202, and r\u0305 = 0.0731 d \u22121 ; R t fluctuates between 2.08 and 0.37.Simulating Dynamics. For Figs. 1 and 2, we numerically solved Eq. 1 using ode45 in Matlab 2019b. Infection was initiated in population A at t = 0 with I A (0) = 10, and in population B at t = \u03c4 with I B (\u03c4) =10, with no infection in B or movement between populations during 0 < t < \u03c4. Growth rate at local initiation (t = 0, \u03c4 for A, B) is r max . Local transmission varies sinusoidally thereafter. We calculated cumulative cases after 50 cycles of Eq. 1, ensuring disease fadeout. Global average initial growth rate is the asymptotic change in log total infections over a cycle after numerically solving Eq. 2 for 10 cycles.

Code and other materials have been deposited in GitHub (https://github.com/kortessis/SpatioTemporal_COVID-19). Long-term disease outcomes. Cumulative cases per thousand postpandemic increase with asynchrony (\u03a9), whether local control is (A) effective (note log scale) or (B) ineffective. Parameters are as inFig. 1.",
