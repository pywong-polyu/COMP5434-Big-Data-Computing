From time to time with the effective use of vaccines, large numbers of people have benefited in being free from vaccine-preventable diseases. Nearly two to three million deaths are prevented each year since the advent of immunization programmes, and vaccines are cost-effective preventive care [1] . As per the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), vaccines are among the top ten effective public health interventions of the twentieth century [2] . Vaccines have a significant benefit in terms of reduction of treatment cost, and enhance the productivity of the workforce in the long term [3] . A crucial point is with regard to perspectives that may hinder the decision at the individual or family level related to the COVID vaccines. However, we cannot reject the benefit of vaccines in protecting us from infectious diseases. Nevertheless, we also cannot assume that the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine is sufficient to vaccinate all of the target population. Vaccination has to be free from fears and negative perspectives, which may halt the speed and size of vaccination coverage.",

Vaccine hesitancy is a complex behaviour and context-specific. It differs across time, place, person and vaccines [4] . It is a spectrum where an individual can express acceptance of vaccine with certainty, have vaccine confidence, delay vaccination, be unsure of vaccination, refuse vaccines or fall anywhere in between. The protection motivational theory believes in threat appraisal (perceived severity of health threat/individual vulnerability) and coping appraisal (perceived self-efficacy) [5] . Recognizing both threat appraisal and coping appraisal and defining vaccine confidence is important to improve good vaccine coverage. Furthermore, the factors that influence vaccine confidence have been clearly expressed through the '3 Cs' model of determinants-confidence, complacency and convenience, and have been included in the definition [6] . The recommendation by the SAGE committee has important takeaways for increasing the understanding of vaccine hesitancy, determinants and challenges, for improving acceptance and sharing lessons from multiple country contexts which are critical for the development of new tools for addressing factors that influence vaccine confidence [7] .",

Thus, the influencing factors have been grouped under contextual, individual/group specific and vaccine/vaccination specific factors as shown in Table 1 . Contextual influences deal with socioeconomic, environmental, political, cultural, economic and institutional factors. Individual/group-specific factors influences arise from personal beliefs about the vaccine and peer environment. Vaccine/vaccination-specific influences are directly related to vaccines or vaccination [6] . We applied the SAGE model of the vaccine hesitancy determinants matrix to examine the vaccine confidence issues in our study.",

            "text": "In India, more than 100 million residents reside in urban slums [8] . The official estimate shows the number of slum dwellers increased in India. The unprecedented rate of urbanization led to the rise of informal settlements or slums. Slums are characterized by the lack or limited health, education services, limited living spaces, insecurity and informal jobs or no jobs [9] . Compared to the rest of the population, slum dwellers have a higher proportion of COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality [10] , and their vulnerability increases due to economic shocks and several depend on informal income. Furthermore, the availability of a safe and effective vaccine is essential to control COVID-19. Currently approved vaccines against COVID-19 have shown promising results. However, adequate coverage of eligible population depends on the uptake of the vaccine, which may vary across sub-populations such as the slum population [11] , ethnic minority population [12] , and healthcare workers [13] . The challenge of improving vaccine confidence among the general public has become a hindrance for immunization programmes in achieving good vaccine coverage [14] . This eventually leads to an increased risk of failure to prevent disease transmission and a surge in vaccine-preventable diseases. In this context, the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the lack of vaccine confidence as one of the top 10 threats to global public health in 2019 [14] . Therefore, an adequate understanding of differing perspectives, barriers and enablers to COVID vaccine uptake could potentially give insights for developing interventions focused on improving vaccine uptake. This is specifically important considering evidence that the urban poor or slum populations are more likely to be affected by COVID-19 and experience higher morbidity and mortality [10] . Additionally, previous study reviews recognise the growing trend of varying concerns against COVID-19 [11] signifies the necessity of monitoring of vaccine confidence [15] . As a result, the focus of this study was to examine the factors that influence to receiving of the COVID-19 vaccine in urban slums in India.",

The data was collected during the peak of the second wave of COVID infection. The spikes in the COVID situation were dynamic and varying across all four sites. However, the evidence was to be collected within a quick turnaround of one week of data collection because time was required for data processing and analysis for generating speedy policy recommendation, albeit without missing out on contextual reality. It was mutually decided that a sample of a minimum 50 respondents was feasible. Hence, we used a convenience sampling procedure for conducting the survey considering what was feasible under these exceptional circumstances. The Bangalore team was able to recruit a bigger sample due to relatively lesser operational challenges. However, data collection in Delhi was conducted telephonically because there was high-risk environment of COVID-19 and the inability of the team to be present in the field at the time of data collection.",

The study found that the main reasons were dependence on others/family to make the decision to get vaccinated (17.6%) and being unable to register for vaccination (21.4%). Here, gender disparity is being implicated. Mostly, women are known to be dependent on family for decision making. Similarly, a nationwide study from Qatar observed relatively higher hesitancy and resistance among the female gender [18] [, whereas a in a study from New York city, females with chronic diseases have a lower likelihood of getting the vaccine [12] . In a study done by Echoru et al., men were found to have more acceptance than women, albeit for a different reason, but that women had more fear of vaccination [19] . The dependency on others to go for vaccination also deters people from vaccination. Often women in the slums and informal settlements need to get permission from their husbands or other family members and are dependent on their decisions and/opinions to get vaccinated. Even for routine child immunization, women had to depend on husbands or elders for taking the decision, as is found in research work done in Nigeria [20] . Dependence on others to register for vaccination in urban slums may be linked to the general lack of digital literacy in the population. Other factors found in our study were the inability to spare a day from work (6.4%), the distance of the vaccination centre (5.7%), physical disability or health problems (2.7%), and lack of supporting documents (0.7%). Geographic barriers prevented proper utilization of immunization services [20] .",

Many people were also found to be dependent on daily wage labour and cannot afford to miss a day at work, especially during these times when financial security for most households is uncertain. Due to the nature of their work, and the lack of time away from it, they find it difficult to go and get vaccinated. Furthermore, they are also unable to accompany aged members in their family for vaccination. The urban population, especially the slum population, have a unique set of factors that expose them to increased risk for COVID-19 infection [11] . They also consist of a migrant population whose health parameters are poorer than the rest, due to low socioeconomic background, limited access to social welfare and vulnerability to marginalization. Socio-economic vulnerability has been determined to be a factor of low vaccine intention [21] .",

One-fourth of the participants felt a lack of understanding of the safety of the vaccine and its adverse effects, while 24% were fearful of getting vaccinated. 11.8% were doubtful about the utility of the vaccine in containing the pandemic. These findings are in agreement with those of previous works on migrants and in low-income countries [22, 23] , which reported a lack of confidence in vaccines and fear of side effects as the major reasons. A study from Italy found that lack of vaccine safety and concerns about adverse effects are key reasons for vaccine hesitation [24] These reasons may be more relevant in this context as COVID vaccines are relatively new and are produced within a short period of time. Our qualitative data reveals that several individuals in slums do not understand the effectiveness and the need to get vaccinated. Many do not trust the vaccines yet and the effectiveness of these in curbing the pandemic. Some consider that the vaccination might be futile.",

Our study findings show that the community strongly believe in those misconceptions about the adverse effects of the vaccination that they get from social media groups. The word-of-mouth campaigns of the vaccines in slum areas also hinder people from getting vaccinated. Most of them have been fearful of getting fever, body aches, losing consciousness and feeling nauseated, among others. Other discrete misnomers prevalent among them included risk of death, the adverse effect of the vaccine on the ability to conceive children, and COVID-19 like complications on taking the vaccine. Key informants strongly feel that such false information and paranoia actively dissuades individuals from being vaccinated. Although social media has both a negative (comments) and positive effect (frequently positive) [27] , it plays a crucial role in the individual's perception of the vaccine, and their subsequent action related to uptake of the vaccine. Concerns about the possible complications and safety of the vaccine and a general lack of understanding are limitations to vaccine confidence. Interventions are required to monitor social media [27] targeting of a particular factor; for instance, more effective communication, involving all stakeholders, to convey the right information about vaccines to the urban slum population and increase their faith in immunization. Also, in order to improve the readiness for vaccine acceptance, the Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP) is likely to provide useful tools for identifying vaccine hesitant population subgroups and recognizing the demand-and supply-side immunization barriers and enablers and, finally, to design evidence-informed responses [28] .",

There is a need to take up vigorous awareness campaigns, telephonic messages, and pamphlets which describe the safety of the vaccine and the active engagement of NGOs [34] and community leaders/champions/employers and community associations [35] . This social mobilization should be utilized to disseminate correct and timely information over social media [36] , newspapers, advertisement campaigns, and billboards to increase awareness. This knowledge, which will invigorate demand for the vaccine, needs to coincide with better access through greater awareness of vaccination centres. For building trust on the vaccine, transparency of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) is critical [37] . Consequently, there is a need to develop and implement a protocol for AEFI response, with a focus on post-vaccination follow-up and communication to handle any adverse events. Furthermore, involving community mobilizers and frontline workers to build trust and engage communities via community engagement practices should be brought into practice [38] . The identification of traditional vaccine-hesitant and resistant areas/groups from local communities has yielded success in the uptake of polio vaccination drives in the past [39] ; hence, similar strategies can be employed to build community trust and acceptance in such pockets. The quality of vaccine dispensing service can greatly improve by improving accessibility and friendly delivery of vaccination [33] . Also, the effective distribution of vaccines has to be ensured in order to avoid overcrowding at the vaccination centers [40] , and also the internal layout and organization of movement in the centers to reduce crowds, smooth the flow of people and maintaining their safety. In order to ensure equity there is a need to overcome technological disparity [41] by developing systems that ensure easy access of the urban poor to the electronic registration system. Furthermore, access to vaccines is hampered when there are few vaccination centres [42] ; therefore, access can greatly improve when there is greater concentration of vaccination centres in close proximity to settlements. Though there are challenges faced by hospitals in sharing public health informatics [43] , the need for increased participation by local health facilities (public and private) to provide information on vaccine availability, registration, and vaccination schedules is urgent. In order to overcome opportunity costs faced by the poor in getting vaccinated during weekdays, mass vaccination drives over the weekend can be organized [44] . As part of an inclusive vaccination programme, the WHO and UNICEF policy brief suggests arranging of transport, especially for the disabled, to the vaccination centers [45] , and the same can be arranged for the elderly. Specifically, the elderly are more likely to have co-morbidities, and in assessing the correlation between co-morbidities and vaccination it is essential to conduct a post-vaccination follow-up for the elderly.",

Our study findings were found to be useful to consider for proactive measures to alleviate key concerns. Furthermore, it is essential to ensure adequate vaccine supply, quality service delivery, optimal timing and appropriate information. There is a need for concerted national, state and local level efforts to understand, analyse and address vaccine confidence at regular intervals. Enhancing understanding in the urban poor/slum population while engaging community-based organisations, strengthening local capabilities to mobilise diverse communities by addressing the community-specific vaccine concerns/reasons from time to time through effective culturally appropriate, tailored messages in vernacular languages supported by ever-emerging evidence could improve coverage of the COVID vaccine. The findings indicate the need to plan and carry out specific result-oriented interventions using key findings such as effective risk communication, which caters to the community's apprehensions and building trust; and using existing technologies to reach target audiences.",
