This algorithm diverges from that of the status quo, as the Plebeian Algorithm uses a democratic process to detect and remove misinformation. A method was constructed in which content deemed as misinformation to be removed from the platform is determined by a randomly selected jury of anonymous users. This not only prevents these types of infodemics but also guarantees a more democratic way of using social media that is beneficial for repairing social trust and encouraging the public's evidence-informed decision-making.",

            "text": "The internet is a powerful tool for spreading information; as such, it follows that it is equally powerful for spreading misinformation. In 2019, the number of social media users worldwide was 3.484 billion [1] , with that number increasing year-by-year by an average of 9% [1, 2] . With this increased use, the \"power-user\" or microinfluencer phenomenon has arisen, where popular social media accounts are able to reach large numbers of readers. This is increasingly important as more people begin to use social media as a source for news [3] . This news comes from a third party by a popular influencer, not posted or moderated by the social media companies themselves. Past analyses examining online misinformation often classify posts as misinformation using a \"Point-And-Shoot\" algorithm; this is the status quo. However, some algorithms will be better at combating misinformation than others. The Plebeian Algorithm creates criteria that social media websites should take into account when designing their algorithms to reduce misinformation. This reduction of misinformation is thought to be achieved by examining the correlation between sentiment and misinformation; it has been found that posts containing misinformation tend to have more negative sentiment when compared categorically to other posts covering the same issue [4] . Due to this correlation, it is hypothesized that an algorithm that encourages positive interactions will also reduce the amount of misinformation present on the platform through a democratic manner.",

First, misinformation shall be defined as the spread, intentional or otherwise, of false information [5] . The intentions of the individuals spreading the information is irrelevant. Second, disinformation is the purposeful spread of false information [5] . A similar yet distinct definition is malinformation, which is the malicious spread of false or misleading information [5] . Finally, fake news is defined as any misinformation (with or without intention) that readers interpret as trustworthy news [5] . For this study, misinformation will be studied in-depth; however, it should be noted that future supplemental studies could conduct a similar investigation focused on disinformation, malinformation, or fake news. Infodemics can additionally be applied to the realm of health care; infodemics have the potential to intensify outbreaks when there is uncertainty among the public concerning evidence-informed preventative and protective health measures [6] .",

The study of the spread of infodemics on a large scale, especially pertaining to medical misinformation, is known as infodemiology. The WHO has additionally linked the rapid surge of such infodemics during the COVID-19 pandemic to \"growing digitization,\" which can support the global reach of information but can also quickly amplify malicious or fabricated messages [6] . The second relevant definition is that of the concept of misinformation, which has been defined similarly to the definition used by the WHO in relation to the infodemic [6] , but specifically refers to the distinct lack of verity in information related to a specific field.",

This maximization of user page time leads to companies using highly specialized and trained machine learning to advertise content on users' feeds [7] . At the same time, this can have unintended adverse effects such as maximizing the time a user engages with content that is not verified for accuracy. The proposed solution to this disparity between engagement and integrity is to create democratically moderated spaces. Democratic spaces and recommendations to posts with more positive sentiment are integral concepts in the Plebeian Algorithm, based on the latest evidence that misinformation tends to be more negative [5] . The Plebeian Algorithm is an algorithm, described herein, for the purpose of the control of the spread of misinformation on social media. It is beneficial compared to other existing algorithms, as will become evident. The currently implemented point-and-shoot algorithms are hypertuned to specific sources of misinformation surrounding specific topics. However, they are not adaptable to the fluidity of the definition of true information.",

One example of a website that breaks the expectations for social media algorithms is 4chan. 4chan is an excellent epitome of ephemeral social media, where content is completely anonymous and is rapidly discarded regardless of popularity [8] ; in addition, there is close to no moderation and the content tends to be more negative in sentiment. This is also exemplified in Parler, an alternative social media platform established in September 2018 that aimed to bring forth a platform with total freedom of speech. Consequently, Parler attracted those who were banned from other social media websites, creating \"echo chambers, harbouring dangerous conspiracies and violent extremist groups\" [9] such as those who were involved in raiding the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Reddit also has a forum-based system similar to 4chan. However, individual fora on these platforms have moderators who work to combat negative sentiment throughout the website. Reddit's issue lies in its incredibly isolated fora, as tailoring one's feed to be a vast majority of explicitly handpicked fora is a part of the experience; this allows for some fora to have little to no moderation [10] .",

Application programming interfaces (APIs) were used from Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan, gathering data regarding username, date, post, and text. Furthermore, two data sets were gathered from academic sources, containing post data from Twitter [17] and Parler [9] . Various Python libraries were used to interact and connect with the APIs, including twarc, urllib3, and basc_py4chan. The following Python libraries were used to clean the data: beautifulsoup4, demoji, and pyenchant. The pandas library for Python was used to retrieve and store third-party data sets [8, [17] [18] [19] [20] , and the numpy library was used for various array operations. Finally, the nltk library was used to perform sentiment analysis, and sklearn was used to perform regressions.",

Plotting a histogram with a kernel density estimation (KDE) resulted in the various graphs produced by the research team. Data for which sentiment analysis returned inconclusive due to textual limitations was removed from visualization. Limiting the language to English has the benefit of statistical comparison congruence. One notable platform that did not use an API is Facebook.

The subreddits selected were r/AskReddit, r/AskThe_Donald, r/conspiracy, r/covid, r/kindness, r/movies, r/politics, and r/EnoughTrumpSpam. These subreddits were selected as an array of options, allowing an analysis of probable misinformative, probable truthful, and unknown sources. The data was gathered using the Python library urllib3. The first subreddit to be examined herein is r/AskReddit. This subreddit tends to contain a wide variety of posts from a myriad of conversation topics. As such, it is relatively indicative of Reddit overall. r/AskReddit's histogram can be found in Figure 2 . The bimodal distribution was \u03bc -\u2248-0.54, \u03bc + \u22480.48, and \u03b3\u2248-0.03214. It should be noted that the extremal frequencies of the bimodal distribution were approximately equal between the negative and positive peaks. Another notable subreddit examined was r/politics, which provided a sample of posts potentially swayed by the political leaning of Reddit users. The histogram and KDE for this analysis is displayed in Figure 3 . The bimodal distribution for r/politics was \u03bc -\u2248-0.56, \u03bc + \u22480.43, and \u03b3\u2248-0.37776. r/politics's content had a stronger negative skew as is apparent by the KDE. The final subreddit to be examined is an avant-garde subreddit: r/conspiracy. In this community, users share various conspiracy theories. When one scrolls through r/conspiracy, plenty of misinformation can easily be noted, including misinformation surrounding Flat Earth Theory and QAnon. The histogram for r/conspiracy is found in Figure 4 . The bimodal distribution for r/conspiracy was \u03bc -\u2248-0.56, \u03bc + \u22480. 39 As can be noted by r/conspiracy, the conspiratorial posts (which are known to contain a large volume of misinformation) are more often negative. This can be noted due to the difference in the peaks of the bimodal distribution.",

A random sample of the data was taken for this analysis, as there were too many tweets to reasonably analyze the population. The bimodal distribution was \u03bc -\u2248-0.36, \u03bc + \u22480.47, and \u03b3\u22480.86500. As can be noted, the positive peak for the KDE is nearly double the negative peak.

This objective contradicts the goal of preventing misinformation from spreading on the platform, as preventing misinformation requires some censorship, resulting in a reduction of revenue. This, however, is not to indicate that the Plebeian Algorithm is of little value to site entrepreneurs. It is critical to give note that the ultimate goal of social media companies (with the exception of Parler) have already shown themselves interested in curbing and moderating their own social media platforms through their implementation of \"point-and-shoot\" algorithms as well as censorship of high-profile posts and accounts (eg, Twitter banning @realDonaldTrump). However, as has already been described, these algorithms are not effective at accomplishing their mission of reducing misinformation and, further, have caused users to become disillusioned with the service. This has led to many users joining platforms that capitalize on this disillusionment (eg, Parler). Hence, by implementing the Plebeian Algorithm, these social media companies finally have a method that carefully balances moderation with freedom of expression that will reinspire a sense of awe within their user base and bring back the notion of social media being a fun online space where people can collaborate and share freely.",

The method used by Facebook, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, aims to combat the spread of misinformation and is based on neural networks trained to search for key terms in textual elements (including posts, comments, and statuses). It should also be noted that Facebook's algorithm includes a large amount of human work, which is easily biased. As has been stated in prior sections, there are several issues with this method of misinformation censorship; most notably, the Facebook algorithm is limited in scope to a specific subset of misinformation topics. Algorithms of this nature will detect specific key terms such as \"COVID\" included in the text of a post to provide additional information and resources for viewers; these algorithms will also provide information to the user sharing the post before publicizing the post. On the contrary, the Plebeian Algorithm is proactive in nature: it is universally applicable to all forms of misinformation and works to combat infodemics before they become widespread. As stated previously, infodemics of misinformation have led to the problem of pandemics becoming exacerbated and thus harder to control for public health workers. By implementing the Plebeian Algorithm, public health will be improved, especially concerning future pandemics, as potentially dangerous misrepresentations or falsehoods about the situation will be contained to a smaller percentage of the populace, and thus ensures that reliable and trustworthy information is more accessible and widespread. The Plebeian Algorithm also requires less maintenance by developers, actively running automatically without the requirement of hard coding key terms to flag.",

This has become clear with YouTube's controversies within the community revolving around issues such as the lack of communication and censorship of YouTube influencer Logan Paul. Should YouTube implement the Plebeian Algorithm, a Jury Phase is required after content is reported and prior to its removal process. It should also be noted that YouTube's jurors are not a random distribution. The moderation algorithms are programmed by humans, and as such, it is extremely difficult to ensure that the correct decisions are consistently being made.

Proposed by Condorcet (and later proven by numerous mathematicians and statisticians in the late 20th century), the theorem explains that two scenarios may unfold when attempting to determine the truth by means of polling a sample of the population [38] .

The user interface should be minimal to ensure that the public reception of the implementation of the Plebeian Algorithm is positive. Although this will likely decrease the percentage of the sample who opt-in to act as jurors, consistence will be achieved due to the positive reception of the algorithm implementation.

With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of misinformed posts has been spread by those with politically right ideologies, or Republicans. A total 48% of US Republicans believe that SARS-CoV-2 is no more dangerous than the common influenza [41] (compared to 25% of US Democrats [41] ), and 42% of Republicans believe that hydroxychloroquine-a treatment for malaria-is an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 [41] (compared to 5% of Democrats [41] ). Furthermore, Republicans (or those with political right ideologies) tend to be more concerned with the preservation of the freedoms of speech and expression. Thus, it is evident that we must preserve these freedoms for any algorithmic change to be effective. The Plebeian Algorithm goes further than this: it works to increase the rights of the individuals with respect to cross-region community matching freedom of expression. Individuals have the right to post and speak as they please and promote the spread of the information they deem to be pertinent. Additionally, they have the right to decide what content they want to see on the platform and what they do not. These benefits will help to ensure that the public reacts in a positive light to the change. Implementing a Plebeian Algorithm is a net positive; it is a positive change for both the containment of infodemics and the promotion of freedom of expression among social media users. Furthermore, under the Plebeian Algorithm, social media companies are still permitted to analyze user activity according to their privacy policies to provide appropriate advertisements tailored to the user.

It is also pertinent to discuss the specific limitation surrounding the use of COVID-19 data for this analysis. It is often difficult for populations to alter their vocabulary to change the reference of a xenophobic initial name to an accurate descriptor [50] . Specifically, with regard to COVID-19 variants of concern (VoCs), many scientific sources still note the location of the VoC's discovery. This brings two significant points to the forefront of discussion: first, national health agencies need to provide precise and nonxenophobic nomenclature from the onset of pandemics, and second, the use of locational taxonomy should not automatically flag a post (ie, it should be flagged through sentimental analysis solely). The Plebeian Algorithm assists in this analysis, as it does not consider specific search terms, but rather pure sentiment. This handles issues surrounding truthful posts containing locational taxonomy. The lack of consensus among the scientific community should be noted regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of using locational taxonomy [15, 45] .",

Second, private sources of media such as chat rooms and servers are not within the scope of the algorithm, and thus, the algorithm is limited to public communication media.

Passive sharing may cause issues in the determination of whether a piece of content meets a popularity threshold.

Although this has happened, their hopeful unity to the political schism has not. The Plebeian Algorithm is not a vaccine for an infodemic; however, it is a treatment to help curb and prevent the virus of misinformation from continuing to spread and grow out of control. This has the critical side-effect of putting power back in the hands of the people and removing the potential domination of a single entity (eg, a social media company) who may be swayed by external forces when deciding if content should be removed. All in all, it is recommended that social media executives consider the implementation of a variation of the Plebeian Algorithm, explicitly modified to adapt to the specifics of the platform. This will help curb misinformation both with regard to the COVID-19 infodemic and to prevent future infodemics.",
