In the HHC context, one main challenge faced by service-sharing platforms is the matching of demand with supply, while considering the heterogeneity of care requests and service providers. From a centralized perspective of service-sharing platforms regarding three stakeholders (i.e., platform, caregiver, and customer), different matching strategies are used, including the \"self-interested\", \"customerfirst\", \"hard-work-happy-life\", and \"social-welfare\" strategies. When addressing the matching problem at an operational level, the platforms must comply with various requirements and rules, including break requirements, temporal dependencies, and flexible service durations. In this study, mixed-integer linear programming models and a branch-and-price approach are designed to match demand with supply using different matching strategies while satisfying all of the requirements and rules. The effects of key factors on performance indicators (e.g., platform revenue, caregiver profit, and customer surplus) are examined, and the matching strategies are compared. The results indicate that the \"customer-first\" and \"self-interested\" strategies benefit more from flexible service durations, however they are more and less negatively affected by break requirements and temporal dependencies, respectively, as compared to the \"social-welfare\" and \"hard-work-happy-life\" strategies. A comparison between the \"social-welfare\" strategy and the other three strategies indicates that the former strategy is beneficial for all three stakeholders of the service-sharing platforms as well as the government. Another comparison between the service-sharing platforms and traditional HHC institutions indicates the sharing economy has a positive impact on caregiver profit and customer surplus.",

HHC is becoming an indispensable and integral part of healthcare systems because of the availability of technologybased health-care products for home-centered disease management, such as smart homes and home health-monitoring technologies (Liu et al., 2016) . HHC offers various short-or long-term services intended to meet the health-or personal-care needs of elderly individuals, such as medical and paramedical services, rehabilitation services, social services, psychological support, and other personalcare services. These services enable the elderly to live as independently and safely as possible when they can no longer perform daily activities by themselves. However, the provision of HHC services requires large amounts of resources.",

            "text": "To enable HHC service delivery, traditional institutions must guarantee a certain level of service at a low cost, caregivers require a fair workload assignment, and the elderly demand high-quality care (Carello et al., 2018) . The daily delivery procedure must satisfy all operational rules and requirements. Caregivers can reduce transit time by traveling directly between their homes and the locations of their activities, and can be assigned to perform tasks within their available time windows. However, although a break requirement is common in real-life care applications, it is difficult to formulate and address this requirement in models and algorithms (Liu et al., 2017) . Each task is performed once or cancelled. Tasks are allocated based on firm time windows, service-duration ranges, caregiver preferences, and qualification requirements. A flexible service duration enables tasks to be completed more quickly and, ultimately, more tasks to be scheduled (Mosquera et al., 2019). However, this attribute also increases the level of difficulty when attempting to address it in an exact algorithm. Furthermore, temporal dependency among tasks occurs in real-life applications of HHC delivery procedures, and must be considered when designing models and algorithms (Rasmussen et al., 2012) . To meet increasing HHC demands, particularly in the context of fewer available resources, daily operational delivery activities in traditional HHC institutions are typically optimized with three main objectives, namely the minimization of travel-related costs (Liu et al., 2017), a guaranteed workload balance for caregivers (Cappanera and Scutell\u00e0, 2015) , and the maximization of customer satisfaction in terms of their preferences (Braekers et al., 2016) .",

Value is derived from the fact that many resources are acquired to satisfy the HHC demand but are otherwise poorly utilized due to factors such as high risks, low trust levels, and difficulty with access. Thus, service-sharing enable the use of these resources by the application of exciting new technologies such as blockchain (Sun et al., 2016) and applications (apps). Blockchain has been shown to provide useful support for various platform operations, as exemplified by Everledger, Tripago, Fmeimei, and Walmart-IBM blockchains . Apps take the form of innovative technologies, including Internet of Things, big data analytics, blockchain, and the cloud, and enable single click mobile device-based access to sharing services. App-based service-sharing platforms cover various sectors that support the delivery of HHC services to the elderly. For example, time banks provide escort services, holiday celebration services, and psychological support (Nansha Timebank in Guangzhou, China), Amazon Home Services and TaskRabbit provide home-care and personal-care services, and Meituan and Ele.me provide meal services and Homeincare and AliHealth provide medical and rehabilitation services.",

            "text": "Although the form of service organization is shifting from traditional HHC institutions to service-sharing platforms, the ability to match demand with supply remains a key problem in the HHC service-delivery process. Different service-sharing platforms may have different aims, and thus use different matching strategies. Here, four matching strategies that are defined according to the aims of three stakeholders and used in practice are summarized: the \"self-interested\", \"customer-first\", \"hard-work-happy-life\", and \"social-welfare\" strategies. For example, time banks often aim to maximize either the proportion of matched tasks or social welfare. The former aim can be described as a \"self-interested\" strategy, while the latter can be described as a \"social-welfare\" strategy. Many time banks are nonprofit platforms that target socially and economically marginalized populations, such as the young, elderly, poor, or disabled. Caregivers associated with these time banks are often volunteers, who receive rewards for their efforts. For-profit platforms may use matching procedures that can maximize the number of matched demands (i.e., a \"self-interested\" strategy), social welfare (i.e., a \"social-welfare\" strategy), the preferences of consumers (i.e., a \"customer-first\" strategy), or the profit of caregivers (i.e., a \"hard-workhappy-life\" strategy). For example, a for-profit platform such as TaskRabbit offers customers two options to hire a service provider on a future date, based on two typical matching models: the distribution-matching model and the assignment-matching model (Li et al., 2020) . In the distribution-matching model, the service platform distributes the demand requests to all service providers, who then decide whether to respond to the request. This type of platform cannot guarantee matching efficiency in terms of platform revenue, service-provider profit, or customer surplus (Li et al., 2020) . Therefore, this study focuses on the assignment-matching model, in which the service platform matches the demand requests with service providers based on certain objectives related to revenue and service quality. This study focuses specifically on platforms that assign tasks to caregivers using well-designed matching criteria.",

Consequently, there is a requirement to meet in time and place, which implies that temporal and spatial aspects are key factors in service-sharing platforms. Despite increasing media attention, care-service sharing through peer-to-peer platforms is not yet a widespread practice. A key reason for this is that the matching and coordination of peer providers and consumers is challenging due to the heterogeneity of service requests and service providers. Therefore, it is important for peer-to-peer care-service sharing platforms to develop matching strategies that enable efficient management. This need raises several questions. First, how do the matching strategies affect performance indicators such as the platform revenue, customer surplus, and caregiver profit when addressing daily care demands and supply in the HHC context? Second, can peer-to-peer service-sharing platforms outperform traditional HHC institutions in terms of these three performance indicators? Third, how do operational rules such as flexible service durations, break requirements, and temporal dependencies among tasks affect these three performance indicators, when using different matching strategies? To answer these questions, models with different matching strategies have been developed to match the daily demands with supplies, and have been validated using instances provided online. The effects of various key factors have also been examined.",

A comparison of the four matching strategies concludes that the \"social-welfare\" strategy is beneficial for all three stakeholders involved in the service-sharing platform and for the government. This strategy can maximize social welfare by sacrificing some of the profit of each stakeholder, and these sacrifices can be recompensed by subsidies from the government via tax decreases or other benefits (e.g., coupons).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper in this field to simultaneously address attributes such as flexible service durations, break requirements, and temporal dependencies. These three important attributes are common in the context of HHC but are not considered simultaneously in the literature, due to the difficulty and complexity of modeling and designing algorithms. This study proposes the use of multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming models to formulate matching strategies that maximize the profits of the three stakeholders, while also considering factors such as time windows, flexible service durations, temporal dependencies, break requirements, qualifications, and preferences. A branch-and-price (B&P) approach is additionally designed to address these attributes. In the pulse algorithm for sub-pricing problem with break requirements and flexible service durations, pulses are derived with consideration of break activity and flexible service duration, rollback with break rules, and the dominance rules of partial paths. Three branching strategies, namely branching on the time window, on uncovered tasks, and on assignment variables, are developed to ensure the constraints of temporal dependency and integrity of solutions are met. The effects of these key factors on the above-identified performance indicators (i.e., platform revenue, caregiver profit, and customer surplus) are also examined when using different matching strategies. The results indicate that the \"customer-first\" and \"self-interested\" strategies benefit more from flexible service durations, however they are more and less negatively affected by break requirements and temporal dependencies, respectively, as compared to the \"social-welfare\" and \"hard-work-happy-life\" strategies.",

            "text": "Several platform types are used in the service-sharing economy (see Table 1 ), as described and inspired by Taylor (2018) . Nonprofit service-sharing is rooted in time banks, which allow users to provide and request services in exchange for time currency. Time banking highlights the principle of equal contribution, wherein both high-skill and low-skill offerings by providers are treated equally, using time spent as the benchmark (Collom and Lasker, 2016) . This principle differs from that used by for-profit servicesharing platforms. The categories of services that are most frequently exchanged in time banks in the US are \"construction, installation, maintenance, and repair\", \"transportation and moving\", \"tutoring, consultation, and personal services\", and \"cleaning, light tasks, and errands\" (Collom and Lasker, 2016) . Thus, time banks provide many types of services to participants and require service providers with Monetized service-sharing platforms, such as on-demand service platforms, freelancing platforms, and scheduled service platforms, are exemplified by TaskRabbit, Upwork, and Zaarly. These on-demand service platforms differ from scheduled service platforms in several respects. Particularly, their offering to delay-sensitive customers exhibits homogeneity, and the platforms determine prices based on different concerns. Taylor (2018) examines the effects of two defining features of an on-demand service platform-delay sensitivity and agent independence-on the platform's optimal per-service price and wage. Choi et al. (2020) focus on uncovering the effects of risk attitudes of customers on the optimal service-pricing decisions, consumer surplus, and expected profits and profit risks of the platform. Liu et al. (2019) analyze the effects of the threshold participating quantity, value-added-service, and matching ability of the provider on the pricing decisions of service platforms. All of these researchers ignore how the platform determines the matching ability and the related mechanisms. Boysen et al. (2019) use a classification scheme to describe any matching problem in service-sharing platforms by summarizing the heterogeneity of supply and demand with many attributes, such as resource type, preference, and individual sharing duration. When heterogeneity is considered, a key role of a platform such as a time bank, freelancing platform (Moreno and Terwiesch, 2014) , or scheduled-service platform is to adequately match customers with service providers, in terms of the customer's needs and the service providers' capabilities. In the literature, matching-mechanism design is mostly strategic and is described at a tactical level. A distinct set of demand or supply characteristics is integrated as a \"type\", which can be differentiated horizontally or vertically (Hu and Zhou, 2018) . The matching rewards differ according to this differentiation. For example, under horizontal differentiation, the matching reward between a demand type and a supply type is determined by their idiosyncratic \"taste\" for each other. Under vertical differentiation, a particular type (e.g., a high-quality provider) is always considered superior to a different type (e.g., a low-quality provider) when generating matching rewards (Tunc et al., 2019) . Three degrees of platform involvement, namely no-intervention, operational efficiency, and enabling communication, have been distinguished and characterized using various game-theoretic queuing models based on a service marketplace where the objective of both the individual customers and service providers is to maximize their own utility (Allon et al., 2012) . When focusing on the design of a matching strategy at an operational level, Li et al. (2020) have formulated matching and pricing strategies using a freight O2O platform, which charges a delivery price depending on the total route distance. Their strategies use mixed-integer nonlinear programming based on vehicle routing and pricing-process selection to assign orders effectively and efficiently to drivers, thereby optimizing the platform revenue. In contrast to the literature, this study focuses on the design of matching strategies at an operational level without considering pricing. Rather, it considers a set of characteristics of demand and supply, such as the time window, the temporal dependency of demand, break requirements, the available working-time window, and the skills of the supplier.",

Hiermann et al. (2015) consider a multimodal transportation network that may involve car travel, walking, and public transportation. Caregivers start and finish their activities at their own homes (i.e., multidepots) (Bard et al., 2014; Fathollahi-Fard et al., 2020; . Each task is necessarily performed for a certain duration, which can be requested using either a fixed constant (Cappanera et al., 2018; Gomes and Ramos, 2019; Liu et al., 2017; Maya Duque et al., 2015) or a flexible range (Mosquera et al., 2019) . Yuan et al. (2018) and Shi et al. (2018) assume that the service duration is a random variable with known probability distributions, while Shi et al. (2019) describe an uncertainty set for the service duration. Mosquera et al. (2019) define the lower and upper bound of the duration (p \u2212 t ,p + t ) for each visit t, such that a visit always has a minimum and maximum duration of p \u2212 t and p + t time units, respectively. A task starts within a time window [t \u2212 , t + ], which is considered as either a soft (Gamst and Jensen, 2012; Maya Duque et al., 2015) or hard constraint (Grenouilleau et al., 2019; Mosquera et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2018) . When caregivers work as full-time employees at traditional institutions, a lunch break is generally necessary and can happen during a time window [e B , l B ] with a regular duration \u03c4 (Gomes and Ramos, 2019; Liu et al., 2017) . A caregiver can also take a break if the maximum consecutive working time exceeds a threshold during the workday (Rest and Hirsch, 2016; Trautsamwieser and Hirsch, 2014) . Overtime should be minimized to mitigate burnout syndrome in caregivers who work as employees at traditional institutions, and to reduce the overtime costs at these institutions (Bard et al., 2014; Braekers et al., 2016; Nickel et al., 2012; Rest and Hirsch, 2016) .",

This is also an important goal of \"self-interested\" platforms, as their revenues are derived from matched tasks. These matched tasks may have different priorities (Cinar et al., 2019; M. Lin et al., 2016) . Each caregiver has a predefined qualification that is a function of the caregiver, sex constraints, or language skills (Braekers et al., 2016; Cappanera and Scutell\u00e0, 2015; Cappanera et al., 2018; Eveborn et al., 2009; Grenouilleau et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2018; Maya Duque et al., 2015; Mosquera et al., 2019; Nickel et al., 2012; Rest and Hirsch, 2016; Yal\u00e7\u0131ndag et al., 2016) . The caregiver's qualification must match the required qualification for each task that the caregiver is required to perform (Braekers et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2018; Maya Duque et al., 2015; Mosquera et al., 2019) . Customers can indicate their preferences regarding caregivers based on the information posted on platforms. The indication of a caregiver as preferred, moderately preferred, or not preferred for a task results in different penalties (e.g., 0, 1, 2) when this caregiver is assigned to the task (Braekers et al., 2016) . Temporal dependency (Frifita and Masmoudi, 2020; Rasmussen et al., 2012) may exist among tasks requested by the same customer. Dohn et al. (2011) describe five types of temporal dependencies between two different visits/customers, including synchronization (Bachouch et al., 2011; En-nahli et al., 2016; Redjem and Marcon, 2016) , precedence (minimum/maximum difference, and minimum plus maximum difference) (Mankowska et al., 2014; Rasmussen et al., 2012; Redjem and Marcon, 2016) , and overlap (Kergosien et al., 2009) .",

According to a summary by Fikar and Hirsch (2017) , maximizing revenue for traditional institutions means minimizing costs associated with travel, overtime, and the number of unscheduled tasks. The customer surplus and caregiver profit derive from the preferences of both stakeholders and fairness. Few studies consider a single objective such as fairness (Cappanera and Scutell\u00e0, 2015; Cappanera et al., 2018) or cost control (Yal\u00e7\u0131ndag et al., 2016) . Rather, most studies implement multiple objectives with weighted objective functions (Grenouilleau et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017; Rest and Hirsch, 2016; Trautsamwieser and Hirsch, 2014; Yuan et al., 2018) . Only a few studies have addressed multi-objective optimization using either a lexicographic approach (Maya Duque et al., 2015; Mosquera et al., 2019; Gomes and Ramos, 2019) or a Pareto-related approach (Braekers et al., 2016) .",

Caregivers are employees at traditional institutions but are independent contractors on service-sharing platforms (Taylor, 2018) . Overtime is meaningless for caregivers on service-sharing platforms, as they have the right to decide whether to take a break during their daily delivery procedure. For example, a caregiver may always prefer to work when the average income is higher than the average cost. Traditional institutions and service-sharing platforms also differ in terms of their objectives. In the business model used by service-sharing platforms, revenue is produced from the average value of matched tasks, customer surplus typically refers to the ability to satisfy customers' preferences for caregivers, and caregiver profit is mainly derived from the difference between a caregiver's income (related to his/her service load) and costs (related to his/her travel load). Different aims lead to different matching strategies being used (e.g., \"self-interested\", \"socialwelfare\", \"customer-first\", and \"hard-work-happy-life\"), and hence to different concerns regarding objectives. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has focused on the problem of matching from the perspective of the daily scheduling and routing of caregivers on service platforms, proposed matching strategies for such platforms, and discussed the effects of these strategies on the profits of the three parties connected to the platforms.

The travel cost and travel time differ among different transportation modes. In the business model of a peer-topeer service-sharing platform, a break requirement for caregivers who work as independent contractors is not mandatory, and it therefore depends on the transportation mode. That is, a break is necessary when a caregiver drives by himself/herself. In contrast, he/ she can rest while traveling by public transportation (e.g., bus, subway) or via a shared-mobility tool (e.g., DiDi, Uber). Therefore, it is assumed that he/she does not take a break when using public transportation or a shared-mobility tool, which is represented by a parameter M c value equal to 0 in Constraint (10). Although there is no overtime cost associated with caregivers on service-sharing platforms, they may choose to work harder to increase their earnings. Therefore, the operational rules/constraints governing breaks and overtime on service-sharing platforms differ from those in traditional HHC institutions, where a lunch break is a mandatory type of employee benefit for full-time caregivers, and where a bonus may be given to caregivers who work overtime to finish their daily tasks.",

Therefore, the different levels of importance of the objectives lead to different optimal matches, which are summarized as different matching strategies. For service-sharing platforms, each matching strategy represents a lexicographic rule regarding the three types of objectives, within which a multi-level hierarchy reflects the importance of each objective. Level 1 refers to the most important objective function on a service-sharing platform. This study defines and investigates the following four matching strategies, which differ from each other according to the objective(s) of Level 1, as summarized in Table 3 . The first matching strategy, the \"self-interested\" strategy, seeks first to maximize the platform revenue, and then maximizes the caregiver profit and the customer surplus. Objective (27) is thus the most important objective (Level 1), while Objectives (28) and (29) are classified as Level 2. The second matching strategy, the \"customer-first\" strategy, first maximizes the customer surplus [Objective (29): Level 1], and then maximizes the platform revenue and the caregiver profit [Objectives (27) and (28): Level 2]. Customers of a platform that uses this matching strategy may be willing to pay higher prices for their preferred caregivers when their surplus is maximized. The third matching strategy, the \"hard-work-happy-life\" strategy, first maximizes the caregiver profit [Objective (28): Level 1], and then maximizes the platform revenue and the customer surplus [Objectives (27) and (29): Level 2]. This strategy aims to attract more caregivers who will remain loyal to the platform. The fourth matching strategy, the \"social-welfare\" strategy, places equal importance on maximizing the platform revenue, caregiver profit, and customer surplus.",

(2017) (refer Fig. 2) , a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition is applied to naturally decompose the matching problem into a set-partitioning problem with side constraints (i.e., the master problem) and a pricing sub-problem. In the master problem, one schedule for each caregiver is chosen from a large set of feasible schedules. The sub-problem generates these feasible schedules, which are subsequently combined feasibly in the master problem. Because the master problem contains exponential variables (i.e., all possible feasible routes/schedules for each caregiver), the restricted master problem (RMP), which consists of a subset of decision variables (i.e., feasible routes presented to caregivers) and constraints (columns), is introduced to replace the master problem. By taking the values of the dual variables of the RMP, the pricing sub-problem is solved to identify columns with negative reduced costs for a minimization problem. If such a column exists, it is then added to the RMP. This column generation procedure is repeated until no new column can be identified. The B&P approach initializes a root node of the search tree by adding a set of initial columns to the RMP. Then, the RMP is solved in child node by column generation, using the set of feasible columns inherited from the parent node. If the optimal solution of the RMP violates the precedence or/and integrality constraints, the branching strategies are adopted to generate new child nodes. Otherwise, the best choice between this feasible solution and the existing upper bound is selected as the new upper bound, and is used to guide a pruning operation. These child nodes are then added to the search tree. The search process ceases when all of the nodes in the tree have been explored using a priority-queue strategy, in which the node with the smallest lower bound is selected for processing.",

The bound stage, which identifies the lower bounds of the reduced cost according to the amount of time consumed, is similar to that in the original algorithm. The pulse algorithm for the ESPPRC with flexible service durations and break requirements comprises two stages. The first is a bound stage that identifies the lower bounds according to a given amount of time consumed, and the second is a recursive exploration stage that identifies an optimal solution. The recursive exploration is triggered by sending a pulse that initiates at the start depot and propagates throughout the outgoing arc of each visited vertex. At each vertex, different pruning strategies (e.g., an infeasibility pruning strategy, a bound pruning strategy, and a rollback pruning strategy) attempt to stop the pulse propagation by using various forms of information, such as the partial path P with the service duration S , the cumulative reduced cost r(P ), the cumulative time consumption t(P ), and the break-taking statuses b a and b b . Any pulse that initiates at the start depot and reaches the end depot contains all of the information pertaining to a feasible path.

(2016) . The infeasibility pruning strategy uses time-window and cycle constraints, and determines whether a cycle is created or a time window is violated whenever a partial path reaches a vertex. If any of these events occur, the partial path will be pruned safely because of its infeasibility. The bound-pruning strategy uses the bounds that store the minimum reduced cost achieved by any partial path that reaches vertex v i at a given value of the consumed resource t(P ). The bounds are calculated by Algorithm 4, where t represents the upper time-window of the end depot and \u0394 represents a nonnegative time-step (e. g., four-time units). Every optimal solution identified using Lines 5-14 acts as a lower bound on the minimum reduced cost that can be achieved by any partial path that reaches vertex v i , given a time consumption t(P ). By using the previously computed bounds, the algorithm continues in a backward mode by repeating the same procedure until a given time-limit is reached, as shown in Lines 1-3. The bound-pruning function checkBounds in Line 2 of Algorithm 3 prunes a partial path if r(P ) + r (v i , t(P ) ) \u2264 r, where r is a primal upper bound that is constantly updated with the value of the best solution identified at any time during the exploration. , upper bound matrix The main difference is attributable to the rollback pruning, compared to the pruning strategy by Lozano et al.

Let partial path P sj = P si \u222a {v k } \u222a {v j }, which reaches node v j through v k , and P ' sj = P si \u222a {v j } represent an alternative partial path to node v j that does not visit node v k .

Each x-axis in Fig. 4 presents the respective values of the arduousness levels (1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60). In Fig. 4, Sub-figure (a) shows that \u03b1 j has a limited effect on the platform revenue when the \"self-interested\" and \"customer-first\" strategies are used, whereas \u03b1 j has a noticeable effect on the platform revenue when the \"hard-work-happy-life\" and \"social-welfare\" strategies are used. In particular, the \"hard-work-happy-life\" strategy significantly improves the platform revenue when \u03b1 j increases from 1 to 5, and slightly improves the revenue when \u03b1 j increases from 5 to 60. The caregiver profit increases with increasing \u03b1 j for all matching strategies, as indicated in Sub-figure (b) of Fig. 4 . As \u03b1 j increases, the customer surplus increases when the \"hard-work-happy-life\" strategy is used but decreases when the \"self-interested\" and \"socialwelfare\" strategies are used, as indicated in Sub-figure (c) of Fig. 4 . Briefly, the use of the \"self-interested\" strategy maintains the platform revenue and increases the caregiver profit as the arduousness level increases, but decreases the customer surplus. In other words, proper arduousness level of service can balance caregiver profit and customer surplus without harms to platform revenue when using the \"self-interested\" strategy. When the \"customer-first\" strategy is used, only the caregiver profit increases as the arduousness level increases, and the platform revenue and customer surplus are maintained. When the \"hard-work-happy-life\" strategy is used, the platform revenue, caregiver profit, and customer surplus all increase according to different trends as the arduousness level increases. When the \"social welfare\" strategy is used, an increasing arduousness level has a limited effect on the platform revenue (similar to that of the \"self-interested\" strategy), while increasing the caregiver profit and decreasing the customer surplus. Thus, the arduousness level should be tuned accordingly when using different strategies. Here, \u03b1 j is set to 10 for all tasks, to accommodate trade-offs among the platform revenue, caregiver profit, and customer surplus.",

This gap may be attributable to the use of a solution pool that is initialized for the root node of the search tree in the proposed B&P algorithm, which is not ideal for optimal solutions. Specifically, the caregiver profit as calculated by CPLEX is greater than the profit calculated using our B&P algorithm, mainly because the latter uses limited choices for the flexible service duration of each task [e.g., (0.8d + j , 0.9d + j , d + j )] to reduce the exploration time in sub-problems, and a different range [0.8d + j , d + j ] for the optimizer. However, both algorithms achieve equally good platform revenues in 75% of instances. In contrast, the B&P algorithm achieves not worse customer surplus than the CPLEX in 75% of instances. In terms of computational time, the B&P algorithm identifies good solutions more quickly than the CPLEX when the size of the instances increases.

The caregiver profit is also lower in the traditional HHC institutions than on the service-sharing platforms, regardless of the matching strategy, suggesting that a higher proportion of the workloads of caregivers from Fig. 9 . Effect of the matching strategy on caregiver profit. Fig. 10 . Effect of the matching strategy on customer surplus. the service-sharing platforms is directed towards serving customers and performing tasks. The traditional HHC institutions pay more attention to minimizing travel and overtime costs than to the utilization of the caregiver workload in customer service. Fig. 10 demonstrates that the \"customer-first\" strategy yields the highest customer surplus among all tested instances. The \"socialwelfare\" and \"self-interested\" strategies also yield higher customer surpluses than the \"hard-work-happy-life\" strategy. This outcome may be attributed to the focus of the \"hard-work-happy-life\" strategy on maximizing the service load while minimizing the travel load, rather than on maximizing the number of matched tasks that may contribute to an increase in the customer surplus. When compared to the traditional HHC institutions, the service-sharing platforms that apply appropriate matching strategies (except the \"hard-workhappy-life\" strategy) achieve higher customer surplus levels. In contrast, traditional HHC institutions achieve higher customer surplus levels than service-sharing platforms that use the \"hard-work-happy-life\" strategy in most instances (21/30), possibly because this strategy also performs worse than the \"self-interested\" strategy. Table 8 summarizes the averages of performance indicators obtained for the traditional HHC institutions and the service-sharing platforms using different matching strategies. First, we compare the performances of the traditional HHC institutions and servicesharing platforms using the \"self-interested\" strategy, because both regard the revenue as the most important objective. Table 8 demonstrates that service-sharing platforms using the \"self-interested\" strategy and traditional HHC institutions earn equivalent revenues, although the former is also associated with greater caregiver profits and customer surpluses. Possibly, the platforms and institutions have different objectives. For example, for Level 2 objectives, HHC institutions aim to minimize travel and overtime costs, whereas service-sharing platforms aim to minimize the average caregiver profit and customer surplus directly.",

Therefore, we compare this strategy to the \"self-interested\", \"customer-first\", and \"hard-work-happy-life\" strategies to identify the gap between the best profit and a balanced profit for each stakeholder. First, we compare the \"social-welfare\" and \"self-interested\" strategies. When using the former, the platform revenue is 0.74% lower and the caregiver profit and customer surplus are 2.64% and 0.72% higher, respectively, than those obtained when using the latter strategy. Second, we compare the \"socialwelfare\" and \"customer-first\" strategies. When using the former, the customer surplus is 19.69% lower and the caregiver profit is 10.87% higher than those obtained when using the latter strategy. Finally, we compare the \"social-welfare\" and the \"hard-work-happylife\" strategies. When using the former, the caregiver profit is 0.27% lower and the customer surplus and platform revenue are 18.03% and 0.85% higher, respectively, than those obtained when using the latter. In conclusion, the \"social-welfare\" strategy must sacrifice a small amount of each stakeholder's profit to achieve a balanced maximum level of social welfare. In fact, it is necessary to sacrifice the customer surplus (although as high as 19.69%) in the supply side on the HHC service market so far. The government may provide funding to the stakeholders by cutting taxes or offering coupons. As service-sharing platforms that provide HHC services (e.g., many time banks) target socially and economically marginalized populations (e.g., the young, elderly, poor, or disabled), the maximization of social welfare helps to ensure the efficient long-term operation of these platforms. Therefore, the \"social-welfare\" strategy is beneficial for scheduled service-sharing platforms, caregivers, and customers in the HHC context. This strategy is also a goal of government funding for HHC services and sets the standards for service delivery.",

            "text": "This study aims to evaluate the matching of daily demands and supply in the context of HHC (HHCRSP) delivered via peer-to-peer service-sharing platforms. Four matching strategies are modeled and compared in terms of platform revenue, customer surplus, and caregiver profit. A B&P approach is designed to solve the optimal matching problem. A pulse algorithm is devised to include break rules, rollback with break rules, and dominance rules of partial paths, for pricing sub-problems that considers the features of break requirements and flexible service durations. Three branching strategies, namely branching on the time-window, on uncovered tasks, and on the assignment variables, are developed to ensure the temporal dependency constraints and solution integrity. Additionally, the effects of several key factors are examined, namely the arduousness level of the task, the flexible service duration of the task, the break requirement for the caregiver, and the temporal dependency among tasks. Four multi-objective, mixed-integer linear programming models with four matching strategies (\"self-interested\", \"customer-first\", \"hard-work-happy-life\", and \"social-welfare\") are constructed for the HHCRSP of peer-to-peer service-sharing platforms, while considering several key rules, such as flexible service durations, break requirements, and temporal dependencies. The results obtained by the models in analyses of instances posted online indicate that flexible service duration increases the platform revenue, caregiver profit, and customer surplus to varying degrees when using different matching strategies. However, the break requirement and temporal dependency have various negative effects on the performance indicators, depending on the matching strategies. More specifically, the \"customer-first\" and \"self-interested\" strategies benefit more from flexible service duration, but are harmed to a greater extent by break requirement and to a lesser extent by temporal dependency, compared to the \"social-welfare\" and \"hard-workhappy-life\" strategies. The comparison between the service-sharing platforms and traditional HHC institutions confirms the positive effect of the sharing economy on profits of three stakeholders. One-to-one comparisons between the \"social-welfare\" strategy and the other strategies indicate that the former can achieve maximum social welfare by sacrificing a small amount of the profit of each stakeholder, and that these sacrifices can be replaced by government subsidies, such as tax cuts or coupons. Thus, in the context of a service-sharing platform, a \"social-welfare\" strategy is beneficial for all three stakeholders and the government.",

The B&P algorithm is effective but cannot outperform CPLEX in terms of solution quality. A long time is required to achieve optimal matching solutions when large numbers of customers and caregivers are available. Therefore, future aims include the improvement of the B&P algorithms and the exploration of better methods that can effectively and efficiently solve the problem of matching daily demands with supply on a large scale and with reference to additional literature. Finally, the matching procedure does not consider pricing issues. In practice, however, the task price or caregiver's hourly rate on a service-sharing platform is dynamic and depends on the demand and supply. Therefore, another future aim is to expand the matching strategies to accommodate surge pricing.
