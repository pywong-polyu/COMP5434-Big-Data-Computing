Months after the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerging research highlights the essential role of interventions to improve public confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine. To improve vaccine confidence, we designed three short, animated videos employing three research-informed pedagogical strategies. These can be distributed globally through social media platforms, because of their wordless and culturally accessible design. However, the effectiveness of short, animated storytelling videos, deploying various pedagogic strategies, needs to be explored across different global regions.",

The WHO has dubbed vaccine hesitancy one of the greatest threats to global health [3] , yet we are lacking interventions that effectively promote vaccine confidence in ways that are accessible and globally scalable. Many existing interventions have focused on providing information in the form of scientific data, using a didactic approach. This strategy has proven ineffective for key target audiences [4] . Designing effective interventions for a broad range of target audiences has become even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic as misinformation has spread rapidly around the world. Negative claims about vaccines often appeal to the emotions of the target audiences, eliciting vaccine doubt and hesitancy. This observation-that emotion-focused messages resonate and affect health behaviors [4, 5] -can also potentially be used to the advantage of health communicators. Research suggests that activating positive emotions, like hope and altruism, can actually bolster vaccine education interventions [5] .",
