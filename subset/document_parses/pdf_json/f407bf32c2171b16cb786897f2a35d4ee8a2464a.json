            "text": "The COVID-19 respiratory disease is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which uses the enzyme ACE2 to entry human cells. This disease is characterized by important damages at multi-organ level, partially due to the abundant expression of ACE2 in practically all human tissues. However, not every organ in which ACE2 is abundant is affected by SARS CoV-2, which suggests the existence of other multi-organ routes for transmitting the perturbations produced by the virus. We consider here diffusive processes through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 as such alternative route. We found a subdiffusive regime that allows the propagation of virus perturbations through the PPI network at a significant rate. By following the main subdiffusive routes across the PPI network we identify proteins mainly expressed in the heart, cerebral cortex, thymus, testis, lymph node, kidney, among others of the organs reported to be affected by COVID-19.",

The new coronavirus disease is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations (4 , 5 ) , with an important implication of multi-organ and systemic dysfunctions (6 , 7 ) , which include heart failure, renal failure, liver damage, shock and multiorgan failure. The new coronavirus shares about 82% of its genome with the one which produced the 2003 outbreak (SARS CoV) (8 ) . Both coronaviruses share the same cellular receptor, which is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (8 , 9 , 10 ) . ACE2 receptors are enriched in several tissues across the organs, such as in alveolar epithelial type II cells of lung tissues, in the heart, endothelium, kidneys and intestines. Therefore, ACE2 has been hypothesized as a potential cause of the major complications of the COVID-19 (11 , 12 ) .",

            "text": "Recently Gordon et al. (14 ) identified human proteins that interact physically with those of the SARS CoV-2 forming a high confidence SARS-CoV-2human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) system. Using this information Gysi et al. (15 ) discovered that 208 of the human proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 forms a connected component inside the human PPI network. That is, these 208 are not randomly distributed across the human proteome but they are closely interconnected by short routes that allow moving from one to another in just a few steps. These interdependencies of protein-protein interactions are known to enable that perturbations on one interaction propagates across the network and affect other interactions (16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ) . In fact, it has been signified that diseases are a consequence of such perturbation propagation (20 , 21 , 22 ) . It has been stressed that the protein-protein interaction process requires diffusion in their initial stages (23 ) . The diffusive processes occur when proteins, possibly guided by electrostatic interactions, need to encounter each other many times before forming an intermediate (24 ) . Not surprisingly, diffusive processes have guided several biologically oriented searches in PPI networks (25 , 26 ) . Therefore, we assume here that perturbations produced by SARS CoV-2 proteins on human PPI network are propagated by means of diffusive processes. However, due to the crowded nature of the intra-cell space and the presence in it of spatial barriers, subdiffusive processes more than normal diffusion are expected for these protein-protein encounters (27 , 28 , 29 ) . This creates another difficulty, as remarked by Batada et al. (23 ) , which is that such (sub)diffusive processes along are not sufficient for carrying out cellular processes at a significant rate in cells.",

The goal is to model the propagation of the perturbations produced by the interactions of human proteins with those of SARS CoV-2 through the whole PPI. The subdiffusive process emerging from the application of this model to the SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs has a very small rate of convergence to the steady state. However, this process produces dramatic increment of the probability that certain proteins are perturbed at very short times. This kind of shock wave effect of the transmission of perturbations occurs at much earlier times in the subdiffusive regime than at the normal diffusion one. Therefore, we propose here a switch and restart process in which a subdiffusive process starts at a given protein of the PPI, perturbs a few others, which then become the starting point of a new subdiffusive processm and so on. Using this approach we then analyze how the initial interaction of the SARS CoV-2 Spike protein with a human protein propagates across the whole network. We discover some potential routes of propagation of these perturbations from proteins mainly expressed in the lungs to proteins mainly expressed in other different tissues, such as the heart, cerebral cortex, thymus, lymph node, testis, prostate, liver, small intestine, duodenum, kidney, among others.",

The second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of this network is very small, i.e., \u00b5 2 = 0.0647. Therefore, the rate of convergence to the steady state of the diffusion processes taking place on this PPI are very slow. We start by analyzing the effects of the fractional coefficient \u03b1 on these diffusive dynamics. We use the normal diffusion \u03b1 = 1 as the reference system. To analyze the effects of changing \u03b1 over the diffusive dynamics on the PPI network we consider the solution of the TFD equation for processes starting at a protein with a large degree, i.e., PRKACA, degree 14, and a protein with a low degree, i.e., MRPS5, degree 3. That is, the initial condition vector consists of a vector having one at the entry corresponding to either PRKACA or MRPS5 ans zeroes elsewhere. In Fig. 1 we display the changes of the probability with the shortest path distance from the protein where the process starts. This distance corresponds to the number of steps that the perturbation needs to traverse to visit other proteins. For \u03b1 = 1.0 the shape of the curves in Fig. 1 are the characteristic ones for the Gaussian decay of the probability with distance. However, for \u03b1 < 1 we observe that such decay differs from that typical shape showing a faster initial decay followed by a slower one. In order to observe this effect in a better way we zoomed the region of distances from 2 to 4 (see 1 (b) and (d)). As can be seen for distances below 3 the curve for \u03b1 = 1.0 is on top of those for \u03b1 < 1 indicating a slower decay of the probability. After this distance, there is an inversion and the normal diffusion occurs at much faster rate than the other two for the longer distances. This is a characteristic signature of subdiffusive processes, which starts at much faster rates than a normal diffusive process and then continue at much slower rates. Therefore, here we observe that the subdiffusive dynamics are much faster at earlier times of the process, which is when the perturbation occurs to close nearest neighbors to the initial point of perturbation.",

In Fig. 2 we illustrate these results for \u03b1 = 1.0 (a), \u03b1 = 0.75 (a), \u03b1 = 0.5 (c). As can be seen in the main plots of this Figure the rate of convergence of the processes to the steady state is much faster in the normal diffusion (a) than in the subdiffusive one (b) and (c). However, at very earlier times (see insets in Fig. 2 ) there is a shock wave increase of the perturbation at a set of nodes. Such kind of shock waves have been previously analyzed in other contexts as a way of propagating effects across PPI networks (17 ) . The remarkable finding here is however the fact that such shock wave occurs at much earlier times in the subdiffusive regimes than at the normal diffusion. That is, while for \u03b1 = 1.0 these perturbations occur at t \u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.3, for \u03b1 = 0.75 they occur at t \u2248 0.0 \u2212 0.2, and for \u03b1 = 0.5 at t \u2248 0.0 \u2212 0.1. Seeing this phenomenon in the light of what we have observed in the previous paragraph is not strange due to the observation that such processes go at much faster rate at earlier times, and at short distances, than the normal diffusion. In fact, this is a consequence of the existence of a positive scalar T for which E \u03b1,1 (\u2212\u03b3t \u03b1 ) decreases faster than exp (\u2212\u03b3t) for t \u2208 (0, T ) for \u03b3 \u2208 R + and \u03b1 \u2208 R + (see Theorem 4.1 in (32 )). Hereafter, we will consider the value of \u03b1 = 0.75 for our experiments due to the fact that it reveals a subdiffusive regime, but the shoch waves observed before are not occurring in an almost instantaneous way like when \u03b1 = 0.5 , which would be difficult from a biological perspective.",

First, the subdiffusive processes which are expected due to the crowded nature of the intra-cellular space, are very slow for carrying out cellular processes at a significant rate in cells. However, the perturbation shocks occurring at earlier times of these processes are significantly faster than in normal diffusion. To sort out these difficulties we propose a switching back and restart subdiffusive process occurring in the PPI network. That is, a subdiffusive process starts at a give protein, which is directly perturbed by a protein of SARS CoV-2. It produces a shock wave increase of the perturbation in close neighbors of that proteins. Then, a second subdiffusive process starts at these newly perturbed proteins, which will perturb their nearest neighbors. The process is repeated until the whole PPI network is perturbed. This kind of \"switch and restart processes\" have been proposed for engineering consensus protocols in multiagent systems (40 ) as a way to accelerate the algorithms using subdiffusive regimes.",

Therefore, we will consider here how a perturbation produced by the interaction of the virus S-protein with GOLGA7 is propagated through the whole PPI network of SARS CoV-2 targets. GOLGA7 has degree one in this network and its diffusion is mainly to close neighbors, namely to proteins separated by 2-3 edges. When starting the diffusion process at the protein GOLGA7 the main increase in the probability of perturbing another protein is reached for protein GOLGA3, which increases its probability up to 0.15 at t = 0.2, followed by PRKAR2A, with a small increase in its probability, 0.0081. Then, the process switch and restarts at GOLGA3, which mainly triggers the probability of the protein PRKAR2A-a major hub of the network. Once we start the process at PRKAR2A, practically the whole network is perturbed with probabilities larger than 0.1 for 19 proteins apart from GOLGA3. These proteins are, in decreasing order of their probability of being perturbed: AKAP8, PRKAR2B, CEP350, MIB1, CDK5RAP2, CEP135, AKAP9, CEP250, PCNT, CEP43, PDE4DIP, PRKACA, TUB6CP3, TUB6CP2, CEP68, CLIP4, CNTRL, PLEKHA5, and NINL.

We have calculated this number to be 3.6250, which is only slightly larger than the average (topological) path length, which is 3.5673. That is, in least than 4 steps the whole network of proteins is activated by a diffusive process starting at PRKAR2A. Also remarkable, the average shortest diffusive path length is almost identical to the shortest (topological) one. This means that this protein mainly uses shortest (topological) paths in perturbing other proteins in the PPI. In other words, it is highly efficient in conducting such perturbations.

We identified 38 proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 for which there are \"definitive\" or \"strong\" evidence of being involved in a human disease or syndrome (see Supplementary Table 1 ). These proteins participate in 70 different human diseases or syndromes as given in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 . We performed an analysis in which a diffusive process starts at any protein of the network and we calculated the average probability that all the proteins involved in human diseases are then perturbed. For instance, for a subdiffusive process starting at the protein ARF6 we summed the probabilities that the 38 proteins involved in diseases are perturbed at an early time of the process t = 0.2. Then, we obtain a global perturbation probability of 0.874. By repeating this process for every protein as an initiator we obtained the top disease activators. We have found that none of the 20 top activators is involved itself in any of the human diseases or syndromes considered here. They are, however, proteins which are important not because of their direct involvement in diseases or syndromes but because they propagate perturbations in a very effective way to those directly involved in such diseases/syndromes. Among the top activators we have found: ARF6, ECSIT, RETREG3, STOM, HDAC2, EXOSC5, THTPA, among others shown in Fig. 4 , where we illustrate the PPI network of the proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 remarking the top 20 disease activators.",

For instance, PKP2 is perturbed by 21 proteins in the lungs, which indicates that this protein, mainly expressed in the heart muscle, has a large chance of being perturbed by diffusive processes starting in proteins mainly located at the lungs. Protein PRIM2 is activated by 5 proteins in the lungs, but if all these proteins were acting at the same time, the probability that PRIM2 is perturbed will be very high, p tot \u2248 0.536. Finally, protein TLE5 is perturbed by 13 proteins in the lungs, which needs as average t mean \u2248 0.24 to perturb TLE5. These proteins do not form a connected component among them in the network. The average shortest diffusion path between them is 5.286 with a maximum shortest subdiffusion path of 10. As average they are almost equidistant from the rest of the proteins in the network as among themselves. That is, the average shortest subdiffusion path between these proteins expressed outside the lungs and the rest of the proteins in the network is 5.106. Therefore, these proteins can be reached from other proteins outside the lungs in no more than 6 steps in subdiffusive processes like the ones considered here.",

            "text": "Finally we study here how the diffusive process determines the paths that the perturbation follows when diffusing from a protein to another not directly connected to it. The most efficient way of propagating a perturbation between the nodes of a network is through the shortest (topological) paths that connect them. The problem for a (sub)diffusive perturbation propagating between the nodes of a network is that it does not have complete information about the topology of the network as to know its shortest (topological) paths. The network formed by the proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 is very sparse and this indeed facilitates that the perturbations occurs by following the shortest (topological) paths most of the time. Think for instance in a tree, which has the lowest possible edge density among all connected networks. In this case, the perturbation will always use the shortest (topological) paths connecting pairs of nodes. However, in the case of the PPI network studied here a normal diffusive process, i.e., \u03b1 = 1, not always uses the shortest (topological) paths. In this case, there are 1294 pairs of proteins for which the diffusive particle uses a shortest diffusive path which is one edge longer than the corresponding shortest (topological) path. This represents 6.11% of all total pairs of proteins that are interconnected by a path in the PPI network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2. However, when we have a subdiffusive process, i.e., \u03b1 = 0.75, this number is reduced to 437, which represents only 2.06% of all pairs of proteins. Therefore, the subdiffusion process studied here through the PPI network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 has an efficiency of 97.9% relative to a process that always uses the shortest (topological) paths in hopping between proteins. In Fig. 5 we illustrate the frequency with which proteins not in the shortest (topological) paths are perturbed as a consequence that they are in the shortest subdiffusive paths between other proteins. For instance, the following is a shortest diffusive path between the two endpoints: RHOA-PRKACA-PRKAR2A-CEP43-RAB7A-ATP6AP1. The corresponding shortest (topological) path is: RHOA-MARK2-AP2M1-RAB7A-ATP6AP1, which is one edge smaller. The proteins PRKACA, PRKAR2A and CEP43 are those in the diffusive path which are not in the topological one. Repeating this selection process for all the diffusive paths that differs from the topological ones we obtained the results illustrated in Fig. 5 . As can be seen there are 36 proteins visited by the shortest diffusive paths which are not visited by the corresponding topological ones. The average degree of these proteins is 7.28 and there is only a small positive trend between the degree of the proteins and the frequency with which they appear in these paths, e.g., the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.46.",

            "text": "We have presented a methodology that allow the study of diffusive processes in (PPI) networks varying from normal to subdiffusive regimes. Here we have studied the particular case in which the time-fractional diffusion equation produces a subdiffusive regime, with the use of \u03b1 = 3/4 in the network of human proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2. A characteristic feature of this PPI network is that the second smallest eigenvalue is very small, i.e., \u00b5 2 = 0.0647. As this eigenvalue determines the rate of convergence to the steady state, the subdiffusive process converges very slowly to that state. What it has been surprising is that even in these conditions of very small convergence to the steady state, there is a very early increase of the probability in those proteins closely connected to the initiator of the diffusive process. That is, in a subdiffusive process on a network, the time at which a perturbation is transmitted from the initiator to any of its nearest neighbors occurs at an earlier time than for the normal diffusion. This is a consequence of the fact that E \u03b1,1 (\u2212\u03b3t \u03b1 ) decreases very fast at small values of t \u03b1 , which implies that the perturbation occurring at a protein i at t = 0 is transmitted almost instantaneously to the proteins closely connected to i. This effect may be responsible for the explanation about why subdiffusive processes, which are so globally slow, can carry out cellular processes at a significant rate in cells. We have considered here a mechanism consisting in switching and restarting several times during the global cellular process. For instance, a subdiffusive process starting at the protein i perturbs its nearest neighbors at very early times, among which we can find the protein j. Then, a new subdiffusive process can be restarted again at the node j, and so on.",

For instance, the protein with the largest number of activators, PKP2, appears mainly in the heart muscle. It has been observed that the elevation of cardiac biomarkers is a prominent feature of COVID-19, which in general is associated with a worse prognosis (41 ) . Myocardial damage and heart failure are responsible for 40% of death in the Wuhan cohort (see references in (41 )). Although the exact mechanism involving the heart injury is not known the hypothesis of direct myocardial infection by SARS CoV-2 is a possibility, which act along or in combination with the increased cardiac stress due to respiratory failure and hypoxemia, and or with indirect injury from the systemic inflammatory response (41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ) . As can be seen in n Table 1 testis is the tissue where several of the proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 are mainly expressed, e.g., CEP43, TLE5, PRIM2, MIPOL1, REEP6, HOOK1, CENPF, TRIM59, and MARK1. Currently there is not conclusive evidence about testis damage by SARS CoV-2 (45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ) . However, the previous SARS CoV that appeared in 2003 and which shares 82% of proteins with the current one, produced testis damage and spermatogenesis, and it was concluded that orchitis was a complication of that previous SARS disease (45 ) . We also detect a few proteins mainly expressed in different brain tissues, such as CEP135, PRIM2, TRIM59, and MARK1. The implication of SARS CoV-2 and cerebrovascular diseases has been reported, including neurological manifestations as well as cerebrovascular disease, such as ischemic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and cerebral hemorrhage (49 , 50 , 51 ) .",

As much as 25% of acute kidney injury has been reported in clinical setting of SARS CoV-2 patients. One of the potential mechanisms for kidney damage is the organ crosstalk (52 ), as can be the mechanism of diffusion from proteins in the lungs to proteins in the urinary tract and kidney proposed here. A very interesting observation from Table 1 is the existence of several proteins expressed mainly in the thymus and T-cells, such as: TLE5, RETREG3, RBM41, CENPF, and TRIM59. It has been reported that many of the patients affected by SARS CoV-2 in Wuhan displayed significant decrease of T-cells (55 ) . Thymus is an organ which displays a progressive decline with age with reduction of the order of 3-5% a year until approximately 30-40 years of age and of about 1% per year after that age. Consequently, it was proposed that the role of thymus should be taken into account in order to explain why COVID-19 appears to be so mild in children (55 ) . The protein TLE5 is also expressed significantly in the lymph nodes. It was found by Feng et al. (56 ) that SARS CoV-2 induces lymph follicle depletion, splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions. The proteins HOOK1 and MIPOL1 are significantly expressed in the pituitary gland. There has been some evidence and concerns that COVID-19 may also damage the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis has been expressed by Pal (57 ) , which may be connected with the participation of the before mentioned proteins.",
