In communities that saw dramatic drops in case numbers, considerations for safe workplace re-entry were quickly adopted. Empirically derived models that minimized the risk of outbreaks in the workplace were lacking; therefore, states, communities, and businesses were forced to improvise to develop protocols that would allow a safe return to normal workforce productivity and function.",

We found that most employees (>90%) reported regularly washing their hands and wearing a face mask ( Table 2) . Social distancing was also reported by a high percentage outside of work (92%) ( Table 2 ). Our findings correlate with reports that student behaviors were most responsible for spread of SARS-CoV-2 on campuses, and with proper precautions, classrooms and other formal spaces were not hot spots for virus spread. 19 Importantly, these findings indicate that IHE can safely operate when employees responsibly practice public health guidelines for infection control both at and outside of work.",

Individuals who reported always social distancing, washing their hands and wearing a facemask at work and outside work also reported being most concerned with contracting COVID-19. These findings are similar to those found among a U.S. sample during the first week of the pandemic, where social distancing and handwashing were most predicted by perceived likelihood of becoming infected. 20 Interestingly, employees were more concerned about exposing others to COVID-19 than contracting COVID-19 (83% vs. 63%) and this concern translated to protective behaviors ( Figure 2 ). Such concern can be described as prosocial, or behavior that is helpful and intended to promote social acceptance. 21 A recent study conducted in Sweden found those scoring higher on a prosociality measure were more likely to follow physical distancing guidelines, stay at home when sick and buy face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. 22 There are multiple drivers of prosocial behavior including empathy, as well as building a sense of shared social identity which can be done through effective leadership. 23 Prosocial behavior has shown to lead to greater positive affect, meaningfulness, empathy and social connectedness 24 , which may then not only influence employees desire to protect their coworkers from an infectious virus (or any other threat), but also overall morale.

Although these results reflect the experience at one Institute of Higher Education, we believe these results could be generalized to other Institutes of Higher Education as well as other complex work environments. Future studies need to consider the important factor of practice of protective behaviors outside the workplace, as no matter how tightly social distancing, mask wearing and washing hands are regulated or expected at work, COVID-19 exposure occurring outside of work can enhance risk of spread in the workplace. Further, prosocial behavior appears to be a strong motivator to practice safe behaviors and should be fostered by unit and institutional leaders as it may help such institutions successfully remain open.
