This study aims to investigate household energy consumption of urban residential buildings in major cities of Indonesia during COVID-19 pandemic. Three representative major cities of Indonesia were selected to investigate detailed information about household appliances and gas consumption through face-to-face interviews in 2021 (n = 311). The factors affecting household energy consumption were investigated by multiple regression analysis. The results showed that, overall, the average annual energy consumption of all samples during pandemic was approximately 23.5 GJ, 3.0 GJ larger than before pandemic. The difference was primarily attributed to the use of air conditioning and cooking. The statistical analysis clearly indicated that the increase in household income (low-to high-cost houses), which would increase household size and number of appliances including air conditioning, thus increased total household energy consumption. We recommended the following potential energy-saving strategies for urban houses in Indonesia: (a) control the number of family members, (b) use more energy efficiency standards for electrical appliances and (c) encourage energy-saving lifestyles, particularly to younger adults by adopting passive cooling techniques (window opening) whereever possible.",

The downturn and change in the economy inevitably impact the energy system. As people were restricted for travel and to stay at home, residential sector starts to take a greater share and the transition in working and living style resulted in a significant change in the use of electrical appliances which affects the household energy consumption patterns.",

The percentage of people living in urban areas reached approximately 49.8% in Indonesia as of 2010 [9] . As a consequence, the need for living spaces increased rapidly, and an enormous number of residential buildings have been developed, particularly in major cities such as Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang and so forth.

These dwellings were settled in unplanned and overcrowded urban villages without proper basic urban infrastructure and services.

[19] investigated the relationship between owning home appliances and electricity consumption in Japanese households and found that the use of residential electricity consumption was related to the number of home appliances owned. Sanquist et al. [21] conducted a lifestyle analysis of residential electricity consumption in United States with respect to social and behavioral patterns associated with income, local electricity price, access to natural gas, air conditioning, laundry usage, personal computer usage, climate zone, and television use, but failed to link cultural differences to electricity consumption [22] . A study conducted on Dutch households by Biesiot and Noorman [23] demonstrated that the main determinants of differences in household energy demand were income and household size. Weber and Perrels [24] investigated socio-economic and household characteristics by developing a model of lifestyle effects on energy demand. Wilhite et al. [25] investigated energy studies related to culture by comparing household electricity consumption in two countries, Japan and Norway, with similar levels and patterns of material culture and economic development. The results showed certain significant differences in end-use patterns for space heating, lighting, and hot water use that were linked to differences in the countries' cultures.",

The majority of studies indicate that household energy consumption increased, which contrasts with a decline in commercial energy consumption. For example, in the United States, household electricity consumption escalated by 30% during pandemic lockdowns [26] . In comparison, Wang et al. [27] compared China's overall energy usage (residential, commercial, etc.) to a hypothetical COVID-19-free situation and found that actual energy consumption would be decreased by an average of 29% as a result of pandemics. COVID-19 related improvements raised the heating energy consumption of residential structures by 182 percent in Barcelona, Spain [28] . According to a study of Canadian social housing, electricity and hot water consumption increased slightly during the first two months of the lockdown. Consumption was distributed throughout the day, rather than peaking in the evening as it had been before the pandemic [29] . In South Korea, energy consumption has declined for the majority of facilities, while consumption by residential buildings has increased, highlighting the need for innovative energy system management [30] . Social distancing, selfquarantine, and home transformation were the most important factors influencing energy consumption [31] . Furthermore, optimal population distribution can reduce energy consumption by 32%, owing to less use of HVAC systems [32] , which are said to significantly increase energy consumption [33] . The governments were proposed to consider domestic energy consumption as an emergency sector and healthcare due to increased consumption and importance during the COVID-19 pandemic [34] . Domestic electricity consumption of residents in urban and rural areas in China increased by 5.3 percent in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the stay-at-home policy. Similarly, electricity consumption in the agricultural sector has increased by 4%. In contrast, it has fallen by 3.1 percent and 19.8 percent, respectively, in the manufacturing and service industries [27, 35] .",

As a consequence, it is important to analyze household energy consumption behavior to formulate policies for promotion of sustainable energy consumption [40] . In developing countries, the number of new buildings is growing rapidly and energy prices as well as markets often do not encourage the use of efficient technologies [41] . However, the study in the context of Asian developing countries is very limited, and one of the main reasons is scarcity of data. To provide detailed information on energy consumption, household-level surveys are normally conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of each country. They can be divided into two types: consumer expenditure surveys (in countries such as USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, and UK) and household energy consumption surveys (in countries such as Canada and Japan).",

The authors recommended adopting higher-efficiency appliances such as those available in the OECD. However, these sorts of recommendations may no longer be relevant because most manufacturers have adopted global standards. Permana et al. [43] conducted a comparative study analyzing and comparing the quantities of energy consumed in transport, non-cooking, and cooking purposes in urban areas. The results indicated that the unplanned areas consumed more energy per unit of income than planned and control areas. A study on household energy consumption-related air conditioner use and building material selection in planned houses and apartments has recently drawn attentions [44, 45] . Indonesia already converted its primary cooking fuel from kerosene to LPG in>50 million households through a massive energy program in 2007 [46] . This megaproject, which was to be completed in late 2011, provided an improved household cooking fuel and associated benefits in user costs, cleanliness, convenience, and environmental friendliness, as well as reducing the government's huge subsidy for petroleum fuels.",

Originally, the unplanned houses, called 'Kampungs', were urban dwellings built by the earliest inhabitants of a city or by city government during colonial period to provide cheap labor to wealthy areas. These dwellings settled in unplanned and overcrowded urban villages. Moreover, some of them were squatters on public land and located in strategic parts of the city without being provided with basic urban infrastructure and services properly [57] . These unplanned houses are scattered across the city as pockets of low income settlements and accounted for about 74% in Jakarta [51] and 89% of the total housing stocks in Bandung as of 2010 [53] , respectively. In contrast, planned houses are defined as houses constructed in a proper modern urban planning. This accounted for another 26% in Jakarta [51] and 11% in Bandung [53] , respectively. Moreover, these planned and unplanned houses can be further classified into three house categories based on its household income, namely low cost, medium cost, and high cost houses for low (<200 USD),medium (201-485 USD) and high (>486 USD) income, respectively (Fig. 2) . These houses have an approximate lifespan of 20, 35, and 50 years on average, respectively [58] . Although the quality and size of houses differ among these three house categories, they are similarly constructed of brick-walled structure. Moreover, most of the building materials used and the construction methods of these houses are similar regardless of the house category [45, 59] .",

As shown, Jakarta sample comprised approximately 39%, 49%, and 12% low, medium and high cost houses, respectively, whereas Semarang sample comprised 27%, 49%, and 24%, respectively for landed houses. Bandung sample comprised for low cost (36%), medium cost (22%) and high cost (42%) houses. The average household size was about 3.5-5.0 persons with little variations between the three categories in all cities. High cost houses tended to have slightly larger households of about 4.2-5.0 persons. The head's highest education attainment increases with the house category. Monthly average household income was converted in USD. Proportions of household income strata were almost the same between the three cities, although the average income in Bandung was slightly greater. In general, household income increased with house category from low to high, as did total floor area. The largest floor area was<50 m 2 (11.1% to 30.8%) for low cost houses, 50 to 99 m 2 (33.3% to 44.9%) for medium cost houses, and 100 to 300 m 2 (8.3% to 66.7%) for high cost houses. Several houses have total floor area>300 m 2 (4.3%-16.7%). Fig. 3 presents the ownership levels of major household appliances. As shown, light bulbs, televisions, refrigerators, rice cooker and washing machine were highly owned in all cities among all house categories. The stand fan (78-91%) was also found in most homes, reflecting the severe hot climatic conditions. In general, ownership levels of other appliances increased with house type, except for cooking blender and DVD player. The ownership level of air conditioners (14-69%) and ceiling fan (8-17%) increased with house category from low to high cost houses. Majority of high cost houses were equiped by cooling appliances (air conditioner) despite the climate. In all cities, Low Emission Diode (LED) and compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) were well penetrated among households regardless of the house categories (Fig. 4) . It has been reported that the Indonesian government highly promoted LED and fluorescent lamps for replacing incandescent lamps starting in 2007 [64] . The national power company (i.e., Perusahaan Listrik Negara) exchanged one incandescent bulb for three compact fluorescent bulbs free to their customers in Indonesia with the aim of reducing nationwide electricity consumption and the government's subsidies for electricity tariffs.",

Fig. 5a indicates energy consumption from various energy sources and Fig. 5b shows it by end-use categories. Overall, the average annual energy consumption of all sampled houses during pandemic was approximately 23.5 GJ, which is 3.0 GJ more than before pandemic. The difference is mainly attributed to the use of cooling and cooking among the three different house categories of the cities. As shown, average energy consumption for cooling and cooking accounted for 7.2 GJ (30%) and 8.1 GJ (34%) respectively of total energy consumption during pandemic, whereas they were higher 2.0 GJ and 0.8 GJ than before pandemic (Fig. 5b) . Hence, in all cities, average household energy consumption increased with increasing ownership and the use of air conditioning (Figs. 3 and 5) . Because average household size did not vary largely among the three house categories, the above difference in ownership and usage of cooling appliances, especially for air conditioners, and those of cooking was directly reflected in the large difference in annual energy consumption among all house categories in all cities. In all cities, secondary energy consumption for house with high and medium cost is more significant compared to the house with lowest cost. This is due to the larger electricity consumption of both household category where most of the activities for highest household income required electricity. The consumption through electricity is much greater than by LPG use: 2.85 GJ to 20.70 GJ during pandemic and 2.85 GJ to 17.68 GJ before pandemic (Fig. 5) . As been reported above on program of kerosene conversion to LPG, the usage of kerosene is very small in Indonesia and therefore, it is negliable. Fig. 6 indicates annual average energy consumption per floor area and per person. As shown in Fig. 6b , the annual energy consumption per person increased sharply with house category. Because average household size did not vary largely among the house categories, this difference was directly reflected in the large difference in annual energy consumption among the categories. This indicates that there is a disparity in consuming electricity between house with larger cost and house with lower cost. In addi-tion, the number of occupants per floor area increased with category (see Table 1 ). Therefore, when annual energy consumption was assessed in terms of per-floor area, it also increased with category by significant differences in their means (Fig. 6a) .",

The CO 2 emission factors by energy source of Indonesia are shown in Table 3 . Fig. 7 shows annual household CO 2 emission of residential buildings of Indonesia. As shown, average annual CO 2 emissions during pandemic were estimated at 4.2 ton CO 2 -equivalent, while those were 3.6 ton CO 2equivalent before pandemic. The major contributors during pandemic were cooling (1.4 ton (33%)), cooking (1.2 ton (28%)), and refrigeration (0.7 ton (18%)), while those before pandemic were cooking (1.0 ton (28%)), cooling (1.0 ton (28%)), and refrigeration (0.7 ton (20%)). If the amount of CO 2 emissions caused by cooling are excluded, then the difference of total CO 2 emissions between the two climate groups is insignificant (2.8 ton during pandemic and 2.6 ton before pandemic). This clearly indicates that an increase in air conditioning use in the future would dramatically increase household energy consumption and therefore, CO 2 emissions. Similar patterns in unit CO 2 emissions per floor area and per person are shown in Fig. 8 . The annual households CO 2 emissions per person in every type of house also vary where house with the highest cost consume cooling around four times compared to the house with lowest cost, especially during the pandemic. The more activity for wealthier household in the house, the more significant they consume energy during pandemic.",

Similarly, the number of family members has positive correlation with household energy consumption, suggesting that as the household size increases, more household energy consumption is consumed [23, 67, 68] . In addition, number of other appliances and joint effect of number of AC and number of fans as well as daily usage of AC and number of fans influenced household energy consumption for medium and low-cost houses, respectively. The results is inline with investigation of Genjo et al. [19] , Wijaya et al. [47] and Surahman et al.

As a consequence, the increase in household income will soon increase total household energy consumption significantly in Southeast Asian cities. It can be concluded that household energy consumption in major cities of Southeast Asia is projected to increase sharply if proper energy-saving strategies are not implemented. First, it is important to avoid the tendency to increase household size and number of appliances especially number of AC and fans directly with the increase in household income. One possible solution is to control number of family members. Indonesia's Family Planning Program can be one solution to prevent pregnancy [69, 70] . Second, but the most importantly, the increase in cooling, especially AC would be a major concern in terms of energy-saving strategies in the hot-humid cities, which is typical of Southeast Asia. Even in the hot-humid cities, the ownership of AC was still averaged at 39.9% according to the present survey, through it is rapidly rising. It is important to reduce the use of AC in the future despite the expected increase in household income. In addition, the usage of more energy efficiency standards for appliances is also necessary. As been seen in Fig. 9 , the households headed by the younger adults ( 40 years old) consumed more cooling energy (1.9 GJ and 0.8 GJ in average during and before pandemic, respectively) than those headed by the adults (>40 years old) in low-cost house and in high-cost houses. Therefore, it is important to encourage the occupants to modify their current lifestyle changes, particularly to the younger adults in low and high-cost houses and promote environmental education. For example, to reduce the electricity consumption by ACs in residential buildings would be preferable for people to open window rather than running an AC in each room of house.

Overall, the average annual energy consumption of all samples during pandemic is approximately 23.5 GJ, which is 3.0 GJ larger than before pandemic.

We recommended the following potential energysaving strategies for urban houses in Indonesia: (a) control number of family members by preventing pregnancy, (b) use more energy efficiency standards for appliances and (c) encour- age energy-saving lifestyles, particularly to younger adults and promote environmental education by adopting passive cooling techniques (window opening) whereever possible.",
