But this monopoly right-argue the 45 signatories of the letter-will inevitably result in high prices, reduced quantities and a redistribution of well-being to the detriment of the consumer and in favour of the producer. At this point, however, Azar would probably rebut that it is true that the monopoly power granted by patents reduces the wellbeing of consumers of the new medicine compared to a hypothetical situation in which this medicine was sold under a competitive regime. But, without a patent, this medicine would probably not exist at all because no company would invest in an innovation that competitors could easily imitate. Therefore, Azar would argue, the real comparison we have to make is not between a vaccine or treatment sold at either monopoly or competitive price, but between a vaccine sold at monopoly price and no vaccine at all. Monopoly and high prices would therefore be a sort of inevitable lesser evil, a price that society must pay for the treatments and vaccines that otherwise would not be invented by profit seeking firms.",

With the aim of promoting and encouraging the stay in Venice of persons of talent capable of promoting and increasing the power and well-being of the city, the Senate of Venice promulgated in 1474 the first statute on patents. It was established that craftsmen, engineers and artists who established their residence in Venice for a sufficiently long period of time and invented something useful and new would be granted the right to be the only one to commercially exploit the work of their talent for 10 years. In exchange, the inventor was committed to reveal the technical details of his invention before he could leave the city.",

The answer, in my opinion, is no. Property confers a right of exclusion: if I own, for instance, a parcel of farming land, nobody can use it without my permission. This right of exclusion, economists say, serves to avoid problems of over-exploitation of the resource that would occur if the resource were accessible to all (Hardin 1968 ). The solution is to confer a monopoly of exploitation on a single subject. Moreover, ownership can be transferred in a market and if the latter works properly the parcel of farming land will go to the best user, i.e. to the farmer who can maximize its yield (Coase 1960) .",

Now, if this monopoly concerns, for example, small or medium-sized agricultural land, such social costs will not be very significant because there will be some other similar and equally productive land.

I make this claim for two reasons. First, the pharmaceutical market does not exist, at least if we look for it from the demand side, but there are as many sub-markets as there are pathologies and these sub-markets are often totally separated. This generally does not occur in other markets that are indeed segmented but where usually there is cross competition between different segments. In the pharmaceutical sector it generally does not work like this: if I have to get vaccinated against covid-19 I need this particular vaccine and a vaccine against e.g. measles will be totally useless. Therefore in the pharmaceutical industry, especially for serious and important diseases and for truly effective medicines, monopoly power is much stronger than in other sectors because sub-markets are naturally impervious to competition from other sub-markets.",

In conclusion, the pharmaceutical sector is a true monopolist's heaven and a potential hell for the consumer. It is therefore truly surprising that in our economic systems there are on the one hand anti-trust laws and authorities that prohibit and punish monopolistic behaviour and on the other legislation protecting patents that create monopolies precisely where monopolies can be more harmful to the community.",

            "text": "Finally, this extreme protection of the interests of pharmaceutical companies does not seem to have even created the benefits in terms of innovation that its defenders hypothesize. According to many empirical studies, the sector's innovativeness rate is declining, and in many fields important to public health, investments and innovations have been scarce or non-existent for many years. For obvious reason, \"Big Pharma\" R&D effort have been more and more concentrated on \"blockbuster\" drugs for chronic disease: the perfect customer for a pharmaceutical company is wealthy, chronically ill, hypochondriac and a maniac pill-popper. Cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and erectile dysfunctions are attracting most of the R&D investment. Infectious diseases and vaccines on the contrary attract little interest because they are for once-for-all uses only and if effective they tend to kill their own market. It is well known for instance that efforts to find a vaccine against SARS have been abandoned when the SARS pandemic slowed down, but, if pursued, could have put us in much better conditions for a vaccine against Covid-19. The team at Oxford University which is now in a leading position in the race for the latter vaccine has invested a lot in finding a vaccine for MERS, regardless the weak economic incentive offered by the limited spread of this epidemic. This point is very important and concerns again cumulative/sequential innovation: it may be the case that innovation A does not have a big enough market and incentives to produce it may be too weak. However innovation A may prove to be an essential step needed to produce innovation B which, on the contrary, may have a potential large market. Abandoning R&D in A may indeed be fully justified in term of market incentives but may cause a kind of adverse selection which may generate huge social costs in the long run.",

            "text": "Azar's second mistake is that he overstates the centrality of private companies in pharmaceutical research, where on the contrary public funding always plays a fundamental role in the processes of discovery, development and pre-clinical and clinical tests of new medicines. For instance, Sampat (2009) has estimated that 7.7% of all approvals by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 10.6% of NMEs are based on academic patents. Expanding on this analysis, Sampat and Lichtenberg (2011) explored the indirect contributions of public-sector funding to drug patents by characterizing the prior art referenced in these patents. Their studies show that, of 379 drugs approved in the period 1988-2007, 48% were associated with a patent that cited prior art generated in the public sector. Azoulay et al. (2019) find a strong and highly significant multiplicative effect of NIH (National Institute for Health, the primary agency of the US government responsible for biomedical and public health research) funding for the private pharma industry. They estimate that each dollar spent by NIH in basic research generates $2.43 of additional drug sales and that $10 million increase in public funding generates 2.5 new patents. Galkina Cleary et al. (2018) found substantial US federal funding behind the development of all the 210 new molecular entities approved by FDA between 2010 and 2016, with a total government spending of more than $100 billion. They also conclude that public sector investment for each first-in-class new molecular entity (i.e. a molecule that uses a new and unique mechanism of action for treating a medical condition) has been on average $839 million and mostly concentrated in essential and more risky stages of basic research.",

Programs for the exploration of the outer space or the investigation of the inner structure of the atom have been managed by public agencies like NASA or CERN, why should not we promote similar programs to treat covid-19 and other important diseases with a strong social impact? These large projects can and must involve private actors, both because they have fundamental knowledge and because it is good to promote a plurality of approaches. But private actors must be \"subcontractors\" of the public project and remunerated as such, unlike what happens now, where we have public projects at the service of private companies (see Florio (2020) for an articulated proposal of a European research infrastructure). Notice that the recently developed \"EU strategy for Covid-19 vaccines\", 1 although very important and generously funded, does not go into this direction as it is based on two pillar: using regulatory flexibility to speed up testing and approval of vaccines and, especially, securing mass production of the vaccine once approved. The latter aim will be pursued by recurring to Advance Purchase Agreements with pharmaceutical companies, but no mention is made to possible interventions on the patent protection of the vaccine.",

In many industries the expected costs of patent litigations exceed the profits derived from patents. This means that in these industries patents likely provide a net disincentive for innovation (Bessen and Meurer 2008) ; (4) in cumulative (or sequential) and complex (i.e. products and technologies which combine a large number of interacting bodies of knowledge and components) technologies strong patents can actually prevent innovations because additional progress is often stopped by lots of pending patent (Bessen and Maskin 2009; Marengo et al. 2012) .",

Extending and institutionalizing compulsory licensing, which already exists in most patent laws and in the TRIPS agreement in case of national emergency, could be a relatively easy way to strike a more equitable balance. For instance, the patent office could still grant patents, but would also issue unlimited licences and levy a (decreasing) tax on the licensees' sales which would be transferred to the patent holder and reward the innovative effort. Alternatively, licenses could be allocated on a continuous auction market where also licensees could issue and sell additional licenses. In this way a stream of profit could flow to the innovator but the price of the drug would quickly decrease towards marginal cost.",
