As it appeared in an unexpected, isolated way with high global impacts and low predictability [2] , this phenomenon could be related to the event called \"Black Swan\", proposed by Taleb [3] . It was a noticeable scenario of unpreparedness regarding the perception of the signs of COVID-19 as the hazard energy passed without the installation of barriers in any sector, promoting a chain reaction until reaching the \"great damage\" [4] . Therefore, it was necessary to establish integrated crisis management, which could enable the integration of the collection and monitoring of deaths and contaminated indicators associated with corrective actions. Such actions could help to contain failures, resulting from the lack of knowledge about the hazard, cultural biases and the lack of leadership [5] . The urgency of elaborating the safeguards was due to the non-resolution of the pandemic and the need to determine assertive measures [6] .",

The epidemic spread mainly into the northern region of the country [16] , where people over 80 and health professionals, who worked on the front line against the coronavirus, corresponded to the most contaminated population and comprised a great number of the fatalities [17] . This situation occurred due to the low availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the initial stages of the pandemic [8] and overcrowding in hospitals, creating a sequence that contributed to the rapid spread of the virus in the country [16] .",

[18] , on 21 February 2020, the first death by COVID-19 was documented, motivating the public governance to adopt more measures against the epidemic, despite neglecting the seriousness of emerging health issues and prioritizing the economic sector. Among the adopted measures, there was the use of an app tool for voluntary people tracking in Lombardy [8] , the establishment of government information system, the strengthening of local health services, continuous supply of PPE, kits for laboratory analysis and devices for respiratory support [19] , which were extremely important, especially in the period between March and April, a time of crisis for the country. Since April, a response to public measures was made [18] . In line with FNOMCeO [19] , on 4 May 2020, a phase of lockdown flexibilization was initiated in Italy. There was a reopening of trade and non-essential activities, guaranteeing a return to the stability of the economy, but with responsibility through personal care. Despite the initial lack of control of the pandemic in the country, the actions were taken effectively and presented satisfactory results in the fight against the coronavirus, bringing the country's trajectory closer to that presented in Scenario 1.",

For example, the collection, analysis and coding of data had to be done simultaneously, non-linearly, so that the comparisons were made continuously [10, 24] . Although the methodological and epistemological perspectives are not invariable, it was also needed to still use indispensable processes of theoretical sampling, theoretical saturation, identification of a central category and codifications, which will be further discussed [21] .",

Such memos are present in the study, carried out in the form of informal bulletins, in which the authors explore different concepts, comparisons, exercises and formulas that are were used to guide the construction of the study design and expose relations between the data. At the same time, the dissemination of knowledge about the disease in question is also sought. In general, it is noticeable that the organization in which these methods are configured contributes to the constant articulation of the elements in an iterative and dynamic way [25] . Using the aforementioned GT tools, the research work inaugurates a practical method for the observation of the curve, considering the various influences and biases on its result as a way of indicating parameters for the decision in general. Therefore, this methodology can be simply understood and applied and is not based on modelling with multiple variables in a crisis marked by underreporting, facilitating its replication.",

However, as the design of the research, based on GT was not previously defined, it was guided by the conceptions built during the investigation of the data providing innovation knowledge [10] . In this sense, during the observation and analysis of the data, the authors tested statistical parameters for the decision and observed the punctual (daily) and accumulated data on deaths and contamination. Besides that, we made an analysis based on a 4-day moving average to eliminate the \"weekend effect\", in which data divergence occurred from other days of the week. Apparently, there was no duty on the database management at the weekend, jeopardizing some immediate decisions. In this way, we could take into account the study of Carl Bergstrom [9] , which compared the adequate health service capacity or failed healthcare service during the pandemic in an or, on the other hand, failure health management. Both scenarios were exposed as figures with a sinusoidal and symmetrical format that the bases coincided despite having different dimensions. So, we assumed this perfect (symmetric) sinusoidal configuration with only one positive peak between two minimum values for the y axis as an ideal epidemiological curve and using a visual, simple and direct method compared them to the configured (real) curves for China and Italy.",

The effectiveness of measures due to the representative of the localities was reflected by the minimum scale of the curve distortion [32] . This search for the sinusoidal curve as an ideal represented the homogeneous effect of dissemination of contamination and the homogeneous effect of isolation against the action of the virus, representing a premise to analyze underreporting and matches. Thus, the match analysis sought for symmetry between the sides, in which the adjust of the theoretical (ideal) curve over the real curve was based on the parameters and positions described as dates and approximations in the shape of the curve (match).

In particular, in modeling its curves, it became clear that there was a need to develop models which could incorporate the effect of undetected infected people [39] . Such an approach allowed us to demonstrate the dependence of the impact of COVID-19 on the percentage of the detected cases over the real total infected cases [40] . It was evident that data handling had to chronologically represent the events related to the pandemic. If there was a displacement in the time of contamination or fatality data, or even the non-reporting of these numbers, the decisions on program strategies to combat the crisis and critical analysis to avoid event recurrences were impaired. Thus, from the exploratory method, based on history, we sought to detect under-reporting and redistribute data with abnormal peaks in the curve. In addition, the exploration of China and Italy data was carried out to address motives for the real and ideal curves and contamination and deaths curves presented in the respective formats. Proposing solutions for this non-notification or determining/affirming specific causalities were not part of the scope of this paper.",
