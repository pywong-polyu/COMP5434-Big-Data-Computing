The proposition that testing for salivary vitamin D can show a correlation with serum levels in healthy people is questionable, especially with low vitamin D intake. This study aimed to find the correlation between vitamin D levels, which were assessed as 25(OH)D and 1.25(OH)D in saliva, and serum 25(OH)D and 1.25(OH)D levels in people with low vitamin D intake.",

The parameters studied were the 25(OH)D and 1.25(OH)D levels in saliva and serum, and vitamin D intake. The statistical analysis used was the Spearman correlation test, performed to determine the correlation between each parameter. Results: This study involved 56 study subjects, who were rural adults (male or female) with a 78.6% deficiency in 25(OH)D found by examining saliva, and a 76.8% deficiency found by examining the serum. All of the subjects were categorized as having low vitamin D intake (less than 15 micrograms per day). The analysis showed a moderate correlation between levels of saliva 25(OH)D and serum 25(OH)D (p = 0.424), and a weak correlation between levels of saliva 1.25(OH)D and serum 25(OH)D (p = 0.339). Conclusion: In people with low vitamin D intake, there was a moderate correlation between serum 25(OH)D and saliva, but a weak correlation was found in the 1.25(OH)D assay. The use of saliva 25(OH)D levels to detect 25(OH)D in the circulation is a possible non-invasive alternative to serum testing.",

            "text": "Vitamin D deficiency occurs in various parts of the world, including in the tropics, and it occurs in both healthy and sick people. 1, 2 Vitamin D deficiency is often found in people with a low intake of food sources of vitamin D. 3, 4 Vitamin D is found at higher levels in fish oil and sun exposure, but not all people can consume fish oil easily, or are exposed to sunlight, considering lifestyle factors. 5, 6 The difficulty involved in getting fish oil or vitamin D supplements is a challenge in preventing vitamin D deficiency. 5, 7, 8 The examination of serum 25(OH)D levels is necessary for determining the level of vitamin D in circulation and in its active form, namely, serum 1.25(OH)D. 9 However, this examination often causes discomfort in the patient, so an easier examination is needed that does not cause pain. Saliva contains various types of biological compounds, including vitamins and enzymes, so it is hoped that saliva can become a biological specimen that describes health status. 10, 11 Saliva screening is considered a non-invasive test, and little encouragement and direction is required to produce a suitable specimen. 10 Several of the vitamins and enzymes that describe health status and that are contained in saliva include vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and enzymes that describe oxidative stress, such as malondialdehyde, amylase and proteomes. 10, [12] [13] [14] This examination of vitamin D is necessary due to the role of vitamin D, which can increase body immunity through its role as an endocrine. [15] [16] [17] [18] It also acts as an antiinflammatory and has a regulatory effect on the immune system. The effects of vitamin D therapy can be felt in various metabolic diseases, and in cancer. 18, 19 The examination of vitamin D levels in the form of 25(OH)D and 1.25(OH)D in saliva has not been used often for diagnostic purposes, because these levels may not show the actual levels in the body, or reflect specific conditions such as low vitamin D level or chronic diseases. 11, 20 Saliva examination is more applicable in hormonal, immunological, and infection tests, but it is rarely used. 11, 21, 22 In addition, saliva examination may reveal many other contamination factors, so its use in diagnostic tests is often neglected. 22 However, if done according to the correct procedure, the risk of contamination can be removed, but whether there is a correlation between saliva and serum vitamin D levels in adults with low vitamin D intake remains questionable. Adults in rural areas offer an example of homogeneity in food intake, compared to those in urban areas with heterogeneity in their food intake.",

The studies did not examine serum 1.25(OH)D levels, which represent the active form of vitamin D. 11 Research on vitamin D, especially on those with vitamin D deficiency due to insufficient intake of food sources of vitamin D, has not been reported. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency, or subclinical symptoms, are likely to be important etiological factors in the pathogenesis of many chronic disease, but this deficiency condition is often ignored. 23 Based on the results of the above research, we conducted a study on the correlation between levels of 25 (OH)D and 1.25(OH)D in the saliva and serum. The goal was to find the correlation between these two parameters in rural adults with low vitamin D intake; besides this, another intention was to find an alternative to serum testing, which is invasive and causes discomfort to the patient. It is hoped that with the findings of this research, saliva examination could replace serum testing.",

Categorical data were presented in number of the subject and percentage. food sources of vitamin D. The low intake of vitamin D caused most of the study subjects to experience vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency. However, a low intake of vitamin D is not the main cause of vitamin D deficiency, as there are several other factors that can affect it, including obesity. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] Vitamin D deficiency is an independent risk factor for obesity and abdominal obesity in women. 40, 41 Previous studies have reported that there is a link between obesity and low levels of vitamin D in the body. [42] [43] [44] It is not yet known what the cause of vitamin D deficiency is, that is, whether it is due to insufficient sunlight exposure, low vitamin D intake, or vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism. [45] [46] [47] [48] One probable mechanism of vitamin D deficiency associated with obesity is the decreased bioavailability of vitamin D (cholecalciferol/vitamin D3) from skin and food as it accumulates in adipocytes, and people who are obese will thus be less able to convert vitamin D into the active form. 41, 43, 49, 50 The examination of vitamin D has become routine, and most often uses 25(OH)D serum, which reflects the circulating vitamin D levels, whereas the examination of serum 1.25(OH)D levels represents the active form of vitamin D. 6, 9, 30 Both these examination are often uncomfortable and invasive. Various studies have also been conducted to compare this examination with the examination of other body fluids. 10, 14 In addition to serum examinations, some studies have discussed the diagnosis of vitamin D status using a questionnaire. 4 This suggests that an invasive examination is not required to establish vitamin status, but this study focused only on the elderly. 4 Other studies have shown that serum levels offer more precise results compared to other body fluids. 8, 51, 52 The saliva examination in this study resulted in a higher measured level than the serum examination, which was probably due to the different sensitivities involved detecting 25(OH)D in serum vs. saliva. Saliva examination results are also considered to be heavily influenced by contaminants, so these results cannot be adjusted to the levels in serum. However, this study showed that there was a moderate correlation between saliva and serum levels, especially in terms of 25(OH)D levels, but the correlation was weak in terms of 1.25(OH) D levels. This was probably due to the condition of low vitamin D intake, which is reflected in the high percentage of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency.",

It can be concluded that there is a linear and positive relationship between levels of 25(OH)D in saliva and serum 25(OH) D levels. This positive relationship means that if the salivary 25(OH)D level increases, so will the serum level. Likewise, the levels of 1.25(OH)D in saliva and serum showed a positive relationship.",
