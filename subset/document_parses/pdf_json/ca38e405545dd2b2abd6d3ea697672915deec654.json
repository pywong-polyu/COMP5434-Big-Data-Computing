Using the available data of Covid-19 infected population on various countries we formulate a model which can successfully track the time evolution from early days to the saturation period in a given wave of this infectious disease. It involves a set of effective parameters which can be extracted from the available data.",

            "text": "Currently a pandemic is ongoing throughout the world caused by a contagious respiratory disease, called Covid-19. The pathogen of this respiratory disease is a novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 [1]. It started from China and subsequently spreads to most of the countries, and as of August 12, 2020, it has infected more than 20.2 million human population worldwide causing more than 740 thousand deaths [1] [2] [3] . Though the spread of infection has substantially reduced in several countries, particularly in China and Europe, in many countries with a large population, such as USA, Brazil and India, the pandemic is surging prominently at this time. It is also not clear whether this respiratory disease will be seasonal and a second wave will come later. There is no clear consensus in the scientific community on the possible future evolution of this disease and naturally there is no consensus on the ideal intervention strategy by a government in minimizing the number of fatalities while allowing economic and social activities. Many mathematical models have been put forward 1 to track the time evolution of the disease spread, to understand its dynamics, as well as to provide a feasible guidance to governments around the world to control this pandemic.",

            "text": "As in ecology and population growth, in epidemiology too the time evolution of virus growth in a population is of fundamental importance. In general, one builds a model of disease transmission using a system of differential equations with an assumption of initial exponential growth [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . A standard way for mathematical analysis of the dynamics of infection spread is to adopt a variety of compartmental models originated primarily from the so-called SIR model [46] [47] [48] , incorporating susceptible (S), infectious (I) and Recovered (R) population. For the Covid-19 disease growth, one of these models, the so-called SEIR model, and its extensions have been utilized extensively [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] 31] . In this scheme of models, one divides the total population, N , at a infected region (e.g., city, country), into susceptible (S), exposed (E), Infected (I) and Recovered (R) population with a constraint S +E +I +R = N . A set of differential equations incorporating these correlated compartments then provides the time evolution of disease spread. The success and problem of this model have been discussed over last few months in detail and there is no clear consensus whether this type of models can predict the spread of Covid-19 with reasonable accuracy [33, 34] . There is an alternate view that the integral equations based models could be more effective than the models based on differential equations mentioned above to describe the dynamics of epidemics [30, 49, 50] .",

The reason behind adopting such an approach is that since the Covid-19 disease is contagious, assuming a region as a closed system, the number of today's infected population is directly correlated to the number of infected population in the past, and moreover, today's number will also determine how many people will be infected in the near future. The parameters of the model can be thought of as an effective mean-field type parameters, which can be constrained with the available data, and later those can be employed for the future time evolution of the disease spread. We find that there is a clear common pattern in the initial growth, mitigation and saturation periods of the time evolution of the number of infected population at various Covid-19-affected regions. The only difference in describing the Covid-19 virus spread between various affected population is the difference between parameter sets of these regions. However, they are all confined within a smaller subspace of the parameter space. The differences between parameters of different regions are possibly due to their differences in total number of population, density, mobility, age and gender distributions, testing facility, lockdown effect, social distancing etc. microscopic factors. Of course, it will be interest-ing to find mathematical correlations between the effective parameters and the microscopic parameters.",

The time evolution of these differential equations can be performed with any good first-order differential equation solver with matching the boundary conditions at different periods of infection. We find that by solving these differential equations it is possible to find a common trajectory that can describe the available data on the total number of infected population for all periods of Covid-19 spread. The parameters inside these differential equations can be tuned with the available data. Instead of finding a single trajectory, we use the available data set with error-bars which yield a set of parameters and hence a set of trajectories within the allowed errorbars. The use of errorbars on the available data is justified as the exact number of infection is unknown due to the lack of adequate testing facility and often for social as well as political reasons. We use a larger error (mostly within 10%, and in a few cases maximum up to 20%) at the first 14 days (considering the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 virus) and later reduced it to less than a percent level in the saturation period. This is a reasonable assumption, as in the initial days the testing facilities are in general severely inadequate, the symptoms are not well recognized in the population and hence under-reported and so the reported infected numbers could be well below the true numbers. In the later days, these bottlenecks in general reduce substantially and the number of reported cases become less erroneous. We adopt a \u03c7 2 minimization procedure to incorporate these errors and this also helps to get a band of trajectories around its mean values (reported numbers). In this way, the onset of saturation period of infection can also be span over a few days (or weeks), and not on a single day which is also what we observe at various affected regions.",

That may help to understand the dynamics of infection in a better way as well as the origin of such equations and their parameters. To achieve such a formulation it is worthwhile to look towards the growth equations in ecology and epidemic studies. In fact in epidemic studies, to estimate the infection rate, cumulative number of cases, the peak number of infected population, future dynamics of the epidemics etc., one can use the growth equations. One such approach is the standard logistic model [52] where population growth is determined through an exponential growth, constrained to the number of population, as below:",

A situation with maturity of population arrives as the competition between two terms reduces the combined growth rate, until the infected population saturates.

An error of about 5-1% is imposed in between with gradual decrement with the number of days. We have already mentioned it and elaborating it further here with following arguments: at the onset of infection, the number of initial cases is not well determined as the number of tests performed could well be too low and there is a good probability for underestimation. We keep the maximum error for the first 14 days which is typically the incubation period for this respiratory disease. The testing procedure, capacity as well as reliability improves over time and hence the reported number for the Covidpositive cases becomes less more erroneous over time. The timing of a transition from one period to other, as mentioned at the beginning of section II is chosen dynamically so that the total \u03c7 2 is minimum. To avoid a sharp transition between two periods (for example, early rise to mitigation, that is points just before and after t m ) we interpolate the results between the adjacent points obtained from two different fitting forms. This is justifiable as we mentioned earlier that change form one period to others does not happen in a single day and can happen with a smooth cross-over over several days. With this procedure we fit the data for the above-mentioned countries uniformly. We first show our results for the first two time-periods (initial and mitigation, till the onset of saturation) with fit to Eqs. (1a) and (1b). This will show the validity of our model at these two time-periods. Later we also show our results of the entire time-periods (initial mitigation, and saturation). We show it separately as Eq.(1c) is the ideal representation of the saturation period with the same environmental factors as in the mitigation period. However, in this period due to possible ease of various environmental factors and with a large unaffected population a second wave of infection may resurface which needs to be dealt separately.

To be noted that solutions of these equations with a given errorbar will result in a band of trajectories rather than just one.

At the boundary, we match the solution without any discontinuity that is solutions are continuously progressed. For example, the initial value of N (t) at t = t m + 1 with (13b) is generated from the solution of (13a) at t = t m . In this way, we match the boundary conditions of solutions between different regions. A trajectory generated by these equations is accepted or rejected based on the minimum \u03c7 2 within the errorbars. The trajectories obtained through these differential equations for Italy and New York City are shown in can also track the disease spread in the saturation period assuming the same environmental condition prevails throughout this period. Though we show results for only two regions, data for others regions can also be tracked with equal success through the proposed differential equations (Eq. (13)). For Italy this projection is for 25 days t s i (= 85 \u2212 60). We find that this projection can progressively be improved by gradually including more data.

The blue bands are obtained using the constrained parameter set, while the red solid lines are actual data. The projected results, using both Eq. (1) as well as Eq.

As in other parts of India, Delhi was also under lockdown from March 24 and gradual un-lockdown has initiated from the beginning of June. However, unlike Mumbai, there was a sudden jump in the number of infection was observed around fourth week of June, perhaps due to ease of lockdown and not maintaining other preventive measures.

We call that part of data as W a. The maximum of W a is chosen dynamically with the usual condition of minimum",

We then dynamically choose the time of transition from W a to W b so that the total \u03c7 2 = \u03c7 2 (W a) + \u03c7 2 (W b) becomes minimum within the acceptable limit. We find the minimum \u03c7 2 fit leads to t m (W a) = 45, the transition time from W a to W b at around time t tr = 103, and t m (W b) = 129 \u2212 140. Interestingly in this way we could track the time evolution of the total number of infection from the initial period to date very well. Result using Eqs. (1a) and (1b) is shown in Fig. 16 with the black solid line, whereas the red solid line represents the actual data [1, 69] . To be noted that the power-law-rise exponent \u03b1 i in W b (5.594) is much bigger than its corresponding value in W a (2.744). In fact, it is the biggest among all other power-law-rise exponents for any affected regions that we study. This is a clear signal that the infection had spread very rapidly in the early period of W b, and unless adequate measures are imposed against the disease spread a substantial increase in the number of infection is expected in foreseeable future. However, on a positive note, it is worthwhile to mention that our model also allows a possibility that another mitigation period has started, albeit slow, at around t = 129 \u2212 140, i.e., around the second week of July. With this slow rate of mitigation, and in no change in existing conditions, this disease can rise another 2.5-3 months infecting about 6.5-7 million people (shown by the black line in Fig. 16 ), before reaching to the saturation period with less than about 3000 infections per day by the end of October to the beginning of November. Thereafter the onset of saturation period can possibly be achieved by maintaining the same restrictions against the infection spread. We project this as the ideal case scenario with continuation of the existing restrictions and current trend of reduction. Although this is an ideal situation and in reality there will be deviation in restrictions and so in this projection, still this can be taken as a possible scenario. However, if the current value of the percentage of per day increment sustains and does not reduce further in the next 2 weeks, this situation can change. We will discuss next about such a possible situation with a set of speculated data.",

            "text": "By analyzing the time-dependent data of the infected population, we find that there is our finding is that it is now crossing the peak of disease spread (that is per day maximum number of infection). However, due to large unaffected population and the unavailability of an effective vaccine, its mitigation period will be prolonged. With the existing measures against the disease spread we expect to see the onset of the saturation period by the middle of November to the middle of December, with 5.5 \u2212 6.5 million cumulative infection and less than 2500 infection per day. Our analysis on India shows that it is still in the powerlaw rise period even after passing more than 5 months of the disease spread. With the current trend of infection we expect that there would be more than 3 million infection by the end of August. We also expect that even with the continuation of the existing measures against the diseases spread, the mitigation period will be quite long considering its huge unaffected population. Hence it is even more important to maintain the existing measures against the disease spread, at least for the next few months, given that no effective vaccine would be available before that. We will continue to monitor the disease propagation and progressively improve our projection on the future trajectory with the availability of more data 3 . We also analyze data on two of its biggest cities: Mumbai and Delhi. For Mumbai, our finding is that it has entered into the mitigation period. If the current conditions against the disease spread can be continued throughout, by the beginning of October we expect to see the onset of saturation period, with the cumulative infected population about 145-160 thousand and with less than 250 infections per day. For Delhi, we project that the onset of saturation period, with a cumulative number of infection of about 160-180 thousand and per day infections below 250, can be achieved by the end of September to the beginning of October. Finally on USA's data, we find that there is a distinct feature in the time evolution trajectory. Our model clearly shows that this data can be explained very well by allowing two waves of infection: first one with the usual exponential-cum-power-rise followed by a mitigation period up to a time, and then the second one started with that mitigated number with a power-rise followed by a very slow mitigation. The exponent in the second power-rise is bigger than that of the first one suggesting a very large number of population can get infected if adequate preventive measures against it are not followed. Our result also shows that had the mitigation period continued for the first wave, by now, a saturation period with much less number of infection could have been achieved. With the current rate of slow mitigation, but with existing restrictions, we project that this disease can rise another 3-4 months infecting about 6.5 \u2212 7 million people, before reaching to the saturation period with less than 5000 infections per day. However, we project this as an ideal case scenario. If the rate of per day increment remains within 0.9-1.25% and no further reduction happens in next 2 weeks, within a speculative scenario, we show that the total number of infection can be around 7-7.5 million by the early November, with more than 10000-12000 infections per day. All the projections are made with 95% confidence intervals in the proposed model given the reported available data. These projections can be progressively improved with the availability of more data in next few weeks 3 . We summarize these projections in Table II .",

The red solid lines are the actual data[56][57][58][59][60][61], while the black solid lines are obtained using Eq. (1), as inFig. 5. Results for the total number of Covid-19 positive cases, (N (t)), and the per day increments (dN (t)/dt), for the full data set along with fitted trajectories are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively, for various countries and New York City. It is quite satisfying to see that the full data set for various countries and cities as well can be tracked very well through the model proposed in Eq. (1). It is to be mentioned here that in the saturation period our main purpose is to show the validity of the proposed model. We do not project the time evolution trajectory in the future in this period as is shown in the figure. Though the extended trajectories (beyond data point) are obtained with 95% confidence intervals of the fitted parameters, a projection in this period may not hold as a second wave of infection can start at any point of time in this period. That is probably what is currently happening, albeit with less extent, in all the regions mentioned in this plot, except for Italy and New York city. Most notable one is on Spain's data where from the middle of July, the number for per day infection has started to increase again beyond what we observe throughout inside a large part of saturation period (t = 81 \u2212 135). Considering that Covid-19 is a contagious disease, this second rise could be due to i) relaxation of measures against the disease spread which was implemented earlier, ii) a large unaffected population, and iii) no availability of an effective vaccine. This will be elaborated further when later we discuss the infection of the USA.",

We vary the parameter set over a wide range and choose a parameter space which can describe the time-dependent data with minimum \u03c7 2 with a given errorbar. Here, again we take the usual definition of \u03c7 2 = (f (t i ) \u2212 N (t i )) 2 /\u03c3 2 N (t i ) , where f (t i )'s are obtained from the solution of Eq.

The red solid lines are actual data from Refs. [59, 61] while the blue lines are obtained from the solutions of the differential equations (Eq. (13)). The upper two figures are for the total number of infection while the bottom two figures represent corresponding per day infection.B. Predictive ability of the proposed modelThe success of a mathematical model not only depends on the validation but crucially also on its predictive power. After successfully validating the model through reproducing the time evolution of the number of infections, hence, we proceed to find the predictive ability of our proposed model. Since the model is non-linear, a small change in parameter space may result in a different time evolution trajectory. However, if there is a parameter space that is unique to disease spread and if that can be constrained with a subset of data then the model can be used for future evolution. With this in mind, we find that it is not possible to constrain the parameter space until it reaches the beginning of the mitigation period (t > t m ). That is apparent as the parameters of a region cannot be obtained from other regions since the dynamics of disease spread in two regions are different. We use a subset of data till the 55th days (for NYC) and 60th days (for Italy) and use those to constrain the respective parameter spaces. We then employ those to obtain the respective future trajectories till the onset of saturation period for the total number of infection. To be mentioned that the onset of saturation period is determined dynamically by minimizing the total \u03c7 2 . Results are shown inFig. 9, where the top two plots are for the cumulative number of infection and the bottom plots are for per day infection. The solid red lines represent the actual data[59,61] while the blue solid lines are obtained using differential equations (Eq.(13)). To compare the effectiveness of projection from the model results, in the bottom two figures we also plot the actual data for the whole range along with its fitted results through Eq. (1). As can be observed from this figure that the proposed differential equations (Eq.(13)) can project the future time evolution trajectories of the number of infection with a correct trend for next few weeks quite reliably. For New York City the projection is for 21 days t s i (= 76 \u2212 55) and the trend of the projected trajectory goes even beyond that.",

With further analysis our finding is that Brazil is now at the early stage of mitigation at its first wave of infection. The mitigation period has possibly started around day 91 (around the beginning of June) assuming t 0 of infection as March 05, 2020.

Till March 03, the number of infected patients was limited to 6, but after that it started to rise as many infected travelers returned to India from various parts of the world. To reduce the widespread infection of this virus, the Government of India had imposed a lockdown starting on March 24, which was subsequently extended till May 30. After then un-lockdown has started in phases at different sectors to balance the economic slowdown. Many of its states and cities have demarcated the containment zones and are periodically imposing further lockdown measures at those places (some time a few days in a week to a more than a week at a stretch) to contain the infection spread.

Our model suggests that the infection can be contained substantially with the current measures against disease spread, and by the end of September to the beginning of October it can be reduced to 250 per day with a cumulative infected population within 160-180 thousand. However, adequate precaution must be taken even after that considering the large unaffected population and regular migration, particularly as the city is trying to come back to its regular life.4. USAAt the end of this work, we analyze the data on Covid-19 infected population of USA.It is also a populous country with a large number of big cities with large population. Wehave already analyzed the data on New York City in the subsections A and B above. To be noted that the infected population of New York City has already reached the saturation period (stage 3 of Eq. (1), see Figs. 5 and 6). However, unlike New York City, currently in many places in USA, the number of infected population are increasing quite rapidly. In fact, the data on USA is quite interesting and has a unique feature which shows a big jump in the number of infected population from a situation where there was a clear pattern of Time evolution trajectories of the Covid-19 infected population (cumulative and differential) for Delhi are shown. The red filled circles are actual data from Ref. [68]. Data up to July 26 are used to obtain parameters for Eqs. (1) and (13), and projections for future evolution are shown by black and blue lines with allowed values in the parameter space. The blue band shows 95% confidence intervals. reduction in the number of infected cases. Unlike many European countries and New York City, the trajectory of the number of infected population in USA does not move towards the saturation period. Rather it looks like a new wave of infection has started with another initial power-law-rise increment and subsequent mitigation. For a contagious disease this must be related to the change in measures against the disease spread by a large population.InFig. 16, we plot the cumulative number on infected population [1, 69] with the effective starting date (t 0 ) as February 27, 2020. Similar to most of the previous countries, this data also shows an exponential increment followed by a power-law-rise, as in Eq. (1a). A simultaneous fit with both forms yields \u03b1 e i = 0.3075 and \u03b1 i = 2.744. This suggests, while the early rise is much faster than many other countries the power-law rise was much slower. One needs to remember that a substantial contribution of this part of the data came from New York City for which \u03b1 e i = 0.5810 and \u03b1 i = 1.619. One can argue from these two exponents that the lockdown effect of New York City may have played a key role against the fast rise of US infection at the earlier months of the infection. As mentioned earlier, one can observe from the figure that the data after crossing about 100 days (with t 0 at Feb 27, 2020) shows a unique feature: instead of slowing down with the expected trajectory, as was observed in most other countries, the number of infection surges once more with a power-law-rise form.",

The total infection time can broadly be divided into three periods: i) initial increment with an exponential rate followed by a power-law rise or simply a power-law rise from the beginning, ii) a mitigation period and iii) a saturation period. Of course, the transitions from one period to the next one is a smooth cross-over without any discontinuity. We propose a mathematical model for the time evolution of the number of infected population and show that it can very well track the number of infected population at various affected regions, from the initial days to saturation period. Based on the proposed mathematical trajectory we then formulate a set of differential equations which can equally well describe the same time evolution. The parameters of the model (for both the mathematical trajectory (Eq. (1)) and differential equations (Eq.(13)) are extracted by dynamically performing a simultaneous \u03c7 2 -minimization against the available data. Our proposed model is then employed to project the probable number of infected population in future till the saturation period is reached. To demonstrate the predictive ability of the model we use a subset of the data and show that using the proposed model we can project the future time evolution of the number of total infected population from a week to a month and even more. Projection from this model can be progressively improved by including more and more data. However, it is based on the assumption that the existing measures against the disease spread remain to be the same throughout this period and the affected region is isolated (i.e., new infections are not coming from outside). Aftervalidation and showing the predictive ability of our model, we analyze the similar data on a number of other countries where Covid-19 infection is currently increasing rapidly. We observe that for Russia the per day infection has already peaked around May 10, and it is heading towards the onset of saturation period. With the continuation of the existing measures against the disease spread, we expect to see the onset of saturation period by the end of September to the beginning of October with less than 500 infections per day and the cumulative number of infected population around 0.95 \u2212 1.1 million.
