It has been widely acknowledged that the most effective public policy to mitigate the pandemic is social and physical distancing: keeping at least six feet away from people, working from home, closing non-essential businesses, etc. There have been a lot of anecdotal evidences floating around, suggesting that social distancing has a causal effect on disease mitigation; however, few studies have investigated the effect of social distancing on disease mitigation in a transparent and statistically-sound manner. We propose to conduct a matched observational study using the U.S. Health Weather Map data by Kinsa Inc., the Social Distancing Scoreboard data by Unacast Inc., and the U.S. census data by the U.S. Census Bureau. Methods and Analysis We propose to perform an optimal non-bipartite matching to pair counties with similar observed covariates but vastly different average social distancing scores during the first week (March 16th through Match 22nd) of President's 15 Days to Slow the Spread campaign. We have produced a total of 302 pairs of two U.S. counties with good covariate balance on a total of 16 important variables. Our primary outcome will be the average observed illness collected by Kinsa Inc. two weeks after the intervention period. Although the observed illness does not directly measure COVID-19, it reflects a real-time aspect of the pandemic, and unlike confirmed cases, it is much less confounded by counties' testing capabilities. We also consider observed illness three weeks after the intervention period as a secondary outcome. We will test a proportional treatment effect using a randomization-based test with covariance adjustment and conduct a sensitivity analysis.",

With moderate number of observed covariates, this task becomes impractical. Instead, we aim to create two groups of counties that are very similar in the mean of each observed covariate. This is known as covariate balance, and we can assess the quality of the match by looking at the standardized difference in the mean of each covariate in the treated and the matched control group. Moreover, we can run a two-sample t-test for each covariate to assess if there is any systematic, statistically significant, difference that is residual after matching. We would aim for a match that has standardized differences of all variables less than 0.1, and roughly only 1 out of 20 p-values less than 0.05.",

In the context of non-bipartite matching, we may strengthen the matched pair difference in the continuous treatment and eliminate some units by adding sinks (Lu et al., 2001) . To eliminate e counties, e sinks are added to the dataset before matching, with distance between each sink and each county equal to 0, and the distance between each pair of sinks equal to infinity.

Table 1 summarizes the covariate balance and average social distancing scores of the treated and control groups. We form a total of 302 pairs of two counties using optimal non-bipartite matching, which roughly corresponds to using 40% of all counties in the US. We observe no statistically significant difference among the treated and control groups in any of the 16 observed covariates adjusted for. The average social distancing score of the treated group is 1.17, corresponding to a letter grade slightly better than D (which translates to more than 40% decrease in the distance traveled and more than 60% decrease in the visits to non-essential venues.). On the other hand, the average score is 0.29 for the control group, corresponding to a letter grad slightly better than F . Figure 3 further plots the distribution of the treated-minus-control difference of the social distancing scores. The median treated-minus-control difference in the social distancing scores is 0.80. The match and the balance table are available via author's Github page: https://github. com/bzhangupenn/Social_Distancing_Match. the magnitudes of all standardized differences are less than 0.1, and all p-values larger than 0.1, suggesting no systematic difference between the encouraged and control groups. The average social distancing score of the treated group is 1.17, corresponding to more than 40% reduction in travel. The average social distancing score of the control group is 0.29, roughly corresponding to less than 25% reduction in travel.
