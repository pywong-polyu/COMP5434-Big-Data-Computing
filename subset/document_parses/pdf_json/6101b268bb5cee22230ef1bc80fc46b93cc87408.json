In a study conducted in England among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, VDD was associated with greater disease severity. The study indicated that a higher prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) was observed in patients requiring intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission compared to patients managed on medical wards (24) . A retrospective cohort study in Switzerland found significantly lower 25(OH)D levels in COVID-19 positive patients compared with negative patients (14) .

Moreover, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that improving vitamin D status has been associated with a reduced risk of upper or lower respiratory tract infections (13) . The possible role of vitamin D in infectious diseases like COVID-19 is explained by its regulatory role on acquired and innate immunity (33) . Evidence also indicated that vitamin D might help in the treatment of COVID-19 by preventing the cytokine storm and subsequent ARDS which is commonly the cause of mortality (29, 34) . The pooled estimate showed that subjects with VDD were 80 % more likely to acquire COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.80; 95% CI: 1.72, 1.88), which is in line with the previous meta-analysis where vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency participants were at increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.00-2.05) (35) . Besides, Ilie et al. reported that vitamin D levels are severely low in COVID-19 positive individuals and found a negative correlation between levels of mean vitamin D and COVID-19 infection (11) .",

Low plasma 25(OH) D level appears to be an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection and hospitalization There was no a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and risk of COVID-19 infection Significantly lower 25(OH)D levels were found in COVID-19 patients (median value 11.1 ng/mL) patients compared with control groups (24.6 ng/mL). Vitamin D3 supplementation would be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 infection, in preventing more severe symptomatology and/or in reducing the presence of the virus in the upper respiratory tract and making the patients less infectious The level of serum 25(OH) vitamin D was significantly lower in COVID-19 positive patients (p = 0.02) and the results demonstrated that there was a significant relationship between the levels of serum 25(OH) vitamin D and the vulnerability to COVID-19Vitamin D deficiency is one of the main predisposing factors associated with the vulnerability to coronavirus infection in the Iranian population",
