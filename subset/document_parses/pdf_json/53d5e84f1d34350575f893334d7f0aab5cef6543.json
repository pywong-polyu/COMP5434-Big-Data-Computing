We examine the potential additional risk of adverse events 28 days after the first dose of CoronaVac or Comirnaty imposed by multimorbidity. Using a territorywide public healthcare database with population-based vaccination records in Hong Kong, we analyze a retrospective cohort of patients with chronic conditions. Thirty adverse events of special interest according to the World Health Organization are examined. In total, 883,416 patients are included and 2,807 (0.3%) develop adverse events. Results suggest vaccinated patients have lower risks of adverse events than unvaccinated individuals, multimorbidity is associated with increased risks regardless of vaccination, and the association of vaccination with adverse events is not modified by multimorbidity. To conclude, we find no evidence that multimorbidity imposes extra risks of adverse events following Covid-19 vaccination.",

Previous research before the pandemic has shown a potential risk increase of cardiovascular events and other adverse outcomes in people living with multimorbidity compared with those without 16, 17 . Specifically, the complex underlying mechanisms of the co-occurrence of multiple health conditions and multiple medications have been found to be related to increased adverse drug reactions [18] [19] [20] . Established evidence shows that varying degrees of inflammation may typically be induced by vaccination and the associated immune responses in general 21 , cautious pharmacovigilance is indeed warranted for people with multimorbidity who are at a higher risk of adverse health outcomes to begin with. Of note, people living with multimorbidity are at increased risk of serious complications following an infection of SARS-CoV-2 22 . It is currently unclear if multimorbidity is related to a risk increase of any AESI following Covid-19 vaccination. Nevertheless, existing research comparing the relationship between vaccination and AESI across sub-populations with and without multimorbidity is limited, rendering the risk and benefit assessment for the vaccination of the multimorbid populations inconclusive.",

This observation is in line with the official guidelines published by the Hong Kong Government only recommending that patients living with chronic conditions receive the vaccine if their conditions are under stable control 27 . Our results may not be applicable to recipients who had poorly controlled chronic conditions. In fact, the vaccination rate among the age group of \u226580 was as low as 16.9% as of 9 November 2021 28 . Nevertheless, even with this potential bias towards an inverse association of vaccines with AESI, there should be no impact on our key result of no stronger association of vaccines with AESI across multimorbidity status. This is because this bias should apply to both patients with multimorbidity and patients with only one listed condition. If multimorbidity does impose additional AESI risk following vaccination, the test for effect modification (interaction in Model 3) should still be able to detect this risk increase.",

Nonetheless, current post-marketing research in this regard is still limited and accruing 29 . In fact, to the best of our knowledge, no research has examined the role of multimorbidity in the potential risk elevation of AESI. In a protocol template for electronic healthcare databases monitoring under the vACCine covid-19 monitoring readinESS (ACCESS) project funded by the European Medicines Agency 31 , it was recommended that specific at-risk disease groups be examined individually with multimorbidity excluded from analyses. While this recommended approach may contribute to more specific information about the risk profile of vaccines for specific disease groups, it is far from ideal to disregard the presence of a significant proportion of patients with more than one condition. According to a systematic review, global community prevalence of multimorbidity is estimated at approximately one-third 32 . Any research excluding multimorbid patients has limited generalizability to this significant proportion of populations. As far as we are aware, this is the first post-marketing pharmacovigilance study testing for a potential AESI risk elevation associated with multimorbidity. Interestingly, we observed when the analysis was confined to AESI recorded in the inpatient setting, the increase of AESI risks associated with multimorbidity regardless of vaccination was greater although the confidence intervals overlapped and differences were non-significant. This may be because those AESI requiring tertiary care were more severe than the more broadly defined ones. Subject to further international research to replicate and verify our results, the implications of this study are important to reassure the public with regard to the widespread concern about vaccine safety among individuals living with multimorbidity who might be hesitant towards vaccine uptake 33 . First, the incidence of AESI was rare even among a cohort of 883,416, with an incidence rate of 51.5 (95% CI 49.6-53.4) per 1000 person-years. Second, we showed that although multimorbidity was associated with a higher risk of AESI, this association was independent of Covid-19 vaccination. Given the fact that people with multimorbidity have a higher risk of developing life-threatening complications if infected with SARS-CoV-2 34 , our results should be reassuring and support the notion that multimorbidity does not impose an additional risk of AESI following vaccination and that the vaccination of these vulnerable citizens should be prioritized.",

Second, a variety of sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. Third, vaccine safety with regard to underlying multimorbidity, especially the safety profile of CoronaVac, was little investigated and this study provides preliminary evidence on this under-researched topic. Despite these strengths, there are several limitations to this study as well. First, we only had access to public healthcare databases and patients whose chronic conditions were managed in the private sectors were not included. There may be potential underascertainment in people only using private healthcare services as a result. However, since Hong Kong does not have a comprehensive publicly funded primary care system, the majority of chronic diseases are managed by the specialist outpatient clinics of the HA. Previous research has suggested that a vast majority of chronic disease patients in Hong Kong had typically used public services and the number of omitted patients should have limited impact on the results 35 . In addition, both inpatient ICD-9 and outpatient ICPC-2 were used to operationalize underlying conditions to minimize the omission of patients. Second, AESI may be handled in settings beyond public healthcare in the city, such as the private sector or overseas. Nevertheless, in terms of the number of hospital admissions that are warranted for most of the included AESI, the HA constitutes~80% of the market share in Hong Kong 36 . Third, residual confounding such as the healthy user bias observed in the study is probably because the variety of covariates considered in the analysis may not be sufficiently wide subject to data availability. Specifically, the inclusion of socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection as covariates would be of great value to further research. Fourth, similar to other large-scale pharmacovigilance studies using electronic medical record databases, we only relied on the diagnostic codes and other records for the operationalization of the diseases despite the demonstrated accuracy of those codes 37 , and specifically to distinguish between overlapping AESI and preexisting chronic conditions. Last, the fact that the vulnerable populations living with chronic conditions are being vaccinated less proactively in Hong Kong compared with other societies may limit the generalizability of the findings. Also, as the population of Hong Kong is predominantly Chinese, replication of the analyses in other world populations is warranted.",

Second, we replicated the analysis on only those who were vaccinated on or before 3 July 2021 to allow all patients to have at least 28 days of observation. Third, we replicated the main analysis on those with only ICD-9 diagnoses in our records, with multimorbidity status replaced by the Charlson Comorbidity Index scores 44 to take into consideration the severity of diseases. Fourth, we replicated the analysis with AESI outcomes defined by inpatient records only and excluded outpatient records to minimize misclassification of follow-up visits in the outpatient setting. Fifth, we replicated the analysis with patients with a hospitalization record within six months prior to the baseline removed. Sixth, we replaced the dichotomous multimorbidity status as an effect modifier with the number of listed chronic conditions, a continuous independent variable. Seventh, a replication of the analysis was conducted with Poisson regression to generate incidence rate ratios for each outcome. Eighth, we used propensity score-based generalized boosted model for an alternative weighting method for the analyses using the same R package, i.e. 'WeightIt'.
