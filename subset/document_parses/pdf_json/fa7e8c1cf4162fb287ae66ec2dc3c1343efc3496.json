The outcome was physically active behavior measured by performing a minimum of 150 min of physical exercise per week. The independent variables were social and psychological characteristics, lifestyle and health. Cox regression was applied to estimate the prevalence ratio (PR). There are 29,666 (48.3%; 95% CI 47.0-50.0) participants reported having NCD. Not being a smoker or alcoholic, living in an urban area (PR = 1.44; CI95% 1.23-1.68/PR = 1.38; CI95% 1.08-1.75), having informal social support (PR = 1.26; CI95% 1.10-1.44/PR = 1.19; CI95% 1.05-1.34), A social class (PR = 0.43; CI95% 0.25-0.73/PR = 0.46; CI95% 0.26-0.80), high schooling (PR = 0.34; CI95% 0.23-0.51/PR = 0.33; CI95% 0.24-0.46) as well as paid work (PR = 0.87; CI95% 0.78-0.96/PR = 0.89; CI95% 0.79-0.99) are more associated with active lifestyle in both groups. However, only in the group without NCD, the male sex (PR = 1.42; CI95% 1.28-1.57), no having some disability (PR = 1.31; CI95% 1.03-1.66) and having private health insurance (PR = 1.26; CI95% 1.13-1.41) were more associated with active behavior, while in the group with NCD, being elderly (PR = 1.22; CI95% 1.05-1.42), not be white (PR = 0.85; CI95% 0.77-0.95) and not having restful sleep (PR = 1.23; CI95% 1.08-1.40) are associated with active lifestyle. People with and without NCD in Brazil have very close active behavior, however, some biopsychosocial factors such as: sex, age, lifestyle, socioeconomic level are unevenly associated with the active lifestyle in the groups. Thus, therapeutic or preventive proposals as well as public policies for health promotion must observe these distinctions when elaborating their actions.",

In this perspective, Wang et al. 2020 22 evaluated the effect of social support on the level of physical activity, finding that the greater the support from family, friends and partners, the better the level of physical activity and the greater the self-efficacy. The specific social support for physical activity is an important factor that helps mainly the elderly to be physically active 23 , which is the case of the NCD group in this study, which comprises a higher proportion of elderly people.",

These habitsare less associated with active lifestyle in our study, which also contributes to the decline in quality of life and health, with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases, mainly in men 24 . People who smoke are more likely to present respiratory symptoms and lower levels of physical activity than people who do not smoke 24, 25 . Physical exercise is a strong ally in the process of smoking cessation, because the practice of physical exercises provides positive effects in reducing withdrawal symptoms and impulsivity, thus suggesting a double effect direction and the need to encourage adherence to an active lifestyle 26 . Similar to this situation, people who live in the urban area show higher prevalence in the practice of physical activity, when compared to the rural area, regardless of whether or not they have NCDs. Rural people inevitably have structural constraints, such as the absence of specific environments for the practice of physical activity, higher interaction with other determinants such as tobacco and alcohol abuse, the perception that human work is enough and diet, that is better than urban areas 27, 28 , which can interfere in the understanding of the importance of the practice of planned physical activity as a protective health measure. This context reinforces the idea that the intensity of work can influence the practice of recreational physical activity 29 .",

In this study, it was observed that a perception of health as good or regular is associated with a more active lifestyle. It is a positive feedback, in which the more active a person is, the better the self-perception of one's own health and vice versa 31, 32 . This is an indicator of vitality and it must be measured individually and collectively in order to estimate how healthy the person and the population are 33 . Even with NCDs, individuals with a good perception of health are able to be more active, which may minimize their activity limitations and generate relevant social and economic impact 34 . The same occurs for those without NCDs, in this case the main idea is the prevention of these conditions. Unlike the biopsychosocial characteristics discussed so far, the participant's sex also demonstrated influence, but only in the group without NCDs, where the sedentary pattern is more common in female individuals, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ compared to males. Considering the Brazilian adult population, 44.8% do not reach a satisfying level of physical activity, this percentage is higher among women than men 30 . Women experience more barriers to the practice of physical activity like race, age, income 34 and motivation 35 distinct from men, which is reduced according to the increase in the education level [33] [34] [35] [36] . This was also one of our findings, when we observed that those with higher education or graduate degrees are more active. This inequality does not seem to be related to biological but to social issues, as there is no evidence that the anatomophysiological composition of female individuals prevents them from having physically active behavior 34, 35 . Furthermore, women who perceive and receive little social support related to the practice of physical exercise have a negative impact on quality of life, emphasizing that social support should be perceived as a determinant of people's health, by health services, by the community, through the several social actors, including family members, friends, neighbors, religious groups and health professionals 37, 38 , which supports the statement that it is a gender issue and not biological conditioning.",

A practice of weekly physical activity of moderate intensity tends to decrease with age and the presence of morbidities. The negative association between being elderly and active lifestyle in individuals with NCDs reported in this study is very worrying, considering that there is a great loss of physiological functions such as strength, balance and cognition that leads to the worsening of the progression stages of NCDs 38 , reinforced by the social stigmatization that elderly people suffer from the false assumptions of their potential fragility for physical exercise, the need for permanent rest and that their functional independence is minimal 39 .",

In this way, hypothetically, it is possible to suggest that the encouragement and performance of planned physical practices such as leisure and well-being actions have a higher frequency among those with higher education because these people better understand the importance of this practice for physical and mental health and social. Complementarily, a higher income could provide easier access to goods and services for the planning and execution of practical activities of sport and leisure, as well as more time for inclusion of these programs in the routines of wealthier people 40 .",

Probably, the highest proportion of elderly people in the NCDs group prevent them from having access to insurance due to the higher fees charged for this age group, which does not make the association in this group significant. Another plausible scenario is that a quick and wide access to the diversified option of health professionals in specialized health services made possible by private insurance may facilitate adherence to the physically active lifestyle, which results in higher levels of physical activity only in the group without NCDs 34, 41, 42 .",

The study by Silva and Boing only considered individuals diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes and/or hypercholesterolemia, whereas our study analyzes the entire spectrum of NCDs with more than 20 diseases. In addition, that study makes an important error in estimating the association between outcome and factors based on the odds ratio (OR) by logistic regression. When the outcome has high prevalence (> 10%), OR cannot be used as a proxy for the prevalence ratio (PR) because point estimates are oversized and interval estimates are extended, producing inaccurate results. The best alternative would be a robust Poisson or Cox regression. As for the study by Mielke et al. 49 , this is a descriptive study, only presenting the magnitude of physical activity practice and sedentary habits in the sample of adults, without raising any inference about the factors implicating these behaviors.",
