Under the influence of these technologies, the traditional development model of the financial industry has changed. Furthermore, scholars have done studies involving theories and applications. To examine FinTech adoption and use from the technology acceptance perspective, Singh et al. (2020) proposed a research framework by adding substructures of the technology acceptance model. The FinTech ecosystem consisting of FinTech startups, technology developers, government, financial customers, and traditional financial institutions was presented by Lee and Shin (2018) . Accordingly, the application of FinTech has been involved in many areas, such as mobile payment (Gomber et al. 2018) , mobile networks (Gai et al. 2016; Wen et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013; Zhang and Soong 2004) , big data (Yin and Gai 2015) , blockchain (Wamba et al. 2020; Iman 2018) , P2P lending (Gomber et al. 2018; Ge et al. 2017; Suryono et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2020a, b) , cloud computing (Castiglione et al. 2015; Gai et al. 2018a, b) , banking service, investment funds, retail groups, and telecom operators (Singh et al. 2020) , image processing (Castiglione et al. 2007) , and data analysis techniques (Qiu et al. 2015) .",

Trading and investment strategies based on artificial intelligence and big data can redefine the price discovery mechanism of the financial market and improve transaction speed, promoting the liquidity of the financial market and enhancing the efficiency and stability of the financial market. Regulators analyze, warn, and prevent systemic risks in the financial market more efficiently. Additionally, the smart FinTech helps save labor costs and reduce staff duplication by combining big data with artificial intelligence. Next, the development and application of FinTech help more people, especially the poor, obtain financial services at a lower cost and more conveniently, and share more reform results. Moreover, because of the \"Belt and Road\", many countries share the achievements of FinTech. For example, our country's mobile payment helps the economic and financial development of countries along the \"Belt and Road\".",

The explosive growth and the advantages of bringing great convenience to economic management activities have prompted us to conduct a comprehensive analysis and explore the current challenges and opportunities facing the field of FinTech. It is essential for scholars who are interested in this field to conduct better and more indepth research. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis helps investigate the development track characteristics and disclose statistical patterns through bibliometric analysis (Borgman and Furner 2002; Wang et al. 2018 ). Furthermore, this paper investigated the current research hot topics, identified the challenges, and predicted the future development trends.",

Bibliometric analysis has been widely applied in different research areas, such as bitcoin (Merediz-Sol\u00e0 and Bariviera 2019), blockchain (Miau and Yang 2018) , fuzzy decision making (Liu and Liao 2017) , deep learning (Li et al. 2020) , social sciences (Nasir et al. 2020) , business and economics (Merigo et al. 2016) , COVID-19 (Lou et al. 2020) , financial innovation (Li and Xu 2021) , poverty cycles (Qin et al. 2021), blockchain and cryptocurrency (Nasir et al. 2021) , and journals (European Journal of Operational Research (Laengle et al. 2017) , Information Sciences (Yu et al. 2017) , IEEE Transaction on Fuzzy Systems (Yu et al. 2018) , Environmental Impact Assessment Review (Nita 2019) , and International Journal of Systems Science ). The two visualization tools, i.e., CiteSpace and Vosviewer, can assist the bibliometric method in revealing the static and dynamic characteristics of FinTech publications from various aspects. For example, the co-occurrence network of author keywords demonstrates the main research topics; the citation and co-citation analysis highlight the top influential objects; the burst detection analysis and timeline view can exhibit changes in a certain period. These processes are called science mapping analysis (Van Eck and Waltman 2010; Cobo et al. 2011) .",

This paper used the bibliometric analysis method to evaluate the development of Fin-Tech documents from the following aspects: (1) start with the types and annual publications with significant indexes (such as numbers and rates), the distribution among different countries/regions, and important branches. Moreover, the productive countries/regions, institutions, journals, and authors are assessed by several recognized indicators, including the total number of publications (TP), the total number of citations (TC), the average citations per publications (AC), and H-index. (2) With statistics and visualization tools, the science mapping analysis is conducted to deeply master the characteristics of FinTech documents, such as the dynamic development trend. CiteSpace and Vosviewer, as two mature visualization tools, effectively illustrate the inner relationship of documents and visualize them in different ways, such as clustering and dynamic timeline (Chen 2006; Stopar and Bartol 2019; Kou et al. 2014) . Through several bibliometric methods, including co-occurrence analysis, timeline analysis, burst detection and co-authorship analysis, this paper presented the keyword situation, citations, and cooperation networks of countries/regions and institutions on FinTech research. The whole process of bibliometric analysis in the field of FinTech can be illustrated in Fig. 1 . ",

We obtained 389 author keywords by setting the minimum number of occurrences of a keyword to 2 and merging financial technology and financial technologies into FinTech. The high-frequency keywords with the close co-occurrence relationship in the field of FinTech are shown in Fig. 6b by setting the minimum number of occurrences of a keyword to 10. In Fig. 6a , the nodes denote the author keywords, and the sizes mean the occurrences. The link between two keywords reflects that the two keywords appear in one paper simultaneously. The thickness of the lines between nodes means the number of co-occurrences of the two keywords. Specifically, the frequency of \"FinTech\" is 385 with 338 links (338 keywords appear with it) and 1,106 total link strength (a total of 1,106 times). \"blockchain\" has 98 occurrences and ranks second, followed by \"financial inclusion\" with 36, \"innovation\" with 36, \"cryptocurrency\" with 34, and \"bitcoin\" with 29.

There are a total of 86 countries/regions, and we selected 62 terms by setting the minimum number of documents of a country to 2 and presented the closest cooperation network, including 52 terms. They are divided into 11 clusters, and different colors represent different categories. In Fig. 8 , the nodes represent the countries/regions, and the sizes of the nodes denote the number of documents. The links between two nodes denote that they have a cooperative relationship with each other. The thicker the link is, the greater their collaboration. The most cooperative countries/regions in each category are the United States, China, England, Russia, Australia, Canada, and South Korea, respectively. The United States is the most cooperative and often cooperates with China, which can be reflected by the links between them. From the perspective of TP and TC of the United States and China, the importance of cooperation is clear. There are 1,048 institutions in the field of FinTech. Figure 9 presents the cooperative relationship networks of all institutions and the closest network of 333 institutions. In Fig. 9 , the sizes of the nodes present the number of documents. The gray nodes indicate that the articles published by these institutions in the field of FinTech were not done in cooperation with other institutions. To improve the TP and TC of publications in this area, cooperation urgently needs to enhance. In the closest cooperation network, the size of the node represents the number of total link strengths. As a result, Singapore Management University is the most cooperative institution, and its total link strength is 38 related to 8 documents with 81 citations. The University of Minnesota System (its total link strength, related documents, and citations are 32, 6, and 81, respectively), New York University (32, 6, and 77), City University of Hong Kong (32, 7, and 56), and the City University of New York (30, 4, and 61) follow. Even though they are not in the top 5 most productive institutions list, their influence is at a higher level. Moreover, only one journal, i.e., Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, has published a paper cited more than 100. The paper is, The economics of mobile payments: Understanding stakeholder issues for an emerging financial technology application. It examined a new technology application, in association with the revolution in wireless connectivity, i.e., mobile payments (Au and Kauffman 2008). Similarly, the number of articles posted by authors is scattered. The authors who have published more than 5 papers are DW Arner, RP Buckley, RJ Kauffman, SH Huang, D Wojcik, and J Zhang. Among them, the work of RJ Fig. 9 The cooperation networks of institutions (generated using Vosviewer on data) Table 5 The top 10 productive journals The cooperation network is shown in Fig. 10 . Setting the threshold to 2 means the minimum number of documents of an author. We obtained the closest network (Fig. 9a ) from the complete cooperation network (Fig. 10b) . According to the above analysis, the spirit of cooperation is worth promoting to enhance the influence of publications and authors.",

Citation explains the number of times the author has been cited, and co-citation reflects that two authors/journals/references/sources are cited in one paper simutaneously. According to Vosviewer, we obtained 138 authors out of 2,025 based on the minimum number of documents of an author (i.e., the threshold is 2), and 90 cited authors out of 20,877 based on the minimum number of citations of an author (i.e., the threshold is 20). The citation network and co-citation network are presented in Fig. 11 . 79 of 138 cited authors constitute the closest citation network. They are divided into 7 clusters. The nodes and their sizes denote the authors and the citation degree, respectively. The greater the node, the more times the author is cited. 89 of the 90 cited authors constitute the closest co-citation network and are divided into 6 clusters.

Of the 848 publications, I Lee published only one paper, FinTech: Ecosystem, business models, investment decisions, and challenges. It introduced a historical view of FinTech; discussed the ecosystem of the FinTech sector, various FinTech business models, and investment types; and illustrated real options for FinTech investment decisions (Lee and Shin 2018) . The paper, FinTech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks, published by G Buchak, studied the contributions of regulatory differences and technological advantages to the growth of the shadow bank market (Buchak et al. 2018 ). FinTech has widespread applications in various fields and is still expanding. According to CiteSpace, 14 journals have been cited frequently in a certain period ( Table 9 ). The citation frequency for most of the journals has increased since 2016. The strength of the Financial Times is the strongest with a value of 8.2555. Financial Times is a newspaper edited in London and has a strong influence on the financial policies of the British government. For academic journals, the strength of the Harvard Business Review is the strongest with 5.2399. It focuses on leadership, organizational change, negotiation, strategy, operations, marketing, finance, and managing Next, we studied the relationship between references related to FinTech. Based on CiteSpace, the reference network is constructed as shown in Fig. 15 . Similarly, the red node is the reference with the strongest citation burst. There is only one reference with the strongest citation burst (its strength is 3.6071), i.e., Social media analytics for enterprise: typology, methods and processes. It provided an overview of social media analytics for managers (Lee 2018) , and was published on Business Horizons in 2018. As listed in Table 10 , the duration result begins in 2019 and continues to 2021, which reflects that its influence is continuing in the field of FinTech.",

In light of countries/regions, China has the greatest number of publications, which can be illustrated by the advanced technological environment of China, such as the convenient mobile payment and intelligent life. Meanwhile, it is expected to achieve the progress of citations (see Fig. 3 and Table 2 ). The research hotspots of this field are clear. It can be reflected from different angles: (1) from the top productive countries/ regions (see Table 3 ), their research topics concentrate on the blockchain, P2P lending, financial inclusion and regulation; (2) from the popular journals (see Fig. 13 ), Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, Journal of Management Information Systems, and Financial Innovation are the top influential journals. Their research focuses on e-commerce, digital economy, blockchain, big data, and banking; (3) from the timeline view of author keywords (see Fig. 7 ), and it not only presents the popular topics but also illustrates their time. Furthermore, burst detection analysis and overlay analysis give impetus to the scholars who are interested in FinTech to grasp the dynamic changes more intuitively.
