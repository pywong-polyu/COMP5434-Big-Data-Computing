Our main focus is on the producers' decision whether or not to reveal the degree of social responsibility of their product.

However, when the informational content of disclosure is imperfect, social responsibility in the market is significantly lower than under full transparency. Our results highlight an important role for transparent and standardized information about social externalities.",

            "text": "The social responsibility (SR) of products and their production processes is a central topic of many public controversies. Prime examples are the accusation of deficiencies in working conditions (e.g., in garment factories), damaging environmental effects (e.g., in CO 2 emissions), or a lack of sustainability in production (e.g., in using non-recyclable plastics). While there seems to be an increasing awareness of consumers about the wider social impact of the purchase of many products, suggestive evidence points at overall levels of SR in markets being fairly low. 1 The existing literature, however, shows that it is not that consumers do not care at all about SR, but instead exhibit a significant increase in their willingness-to-pay for these types of products. 2 Then how does this square with the idea that in many industries SR products often only have very small market shares? If consumers care about the social responsibility of the purchased products, this should be a relevant dimension for firms to compete in, and firms offering SR products should have a competitive advantage. This argument, however, relies on the assumption that consumers can assess the social impact of a product. Yet, typically SR is not a directly visible characteristic of the product, but one that needs to be actively revealed by the seller, like, for example, the working conditions in the production process. Although in some domains revelation of the SR in production through producer declarations seems an appropriate solution (e.g., declaration of a piece of furniture to be free of tropical timber), in many cases incentives for providing non-truthful specifications are strong and hardly verifiable (e.g., due to complex opaque production chains). In such cases, labels certifying SR in production may be a powerful solution. The multiplicity of labels has tremendously increased in recent years. Some labels address single issues, like the energy efficiency class of an electric appliance, while others cover multiple facets. For example, fair trade as well as animal welfare are two dimensions of social responsibility where a large number of different labels for seemingly similar issues exist. 3 Arguably, if the externalities of products are measured in various different ways by considering various different facets, this considerably lowers the informational content of those labels for consumers.",

In the experiment, our proxy for SR is a monetary transfer to the charity unicef. Each seller chooses the price at which he offers the product, and an amount (also referred to as \"donation\" below) to be transferred to unicef in case he sells the product to a consumer. Donations do not influence the consumer's monetary benefit from the product, but the vast majority of participants in our experiment consider unicef a charity worth supporting. Higher donations incur higher monetary costs for the seller. 4 To get a nuanced picture we study various scenarios in our experimental treatments. Our benchmark cases are that customers are either completely ignorant (No INfo) or fully informed (full INfo) about the donation associated with the product (i.e. the SR of the product). The degree of information (either none or full) is externally enforced and neither producers nor customers can change this. The full INfo case mirrors a situation in which, for example, regulation requires an unambiguous declaration of the SR characteristic of the product, e.g. the specification of the energy efficiency class of a light bulb or a fridge.",

            "text": "Three further ChoICe treatments mimic situations in which producers can choose to reveal the SR information of their product to customers (e.g., by certification through a label), but revelation is potentially imperfect. The ChoICe treatments vary the degree of the imperfection of this revelation. In treatment ChoICe-100 customers unambiguously see the information whenever a producer decides to reveal the SR information. This resembles the case of a (standardized) label and customers that are aware of what this label certifies (e.g., declaration of the absence of tropical timber). In treatments ChoICe-85 and ChoICe-60 the producer also decides whether or not to reveal the SR information, but -in case of a revelation decision -both the revelation decision and the revealed SR information may not reach the consumer (in ChoICe-85 there is a 85 percent chance that the revelation decision and SR information reaches consumers and there is a 60 percent chance in ChoICe-60). These two treatments are designed to map situations in which the producer faces an uncertainty whether his SR information reaches the consumers. Reasons for this uncertainty may be that consumers do not get the informational content of the provided information, e.g., due to a lack of standardization or limited attention of consumers. Hence, in treatments ChoICe-85 and ChoICe-60, a consumer facing non-disclosed information does not know whether the producer chose not to disclose or whether he disclosed, but the information was not transmitted. This means that while strategically sophisticated buyers should interpret undisclosed donations in ChoICe-100 as zero donations, this is no longer the case in ChoICe-85 and ChoICe-60. The unreliability of disclosure provides strategic incentives to producers to offer products with a lower level of social responsibility compared to ChoICe-100 where buyers can rely on nondisclosure being fully reliable.",

            "text": "In a nutshell, our results show that disclosure of SR information has large and positive effects compared to a regime where producers are unable to disclose the social responsibility of their products to consumers (No INfo) . We find that when voluntary disclosure provides unambiguous information for customers (ChoICe-100), the level of social responsibility comes close to the outcome under full and externally enforced disclosure (full INfo). While this is, in general, positive news when trying to establish more socially responsible markets, our results for the cases where disclosure is imperfect show the limitations of such an approach. When producers cannot be sure that the provided SR information has full informational content for consumers (ChoICe-85 and ChoICe-60), SR in production is significantly lower compared to full INfo. Yet, since our data does not provide an unambiguous statistical difference between the three choice treatments, the sensitivity of social responsibility to changes in the disclosure probability cannot be precisely determined. Furthermore, we show that producers benefit from more opaque information environments via higher profits. They produce products at lower cost, while selling them with a higher mark-up, taking advantage of the reduced competition in the market.",

            "text": "Our results have important implications for the understanding of markets with a social externality. In particular, they can provide guidance for policy makers and regulators interested in increasing socially responsible production or products. This is true in particular for environments where there is scope for \"demand-driven\" social responsibility, i.e., markets where consumers care about the social impact of the product they purchase and have enough influence to affect sellers' production choices. Then, competitive markets can deliver high levels of social responsibility, but only when transparency and clarity of the latter is enforced. Since such strict policies may be impractical to implement, we show that voluntary disclosure, which requires little regulatory intervention, seems to be a viable alternative to also achieve high levels of SR. However, our results also indicate that this is not true if producers can disclose the social responsibility of their products only in a way that is unreliable. This provides a rationale for coherent labels with standardized criteria. In many relevant industries, however, this is not the case, as the examples provided above show. Our results are consistent with markets for such products displaying low production standards for a majority of the products sold. They also provide a clear reason why neither forced disclosure nor more informative and standardized labels are in the interest of the producers: Producers benefit from the reduced transparency through higher profits, and thus have strong incentives to actively oppose such labels.",

More specifically, we focus on the emergence of social responsibility in markets. To our knowledge, there is no paper within the experimental literature which explicitly analyzes, as our paper does, the firms' decision whether or not to reveal the level of social responsibility of the offered product. Bartling et al. (2015) study a laboratory market where products with and without an externality, represented by the earnings of a third party, can be traded. They find that behavior in those markets reflects a concern for social responsibility, demonstrated through market shares for the socially responsible product of up to 50%. Using the same basic paradigm, Bartling et al. (2019) show that these results do not depend on whether social harm is concentrated on a single subject or diffused among many, while Bartling et al. (2020) show that an exogenous increase in consumer incomes increases social responsibility in the market. Using, like us, a charity rather than another lab participant representing the externality, Rode et al. (2008) also provide evidence that consumers are willing to pay a price premium for socially responsible products, thus avoiding them being crowded out. These findings are in accordance with our results in treatment full INfo: when consumers are fully aware of the social impact of their purchase decisions, market outcomes reflect their concerns for socially responsible behavior.",

            "text": "A closely related set of papers contains a comparison across market conditions which is similar to the relation between the treatments No INfo and full INfo in this paper. Pigors and Rockenbach (2016) , in a setting similar to Bartling et al. (2015) , also show that once the social dimension becomes known to buyers rather than being private information of the sellers, social responsibility in the market increases. In Feicht et al. (2016) , when they face neither commitment nor a possibility that deviating behavior is observed, sellers generate lower donations compared to the case where there is full commitment to donations as promised to buyers at the point of purchase. Etil\u00e9 and Teyssier (2016) study the roles of labels in an experimental market. They compare treatments where sellers can acquire labels signifying a minimum amount of donations to a charity to a treatment where no labels can be acquired. They find that only if such labels are credible, i.e., sellers cannot lie, the use of such labels increases social responsibility. Our paper differs from theirs in, at least, two important aspects. First, they cannot say anything about the effectiveness of labels compared to an institutional regime which forces disclosure of the amount of social responsibility. Neither do they allow for sellers to convey information to buyers beyond whether or not a minimum standard is met. Moreover, our design introduces the feature that labels are often complicated and difficult to transmit to consumers, something which is both realistic and relevant for policy makers in so far as markets outside the lab are concerned. 5 On a broader level, we add to a literature which studies under which conditions market forces are beneficial in generating socially and morally desirable outcomes. Falk and Szech (2013) argue that the presence of markets reduces moral behavior, as indicated by lower prices in markets than in individual decisions for the same externalities (saving the life of a mouse). Yet in a recent paper Bartling et al. (2020a) show that neither Falk and Szech's data nor their own data support the claim that market interaction erodes moral behavior, but instead it is repeated play that causes the erosion of moral values. Kirchler et al. (2016) also compare individual decision making with a double-auction market and identify the threat of punishment as an effective intervention to increase moral behavior. Sutter et al. (2020) provide evidence that markets with an externality lead to fewer trades, while the effect on prices is ambiguous. The latter two papers use, like us, donations to unicef as a proxy for moral behavior. Pigors and Rockenbach (2016) compare monopoly to duopoly markets and show that competition has positive effects on the emergence of more moral behavior. In light of this literature, our design can be interpreted as varying the intensity of competition along the \"informativeness-dimension\" of the social externality. If there is competition both on the price and the charity dimension, social responsibility increases compared to cases where the latter dimension is not, or only partly, relevant for competitors.",

Recent evidence (e.g., Jin et al. 2021; Benndorf et al. 2015; Deversi et al. 2021) shows that people have difficulties interpreting non-disclosure as sufficiently negative information, severely limiting the kind of unraveling predicted when agents were sophisticated rather than boundedly rational. Given that in our ChoICe treatments buyers face a similar task, namely to infer the donation associated with undisclosed offers, it is worth pointing out that if disclosure is sufficiently unambiguous, our results show that buyers behave as if they can infer donations relatively well. An important difference of our paper, also compared to the theoretical literature on disclosure in the presence of boundedly rational consumers (e.g., Ispano and Schwardmann 2018) , is that we implement a setting where sellers can choose their donation level, i.e., their product's quality. Hence, this may be an important driver of the diverging findings, in particular as in most markets quality is endogenous, at least in the medium-to long-run. 6",

Hence, it can suitably capture, in a stylized manner, the choice of a firm how socially responsible the offered product is. Second, money transferred to uNICef is not a transfer between market participants, but something that affects people not involved in the transaction, just like many externalities outside of the laboratory, such as environmental effects. Moreover, we view the possibility that participants could, in principle, also donate to unicef outside of the experiment as a feature which increases the external validity of the experiment because in many real-world settings consumers and firms can choose between buying more socially responsible products on a market, like a low CO 2 emission vehicle, or can compensate higher emissions through other means. 8",

Yet, buyers are aware that higher prices are not a reliable signal of positive donations, because they might be an attempt of sellers to achieve higher profits. In contrast, sellers in treatment full INfo compete both on price and the level of social responsibility. A product will be the more attractive to a buyer the lower its price and -for a buyer with some form of social preferences that make her also value money transferred to the charity -the higher the donations associated with a purchase.

Then, the belief a rational buyer holds about the donation level in undisclosed offers would be sd \u2032 < d \u2032 . But then, a seller who chooses d \u2032 is better off disclosing her donation level to separate from those sellers with d = 0 and thereby increasing the buyers' willingness to pay for her product. At the same time, if s = 1 , i.e. all sellers who choose not to disclose set d \u2032 > 0 (and buyers believe this to be the case), there is a profitable deviation for a seller to reduce his donation level to d = 0 because this increases his profits due to the lower production cost without affecting the purchase decision of a buyer (since the donation decision is unobservable).

However, our setting differs from those disclosure games in a number of ways which means that we consider it an open question whether we should expect beliefs to be biased in our case. 11 We therefore state our prediction based on the assumption that buyers form rational beliefs. Note, however, that this prediction does not tell us anything about the disclosure rates, i.e., the share of undisclosed offers in treatment ChoICe-100. Based on the intuition developed above, donations of zero which are disclosed and undisclosed donations should be treated by buyers in a similar manner, which in turn means that for sellers who choose a donation of zero it is irrelevant whether they disclose or not.

Of course, in these two treatments, the intentions of the sellers do not correspond to the share of disclosed donations in the market. In ChoICe-85, 55.6% of offers feature a visible donation, for ChoICe-60 this number drops to 39.2%. As discussed in Sect. 4, we would expect sellers to only hide their donation if they offer a donation of zero. This is indeed the case in our data. Only 9.1% of offers hide a positive donation level. Conversely, of those offers with a donation level of zero, for only 5.4% of them did the seller intend to reveal the donation to buyers.

Notice that buyers almost always buy a product (99.6% of cases in full INfo and 99.7% of cases in No INfo). Remarkably, however, there is no significant difference in market prices between the two treatments. While in treatment full INfo a product is sold at an average price of 40.6, in No INfo, buyers pay on average 39.5 ( p = 0.564 , MWU-test). In treatment No INfo, however, market prices decline only in the first few periods while afterwards they remain almost constant over the 30 periods. In contrast, in treatment full INfo we observe a significant decrease in market prices by \u22120.902 points per period ( p < 0.001 ), see Fig. 2a . 15 Since sellers in full INfo sell products which have a higher production cost due to the higher donations, they obtain lower profits than sellers in No INfo: Sellers in full INfo earn on average 30.8 points compared to 37.7 points in No INfo ( p < 0.001 , MWU-test). Controlling for observables, the corresponding treatment effect amounts to 7.2 points ( p < 0.001 ), see Table A1 in the Online Appendix. Thus, the higher production cost due to the higher donations in full INfo, is almost fully borne by the sellers. In line with the result on price dynamics reported above, seller profits decrease over time in treatment full INfo while in No INfo they do not. 16 We note that this is not what we should observe based on Prediction 1. As discussed above, we would have expected prices to be lower in No INfo since production cost are lower as well. The fact that prices are similar and follow a different time trend indicates that there are differences in the intensity of competition between the two treatments. We establish in Sect. 5.3 that purchase decisions by buyers in No INfo hamper effective competition between sellers.",

Moreover, profits in ChoICe-60 are higher than profits in both ChoICe-100 ( Result 6 Market prices in ChoICe-85 are lower than prices in full INfo. Prices in ChoICe-60 are, however, almost 10 points higher than in ChoICe-85 and not significantly different from prices in full INfo. This is at odds with Prediction 3. Seller profits increase when the informational content of disclosure is sufficiently limited (ChoICe-60).",

Instead, she seems to deliberately favor a seller with a higher price, suggesting that she expects this seller to have chosen a higher donation. While it is indeed the case that in No INfo higher prices do signal higher donations (an increase in donations by one (10 point) increment implies a 2.6-point increase in the price, p < 0.001 , see Table A3 in the Online Appendix), buyers are far from perfect in inferring donations from prices (26.7% of choices are dominated by an offer with a lower price and a higher, but unobserved, donation). The fact that in full INfo only in 7.3% of cases buyers choose offers which are dominated by another offer with both a lower price and a higher observed donation, indicates that choosing offers with higher prices in No INfo is not caused by erroneous behavior but stems from conscious decisions of buyers. 19 It remains speculative whether buyers in No INfo sometimes buy higher-priced products because they firmly believe that they are able to correctly predict undisclosed donations, or whether other types of reasoning, such as motivated beliefs (i.e., convincing oneself that paying a higher price is the more socially-responsible action) play an important role as well. Yet, it is clear that this buyer behavior has consequences for the competitiveness of the market: that in No INfo in almost one third of the cases a seller can sell his product although it is not the cheapest (while dominated choices are rare in full INfo) yields a reduced intensity of competition in No INfo. This explains why market prices in No INfo display no decreasing trend, while in full INfo the steady decline of market prices suggests that sellers actively try to undercut each other.",

However, as described above, our data remains inconclusive when comparing donations in ChoICe-85 and ChoICe-60 to donations in ChoICe-100. In particular, we cannot say by how much the observed decline in social responsibility between full INfo and ChoICe-60 and ChoICe-85, respectively, can be attributed to the effect of making disclosure voluntary and by how much to the additional effect of a decrease in the reliability of information. One reason for this is that our initial data, as becomes clear when looking at Fig. 1b again, features rather large confidence intervals, especially in ChoICe-100. Therefore, in order to shed more light on whether donations in ChoICe-100 are indeed different from full INfo -which would indicate that it is voluntary disclosure per se which decreases donations -we conducted a high powered replication of treatments ChoICe-100 and full INfo. As already described in Sect.5.1 above, this replication shows that the effect of just making disclosure voluntary is small. This observation is corroborated when estimating a random-effects regression of realized donations on a set of treatment dummy variables including all observations from the initial experiment and the replication. Since the replication was conducted in a somewhat different setting than the main experiment, we include a dummy variable indicating data coming from the replication study. 22 As shown in Table A11 , Column (1) in the Online Appendix, we estimate a small and insignificant effect ( \u22123.6 points, p = 0.530 ) of making disclosure voluntary on donation levels between full INfo and ChoICe-100. The effect of reducing the disclosure probability from 100% (ChoICe-100) to 85% (ChoICe-85) is estimated to cause a reduction in donations of 26.5 points ( p < 0.001 ). The effect of moving from 100% (ChoICe-100) to 60% (ChoICe-60) is estimated to decrease donations by 16.0 points ( p = 0.039). 22 As described in more detail in Online Appendix A.5, the main (and unavoidable) difference was that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the replication study had to be conducted online.",

Our main interest, however, lies in using this conditional choice model for quantifying a potential effect of reputation. To do that, we include an additional variable into this model which captures how often a buyer previously bought from a specific seller. More precisely, for each alternative available to a buyer we calculate the share of offers she accepted from this specific seller in the past. Hence, controlling for the price and donation of a given offer, we check whether a buyer is more likely to buy from a seller he already bought more from in the past. Table 2 presents the results from estimating such a model. We first note that we estimate, as should be expected, a positive value for as well as b , with the ratio of the two being between five and seven, depending on the specification, indicating that buyers are willing to give up one point of their own monetary payoff to increase donations by five to seven points. We then note the share of offers previously bought from this seller has a positive effect on the utility associated with a specific alternative (see columns (1) and (2) in Table 2 ). When allowing for this effect to vary across treatments, we find a significant effect only in the ChoICe-60 treatment. To quantify this effect, a ten percentage points increase in the share of offers bought from a seller is comparable in magnitude to a price increase of about one point.

These results thus provide empirical support for theoretical models which posit that consumer confusion about the informational content of labels decrease the incentive for firms to disclose these attributes (e.g., Harbaugh et al. 2011) . They also suggest that an important role for policy makers lies in making it easier for firms to communicate to consumers how to assess the SR of products, for example through reliable and easy-to-interpret information.",
