[13] [14] [15] The main question is if and how adequate treatment can take place digitally in the future. This survey addressed this question by examining the usage and perception of digital health applications (such as video consultations, medical apps, digital appointments, diaries, questionnaires, online courses or the use of symptom checkers) by RMD patients and rheumatologists in Germany. In particular, changes in regard to these aspects during the COVID-19 pandemic were recorded.",

This technology enables a low-barrier digital health check to assess disease symptoms. Frequent use could reflect patients' increased need for security. However, there is still little evidence to support the positive benefits of symptom checker usage. This might explain the reported reluctance of rheumatologists in recommending symptom checkers to their patients. 16 Both groups showed an increased interest in the implementation of digital therapies to complement conventional therapies, that is, educational online courses. However, noteworthily, these resources were, at the time of the survey, rarely used, indicating the need for better quality material and the effective promotion of existing programmes. To reduce infection risk during consultations and to save time and clinic resources, selfadministered blood tests in combination with digital monitoring might complement clinical practice in the future. 18 19 Gossec et al 20 were able to demonstrate that wearable data was able to predict disease flares in RA and axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients. Furthermore, the feasibility of CRP quick tests for a rapid on-site disease activity assessment was shown in SpA patients. 19 However, patients were somewhat reluctant to use applications such as self-administered blood tests or wearables for disease monitoring in the future. This may be because many of these solutions are concepts that currently remain foreign to the patient and/or raise concerns about digital overload and potential data violation.",

In line with the literature, the majority of rheumatologists and patients reported that follow-up appointments were most suited to videoconsultations, as were emergency appointments. 1 21 Noteworthily, most patients were interested in the concept of video consultations; however, only a minority had previously engaged in one (6.7%). Consequently, of all listed DHAs, rheumatologists reported the greatest COVID-19 induced uptake for video consultations. A majority in both groups indicated that they would be willing to skip an on-site appointment if the patients were able to indicate their well-being via a DHA. Interestingly, the analysis showed that synchronous monitoring via telephone or video consultation was, in both groups, preferred to flexible asynchronous monitoring, for example, via digital questionnaires. These findings are supported by a pre-COVID-19 study by Ferucci et al. 22 The authors reported few differences between outcome and quality of care for patients with RA treated with telemedicine compared with physical follow-up treatment, concluding that it is reasonable to incorporate telehealth into routine care for patients with RA.

Only the minority (0.7% of patients and 8.5% of physicians) saw potential negative effects. However, the majority in both groups currently stated a mixed perception of this topic. Unfortunately, the different aspects of this topic were not further specified in the survey. However, the loss of physical contact for examinations and difficulties in establishing an emotional relationship is regarded as a disadvantage by some authors ('emotional and physical gap'). 24 Furthermore, some patients, especially the elderly or those with a poor socioeconomic background, may not have the equipment and skills to use telehealth solutions, causing a digital divide based on age and income. 1 However, the use of digital tools offers both sides a variety of new opportunities, such as new ways of communication and knowledge exchange (ie, via social media), 25 new possibilities for identifying diagnoses, 26 27 personalised treatment and disease monitoring via digital tools (such as apps or wearables), 28 as well as an efficient and simple exchange of electronic information for both clinical and scientific purposes. 6 29 Almost all patients and rheumatologists identified advantages in using DHAs: implementation independent of time and place and general flexibility were stated most often. Interestingly, in contrast to 46 patients (15.4%), no rheumatologist thought that DHAs might help in the preparation of a face-to-face appointment. Similar to previous surveys, the main barrier was a lack of information concerning suitable DHAs. 13 For patients, the second greatest barrier was poor DHA usability, while for rheumatologists, it was too little evidence supporting DHA usage. This highlights the need for DHA studies, as expressed previously. 12 30 To ensure high usability, it is advisable to integrate patients in the early phases of DHA development. 11 Unsatisfactory DHA skills were rarely stated as a barrier, similarly to costs.",

Lack of internet access or the availability to a modern smartphone was also identified as an issue regarding the German COVID-19 tracing app. 31 32 The interpretation of the digital survey results should therefore be carried out cautiously, as we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that not all RMD patients (especially the elderly) were able to participate in the survey. The survey was conducted between 9 September and 15 October. During this time, Germany was in the phase between the first and the second European COVID-19 waves. The results should therefore be carefully interpreted in the context of this timeframe.
