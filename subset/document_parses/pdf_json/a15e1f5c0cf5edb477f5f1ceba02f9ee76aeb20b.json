Methods: We identified 26,117 COVID-19 positive patients from the Mass General Brigham's electronic health records (EHR) and extracted 328,879 clinical notes from their post-acute infection period (day 51-110 from first positive COVID-19 test). PASCLex incorporated Unified Medical Language System \u00ae (UMLS) Metathesaurus concepts and synonyms based on selected semantic types. The MTERMS natural language processing (NLP) tool was used to automatically extract symptoms from a development dataset. The lexicon was iteratively revised with manual chart review, keyword search, concept consolidation, and evaluation of NLP output.",

Emerging prospective and retrospective studies suggest that some patients have persistent symptoms and/or develop delayed or longterm complications after their recovery from acute COVID-19, which may also be referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) syndrome or long COVID. [2] [3] [4] The onset, scope, and duration of PASC symptoms that often involve multiple organ systems represent a new phase of the pandemic, with significant implications for health care delivery. 5 Efficient, scalable tools to identify and analyze patient PASC symptoms are essential to inform risk assessment, prevention and treatment strategy development, and outcome estimation. 6, 7 The characterization of PASC symptoms has varied widely by study. 8 This heterogeneity of research findings is attributed to multiple factors, including variation in study design, patient populations, the \"post-acute COVID-19\" timeframe, and sample size. 2, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Most early studies on PASC symptoms relied on patient survey data, manual chart review, and in person follow-up. 6, 12, 13, [15] [16] [17] [18] These studies were often limited by sample size and reporting biases. Longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data serve as a rich data source for studying PASC symptoms.",

[23] [24] [25] However, those efforts have focused on acute phases of COVID-19, while post-acute and long-term symptom identification were not covered and remain an unmet need. A significant challenge for developing such an NLP tool is the wide variation in potential postacute COVID-19 symptoms, as COVID-19 survivors can experience a heterogeneous constellation of respiratory, cardiovascular, neurologic, psychiatric, dermatologic, and gastrointestinal symptoms and/or complications. A comprehensive lexicon encoded with a standard medical terminology that encompasses a broad range of PASC symptoms derived from large volumes of EHR notes is crucial for NLP tool development and utility and future EHRbased PASC analytics and research.",

We first used MTERMS's section identifier to process clinical notes in the development dataset, excluding sections less likely to contain patients' post-acute COVID-19 symptoms, such as medications list, laboratory results, immunization history, hospital discharge instructions, plan of care, and family history. Next, we split the sections into sentences and applied MTERMS's lexicon-based search module. This search module can utilize a pre-defined lexicon to match mentions of terms contained in the lexicon in the text. Synonyms in the symptom lexicon were considered as NLP search terms, and each mention of the terms was mapped to a UMLS concept. Those terms were further processed by modifier modules which consist of adapted or manually constructed rules to exclude invalid symptoms. For example, the MTERMS negation modifier module, which adopted rules from NegEx that detect negation based on a list of terms (e.g., \"no\", \"denies\", \"rule out\", \"no sign of\"), 32 was applied to exclude negated terms (e.g., \"fever\" was considered negated if occurred in \"no fever\"). Similarly, we also used modifier modules to identify experiencers other than the patient (e.g., mother, father, wife, husband, son, daughter), patient history, and allergic reactions for which we used an allergen lexicon to identify and exclude symptoms mentioned in the context of drug-induced adverse events, such as drug allergic reactions (e.g., 'ACE Inhibitors Angioedema', 'Metformin GI Upset'). 33 Additionally, we used a pattern-matching approach to identify sentences in which symptoms were mentioned as part of risk factors, side effects, instructions, and survey questions. The NLP rules were iteratively added or refined during the lexicon development stage to optimize NLP performance. Examples of challenges in NLP-based symptom extraction from clinical notes are described in Supplementary eTable 1.",

We distinguished patient symptoms from objective findings (e.g., laboratory results, blood pressure measurements) and provider-based disease diagnoses (e.g., choledocholithiasis). This enabled inclusion of symptoms such as palpitations, but not the corresponding diagnoses of \"Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\" which require provider-based assessment, criteria, and evaluation. At each stage of development, we used the current symptom lexicon to extract all possible symptoms in clinical notes. We ranked all the concepts by frequency of patient occurrence. We manually reviewed the concepts to identify symptomspecific terms, as defined above. Given the long tail of symptoms distribution (as many symptoms occurred in only a small percentage of patients and therefore in a low volume of notes), we prioritized identification of the most common symptoms in the patient cohort: 1) concepts occurring in 50 or more patients were manually reviewed by two subject matter experts (DF and YL); 2) concepts occurring in fewer than 50 patients were manually searched using the symptom keywords (identified from the set of concepts occurring in more than 50 patients), e.g., \"pain\", \"swelling\". This enabled us to maximize symptom capture and facilitate subsequent concept consolidation even for rarer symptoms.

For example, \"paresthesia\" (CUI: C0030554) and \"pins and needles\" (CUI: C0423572) are included in the UMLS Metathesaurus as two different concepts; however, from a symptom-oriented perspective \"pins and needles\" is a manifestation of paresthesia and was consolidated under \"Paresthesia\".",

For example, a synonym \"chest pressure\" was mapped to \"chess tightness\" (CUI: C0232292) and \"pressure in chest\" (CUI: C0438716), and we consolidated these two concepts to a single concept \"chest tightness\". We also combined terms that were frequently paired in clinical notes into a single term (e.g., terms \"loss of sense of smell\", \"sense of smell altered\", \"disorder of taste\", and \"decreasing sense of taste/smell\" being mapped to a single term \"problem with smell and taste\", and terms \"nausea\" \"vomiting\" \"nausea and vomiting\" \"nausea or vomiting\" \"nausea and/or vomiting\" being merged to \"nausea and/or vomiting\"). We further consolidated the concepts based on anatomic site. For example, pain is a common symptom in the development dataset with over 300 concepts containing the word \"pain\". We manually consolidated all pain-related concepts by pain site, resulting in several concept groups, e.g., \"abdominal pain\", \"joint pain\", \"pain in extremities\", \"chest pain\".",

The goals of lexicon refinement were to 1) refine concept mappings causing the NLP tool to identify false positive or false negative symptoms, and 2) enhance the lexicon with synonyms from clinical notes. After each lexicon revision, we re-applied the NLP to the development dataset and manually checked the output of the NLP on a random set of clinical notes, through which, we were able to identify false positives and false negatives to continue refining the symptom lexicon and NLP rules. Specifically, we removed or changed concepts mappings that cause false positives. For example, based on the UMLS Metathesaurus, the term \"fit\" is a colloquial synonym for seizure, and \"TEN\" is an acronym for \"toxic epidermal necrolysis\". However, without advanced word sense disambiguation functions, these terms could cause inaccurate extraction or false positives. Therefore, term mapping rules were removed to minimize false positive symptom identification. The process of manual review also enabled symptom synonym identification from clinical notes. For example, for the symptom \"problem with smell or taste\", we manually reviewed clinical notes for mentions of \"smell\" and \"taste\" and added additional 143 synonyms to the lexicon. We also added \"brain fog\", \"mental fog\", \"mental fogginess\", and \"foggy\" as synonyms to the concept of \"clouded consciousness\".",

Clinical notes also have an advantage over these sources for studying symptoms, by representing the clinical encounter between patient and provider, and capturing patient reported symptoms--including outside of the formal visit setting (e.g., patient messages and telephone encounters). While patient surveys also capture symptoms, they are subject to responder bias and limited in scale. 2 In larger survey studies across institutions or from social media-based sources, acute COVID-19 infection status may be difficult to ascertain. 38 From a methods perspective, we used an NLP-based approach which is well-suited to systematically process unstructured data containing post-acute COVID-19 symptoms. 8 Compared to machine learning-based approaches for symptom extraction, 24 which may focus on specific symptoms as unique classification tasks, requiring resource-intensive document annotation, a knowledge-based NLP approach can leverage existing knowledge bases to investigate and identify a wide variety of symptoms from a large dataset. Previously, Sahoo and Silverman et al described a rule-based NLP system to detect 11 COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnea, fatigue, aches, new loss of smell/taste, sore throat). 39 Wang et al adapted a clinical NLP tool, i.e., CLAMP, to identify common COVID-19 signs and symptoms, which was based on 153 UMLS concepts (e.g., sore throat, headache, fever, fatigue, altered consciousness). 24 Our work significantly expands on this prior literature providing a comprehensive lexicon of 355 symptoms consolidated from 1,520 UMLS concepts, which could support various NLP systems 40, 41 19 We identified the most common 10 symptoms as pain, anxiety, depression, fatigue, shortness of breath, joint pain, nausea and/or vomiting, headache, myalgia, and gastroesophageal reflux, highlighting symptoms common to both prior inpatient and outpatient-based studies and raising additional symptoms for consideration.",

To strengthen the temporal relationship between symptom and infection, we limited the timeframe of the postacute COVID-19 phase to day 110, rather than longer timeframes used in other studies (e.g., 6 months) which might otherwise have increased the probability of non-COVID19 related symptom capture. However, we did not distinguish between prevalent and incident symptoms for the reasons described above and this remains a limitation. Future studies may use computational or epidemiological approaches to investigate correlations between COVID-19 and resulting symptoms. 11 Limitations in the process of lexicon development are also present. First, as detailed in the lexicon development methods, we used keyword search, rather than systematic manual review, for concepts occurring in fewer than 50 patients (0.2% of the population with notes).",

We did not formally record intermediate values of recall and precision for each iteration, but this would have strengthened the generalizability of our methods to other lexicon curations. In the final system evaluation for symptom extraction, recall was estimated using a random set of clinical notes from across the corpus of notes. We did not calculate recall estimates for each individual symptom due to low frequency of many of the symptoms in clinical notes (as described above) which would have been prohibitive from the standpoint of manual review.",

            "text": "Third, although we incorporated synonyms and variations from UMLS enriched with local variations, residual undetected variations may remain, particularly due to missed abbreviations or misspellings. Initially we applied abbreviation tables, however, we found it was over-sensitive with a high false positive identification rate and therefore this was silenced. Subsequently, missed symptom variations from PASCLex may have caused the NLP to miss true positives from some clinical notes. Future work may consider building in additional abbreviation tables and word sense disambiguation modules to better leverage abbreviations. Additional enrichments might also include hierarchical associations among the symptom concepts and/or categorizations by body systems. Fourth, semantic context can challenge our rule-based NLP approach. For example, while the NLP tool can accurately identify the symptom term \"weight loss\" in clinical notes, on chart review we found that the term \"weight loss\" was often used in the context of weight gain in the post-COVID-19 period, as patients had gained weight and were trialing weight management interventions to decrease their weight. Future studies using word or sentence embeddings in advanced machine learning models may help to extract mentions of symptoms from free-text notes with greater accuracy. 44 Our proposed symptom lexicon and NLP approach can serve as a base for those future efforts.",
