We recently published a very low humoral response rate at 3.8% (n=3/78), 28 d after a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech). 1 This article reports the serological response rate 28 d after the second dose of vaccine using an immunoassay detecting antibodies against the spike protein receptor-binding domain (Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany; positive threshold >0.8 U/mL). All patients had no history of COVID-19 infection and tested negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody before vaccination. Seventy-nine patients were included. The median age was 61 (range, 18-88) y; 48% were male individuals. The median time since transplantation was 105 (range, 5-609) mo, and 63% were transplanted >6 y ago. Forty-seven percent were treated with an association of tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and steroids, and 29% received an antimetabolite-free immunosuppressive therapy. At day 28, after the second vaccine injection, 39 patients (49%) mounted a serological response. Among responders (Figure 1 ), only 4 (10%) had high antibody titers (>250 U/mL-the upper detection limit of our assay), whereas 35 (90%) had intermediate response with a median antibody titer of 11.9 U/mL (range, 0.93-207). From the 3 patients who seroconverted after the first dose, 1 reported an immunization rate of 48% 1 mo after the second dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in 205 KTRs. They also found that patients with a first KT, a longer time from transplantation, better kidney function, and less immunosuppression were more likely to seroconvert. Boyarski et al 4 showed a seroconversion rate of 54% in 658 solid organ transplanted patients 29 d after the second injection of an mRNA vaccine (47% and 53% of patients were vaccinated with the mRNA-1273 and the BNT162b2 vaccine, respectively). The use of antimetabolites was associated with poor antibody response.",
