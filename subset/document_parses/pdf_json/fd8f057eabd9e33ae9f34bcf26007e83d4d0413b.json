Descriptive statistics such as frequency, proportion, mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to summarize variables and evaluate the distribution of responses. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with dyslipidemia. Variables that were significant at p-value < 0.05 in the bivariable analysis were included in the multivariable analysis to control confounding effects. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were used to determine the strength of associations between dyslipidemia and independent variables and the level of statistical significance was declared at p-value < 0.05.

Gender was not significantly associated with dyslipidemia in this study. However, findings in many previous studies reported that women had a significantly higher prevalence of dyslipidemia [15-17, 26, 30] . 22 Whereas, contradictory findings were reported in China and Saudi Arabia [1, 7] . The observed variations might be due to differences in gender composition, as in this study a relatively lower percentage of female participants were included. Additional reasons could be the diverse socioeconomic status, culture, and lifestyle of the participants which could result in different dietary habits. Alcohol does modulate several components of the lipogenic pathway; for instance, it decreases the primary enzyme that regulates lipogenesis resulting in higher levels of plasma lipids [31] . Similarly, several studies have reported that alcohol consumption is positively associated with dyslipidemia [1, [10] [11] [12] 32] , which is consistent with the results of this study which revealed that alcohol consumption is significantly associated with dyslipidemia, mainly with reduced HDL-C and elevated triglycerides. This could be explained by working in an alcoholic beverage factory might increase the access to alcoholic beverages to the employees and the tendency of excessive alcohol consumption.",

A comparable finding was found in India which reported a sedentary lifestyle, which could be described by longer sitting and lying down, was significantly associated with dyslipidemia [29] . This could be explained by longer sitting duration means fewer calories are being burned, which might lead to storage of calories in the form of lipids [33] .",

Contrary to the findings in many previous studies [9, 15, 16, 18, 28] , BMI was not significantly associated with dyslipidemia in this study.

Other studies from Eastern Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia [6, 7] showed that elevated fasting blood sugar level was significantly associated with dyslipidemia. Whereas, this study reported a contradictory finding. This variation might be due to differences in study population and age composition. For instance, the study in Eastern Ethiopia was conducted solely in the female gender, the study in India includes only male participants above 30 years of age, and the study in Durame, southern Ethiopia was a hospital-based study. Besides, differences in socioeconomic status and lifestyle of the participants could also be additional reasons.",

This finding indicates that dyslipidemia is a significant public health problem among the alcoholic beverage industrial working population of developing countries. Older age was the only non-modifiable risk factor for dyslipidemia in this study. Other modifiable factors such as; alcohol consumption, less eating of vegetables, longer sitting duration, and raised waist circumference were also the significant risk factors of dyslipidemia in this study. Periodic screening of high-risk groups for early detection and treatment is needed along with effective health promotion and education which encourages a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, broader studies with different study designs are needed to assess the association of lipid derangements with alcohol consumption.",
