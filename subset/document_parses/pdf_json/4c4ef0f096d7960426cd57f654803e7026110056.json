So, the goal of the present study is to learn from the pathophysiology of COVID-19 clinical features, laboratory results, and high-resolution CT manifestations in different stages of disease severity to provide significant reference values for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Methods This was a multicentered study that included 128 patients. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, in addition to chest HRCT findings, were evaluated. According to chest HRCT features, radiologic scoring were grade 1 and 2 for mild grades of the disease, 3 and 4 for moderate grades of the disease, and 5 and 6 for severe grades of the disease. Results Patient clinical symptoms ranged between fever, dry cough, muscle ache (myalgia)/fatigue, dyspnea, hyposomia, sore throat, and diarrhea. Lymphocytes and WBCs were significantly lower in patients with severe COVID-19. A significant negative correlation was found with WBCs (r = \u2212 0.245, P = 0.005), lymphocytes% (r = \u2212 0.586, P < 0.001), RBCs (r = \u2212 0.2488, P = 0.005), Hb (gm/dl) (r = \u2212 0.342, P < 0.001), and HCT (r = \u2212 0.377, P < 0.001). Transferrin and CRP were significantly higher in moderate and severe COVID-19 than mild degree and showed a significant positive correlation with CT score (r = 0.356, P < 0.001) and (r = 0.429, P < 0.001), respectively. The most common CT features were peripheral pulmonary GGO and air space consolidation.",

There are many publications of several studies of COVID-19, which included explanations of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory features of this disease. The current study analysis involved 128 patients with established cases of COVID-19. All clinical features, imaging, and laboratory findings were collected and statistically analyzed as soon as a patient's diagnosis is confirmed.

Furthermore, we found that male\\female ratio in mild cases was 9\\10 (nearly equal), while in severe cases, it was 45\\21 (nearly doubled). In his study, Dai et al., 2020, stated similar results with a greater total number of men (58.1%, 136/234) than that of women (41.9%, 98/234) [29] . A potential description for this finding may be protection provided by the X chromosome and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity [11, 30] . Furthermore, physiologically, female have lower blood indices (e.g., Hb, HCT, and RBCs) than male with lower iron levels. Low iron seems to afford a protective mechanism from infection by restricting iron utilization by the virus [31] and improve the inflammatory condition [32] . Blood indices such as Hb, HCT, RBCs, and transferrin level showed significant changes with increasing disease severity which affects male more than female, suggesting occurrence of dysregulated iron homeostasis alongside the course of COVID-19 disease. It was shown that SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences may form a complex with porphyrin, affecting the 1-\u03b2 chain of heme of the hemoglobin with subsequent dissociation of the iron [33] .",

There are several reported cases where autoimmune hemolytic anemia occurred during the worsening of symptoms of Covid-19 infection [34] [35] [36] . Reduced Hb level with the associated reduction of oxygen carrying capacity of the blood together with CT diagnosed lung parenchymal pathology explains the significant dyspnea associated with increased disease severity. The COVID-19 disease severity significantly increased with old age and was milder in younger age which was in concordance with several other studies [37] [38] [39] . This can be explained by poor health outcomes and the physiologic changes of aging which begin early in life with the drop in production of new T cells due to thymus gland involution, followed by deterioration of the immune system and increased susceptibility to infection [40] . Seventy to eighty percent of the circulating lymphocytes are composed of T lymphocytes [41] .",

In a study of 41 patients, Huang et al., 2020, stated that 40 patients (98%) had bilateral while 1 (2%) had unilateral involvement. They stated that the characteristic chest CT signs for patients with severe symptoms admitted to the ICU were bilateral, multiple, lobular, and subsegmental areas of consolidation, whereas findings for patients with mild symptoms not admitted to the ICU were bilateral GGO and subsegmental areas of consolidation [10] . In a study of 99 patients, Chen et al., 2020, stated that 74 patients (75%) had bilateral pneumonia, with just 25 (25%) having unilateral pneumonia [11] . In a study of 51 patients, Song et al., 2020, reported that pure GGOs were detected in 77% of patients and that they showed principally bilateral, posterior, and peripheral distribution [18] . Such data are related to our results with 83.6% of our patients having bilateral distribution and 8.6% having unilateral distribution with slight difference between our results and the previous literature that could be explained by the difference in patient population number included in each cohort study. The typical CT manifestations of COVID-19 were in concordance with Wang et al., 2020, and Kanne et al., 2020, which are bilateral, basal, and peripheral ground glass opacities (GGOs), i.e., 92.2% and consolidation in nearly 58.6% of patients [44, 48] . Although consolidation associated with round opacities and septal thickening are more common in COVID-19 according to Parekh et al. 2020 [13] , our finding revealed GGO with higher non-round opacities (74.2%), which can be useful in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from other patterns of lung pathology (Fig. 8) .",

In a study by Chan et al., 2020, six of seven patients had multifocal patchy GGO on CT, principally around the peripheral parts of the lungs [49] . Overall, according to Bai et al. 2020 , compared to non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, parenchymal opacities in COVID-19 pneumonia were more likely to be peripheral (80% vs. 57%), and have GGO (91% vs. 68%). COVID-19 patients were less probably to have central and peripheral distribution (14% vs. 35%) [13, 24] . In the present study, 63.3% of our patients have diffuse GGO opacities while 27.3% have peripheral and 1.6% have central distribution. Cheng et al., 2020, in his study, found mixed GGO and consolidation in patients with positive RT-PCR test results, the most frequently detected opacification in patients with COVID-19 was GGO (100.0% [11/11] ), which appeared mainly in the peripheral zone and most often involved lower lung lobes and segments. This strongly suggests that GGO is the most common imaging manifestation among patients with COVID-19, which is useful in diagnosing and isolating cases while they are in the early stage of the disease. It is worth mentioning that the appearance of the GGO was round or oval rather than patchy [10] . Equivalent to previous studies, GGO patterns were found in 92.2% of our patients.",

The lesions involved one lobe in 15.6% and two or more lobes in 76.6% of the patients. In the current study, the lower lobe was the most affected part (14.1%) in single lobar affection. This was in agreement with Han et al.al. (2020) who stated that in primary CT findings, when the lesions involved two or more lobes, it were essentially distributed in the peripheral zones of the lung, while in single lobe involvement, it was usually in the right lower lobe [26] . This finding may be related to the anatomy of the right lower lobe bronchus, which is thick and short, making it easy for the virus to attack it. Regarding the diffuse radiological characteristics of the studied patients with more tendency to basal lung affection and the correlation between lung CT score and lab investigations (WBCs, lympho-cytes%, RBCs, Hb, HCT, platelets, transferrin, and CRP), these results suggest additional blood involvement in COVID-19 lung pathophysiology. Furthermore, Han et al., 2020, found that COVID-19 pneumonia is common in adults (mean age, 45 years) but infrequent in children and infants [26] . In his study, Cheng et al., 2020, the youngest patient in the present study is a 25-year-old male [28] . In the current study, the mean age \u00b1 SD is 49.07 \u00b1 15.89, range 13-65 years.

Lung abnormalities in SARS are more frequently described to be unifocal [57] . Our study agree with those distinguishing CT manifestations; 83.6% of our patients have ground glass opacities GGOs which were the most frequently seen in each CT stages with different CT manifestations; reverse halo/atoll sign (92.2%), mosaic attenuation (63.3%), consolidation (58.6%), bronchial wall thickening (42.2%), and crazy paving (20.3%). GGO assumes rounded shape in (25.8%). In addition to the characteristic GGO, another CT manifestation was also recorded; centrilobular nodules/tree-in-bud sign 30.5%, solid nodule(s) 29 .7%, bronchial wall thickening 42.2%, interlobular septal thickening 64.1%, and mucoid impaction 20.3%. The frequency of pulmonary cavities 2.3%, pleural thickening 16.4%, pleural effusion 15.6%, mediastinal lymphadenopathy (30.5%), and pericardial effusion (1.6%) was relatively small. These CT performances of COVID-19 were in line parallel to the earlier studies [17, 26, 28, 29] . Our results suggested that each clinical, laboratory and imaging (especially CT) finding had their characteristic signs and performances, making it feasible for physicians and radiologists to quickly make the final diagnosis and staging of the COVID-19 pneumonia.",

First, the number of study cohort is small; a larger cohort study would be useful to further explore the details of imaging findings. Further research with use of a more sample size is necessary to explore the applicability of the clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings in predicting the prognosis of COVID-19, so further studies that include long-term follow-up CT examinations are needed to investigate the entire course of the disease and to evaluate disease progression/ regression after treatment efficacy. Second, lung tissue biopsies or even autopsy to investigate the relation between CT findings and histopathologic appearances were not available. Third, the patients performed the CT scans with different machine type, due to the multiple centers in the study. The heterogeneity of the CT data might influence the results of the study. As a final point, this was a retrospective study. A further longitudinal research was needed to provide dynamic CT assessment for pulmonary lesions and to obtain the data of long term pulmonary function changes.",
