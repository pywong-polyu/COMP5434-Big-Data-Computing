The experience of consultants was stratified into less than or equal to five, six to 10, 11-15 and more than 15 years. The Modified McCormick scale (MMS), as depicted in Table 1 [3] , was used to classify patients' neurological status on a scale of grade I-V, both pre-operatively, and at the latest follow-up. Initially, the changes in MMS from the pre-operative assessment to the end of follow-up were assessed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. Patient demographics, surgical factors and short-term outcomes were then compared between consultant-related factors, namely, the number present and the level of experience of the most senior consultant. Nominal factors were analysed using Fisher's exact tests, with ordinal or continuous variables analysed using the Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis test for comparisons across two or more than two groups, respectively.

Dural closure was the most commonly performed with sutures (67%), with 2% of the procedures using both sutures and non-penetrating titanium clips (LeMaitre Vascular, Burlington, MA). A single procedure used neither sutures nor clips due to a large defect with inadequate dura for closure, but the dura was instead closed with a collagen matrix, Duragen (Integra, Plainsboro, NJ, USA) and fibrin sealant, Tisseel (Baxter, Vienna, Austria). Further details of the cohort and operative approach are reported in Table 2 .

The 'Get it Right First Time' (GIRFT) spinal services report was published in the United Kingdom in 2019 as a national initiative aimed at improving and minimising variation in care provided to patients undergoing spinal surgery [5] . The surgical resection of intradural intramedullary spinal tumours has been highlighted as an area posing a relatively high risk of surgical complications. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that there remains wide variation in the volume of surgical procedures being performed for intradural spinal tumours across various trusts within the UK. As a result, there has been a drive towards centralising specialist surgical services for these conditions to higher volume centres to improve post-operative outcomes. However, a firm link between higher surgical volumes and improved patient outcomes for these procedures remains to be established [5] .",

            "text": "The introduction of working-hours restrictions for medical practitioners due to the introduction of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) has led to a knock-on reduction in operative exposure during surgical training. The impact of this is unclear, but it may result in newly appointed consultants being less experienced in managing more complex cases when compared with their predecessors. Babu et al. showed that following the introduction of resident duty-hour restrictions, there was an increased risk of postoperative complications for patients undergoing brain tumour and cerebrovascular procedures [6] . Due to the complexity of certain intradural spinal tumours, it is not uncommon to have joint consultant involvement for complex cases in our unit. There is evidence in the literature to support that by having two consultants operating in complex spinal cases, there is a significant reduction in operative time, perioperative complications and blood loss [7] [8] . In our study, we found that there was no significant correlation between patients' outcomes and the number of consultants involved. The main drawback for joint consultant cases is the limitation of training opportunities for surgical trainees who would only be involved in more straightforward cases. One should, however, be mindful that there is a great learning opportunity that could be gained from assisting two consultants. A systematic review of the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on surgical training found that operative experience for trainees has been reduced globally due to a variety of factors such as re-deployment of trainees to other clinical areas of need, cancellation of elective cases and changes to work patterns [9] . In addition, the restriction to the number of surgeons scrubbing in theatre to reduce potential exposure and transmission of coronavirus will also negatively impact surgical training, as trainees may not be able to scrub in cases with joint consultant involvement. Therefore, surgical trainees may find it more challenging to participate and gain competence in the surgical management of complex intradural spinal tumour resection.",

            "text": "A post-operative CSF leak is a well-recognised complication following spinal surgery, and the reported incidence of CSF leaks requiring secondary intervention varies between 1.7% and 16.7% [10] [11] [12] . Patients with CSF leak are at a higher risk of delayed wound healing, infection, neurological deficit secondary to neural compression, and prolonged hospital stay [12] . In our cohort, four patients (3%) returned to theatre for the repair of a post-operative CSF leak. We found that the methods of dural closure used were variable and dural closure using titanium clips was introduced in our unit in 2015. Laut et al. reported that no patients in their series of 50 patients who underwent dural closure using non-penetrating titanium U-clips had post-operative CSF leak [13] and that clips do not cause significant artefacts on post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [13] . In another study by Ito et al., the authors found that by using non-penetrating titanium clips, the dura can be closed without creating any holes in the dura, which, in turn, allows the dura to sustain higher leakage pressure when compared with dural closure using sutures [14] . Due to the low incidence of CSF leak in our study (3%), we were unable to compare and determine if there is any significant difference in the incidence of CSF leak between dura closed using clips and sutures. A post-hoc power calculation estimated that, given the incidence and sample size of our study, approximately a seven-fold difference in CSF leak rates, would have been required to detect a difference between closure methods. Assuming a similar overall CSF leak rate (3%), a future study would require approximately 800 patients per closure method to detect a two-fold difference between arms (at 80% power and 5% alpha). However, although we were not able to assess this qualitatively, based on the current literature and our experience, we feel that dural closure using clips is a safe alternative.",

As the incidence of CSF leak in our cohort is low, we are unable to determine whether mandatory post-operative bed rest has a significant impact on the incidence of CSF leak. Low et al. found no significant correlation between the rate of complications and the day of mobilisation following accidental durotomy, and the authors concluded that patients should be mobilised as soon as they are able to [18] . In another retrospective review of 20 patients with incidental durotomy that was managed post-operatively without any mandatory bed rest, the authors found that only one patient had stitch loosening that required revision surgery [19] . Post-operative bed rest has been associated with pulmonary or urinary infections, wound problems like pressure sores or infection, and venous thromboembolism [20] . Radcliff et al. found that patients who are kept on flatbed rest for more than 24 hours are significantly more likely to have medical complications [20] . We feel that early post-operative mobilisation of patients should be encouraged if the operating surgeon is confident with the intraoperative primary closure of the dura with no evidence of CSF egress following Valsalva manoeuvre.

We used intraoperative neuro-monitoring in more than two-thirds of cases and did not find any significant correlation between the usage of intra-operative neuro-monitoring and the neurological outcomes for patients. The use of intraoperative neuro-monitoring has been shown to be an effective tool in anticipating neurological injury during spinal tumour surgery, but it can also limit tumour resection with false readings [24] [25] . The D-wave recordings had been found to be the most significant predictor of good motor outcome even when motor-evoked potentials (MEP) are lost intraoperatively [26] .

Additional limitations include a potential follow-up bias given the disparate length of time from initial review to outpatient followup. Analysis of changes in the MMS outcome could also be potentially affected by the wide range of followup times that elapsed between the assessments performed pre-operatively and at the most recent follow-up. As such, if the effect of surgery on symptoms either took some time to manifest or if the benefits of surgery only lasted for a limited period, this effect may have been underestimated in patients with short or long follow-up times, introducing bias into the analysis. To assess the impact of this potential bias, the direction of change in MMS was compared with the duration of follow-up, with no significant association being detected.
