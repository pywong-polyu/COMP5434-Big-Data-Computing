There are many reports suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected and identified in anal/rectal swabs [4, 5] and stool specimens [6, 7] . In fact, one recent small sample study found that RNA was consistently detected in rectal swabs, even after viral clearance from the upper respiratory tract, indicating extended duration of viral shedding in fecal samples and raising the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [5] . Similar results were reported in another study with more cases involved, raising the possibility of prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 in stools.",

A small portion of the remaining tissue was soaked with RNA later solution for 24 hours and transferred to a \u2212 80\u00b0C freezer. On day 3 postoperatively, the patient presented with fever and cough. On day 7 postoperatively, chest CT scan showed typical viral pneumonia with ground-glass opacity (Figure 2). At the same time, the SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay using throat swab samples and the patient was transferred to an isolation ward for treatment. The patient was discharged on day 41 after two consecutive negative qRT-PCR test results plus absence of clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities. In the middle of March, we conducted a retrospective study on the patient's surgically removed tissue. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was performed on the surgical specimens of rectal which was positive for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, throat swab, rectal swab, terminal ileum mucosa, and succus entericus samples were collected on day 72 during follow-up and tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid; all of these were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2. To explore the direct evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in the rectal tissues of surgical specimens, ultrathin sections of rectal tissues were prepared, and virus particles were found in the cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells. Under electron microscopy, the virions showed typical morphology of coronavirus (Figure 3). Pathological changes of rectal mucosa with SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication are shown in Figure 4. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained rectal mucosa showed prominent lymphocytes and macrophages infiltrating the lamina propria without significant mucosal damage (Figure 5). T lymphocytes and macrophages were found to be more numerous than B lymphocytes in the lamina propria, as demonstrated on immunostaining. No viral inclusions were observed in the tissues.To further confirm the SARS-CoV-2 -specific infection and replication in the rectum, we conducted immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence using the rabbit anti-SARA-CoV-2 NP antibody. SARS-CoV-2 antigens were confirmed to be expressed on intestinal epithelial cells, lymphocytes and macrophages in the lamina propria (Figure 6).",

            "text": "study, we found, for the first time, that the SARS-CoV-2 had already replicated in the patient's rectum during the incubation period, with no obvious intestinal pathological damage. In this case, the patient developed a dry cough and fever (39.2\u2103) in the early stage after the operation (postoperative day 3). At the same time, an atypical pulmonary inflammation was revealed by the chest CT. Fever and pulmonary infection are common complications after surgery. However, numerous possible causes of these clinical manifestations to some extent led to a challenge in the differential diagnosis between SARS-CoV-2-related fever and postoperative fever. Initially, when the patient started developing fever, the throat swab was not tested for SARS-CoV-2.Here, we observed typical SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in the intestinal epithelial cells of patients under electron microscopy and obtained direct evidence of active SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in the intestine. Meanwhile, we detected the viral components of SARS-CoV-2 in the intestine. It is worth mentioning that virus particles were found in intestinal epithelial cells, but the results of immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry showed that the viral components were mainly present in intestinal lymphocytes and macrophages, besides the intestinal epithelial cells. To explain this seemingly self-contradictory phenomenon, we need to understand the scientific question of how the virus spreads from the lungs to other non-pulmonary tissues. Regarding this issue, some researches have been carried out in the influenza virus and several studies have shown that influenza viruses can be transported by immune cells and spread from the lungs to other tissues [15-17]. These \"virus-carrying\" RNA fragments (majority, these cannot infect other cells) and whole RNA virions (minority, these can infect other cells). These are jointly called the influenza virus transcriptome. Several researches have strongly supported the concept that the influenza virus transcriptome can be transported by the immune cells within the systematic circulation, following which, the viral transcriptome could spread to distant organs such as the intestine 21 . We speculate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses the same strategy as the influenza virus to spread from the lung to the distant organs. Therefore, a large number of non-infectious components of SARS-CoV-2 in intestinal lymphocytes and macrophages were found, with few components in the intestinal epithelial cells. Of course, further experiments are needed to verify this hypothesis. Our study provided further evidence to support the fecal-oral transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, and the intestine represent a target organ of SARS-CoV-2 [22]. A recent study indicated persistent presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool samples of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with moderate disease, even 5 weeks after onset of symptoms 8 . However, in this study, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in samples from the gastrointestinal tract in this case on day 37 after hospital discharge. To explore the mechanism of high viral load and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the intestinal tract of some patients when SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests of throat swab was negative and clinical indicators were normal, further studies with large sample size are needed.",
