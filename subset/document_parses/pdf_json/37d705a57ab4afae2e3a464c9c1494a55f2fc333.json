            "text": "This declaration had an unprecedented impact on health profession education, especially the clinical clerkship of nursing and medical students. The teaching hospitals had to suspend traditional bedside clinical teaching and switch to digital education. Objective: To systematically synthesize the available literature on the application of digital education in undergraduate nursing and medical interns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: A systematic review informed by PRISMA guidelines. Data sources: Five electronic databases were systematically searched: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE (OVID), CINAHL and the Cochrane Library. Review methods: The retrieved articles were screened at the title, abstract, and full text stages. The Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of quantitative and mixed-method studies. Then, two reviewers extracted the quantitative data of the included studies. Results: A total of 4596 studies were identified following a comprehensive search, and 16 studies were included after removing duplicates and screening, which focused on undergraduate nursing students (3 studies) and medical students (13 studies). We found that the standalone digital education modalities were as effective as conventional learning for knowledge and practice. Different educational technologies have different effects on the knowledge and practice of interns. Conclusion: Digital education plays a significant role in distance training for nursing and medical interns both now and in the future. The overall risk of bias was high, and the quality of evidence was found to be variable. There is a need for further research designing more quasi-experimental studies to assess the effectiveness of standalone digital education interventions for the remote training of nursing or medical interns to be fully prepared for emergencies.",

As of June 2021, there have been more than 3.8 million deaths and 170 million confirmed cases in 222 countries and territories. The pandemic has caused enormous economic and social upheaval internationally; furthermore, it has had an immeasurable impact on the delivery of health profession education worldwide (Hodgson et al., 2021; Seymour-Walsh et al., 2020a) . Therefore, to protect students' education and wellbeing, the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China issued a notice postponing the start of the school year, and the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) recommended that health professions schools pause all clinical practicums (Harries et al., 2021) .",

However, with the rapid spread of COVID-19, nationwide lockdown restrictions have had a strong impact on medical and nursing students' access to patients as well as medical staff (Dost et al., 2020) . The resulting passive form of the clinical practicum has led to issues in the quality of medical education. Thus, the faculty preceptors had to urgently fill the gaps in the clinical practicum and complete the mission of cultivating qualified future health care workers. Given that the pandemic is a moment to promote the culture of professionalism and altruism and can present a once-in-a-lifetime disaster response learning experience for medical and nursing students, some medical schools encouraged their students to work on the front line during the COVID-19 pandemic Leigh et al., 2020) . However, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), limited availability of COVID-19 testing and imperfect infection control schemes have all been major safety concerns (Wang et al., 2020) . Thus, digital education without security risks may be an alternative to clinical education that can be implemented even during the lockdown .",

Distance training has undoubtedly been one of the feasible teaching reform measures. A previous review evaluated the effectiveness and potential benefits of digital education in health professional education (Curran et al., 2017) , but it was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the authenticity of the results may inevitably be interfered with by traditional offline teaching. In addition, some reviews synthesized data on medical or surgical education during the period of COVID-19, but they never took nursing education into consideration (Dedeilia et al., 2020; Wilcha, 2020) . To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has examined digital education as an alternative to training medical and nursing interns during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, this review filled a gap in the literature. We not only assessed the effectiveness of digital education but also evaluated its impact on the knowledge, attitudes, skills, and satisfaction of nursing and medical students.",

The databases were searched for studies published between 2019 and April 2021. A combination of medical subject headings (MeSH) and free text terms were utilized to generate a systematic search strategy, which was developed and adjusted for use across databases (Kerr et al., 2020) . Boolean connectors AND and OR were used to maximize saturation of terms searched (Cleary et al., 2018) . The keywords used to search relevant literature included \"nurs* undergraduate\" OR \"medical student*\" AND \"clinical clerkship\" AND \"SARS-CoV-2\" and \"digital*\" OR \"e-learn*\". An example of the search strategy for the PubMed database is shown in Supplementary File. Additionally, we adopted additional methods to improve the comprehensiveness of the retrieval, including checking the reference list of included studies and citation tracking (Wu et al., 2018) .",

This tool includes two screening questions for all research types and three to four questions for each type. The quality of the included studies was scored as \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Can't tell\" according to whether the research met the criteria. The overall quality score is equal to the number of criteria met (Yes) divided by the total number of related questions and multiplied by 100 (M\u0105cznik et al., 2015) . Two researchers independently assessed the quality of the full texts, and any bifurcations were rigorously discussed until a consensus was reached. Given the limited number of studies, we decided to take an inclusive approach to include all eligible studies in this review.",

Studies were conducted in the United States of America (n = 7), China (n = 3), the UK (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), Korea (n = 1), Italy (n = 1), Arabia (n = 1), and Israel (n = 1). The sample sizes in the included papers ranged from 10 to 211 students. A total of 1174 participants were enrolled in this review, of whom 457 were undergraduate nursing students (3 studies) and 717 were medical students (13 studies). Only one of these studies contained a mixture of educational levels (He et al., 2021) , such as undergraduate and PhD students in medicine. However, we only extracted data related to undergraduate students. The 16 papers used a variety of methodologies, including one cross-sectional study, two quantitative descriptive studies, two quasiexperimental studies, one prospective cohort study and the rest of the ten mixed-method studies. The publications were devoted to exploring the different modalities of digital education, including virtual realitybased simulation training (3 studies) (De Ponti et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2020; Weston and Zauche, 2021) , teleconsultation and virtual rounds (3 studies) (Bala et al., 2021; Sukumar et al., 2021; Weber et al., 2021) , web-based specialized skills learning (2 studies) (Alpert et al., 2021; Shahrjerdi et al., 2020) , and multimodal online curriculums (8 studies) (Coffey et al., 2020; He et al., 2021; Kaliyadan et al., 2020; Kasai et al., 2021; Michener et al., 2020; Samueli et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020) . Study outcomes were measured utilizing a series of homemade tools. For instance, standardized questionnaires, scales, anonymous surveys and Likert scales were used. In addition, academic performance was assessed in 3 studies in terms of examinations, and one study used specialized instruments with high reliability and validity to evaluate learning outcomes.",

Two of them focused on nursing students (Kang et al., 2020; Weston and Zauche, 2021) , and one paid attention to medical students (De Ponti et al., 2020) . Virtual simulation platforms such as i-Human\u00ae and Body Interact\u2122 were sufficiently utilized for case-based learning to present students with an interactive medical patient experience. In addition, one quasi-experimental study included two additional intervention groups in which high-fidelity simulation (HFS) training and collaborative teaching combining HFS and virtual simulation training were conducted for nursing students (Kang et al., 2020) . The three studies assessed the interns' Assessment Technologies Institute (ATI) scores, the perceived quality of this training modality, the level of knowledge, confidence in practice pre-and post-training and the aggregate performance. One study compared the students who were in clinical practice with those who participated in virtual simulation and reported that there were no significant differences in ATI scores (Weston and Zauche, 2021) . The study focused on medical students indicated that more than half of them preferred simulation training with virtual platforms rather than online formal teaching, although technical troubles may inevitably emerge when accessing the online platform (De Ponti et al., 2020) . The study included additional educational modalities, such as HFS and lectures, and showed that virtual reality-based simulation training could further enhance the knowledge level and confidence in clinical practice for the interns compared with high-fidelity simulation. However, the promoting effect of simulation training on overall clinical performance was slightly inferior (Kang et al., 2020) .",

This study revealed that students obtained substantial experience with telemedicine technologies; for example, they could make a personal connection with patients and determine patients' perspective of their illness independently. The remaining two studies used Zoom video conference and Microsoft Dynamic 365 Remote Assist Application to interact with patients during virtual rounds. One study demonstrated that the clinical ability and professional confidence improved in the majority of the students and that the overall ability to teach tele-instructors in virtual rounds was better than that in in-person rounds (Sukumar et al., 2021) . Beyond that, this study found that smaller groups were better for teaching and further affirmed the value of virtual rounds after the release of isolation. However, while another study using mixed reality (MR) technology suggested that virtual rounds were acceptable and effective, it denied its significance secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic (Bala et al., 2021) .",

One study used Zoom video conferencing for online presentation, focusing on surgical instruments and hand knots (Shahrjerdi et al., 2020) . In this study, most of the students believed the new web-based surgical instruction was as difficult/easy as conventional face-to-face teaching, and they considered that this new teaching format was worthy of recommendation. Another study that performed remote radiology review by means of WebEx, a teleconferencing and screen sharing application, gauged the learning experience of two groups of interns (in-person group and VRO group) in reviewing radiology exams (Alpert et al., 2021) . The results showed that remote training was more entertaining and that students tended to play an active role in reviewing radiology exams.",

In this review, 8 studies conducted online curriculums consisting of synchronous and asynchronous content and compared them with no controls. Asynchronous content included online videos, massive open online courses (MOOCs), discussion posts and so on. Synchronous content contained virtual conferences, impromptu role playing and lectures. Canvas, an online learning management system, was responsible for hosting asynchronous content. There were a variety of asynchronous platforms, such as Zoom, Tencent Class, and Blackboard\u00ae. Three of the studies assessed the preference of the students for the different curriculum formats, and the results suggested that students had a greater interest in interactive discussion learning patterns and were less interested in passive teaching resources (Coffey et al., 2020; He et al., 2021; Michener et al., 2020) . In addition, two of the three studies indicated that the majority of students were satisfied with multimodal online courses (He et al., 2021; Michener et al., 2020) . One study found the same result as Sukumar et al. (2021) , that a smaller learning group size might bring a better learning experience for interns (He et al., 2021) . Additionally, this study also showed that an overwhelming majority of students recommended continuing the online curriculum after the pandemic. Another study found that interns gradually reconnected with school and their peers by taking online curricula (Coffey et al., 2020) .",

In addition, these two studies also separately included short presentations (PPT courseware), case-based teaching and other curriculum formats. One study indicated that both faculty and interns gave good feedback in terms of the overall content coverage and technical aspects of this online module, but they were less satisfied with practical skills training and assessment (Kaliyadan et al., 2020) . Another study showed that interns had an acceptable satisfaction level with online simulated clinical practice (online-sCP); however, bedside practice was more useful for learning associated with physical examinations, medical interviews and humanistic qualities such as professionalism than online-sCP. The remaining three studies varied in curriculum formats and assessment contents (Samueli et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020) . One study training the diagnostic capability of medical students by browsing and reviewing slide sets of surgical biopsies found that the online format seemed to be preferable to students (Samueli et al., 2020) . In addition, it is worth noting that the single worst disadvantage of the online curriculums was the technical challenges when accessing the slides. Another study with a massive open online course (MOOC) and microvideo as the major nursing teaching approach proved that there was no significant difference in the scores of the examination of theoretical knowledge and practice dialogue between interns who took face-to-face internships and those who participated in remote curriculums (Zhou et al., 2020) . More interestingly, those who took the online curriculums reported higher levels of satisfaction with their internship. The last remaining study showed that interns' confidence in their urology practice and knowledge level increased significantly after the online curriculums (Williams et al., 2021) .",

By comparing two different modalities of digital education, we found that different educational technologies have different effects on the knowledge and practice of interns. In addition, most studies examined in this review demonstrated the generally positive impact of digital education on the included interns in terms of skills, attitudes, satisfaction and other aspects. However, there was a high risk of bias in this part of the studies due to the deficiency of control groups. There were some meaningful findings in terms of learning group size and teaching resources. First, a smaller learning group size might exert a better clinical teaching effect compared with a larger group size. A published study indicated that group size was a significant predictor of satisfaction with clinical experience for interns (Ofei-Dodoo et al., 2018) , which was similar to our findings. Smaller groups help students dig deeper into what they are exploring and enable greater participation, collaboration and discussion (Bristol and Kyarsgaard, 2012; Burgess et al., 2017) . Therefore, even though online teaching modalities allow a large number of users to attend a virtual space concurrently, the faculty should try to avoid centralized teaching where possible. Second, we found that interns had a greater interest in interactive training than passive access to resources. Similar findings have been found in previous reviews, indicating that interactive education was more effective than preaching education, which had little or no impact on professional practice (Bloom, 2005; Forsetlund et al., 2009) . One of the possible reasons is that the motivation of learning can be heightened by an interactive style of teaching (Dolmans et al., 1998) . In addition, the instantaneous feedback provided in interactive teaching helps students learn more effectively and internalize the material (Shapiro et al., 2014) . Thus, it is a feasible and effective teaching reform measure to integrate interactive training into conventional didactic teaching to promote better learning after the COVID-19 epidemic is easing.",

First, the technical challenges in distance access were the common shortcomings of most digital education modalities, which has also been confirmed in published studies (Hodgson and Hagan, 2020; Sleiwah et al., 2020) . In this review, nearly half of the studies were conducted in developing countries, so costs such as computers and IT equipment might be one of the barriers to use. In addition, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, faculty members might have difficulty coping with the online delivery mode, so there was limited direction on how to implement such tools or programs (O'Doherty et al., 2018; Sahu, 2020) . Therefore, a clear institutional strategy is recommended when implementing digital learning to reduce technical barriers to access (O'Doherty et al., 2018) . Second, while most studies gave high praise for digital education and affirmed its value after the pandemic, they consistently believed that bedside clinical teaching was irreplaceable. Conventional clinical training and interaction with tutors was invaluable (De Ponti et al., 2020) . Research has suggested that there might not be a competitive relationship between digital education and face-to-face teaching in some respects (Pei and Wu, 2019) . Therefore, it may be worthwhile to combine the advantages of digital and face-to-face teaching methods to maximize the benefits (Pei and Wu, 2019) .",

With the advent of vaccines against COVID-19 and the implementation of social isolation measures worldwide, we have entered a period of relaxation of restrictions, during which the national economy and health education have been temporarily restored. In accordance with the teaching arrangements, we have resumed face-to-face teaching and ward rotation in a limited form (Khoo et al., 2021) ; additionally, digital education seems to continue to play a significant role in health professional education. However, there are still potential risks, such as gene mutation in SARS-CoV-2, which is one of the challenges that vaccine development has to face (Silveira et al., 2021) . In addition, the popularization of vaccines also has insurmountable bottlenecks, including mass production and delivery of billions of doses to the worldwide population (Izda et al., 2021) . As a result, the development of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to vaccines and unexpected outbreaks are highly possible in the near future (Dos Santos, 2021), which will lead to a new wave of digital learning in health profession education. Digital education is vital to remote training for interns both now and in the future. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the ethical issues of patient privacy and data security are often ignored in the implementation of digital education, which may compromise the welfare of patients (Lall et al., 2019) . To better apply it to clinical training, teaching hospitals should further standardize the specific implementation guidelines of digital education.",

Second, the results of the included studies were too heterogeneous to be pooled. Third, non-English language articles were excluded due to lack of translation resources, which was likely to influence the findings of the results. Moreover, only four of the included studies (Alpert et al., 2021; Kang et al., 2020; Weston and Zauche, 2021; Zhou et al., 2020) contained controls, so the assessment of the effectiveness of digital education was relatively incomplete. Although randomized controlled trials that provide the highest level of evidence for the effectiveness of interventions are not appropriate for educational research (Tudor Car et al., 2019a) , a quasi-experimental design can be used at least in future studies to explore the effectiveness of standalone digital education in health professions. Finally, almost all studies used homemade questionnaires to measure outcomes, which made it challenging to compare the use of digital education in different settings. Therefore, alternative methods such as the total time spent on digital learning or deeply qualitative analyses on the perceptions of digital education should be used to investigate interns' attitudes with digital education in future studies (Huang et al., 2019) .",

After comprehensive analysis, we found that digital education plays a significant role in distance training for nursing and medical interns both now and in the future. The overall risk of bias was high, and the quality of evidence was found to be variable. There is a need for further research adopting designs that provide a high level of evidence to assess the effectiveness of standalone digital education interventions for the remote training of nursing or medical interns. Additionally, it is significant for teaching hospitals to formulate systematic guidelines for the implementation of digital education to be fully prepared for emergencies.",
