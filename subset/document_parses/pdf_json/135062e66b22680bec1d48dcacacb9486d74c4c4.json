It is known, though, that waning of vaccine-induced immunity of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adult populations is evident within a few months of administration, 7-11 though protection against severe disease is more sustained. 12 The question of waning immunity in the adolescent population has important implications for future areas of vaccine research and policy. For example, the US FDA and Israel have already extended the eligibility of the booster (third) dose for ages 12-15, 13,14 and other countries are considering this decision.",

The analysis sought to estimate the reduction in the odds of a positive test at different time intervals following receipt of the first and second vaccine doses (0-6 days following the first dose; 7 days after dose 1 to 13 days after dose 2; and 14-89 days, 90-149 days and 150-180 days following the second dose). The 7-day and 14-day cutoffs for the first and second doses were chosen based on previous research on vaccine effectiveness in adults. 19, 20 The reference group in the analysis was those who were unvaccinated. We included obesity (i.e., BMI \u2265 30) as a covariate, which has been linked to severity of COVID-19 symptoms. [21] [22] [23] We also tested our model by including an additional covariate consisting of the number of tests performed before the study period, i.e. between March 1, 2020, to June 14, 2021, to adjust for potential differences in health-seeking behavior. 16 The rationale is that there is a correlation between the number of tests before the study period and the one during it, potentially correcting for a possible detection bias. 7, 9 However, repeated testing was significantly lower compared to adults, 7,16,24 and results were not materially changed.",

The estimates of vaccine-induced protection against symptomatic infection should be interpreted with caution, since a protective effect of the vaccine was already evident a few days after the receipt of the first dose (52% effectiveness at 0-6 days). We did not expect to find a significant effect of vaccination in the first week after receipt of the first dose, since it presumably takes time for the vaccine to induce an immune response. We observed a small but significant reduction in the odds of infection in the six days following the first dose and a larger reduction in the odds of symptomatic infection, which could indicate a potential bias. It is possible that individuals are less likely to be tested immediately after vaccination (e.g. because they attribute symptoms to temporary side effects), and are therefore less likely to be detected (rather than less likely to be infected) compared to unvaccinated individuals, especially symptomatic ones. However, this bias would most likely be short-lived, so the estimates of vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 could be more reliable a couple of weeks after receipt of the first dose. 9, 16 A second limitation is with regards the generalizability of our findings in light of the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our study only estimates the short-and long-term vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant, which was the dominant strain in Israel at the time of our study. The protection conferred against other strains, including the Omicron variant, cannot be inferred.",

Individuals could contribute multiple negative tests to the analysis, but were excluded once they tested positive. If multiple tests were conducted within a 5-day period, the day of test was considered to be the first day of that test series. Similar to the matched case-control analysis, we estimated the reduction in the odds of a positive test at different time intervals following receipt of the first and second vaccine doses (0-6 days following the first dose; 7 days after dose 1 to 13 days after dose 2; and 14-89 days, 90-149 days and 150-180 days following the second dose). We also included obesity (i.e., Body Mass Index \u2265 30) as a covariate. The number of positive tests performed on that day throughout the entire population (log-transformed) was included as an additional covariate to adjust for potential variability in levels of exposure at different time points.",
