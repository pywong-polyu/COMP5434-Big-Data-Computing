A major open challenge that AI will need to address before its integration in the clinical routine is that of algorithmic bias. Most AI algorithms need big datasets to learn from, but several groups of the human population have a long history of being absent or misrepresented in existing biomedical datasets. If the training data is misrepresentative of the population variability, AI is prone to reinforcing bias, which can lead to fatal outcomes, misdiagnoses, and lack of generalization. Here, we describe the challenges in rendering AI algorithms fairer, and we propose concrete steps for addressing bias using tools from the field of open science.",

As a notable example, one of the most frequent medical therapies is oxygen administration, whose levels in the blood are measured through a pulse oximeter. 1 The pulse oximeter measures oxygen saturation by sending infrared light through the skin. Measurements of the pulse oximeter are known to be affected by the patient's skin color, as the device systematically overestimates oxygen saturation levels in nonwhite patients. 2 As a result, Black patients are three times more likely to suffer from an occult hypoxemia that remains undetected by pulse oximeters compared with white patients. 1 As highlighted by this example, disparities in health care may start at the level of clinical measurements, which can ultimately shape erroneous medical decisions for entire patient groups, and can be amplified with the development of AI technologies.",

Bias in AI algorithms for health care can have catastrophic consequences by propagating deeply rooted societal biases. This can result in misdiagnosing certain patient groups, like gender and ethnic minorities, that have a history of being underrepresented in existing datasets, further amplifying inequalities. Open science practices can assist in moving toward fairness in AI for health care. These include (1) participant-centered development of AI algorithms and participatory science; (2) responsible data sharing and inclusive data standards to support interoperability; and (3) code sharing, including sharing of AI algorithms that can synthesize underrepresented data to address bias. Future research needs to focus on developing standards for AI in health care that enable transparency and data sharing, while at the same time preserving patients' privacy.",

            "text": "approaches, deep neural networks rely on propagating an input signal through multiple layers of transformations. 3 This results in the extraction of more complex patterns of information from the input signal than simpler techniques are typically able to reveal. As the amount of data in the biomedical field constantly increases, the use of deep learning has also seen a vast increase, as deep neural networks are particularly powerful in extracting information from large datasets. 4 In one of many examples, in the field of dermatology, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to classify images of skin lesions as accurately as trained dermatologists. 5 Notably, CNNs have even been found to be superior to dermatologists in melanoma image classification. 6 In cardiology, machine learning has been proposed for developing risk assessments and performing predictions of cardiovascular events. 7 In sleep medicine, deep learning can automate sleep scoring, a tedious task that is otherwise manually performed. 8 Similar applications also have been reported in the fields of neurology, radiology, and pathology. 9,10 Apart from an important role in diagnostics, AI also has applications in drug discovery and development, where it could be used to identify drug-drug interactions and to develop personalized treatments. 11 AI systems could also help reduce health care costs, predict patients' no show, or shorten hospital waiting times by searching millions of medical records. 12 Our goal with this article is to focus on the question of AI and fairness in relation to bias in health care, and examine how open science tools can help address it. We start with an overview of known sources and examples of bias in the medical field. We then focus on data bias, and outline the main open challenges that need to be addressed from an algorithmic, medical, and societal point of view.

This omission should not be taken lightly, as Black patients have the highest mortality rate for melanoma, with an estimated 5-year survival rate of only 70%, versus 94% for white patients. Misdiagnoses and socioeconomic barriers hindering access to health care may cause skin cancer at a more advanced stage in Black patients, hindering treatment. 15 Racial bias in health care results in some groups of patients getting better medical treatment than others. In another example, AI algorithms used health costs as a proxy for health needs and falsely concluded that Black patients are healthier than equally sick white patients, as less money was spent on them. 16 As a result, these algorithms gave higher priority to white patients when treating life-threatening conditions, such as diabetes and kidney disease, even though Black patients have higher severity indexes. 16 The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has proven how biased AI systems amplify existing inequalities, placing vulnerable populations at a higher risk of severe illness and death. 17 AI is used in the fight against COVID-19, but because of the time pressure to develop concrete solutions against the pandemic, AI might be likely to reinforce COVID-19-induced inequalities at scale, because its performance in vulnerable populations may not have been thoroughly tested. 18 Algorithmic bias is not exclusive to race. Gender inequalities also can be exacerbated by imbalanced algorithms. For example, in cardiology, a heart attack is overwhelmingly misdiagnosed in women. 19 Nevertheless, prediction models for cardiovascular disease that claim to predict heart attacks 5 years before they happen 20 are trained in predominantly male datasets. As cardiovascular disease has different patterns of expression in men versus women, 21 an algorithm that has been trained predominantly with data samples of men may not be as accurate in diagnosing women.",

            "text": "Another interesting area for AI in medicine is the quest for automated sleep scoring algorithms. Since the 1960s, many algorithms have been developed, reaching very good perfomances, 22 but when used in a clinical routine they fail miserably. Being trained on young healthy individuals, automated algorithms are often unable to decrypt sleep disorders in older patients. Thanks to bigger and more heterogeneous datasets, automated sleep staging has improved, but we are still far from acceptable performance when validation is done on new datasets or unseen sleep disorders. In sleep scoring, training of AI algorithms is done utilizing visual scoring labels as gold standards. Cognitive biases can lead to poor inter-(70%-80%) and intra-(90%) scoring agreement. 23 This intrinsic limit could be overcome by AI, as its use neutralizes external sources of variance like human expert variability, offering a uniform standardized solution. 8 Bias is concerning in areas where the lack of variability in training data is harder to identify at an early stage, such as drug development and clinical trials. In the case of clinical trials, the majority of participants are male, of a limited age group, and from similar ethnic backgrounds. 24 Preclinical studies are also affected by gender bias, as they typically include either a vast majority, or exclusively male animals, 25 which resulted in the NIH issuing guidelines to balance the ratio of male/female animals. 26 Gender biases during the preclinical stages of drug development could alter how women react to newly developed drugs. 27 The results of drug behavior, side effects, and effectiveness from such early studies may in turn be transferred into the datasets that are then used to train AI algorithms.",

In the simplest case, when an algorithm is trained to classify a dataset consisting of 80% healthy and 20% diseased images, just by predicting every sample as healthy, the algorithm will achieve a performance of 80% accuracy.

To increase algorithmic fairness, protected attributes, such as gender or ethnicity, can be included during training in order to ensure that algorithmic predictions are statistically independent from these attributes. 34 Alternatively, loss functions can be defined per protected group, and may be forced to remain below a certain level for all defined groups, so that no single group is systematically misclassified. 34 Similar approaches have been introduced in different AI frameworks, such as in the case of adversarial learning, 35 and are summarized in opensource toolkits that can be used to mitigate algorithmic bias. 36 Human bias. As AI algorithms are designed by humans, they may often reflect human biases. Algorithms are often designed to tackle what their developers consider the most urgent problems to solve, which are not necessarily the same challenges faced by the individuals that are concerned by those algorithms.

As an example, despite numerous initiatives to include sexual orientation and gender identity in electronic health records, to date this information is largely missing. 50 In the vast majority of medical records it is thus impossible to identify LGBTQ+ individuals, who experience health disparities, and may have unique health care needs. Moreover, information related to the researchers or clinicians who collected certain metadata is also often missing, and its importance is ignored. Labels associated with medical data, disease rating scales, and diagnosis may be imbued with cognitive biases of the health care personnel who collected this information. 51 Personality traits like tolerance to risk, or overconfidence may result in diagnostic, therapeutic, or management errors, and may impact patient outcomes. 44 Data standards and interoperability Standardization makes data interoperable and impactful. When data are not openly available and are published in inconsistent and incompatible formats, it becomes difficult to exchange, analyze, and interpret them. Inconsistency in data sharing, variability in data quality, and different levels of data usability determine whether or not researchers get access to high quality training datasets for fair AI. 52 Importantly, several of the underlying datasets that power AI algorithms were not built for this purpose. As a result, the data standards (or lack of) applied to these datasets limit the potential of the algorithms that are trained with them. This is a major limitation in many of the datasets published in data science websites, such as Kaggle, where binary gender fields, incomplete gender disaggregation, and incompatible formats make it difficult to not only build inclusive AI, but also to test for biases.",

Although health care data are necessary to advance medicine, they contain sensitive information that needs to be safeguarded for privacy reasons. 54 It is not enough to simply code the name and surname of a patient to ensure anonymity. In one of many examples, electroencephalography signals, which are typically considered anonymous, can be used as a biometric identifier. 55 Therefore, new anonymization processes must be conceived. Responsible data sharing frameworks designed with openness at their core that also protect the individual's rights to privacy are needed for health care data. One example of such a framework is the federated learning systems, which enable the training of AI algorithms at a local level, allowing individuals to maintain control and anonymity of their data. 56 Inclusive health data standards to support interoperability Data standards lead to efficient data infrastructure and support interoperability. Shared formatting, language, and data identifiers make information scalable, while comprehensive metadata descriptions enhance the discoverability of communities and concepts. 57 Fair biomedical data standards cannot be developed in isolation, and require constant feedback from patient or community representatives. 58 However, creating standards from the ground up is a complex process; therefore, the adoption of existing health data standards is advised. A number of existing health data standards are recommended by health authorities, such as Health Level 7, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and OpenEHR, among others. 58 In addition, the Open Standards for Data Guidebook provides a general introduction to open data standards for data, making it easier to find and adopt existing standards and, when necessary, create new ones. Generating synthetic data to combat bias Oftentimes, despite the best intentions, it is impossible to have unbiased datasets. Questions of privacy, anonymity, and trust may obstruct the participation of underrepresented groups in data sharing initiatives. To overcome this limitation, the field of machine learning has several tools, such as Generative Adversarial Networks, 59 that can be used to artificially generate synthetic data and augment underrepresented classes, such as skin lesion images. 60 This can allow neural networks to be trained with more samples of data that may be underrepresented, such as data of ethnic minorities. Future studies can evaluate the efficacy of this approach in decreasing the rates of misclassified samples of underrepresented groups.",

Open Humans takes a participant-centered approach to data sharing, in order to solve some of the challenges associated with data ethics, privacy, and patient involvement. 61 ",
