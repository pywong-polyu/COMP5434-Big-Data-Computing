Study design In this qualitative study, 111 healthcare professionals participated in patient care simulations and debriefings in a new NICU. Debriefing transcripts were inductively analyzed to characterize LSTs. Unresolved LSTs were identified 1 year after NICU occupancy. Results Thematic saturation was attained after analysis of nine debriefings. Four major themes affecting staff function and patient safety emerged from 305 threats: relay of information, workplace design, patient care processes, and patient family and staff focus. One-year post occupancy, 29 (9%) LSTs remained unresolved. Conclusion Team debriefings of simulated patient events uncover LSTs that can largely be resolved before transitioning patient care into a new NICU. Understanding how LSTs interact provides a platform to develop viable strategies to mitigate patient safety risks.",

A codebook was developed and iteratively revised during the data analysis process as investigators reviewed and analyzed the data. Investigators refined and updated the codes with analysis of each subsequent transcript [20] . A third investigator reviewed coded transcripts and verified the codes. When there was discordance amongst investigators on specific codes, they discussed the codes together to find a resolution. If no resolution resulted, they consulted a fourth investigator. Investigators synthesized the codes to identify themes and subthemes of LSTs. Each latent safety threat was categorized as minor, major or serious in scope, based on the potential for harm. LSTs that were likely to result in harm if not resolved were defined as serious; LSTs that had the potential to cause harm if linked with other LSTs were defined as major; and systems inefficiencies with a low probability of causing harm to patients, families or staff were defined as minor. The investigators developed visual aids to illustrate the relationship of emerging themes and subthemes [21] . They maintained an audit trail, which was reviewed by a fifth investigator to mitigate unintended bias and support the trustworthiness of content analysis [22] .",

The nurse leader assisting the bedside nurse ran to the charting room to alert them. She tried signaling for help through the glass wall, but they were not able to hear her.

This study was conducted at a single academic medical center, and the specific types and proportions of identified LSTs may not wholly represent those uncovered in other healthcare environments. In addition, in situ simulations do not fully replicate patient care in the clinical environment. To minimize these limitations, we utilized a variety of clinical scenarios based on a needs assessment, and staff from different professions and disciplines participated to strengthen the yield and quality of team debriefings. Using these strategies, we did not identify any new themes. Conducting post-occupancy team debriefings after in situ simulations and clinical events would further verify the identified themes.",

A conceptual framework that highlights the important interactions between human factors, relay of information, workplace design, and patient care processes can help explore unanticipated risk in the early healthcare environment design stages. Understanding the impact of the new healthcare environment on these factors provides a platform to develop viable solutions that better support staff function and improve patient care. Testing proposed LST mitigation strategies in a simulated environment further strengthens patient safety before transitioning patient care into the new healthcare environment.",
