The participants included 1780 left-behind (960 boys) and 1500 non-left-behind (811 boys) children in elementary and junior high school with a mean age of 11.23. Self-reported questionnaires concerning children's depression, loneliness, anxiety, and academic adjustment, and parents' coping with children's negative emotions were completed. The results suggested that compared with non-left-behind children, left-behind children's depression and anxiety symptoms were more severe and their academic adjustment was poorer. However, left-behind children had lower levels of loneliness than non-left-behind children. Additionally, supportive coping types, especially emotion-focused and problem-focused reactions, were significantly negatively correlated with children's depression and anxiety. Unsupportive coping types, especially distress and punitive reactions, were significantly positively correlated with children's depression and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, the relationships between punitive reactions and depression, ignoring and loneliness and problem-focused reactions and academic adjustment were significantly stronger in left-behind children. Hence, during the pandemic, left-behind children were still at a disadvantage even with their parents' company. However, parents' coping style towards left-behind children's negative emotions played a significant role in their adjustment.",

However, the pandemic brought many challenges to LBC's families: first, LBC had difficulties taking courses online because of their low family economic status and the poor network infrastructure in rural communities (Chen et al., 2019) ; second, like general children, LBC experienced a stress response to the pandemic, such as negative emotions; third, LBC's parents need to rebuild bonds with their children (Louise et al., 2019) and manage pressure from children's negative emotions as well as the danger of being unemployed. Hence, although LBC and their parents had a chance to live together for a longer time, they both faced a disadvantaged situation.",

Compared to NLBC, this situation brought greater changes to LBC's family income and parent-child bonds. However, the reunion between parents and children is a dynamic process of physical return after separation (Louise et al., 2019) . In this process, both parents and children need to adapt their behaviour patterns to fit the new family environment, which may result in a maladaptive child-parent bond. Louise et al. (2019) indicated that LBC have disrupted attachment, which makes them vulnerable to environmental changes. Hence, during the COVID-19 pandemic, LBC encountered more challenges in their family environment, which would make them have poorer adjustment levels compared with NLBC.",

How parents cope with children's negative emotions has a critical impact on children's social response, which is an important aspect of their social adjustment process (Fabes et al., 2001) . Specifically, researchers explored how each coping style affected children's social adjustment. Parental punitive reactions positively predicted externalising problems, whereas emotion-focused reactions were negatively related to internalising problems (Tao et al., 2010) . Additionally, parents' problem-focused reactions tended to promote children's social skills. Mirabile (2015) also found that parental ignoring reactions increase the risk of child socioemotional maladjustment. In general, parental supportive reactions to children's negative emotions, such as problem-focused protected child social adjustment, are more helpful, whereas unsupportive reactions are risk factors.",

Parents and children spent much more time together, but their outdoor activities were limited, which brought varied outcomes to children depending on the quality of their family interaction. According to attachment theory, repeating separations and reunions with caregivers is stressful and disrupts LBC's attachment behaviours (Rosmalen et al., 2014) . Hence, when they reunited with their parents, the previous attachment network pattern changed, in which children needed to make great efforts to adapt to the parent-child bond. A previous study found that LBC lack emotional care and socialisation from parents, so they are more vulnerable when their parents cannot provide positive reactions when they have negative emotions (Zhao et al., 2015) . Thus, because LBC are more sensitive to cohesion and emotional relationships with their parents than NLBC (Fan et al., 2018) , how parents cope with LBC's negative emotions during the COVID-19 would be vitally important.",

Because all the children took courses online, which is far different from traditional classroom settings, ASS is more suitable for this situation than others in that it assesses a more stable state of academic adjustment. ASS was originally developed in English, so it was translated into Chinese and back-translated into English to ensure linguistic and conceptual equivalence (Marsella & Leong, 1995) . AAS consists of three dimensions: academic lifestyle, academic achievement and academic motivation. Each dimension has three items. In the current study, we adopted the expression of each item to help children of different ages better understand the items and asked children to report academic adjustment during the pandemic (e.g. \"I am enjoying the lifestyle of studying at home\" [academic lifestyle]; \"I am satisfied with the level of my academic performance lately\" [academic achievement]; \"After this winter break, I think I will do my best to overcome the difficulties of the subject I don't like\" [academic motivation].

Though LBC had their parents with them during the pandemic, their parent-child bonds were still not stable since their family environment changed because of the pandemic. However, we found that LBC had a lower level of loneliness than NLBC during the COVID-19, which is in disagreement with H1 and inconsistent with previous research (Jia & Tian, 2010) . This incompatible result could be explained by the difference in the relationship between peer relationships and loneliness in LBC and NLBC. Sun and his colleagues (2010) found that the predictive effect of peer relationships on loneliness in LBC was significantly weaker than NLBC because the major predictor of LBC's loneliness is parental absence but for NLBC, friendship played a more important role in their feelings of loneliness. Hence, on account of the quarantine, NLBC had fewer chances to maintain peer relationships, which might increase their feelings of loneliness. In contrast, LBC reunited with their parents and regain the concern from their families during the pandemic, which was the reason for their lower level of loneliness (Jia & Tian, 2010) .",

On the one hand, supportive coping types, especially emotion-focused and problem-focused reactions, were closely related to children's depression and anxiety. Indeed, previous research has stressed the importance of parental responses to release children's negative emotions and help solve the problem induced by emotions, which is an emotional socialisation process (Yan et al., 2016) and would help children socialise their own abilities of emotional adjustment. On the other hand, unsupportive coping types, in particular, distress reactions and punitive reactions, endangered children's depression and anxiety symptoms (Fabes et al., 2001) , because there was an intergenerational transmission between parents' emotional behaviours and children's emotional problems (Zhao et al., 2018) . Therefore, if parents use harsh coping strategies in response to children's negative emotions, then their children would express emotion in relatively intense ways (Fabes et al., 2001) . In addition, there were significant associations between academic adjustment and parental emotion-focused, problem-focused and punitive reactions. Consistent with an Emotion-Attention Process Model advanced by Moed et al. (2016) , parent-child negative emotion reciprocity predicted children's school success through children's negative emotionality as well as their low attention focusing.",

More specifically, for LBC, if parents conducted more punitive reactions when they had negative emotions, their depression symptoms would be amplified more significantly; if parents adopted ignoring reactions frequently, LBC's feeling of loneliness would be significantly increased, although their overall level of loneliness was lower than that of NLBC during the pandemic; if the parent used more problem-focused reactions towards children's negative emotions, LBC's academic adjustment would be protected though they had more academic adjustment difficulties. Since the multidimensionality of social adjustment and PRNs, it is significant to identify the adjustment in different domains that were affected by which specific coping ways. Previous findings revealed that, in comparison with other parental coping types, LBC's emotional adjustment was more vulnerable to punitive and ignoring reactions and their academic adjustment significantly improved by problem-focused reaction. To summarise, though PRNs were important to children's social adjustment generally, LBC were more sensitive to these three reactions for their emotional and academic adjustment, respectively.",

During the COVID-19, LBC and their parents both need to make efforts to adjust to rebuild their attachment pattern. Therefore, if parents exhibit an unsupportive coping style when LBC have negative emotions, they would only make the emotional problem more severe. Punitive and ignoring but not distress and minimisation reactions played a moderator role between the left-behind situation and children's emotional adjustment, which might be because the punitive reaction is more intense than other coping methods (Mirabile, 2015) , especially for vulnerable children like LBC. Additionally, because LBC were neglected by their parents and society for a long time (Chen et al., 2010) , their emotional adjustment would be damaged more severely if they were still ignored when they were together with their parents.",

From February to March of the pandemic period, all students were taking classes at home after the winter break, which needed a higher level of self-discipline and attention ability to learn efficiently (Gaytan, 2013) . LBC had poorer academic performance and higher level of academic anxiety due to the lack of appropriate family education and family warmth (Fan & Sang, 2005) . However, during the pandemic, if they had great instruction from parental problem-focused reactions when they confronted with academic difficulties and anxiety, they would get additional improvement in academic adjustment than NLBC, since NLBC already had a stable parental problem-focused reaction pattern. Hence, LBC would benefit more from problem-focused reactions on their academic adjustment. Other supportive PNRs did not show significant interactions with the left-behind situation, which might be because problem-focused strategy is a more direct way for children to learn how to deal with academic difficulties that involve solvable problems (Liu et al., 2009) .",

First, due to the unpredictive outbreak of COVID-19, all data were collected through an online survey, so although the reliability reached an acceptable standard, it might decrease compared with previous studies at other times. In addition, a sampling bias might exist because the counties with poorer network infrastructure were out of reach, although the counties we selected are the typical areas where the left-behind phenomenon is more frequently observed. Second, since parents of LBC might not perceive children's situations immediately after returning home in the short term, children's adjustment outcomes were self-reported, which might increase common method bias. Third, the family condition was complicated during the pandemic, and there might be more stressors on children and parents, such as the dangers of unemployment for parents and peer distancing for children. The current study only assessed the outcomes of children's social adjustment during this period; further exploration is required to understand the major stressors induced by a pandemic such as COVID-19. Fourth, we explored different effects of the types of PNRs, but LBC's family reunion was a dynamic process (Louise et al., 2019) , so future research could focus on the family functioning process of reunion in LBC.",
