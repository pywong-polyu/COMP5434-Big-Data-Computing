This global crisis affected all age groups in every single country, causing a huge medical and economic burden. Perioperative management of parturients has always been considered challenging, especially regarding difficult airway and pulmonary complications [1] . COVID-19 infection adds more challenge especially in patients already having pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pregnant ladies are more prone to morbidity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality due to COVID-19 in comparison with non-pregnant females [2, 3] , since they have relatively depressed immunity and several cardiopulmonary physiologic changes during pregnancy that can theoretically increase the risk from COVID-19 infection [4] .",

At the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), the level of dermatological block also showed a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.001), but this correlation was contrariwise to the intraoperative levels of sensory block, since the median level of sensory block was T8 (T6-T10) in COVID-19 positive patients, compared to T10 (T10-T10) in control group. There were no statistically significant differences in the time needed for motor block reversal (p = 0.26), neither in the time lapsed prior to the need for the first dose of rescue analgesia (p = 0.191).

The other case was admitted to the ICU for severe ARDS few days before delivery, she underwent cesarean section under spinal anesthesia on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and couple of days later she was electively intubated after being unstable and due to the failure of other methods to maintain her oxygenation. This patient passed away on the fourth postoperative day, marking a mortality rate of 3.2% among COVID-19 positive parturients (p = 1).

Although previous literature on non-COVID-19 laboring women indicated that spinal aesthesia is associated with postspinal hypotension [22] , no vigorous comparison was performed to compare between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 parturients. In their recent study, Zhang et al., concluded that there is an increased risk of neuraxial anesthesia-related hypotension in COVID-19 parturients undergoing cesarean delivery (57.4% in COVID-19 parturients and 41.9% control group) [23] . Although this article provides interesting multicentric data of 101 COVID-19 parturients from three hospitals of Hubei Province, China, the multicentric retrospective design of their study did not permit the inclusion of data regarding preoperative fluid preloading, nor did the study include information regarding the agents and doses used for spinal anesthesia, the utilization of right lumbar-pelvic wedge upon patients positioning, intraoperative blood loss, and intraoperative dose of oxytocin and carbetocin. In our study, all patients received 100 mcg carbetocin and 5 IU oxytocin IV just after delivering their neonates. Several protective measures help in decreasing the risk for post-spinal hypotension, such as the use of right lumbar-pelvic wedge, decreasing the dose of intrathecal local anesthetic, preoperative fluid preloading, as well as decreasing the dose of intraoperative intravenous oxytocin, which was given with carbetocin after delivering the neonate.",

Upon reviewing literature, incidence of neonatal COVID-19 infections seems low, and there are only few rare cases of vertical transmission of COVID-19 [24, 25] . As most NICU admissions were related to prematurity, and literature shows no increase in premature delivery rates in COVID-19 positive patients [26] [27] [28] , it remains unclear whether other maternal factors related to their COVID-19 infection have a role in increasing premature deliveries or increasing NICU admissions.

The other case of ICU admission was due to PPH due to obstetric cause, and she was discharged home without complications few days later. In comparison, in a study conducted in India on 115 patients, 5 cases were admitted to the ICU, out of which 1 patient (0.87%) died on the seventh postoperative day [31] . On the other hand, in a study including 61 COVID-19 positive cesarean deliveries in Turkey [32] , in which 58 (95.1%) underwent spinal anesthesia, 1 case was admitted to the ICU after delivery under spinal anesthesia, she was intubated later on, and received mechanical ventilation for 68 days, after which she was discharged from the ICU 108 days after her admission. Among the three remaining patients who received general anesthesia, one patient was already intubated at the ICU due to respiratory worsening preoperatively, and she died on the tenth day of ICU follow-up. Based on these findings, Karasu et al., concluded that the mortality rate was 1.6% in all patients, 5.0% in symptomatic patients, and 11.1% in patients with pneumonia [32] . In the current study, the only mortality case was mainly related to the patient's pre-operative respiratory condition. She had severe ARDS few days before delivery and she underwent cesarean section under spinal anesthesia on HFNC. Couple of days later, she was electively intubated, and she passed away on the fourth postoperative day. Since few records of this adverse outcome are present in each study, we encourage future international registry to include all similar unfavorable outcomes in order to investigate risk factors for perioperative maternal mortality.",

Secondly, this study did not focus primarily on neonatal outcomes, but rather compared between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 parturients regarding the safety of spinal anesthesia for cesarean deliveries. Thirdly, the number of attempts of dural puncture must be compared in future studies among anesthesia providers from different training levels to investigate whether the utilization of level 3 PPEs increased the number of unsuccessful attempts for spinal anesthesia. Furthermore, this study was not designed to perform longterm follow-up on patients and their newborns. Lastly, we did not compare the sample to outcomes of general anesthesia, which is justified by the very little number of COVID-19 positive patients undergoing general anesthesia due increased risk of general anesthesia and ethical limitations of performing general anesthesia on parturients for the sake of medical research.",
