This review aimed to determine whether there are clinical tools that can be incorporated into a clinical decision support system for primary care for efficient and accurate diagnosis of causes of chronic dyspnoea. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar for all literature published between 1946 and 2020. Studies that evaluated a clinical algorithm for assessment of chronic dyspnoea in patients of any age group presenting to physicians with chronic dyspnoea were included. We identified 326 abstracts, 55 papers were reviewed, and eight included. A total 2026 patients aged between 20-80 years were included, 60% were women. The duration of dyspnoea was three weeks to 25 years. All studies undertook a stepwise or algorithmic approach to the assessment of dyspnoea.",

If the patient remains undiagnosed, the second stage includes investigations such as chest x-ray, thyroid function tests, full blood count and NT-proBNP. In the third stage patients are referred for more advanced tests such as echocardiogram and thoracic CT. If dyspnoea remains unexplained, the fourth stage of assessment will require secondary care referral for more advanced diagnostic testing such as exercise tests. Utilising this proposed stepwise approach is expected to ascertain a cause for dyspnoea for 35% of the patients in stage 1, 83% by stage 3 and >90% of patients by stage 4.",

As an example, in a study using questionnaires and spirometry to estimate the burden of obstructive lung disease in urban and regional Australia, 29% of people who said a doctor had diagnosed COPD, emphysema or chronic bronchitis, actually had no evidence of airflow limitation 14 . This apparent over-diagnosis was matched by similar levels of under-diagnosis. In this same study, the prevalence of shortness of breath when hurrying or climbing a slight hill was 25.2% (95% CI, 22.7-27.6%) demonstrating the high prevalence of dyspnoea in Australians aged over 40 years. Similarly, in Italy, it was reported that only one-third (30.7%) of participants with daily respiratory symptoms had undergone any lung function tests. Moreover, the prevalence of self-reported physician diagnosis was 1.4%, far lower than the 9.1% to 11.7% prevalence based on spirometry 15 .",

Once duplicates were removed, the investigators (C.J., N.B., N.H. and A.P.S.) independently reviewed the title and abstracts and excluded irrelevant studies. The full-length relevant articles were retrieved and examined to further determine if they met inclusion criteria. Conflicts were resolved through discussion with all investigators.

After further review of the full articles, eight studies were included in the final analyses. (Fig. 1 ) The primary reasons for exclusion were that the average duration of dyspnoea was of shorter duration than one month, there was an inadequate description of the CDSS or algorithm, the algorithm was not validated and/or there was no quantification of outcome after its use. One study (Pratter et al. 18 ) included patients with dyspnoea from >3 weeks but reported a mean dyspnoea duration of 2.9 years (range 3 weeks to 25 years), hence it was decided to include it as part of the review.

In this study CPET results were compared with final clinical diagnosis in 50 patients. In the majority of patients (n = 24) the CPET study was suggestive of poor conditioning but could not exclude a cardiac cause. Of these, 14 patients responded to exercise training and/or weight loss, 3 had cardiac disease, 7 had airway hyperresponsiveness, and 4 had psychogenic dyspnoea. In 13 patients with normal CPET results, the cause of dyspnoea was assessed as gastroesophageal reflux in 1, hyperactive airway disease in 2, psychogenic dyspnoea in 4, and no identifiable disease in 6. The authors concluded that CPET is useful in identifying a cardiac or a pulmonary cause but has limited sensitivity in distinguishing cardiac cause from deconditioning. Subsequent studies, however, suggest that cardiac disease and deconditioning can be distinguished more readily with CPET 27 . When dyspnoea is unexplained after clinical history and examination, lung function testing, chest X-ray and echocardiogram, CPET remains a highly informative test 28 .",

We note that some of these investigations are only available in secondary and tertiary care with specific use cases. ABGs for example were used in the two studies that reported them only in patients with concomitant hypoxia (oxygen saturation <95%) or utilised to measure the alveolar to arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient which was found to support diagnosis of functional dyspnoea in patients aged <40 years. It is, however, worth noting that since several of these studies were published, several tests investigations have become much more practical in primary care (e.g. oxygen saturation measurements), or very readily accessed (e.g. thoracic CT imaging with reports).",

Additionally, patients have their own explanations for it, often blaming themselves for lack of fitness, sedentary lifestyle, smoking or obesity. Nihilism and lack of vigilance on a clinician's part can also delay diagnosis and the implementation of effective treatment [6] [7] [8] . As Ocal and colleagues 24 had also noted, multimorbid causes of dyspnoea are common in practice and must be taken into account during evaluation. Even where the chronic heart and/or lung disease is present, dyspnoea was strongly associated with preventable, addressable lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, anxiety and depression 34, 35 .",

Although it is non-invasive and can be readily performed in primary care, many previous studies have shown that spirometry is not routinely utilised in primary care or is performed with sub-optimal technical quality and interpretation 14, 15 . White and colleagues in an observational study of spirometry in 6 general practices in the United Kingdom (UK) reported that 15% of spirometry test results were incomplete and 40% of those complete were unacceptable by specialist standards 36 . In a more recent validation study in the UK on the validity and interpretation of spirometry recordings in primary care for diagnosing COPD it was reported that while 98.6% of spirometry recordings were of adequate quality according to chest physicians, only 72.5% of spirometry traces labelled as COPD were consistent with obstruction 37 . In Australia, a study in New South Wales reported even lower values with only 57.8% of COPD patients diagnosed with no prior testing in primary care having had post-bronchodilator spirometry results consistent with COPD or asthma 38 . These studies demonstrate that not only is the quality of recording a problem in some sites but even when of technically adequate quality, interpretation may be inaccurate. This is a situation where a decision support system can help by providing support in both performing the spirometry and its automated interpretation.",
