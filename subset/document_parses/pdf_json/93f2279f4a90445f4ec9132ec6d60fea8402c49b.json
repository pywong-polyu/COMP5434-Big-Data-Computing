Methods We used the novel \"Herdsman\" system implementing radiotracking technology to measure individual ethanol intake in group-housed animals. Mice were housed in same-sex groups of 4 per cage and exposed to 3 and 6% ethanol solutions. After baseline drinking was established, half of the animals in each cage received repeated intraperitoneal injections of 3 mg/kg oxytocin. Results During baseline, females consumed more ethanol than males partly due to greater number of ethanol drinks taken by females. We also observed a gradual development of two peaks of ethanol consumption during the dark phase of the circadian cycle. The effects of oxytocin treatment were short-acting and varied across treatment days. Oxytocin significantly decreased ethanol intake on three out the four treatment days. On the fourth treatment day, oxytocin decreased ethanol intake and water intake. Conclusion The greater intake of ethanol in female mice is associated with the number of drinks taken. Oxytocin treatments not only cause an acute decrease in ethanol consumption, but can also change in efficacy over time. While the oxytocin system remains a promising therapeutic target for alcoholism, studies investigating longer periods of repeated oxytocin treatment and those using additional oxytocin receptor agonists are warranted.",

The development of this disorder involves the transition from a state of recreational alcohol use to that of an uncontrolled pattern of intake (Koob and Volkow 2016) , and eventually, if untreated, can lead to compulsive use and the emergence of a negative affective state when abstaining from alcohol use (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 2018). There are currently three drugs approved for treatment of AUD by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 2014). While these medications reduce alcohol consumption in certain patient populations, the overall effectiveness of these treatments varies (Swift and Aston 2015; Akbar et al. 2018) . Thus, the identification of additional therapeutic targets is greatly needed.",

            "text": "Oxytocin (OXT) is a nine-amino acid peptide that has been linked to a variety of physiological functions and behaviors such as lactation, parturition, and pair and social bonding (Williams et al. 1994; Kramer et al. 2006; Lee et al. , 2009 . Recently, though, OXT has also gained interest as a potential treatment for substance use disorders . A growing amount of preclinical and clinical data has demonstrated the ability of OXT to reduce alcohol intake using intranasal, intravenous, intraperitoneal (IP), and intracranial routes of administration (McGregor and Bowen 2012; Peters et al. 2013; MacFadyen et al. 2016; King et al. 2017; Stevenson et al. 2017; Hansson et al. 2018; Tunstall et al. 2019; Walcott and Ryabinin 2020) . However, a number of questions regarding the effectiveness and specificity of OXT treatment for this behavior remain. In particular, it is not clear whether OXT's effects on alcohol intake change over time and/or as a result of repeated treatment. The latter issue is of particular importance, as it is expected that patients with AUD would be treated with OXT repeatedly, and acute versus repeated OXT exposures have been shown to have different effects on various behaviors (Szab\u00f3 et al. 1985; Bowen et al. 2011; Benner et al. 2018 ). Thus, as most of the previously described studies have only examined the effects of OXT following a single treatment, a primary goal of this experiment was to investigate the effects of several OXT treatments on ethanol consumption in male and female mice.",

            "text": "To assess the effects of pharmacological intervention on voluntary ethanol intake, researchers often use a traditional two-bottle choice model where single-housed rodents have access to one bottle of ethanol and one bottle of water (Crabbe et al. 2011; Becker 2013; Huynh et al. 2019) . Single-housing rodents can be problematic for ethanol studies because drinking behavior and the reaction to drugs can differ depending on the housing condition of the rodents (Heilig et al. 2016; Ahmed et al. 2020) . Therefore, any treatments that reduce ethanol intake in singly housed mice might not be as effective, or may have a different effect altogether, if the subjects are housed socially. Additionally, while some studies have investigated the effect of social-housing on ethanol intake, these studies were still unable to track drinking on an individual level, complicating the assessment of pharmacological interventions on ethanol intake in co-housed animals (Ryabinin and Walcott 2018) . As a step forward, advances in radiotracking technology have enabled the study of ethanol intake in group-housed animals at an individual level using Intellicage systems (Smutek et al. 2014; Holgate et al. 2017 ). However, these cages monitor the number licks for ethanol and water bottles for individual animals that are housed socially, rather than measuring exact amounts of fluid consumed. While the number of licks generally correlates with levels of fluid intake, the exact intake per lick can vary between individuals (Ryabinin and Walcott 2018) . In an attempt to address this caveat, a new radiotracking system has been recently developed. The Herdsman-2 (HM2) system (MBRose, Faaborg, Denmark) is designed to track fluid intake at an individual level in socially housed rodents by recording fluid intake (in milliliters), approaches to the fluid bottles and the number of consummatory events, all while also accounting for spillage/evaporation. This system has already been used in two previous studies (Thomsen et al. 2017; Walcott and Ryabinin 2020) assessing ethanol intake in mice and voles, respectively, with promising results. Thomsen et al. have used the HM2 system to investigate the effects of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist exendin-4 on ethanol intake in socially house male C57BL/6 mice. In this study, treatments were administered per cage, such that all animals in a cage received either the agonist or its vehicle. While this study did provide important findings, the basal ethanol intake in this study was low, and researchers needed to first ethanol-deprive animals to test the effectiveness of exendin-4. More recently, our lab has used this system to assess the effects of OXT on ethanol drinking in socially housed male and female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) (Walcott and Ryabinin 2020) . For this study, treatments were administered in a mixed-cage design, such that half of the individuals in each cage received drug treatment while the other half received vehicle. OXT administration decreased ethanol consumption despite the presence of untreated individuals in the same cage. However, the effects of OXT were not specific to ethanol, as this treatment also decreased water intake. These previous studies also did not utilize the HM2 system's ability to examine the temporal dynamics of the treatment effects (only analyzing time-locked cumulative intakes) and its ability to analyze consumption-related behaviors (such as animals' approaches to the fluid bottles and consummatory events). Without these measures, it could be theorized that effects of OXT on ethanol drinking in socially housed animals are mediated by non-specific, for example sedative, effects.",

Since this is the first study measuring several ethanol-related consummatory behaviors in unconstrained socially housed male and female mice, we first thoroughly characterized basal ethanol drinking in these animals. After establishing baseline drinking, we administered IP OXT to half of the animals in each cage and examined temporal effects of repeated OXT over 4 days of treatment on ethanol intake and accompanying behaviors.",

This version of the HM2 system was built to only monitor fluid intake (not food) from two separate bottles. All HM2 apparatuses came equipped with a specialized cage measuring at 48 cm W \u00d7 37.5 cm D \u00d7 21 cm H. All cages included the same bedding that was provided in home cages, a cotton nestlet, 1 pouch of shredded paper, as well as a 15-cm curved, hard plastic tube. Thus, mice were housed in a relatively \"enriched\" environment due to the increased space, nesting materials, and plastic tube. The mice had access to fluids in bottles located at the ends of two separate channels. Each 7-cm channel was designed to only allow a single mouse access to the bottle at a time. Channels are equipped with two separate photocells, one at the entrance of the channel and another before the spout. An RFID chip reader is located next to the channel, so that when an individual mouse enters a channel, the photocell detects their presence and the RFID chip reader identifies that individual. Any raw data generated by that mouse is exported by HM2 software and stored on a computer for subsequent analysis. Fluid consumption is measured by weight displacement in the bottle while a mouse is present in the channel. Any lost fluid is caught by a drip tray directly beneath the bottle and spout and is automatically subtracted from the displacement. In addition to spillage, potential evaporation does not affect intake measures, as weight displacement is only measured when an individual is present in the channel. Additional behavioral measures automatically registered by the system were \"channel entries\", indicating registration of the individual animal when it is breaking the photobeam next to the channel entry, but not the photobeam next to the spout, \"drinks\", indicating when the registered animal is breaking the photobeam next to the spout and there is a weight displacement of 0.02 g or greater in the bottle, and \"drink size,\" the volume of solution consumed during each drinking episode.",

            "text": "Training and experimental timeline HM2 cages were located in a separate room in close proximity to the mouse colony. The room was kept on reverse 12-hr light cycle (lights off at 11 a.m.). Once transferred to the HM2 cages, mice were given 5 days to habituate to the HM2 system and to the reverse light/dark cycle. The mice remained in HM2 cages on a reverse light cycle through the remainder of the experiment. During this habituation period, mice had access to food and water ad libitum, with water located in bottles at the end of both channels. At the end of the habituation period, one of the water bottles was randomly assigned to be replaced with 3% (v/v) ethanol, diluted from 95% ethanol in autoclaved water, to which mice had continuous access for 2 days. This solution was then replaced with 6% (v/v) ethanol, to which mice had continuous access for the remainder of the experiment. While singly housed animals exhibit high levels of intake and high preferences for ethanol concentrations as high as 20% (Hwa et al. 2011; Nelson et al. 2018; Fulenwider et al. 2019) , when housed in a group setting, it has been shown that concentrations greater than 8-10% can yield extremely low preferences and levels of intake (Holgate et al. 2017; Thomsen et al. 2017) . In pilot experiments, we have found that ethanol preference tended to decrease in group-housed mice when the ethanol concentration increased to 8%; therefore, we chose to use 6% ethanol as the final ethanol concentration presented in the current experiment.",

            "text": "Our study is the second to use HM2 cages to evaluate ethanol drinking in mice. The previous mouse study demonstrated lower baseline intakes and preference than our experiment in the absence of ethanol deprivation (Thomsen et al. 2017) . Under these conditions, we also observed lower intakes than most studies using single-housed C57BL/6J mice. This observation is in agreement with previous publications demonstrating that social housing decreases ethanol intake and preference in rodents. However, the levels of ethanol intake and preference observed in our studies are still higher than those reported in previous studies of ethanol drinking in socially housed animals (Smutek et al. 2014; Pradier et al. 2015; Holgate et al. 2017) . Specifically, at the 6% solution (a concentration lower than those used in most studies with socially housed mice), mice in our experiment had higher levels of ethanol intake (3.9-5.3 \u00b1 0.24 \u2212 0.34g/kg) and preference (65-77 \u00b1 4%) than those in previous studies. Interestingly, these intakes are comparable with those observed in singlehoused animals using standard 2BC procedures when similar concentrations are presented (Peters et al. 2013; Marcus et al. 2017; Fulenwider et al. 2019) . Therefore, it appears that social housing decreases not ethanol consumption per se, but rather consumption of higher concentrations of ethanol. Since higher concentrations of ethanol are more likely to produce aversive effects, we hypothesize that socially housed mice are more c d e f Fig. 3 Baseline correlational analyses. a Average baseline ethanol (EtOH) intake positively correlated with average number of EtOH drinks for males (r-squared = 0.78, p < 0.0001) and females (r squared = 0.78, p < 0.0001). b Average baseline water (H2O) intake positively correlated with average number of H2O drinks for males (r-squared = 0.73, p< 0.0001) and females (rsquared = 0.95, p < 0.0001). c Average baseline EtOH intake was not correlated with EtOH drink size for males (r-squared = 0.0004, p = 0.93) or females (rsquared = 0.02, p = 0.54). d Average baseline H2O intake was not correlated with H2O drink size for males (r-squared < 0.0001, p = 0.97) or females (rsquared = 0.0002, p = 0.95). e Average baseline EtOH intake was not correlated with average number of EtOH channel entries for males (r-squared = 0.07, p = 0.21) or females (r-squared = 0.12, p = 0.09). f Average baseline H2O intake was not correlated with average number of H2O channel entries for males (rsquared = 0.05, p = 0.30) or females (r-squared = 0.10, p = 0.13). n = 24/sex sensitive, or at least cautious, of these aversive effects. To model AUD, future studies will focus on ways to increase ethanol intake by implementing ethanol deprivation and intermittent schedule procedures. Female mice consumed significantly higher doses of ethanol than males and had a higher ethanol preference (Figures 2A, S1 ). This observation is consistent with previous studies using single-housed mice (Finn et al. 2004; Mel\u00f3n et al. 2013; Jury et al. 2017; Satta et al. 2018; Fulenwider et al. 2019; Sneddon et al. 2019 ). Our approach using HM2 cages evaluated whether the higher intake in females was caused by a higher number of drinks taken or other factors, such as a higher volume consumed per drink. Previously, such conclusions could only be made by assessing the number of licks in lickometer approaches or by estimating how much time an animal spends in close proximity to the drinking bottle. The lack of correlation between g/kg intake and the number of entries into either the water or ethanol channel indicates that proximity to the drinking bottle is not a good indicator of fluid consumption. In fact, on certain occasions, a significant difference in the number of entries did not correspond to a difference in fluid consumption. This observation was especially noticeable during the first day of baseline drinking behavior, when one of the two bottles was first adulterated with ethanol (see Fig. 2a ), although it was also noticeable at other occasions as well (see Fig. 2g ). In contrast, the number of ethanol and water drinks were strongly, positively correlated with levels of ethanol and water intake in g/kg. In fact, to our knowledge, the correlation between the number of drinks and fluid intake in our study was higher than the correlations between number of licks and intake observed in lickometer studies (Ford et al. 2005; Griffin et al. 2007; Ford et al. 2008) The stronger positive correlation between ethanol intake and number drinks observed here versus the correlation between intake and licks is not surprising, as the number of drinks in the HM2 cages reflects not only the number of an Fig. 4 Time-dependent effects of oxytocin on ethanol (EtOH) consumption (g/kg). Shaded regions of the graph are representative of the dark cycle. a EtOH intake on the first day of treatment. b EtOH intake on the second day of treatment. c EtOH intake on the third and fourth day of treatment.

Hourly analysis of behaviors revealed that females reach greater levels of g/kg ethanol intake partly due to a higher number of drinks in comparison to males. Interestingly, this higher intake is despite larger sizes of individual drinks in males versus females.",

The higher intake of water in males versus females observed towards the end of the dark cycle corresponded to higher number of water drinks taken by males at this time. Overall, these observations indicate that radiofrequency tracking in HM2 cages detects differences in ethanol consumption and accompanying behaviors with high sensitivity, a potentially useful feature for deciphering specific mechanisms by which pharmacological agents regulate ethanol drinking in mice.",

Moreover, it is the second study showing that OXT is capable of decreasing ethanol consumption in mixed-treatment settings, i.e., when only half of the subjects in the group/cage received the treatment. Our laboratory has previously observed this effect in prairie voles using HM2 There were no significant differences. n = 12/group cages (Walcott and Ryabinin 2020) . These findings indicate that OXT can decrease ethanol consumption irrespective of potential counteracting influence by untreated subjects. Interestingly, in the previous HM2 study in prairie voles, OXT did not have selective effects towards ethanol, decreasing both ethanol and water consumption. This is in contrast to our current observation showing that during the first three rounds of OXT treatment, the effects of OXT were specific in decreasing ethanol, but not water, drinking. The lack of OXT's specificity observed in prairie voles could be a species-specific effect due to differences in OXT systems in monogamous versus promiscuous rodent species. Additionally, the prairie voles in the previous experiment had higher baseline levels of ethanol intake compared to those of mice in the current study. Indeed, ethanol consumption in the current model is not an ideal model for AUD, as the levels of ethanol intake were relatively low. However, these findings demonstrate that OXT treatment may also be effective in decreasing modest levels of ethanol consumption, and that this decrease is largely driven by an OXT-induced decrease in the number of drinks taken, demonstrating OXT's ability to decrease the number of drinking occasions.",

However, this dose is lower than those reported to have suppressed ethanol drinking without affecting water drinking or general locomotor activity in rodent models (Stevenson et al. 2017) . The higher doses of OXT could theoretically produce non-selective effects by acting at not only OXT, but also vasopressin receptors. However, our findings argue against this possibility. During the first three treatment cycles, OXT selectively decreased ethanol intake and number of ethanol drinks, but not water intake or the number of water drinks. Furthermore, regardless of the high dose of OXT used in our study, clearance of this peptide from the blood is rapid, such that it is expected to be completely eliminated within 1 h of treatment Lee et al. 2018) . Additionally, controversy exists in the field regarding the pharmacodynamics of IP-administered OXT effects on behavior. Passive blood brain penetrance of OXT is clearly low (Ermisch et al. 1985; Macdonald and Feifel 2013; Neumann et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2018) . Nevertheless, active transport of OXT by Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) to the brain has been recently observed in mice (Yamamoto et al. 2019; Yamamoto and Higashida 2020) . Effects of OXT could also be enhanced by feed-forward mechanisms where peripheral OXT stimulates central actions of OXT . Such feed-forward mechanisms could explain effects of peripheral mechanisms at times when the peptide is eliminated from the bloodstream.",

For example, the effect of OXT on ethanol intake was much weaker on day 2 of treatment in comparison to the previous and subsequent treatment days. Additionally, although OXT selectively decreased ethanol intake within the first several hours of drinking during first three treatment days, a rebound in ethanol intake was observed 13-h post-treatment during the second and third days of treatment, in which OXTtreated mice consumed more ethanol than vehicle-treated controls (see Figs. 4c and 6c). Such inconsistent effects over time were not observed in the previous prairie vole study in the HM2 cages where the same dose of OXT continued to be effective with repeated treatments (Walcott and Ryabinin 2020) . Since the ethanol intake in the prairie vole study was higher than here, and yet more consistent effects of treatment were observed there, we hypothesize that mice are less sensitive to OXT than prairie voles. Interestingly however, although in the present study OXT was observed to have specific effects on ethanol intake during the first three treatments, its effects during the fourth treatment appeared to become less selective. In particular, following the fourth treatment, OXT decreased not only ethanol intake and the number of ethanol drinks, but also water intake, the number of water drinks, and the number of entries into the ethanol channel, suggesting that on the fourth day of treatment, OXT may have decreased ethanol intake through off-target effects, such as sedation or general motivation to consume any fluid.",

In contrast, our findings suggest that OXT's effects change from more selective to non-selective and suggest sensitization in the systems affected by OXT. This sensitization could occur in OXT or vasopressin receptors, or could even involve signal transduction mechanisms affected by activation of these receptors. The role of the vasopressin system in these offtarget consummatory effects is of particularly high relevance given this system's established importance in regulating water balance (Danziger and Zeidel 2015; Bankir et al. 2017) . Additionally, while we did not directly measure the effects of OXT treatment on food consumption, acute OXT treatment can significantly decrease food intake (Arletti et al. 1989; Olson et al. 1991; Ott et al. 2013) . Thus, the effect of repeated, IP OXT administration on food intake and on palatable, ethanol-free, sucrose solutions will be examined in future experiments.",
