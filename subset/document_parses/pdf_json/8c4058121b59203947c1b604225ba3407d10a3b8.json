Simultaneously, the tourism industry's economic sustainability in the digital economy has been impacted by the epidemic as its growth has shifted from a steady increase to an unstable state. To better explore the tourism industry's economic sustainability and learn about the trend of tourism stock price, one must establish an excellent stock forecasting model. Stock price prediction has been regarded as an intractable task due to the stock market's intrinsic non-linearity and instability.",

China's National Bureau of Statistics announced a 6.8% year-on-year decline in real GDP for the first quarter of 2020. In terms of the micro-sector situation, China's tourism industry lost more than RMB 550 billion in revenue, equivalent to 2% of GDP in the first quarter, due to measures such as the travel ban imposed during the epidemic. With the epidemic under effective control in China, China's domestic tourism revenue during the May Day holiday in 2020 was RMB 47.56 billion, a recovery of 31.2% compared to the first quarter. In the digital economy, the tourism industry has always had good development opportunities. Still, the outbreak of the epidemic caused a short-term downturn in the tourism industry during this period. It can be seen from the above data that the economic sustainability of the tourism industry has been greatly impacted. As the tourism industry has been affected by the epidemic, stock prices in China's tourism industry are in a state of volatility. Also, they cannot be predicted accurately due to their stochastic features. The volatile stock price trends require better stock forecasting models to predict them.",

Many scholars invoked swarm intelligence algorithms to optimize stock prediction models' parameters to obtain higher prediction accuracy. For example, Wang and Zhuo (7) applied the FOA algorithm to optimize SVR parameters and combine them with support vector machines to develop a PCA-FOA-SVR stock price prediction model with high accuracy non-linear planning. However, compared with the QFOA algorithm, the FOA algorithm has a limited application range and a slightly lower parameter optimization accuracy. Bao et al.

Huo et al. (13) established a threelayer BPNN. They utilized the LM-BP algorithm to forecast stock price, which has a faster convergence rate and overcomes the samples' redundancy and noise.

Despite abundant researches on the application of multilayer-BPNN, it's still a hard task to define the optimal architecture. If there are too few nodes in each layer, the architecture cannot learn from the data properly, whereas if there are too many nodes, it causes waste inefficiency of training the Neural Network. Thomas and Suhner (16) . In general, there is no clear theoretical guidance for setting the number of nodes in each hidden layer. Some researches focused on this topic. For instance, Beigy and Meybodi (17) pointed out that the determination of the optimal topology of neural networks belongs to the class of non-deterministic polynomialtime (NP)-hard problems and proposed a survival algorithm to determine the number of hidden units of three layers neural networks. Thomas and Suhner (16) proposed a pruning approach to determine the optimal structure of neural networks. Khan et al. (18) conducted empirical research that indicated that BPNN for predicting stock prices with two hidden layers is more accurate than the sing layer and three and four hidden layers. However, Zhang and Shen (19) compared single hidden layer prediction models and the multiple hidden layers prediction model. The result showed that the three hidden layers' model has a better predictive ability than the former. Therefore, we consider that the number of hidden layers depends on the different data set and there is no absolutely optimal number of hidden layers.",

Still, several scholars seldom studied how to use the swarm intelligence algorithms to optimize the structure of BPNN for the pre-COVID era. However, these papers have not considered the NP-hard problems for the COVID-19 era. At this stage, the swarm intelligence algorithm is a good way to solve NPhard problems. Therefore, a new Quantum Step Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (QSFOA) is proposed in this paper. This issue is the main contribution of our paper. Besides, quantum swarm intelligent algorithms (QSIAs), including QSFOA, QPSO and QGA, are respectively used to optimize the number of neurons in the multilayer-BPNN. The tourism industry's stock data is then applied to test the three models' predictive power as proof of the feasibility and superiority of the method proposed in the paper.",

BPNN is a kind of multilayer perceptron (MLP), and it is a feedforward network. It trains the network by error backpropagation algorithm. The training purpose of BPNN is to establish a non-linear mapping between input values X and output value Y. The weights and thresholds are adjusted continuously through error backpropagation, and finally, the error signal reaches the minimum. The training process of BPNN is mainly divided into two stages. The first stage is the forward propagation of the signal from the input layer to the hidden layer and finally to the output layer. The second stage is the backpropagation of errors, from the output layer to the hidden layer, and finally to the input layer, adjusting the hidden layer's weight and bias to the output layer to the hidden layers in turn. BPNN consists of three parts including input Layer, hidden layer and output layer. The structure of multilayer-BPNN is shown in Figure 1 .",

Therefore, this paper collects these two enterprises' daily stock information from the Wind database from October 25, 2018, to October 21, 2020, with 483 observations. We first import all the data from 16 indexes of the two tourism enterprises' stocks into the R language, then discretize the data using the \"discretization\" function in the rough set calculation method. Finally, the function \"FS.all.reducts.computation\" is used to reduce the indexes. After eliminating the useless indexes through a rough set, the 16 technical indexes such as opening price are reduced to 12 technical indexes such as opening price, highest price, lowest price, turnover (million RMB) and RSI as the independent variables in this paper. In this paper, MATLAB R2019a software is used for the analysis. Eighty percent of entire data sets (if it's not an integer, round it off) are used as training data to construct the model. The rest of the 20% data are then used as test data to perform the prediction accuracy analysis of the QSFOA-BPNN, QPSO-BPNN and QGA-BPNN.

Besides, the best structure optimized by these three QSIA about two companies is shown in the fifth index, and the last one is the running time of different algorithms. We can find from Table 3 that QSFOA-BPNN model evaluation indexes in the first group of data are as follows, MAPE is 1.2416, which is not much different from the other two models. While CE is 0.9850, RMSE is 0.1025, and MAD is 0.0772, all of which are better than the other two models. Therefore, the prediction performance of stock 002707.SZ gives a ranking result about the three models of QSFOA-BPNN > QGA-BPNN > QPSO-BPNN. The QSFOA-BPNN model has a MAPE of 1.2416 and a MAD of 1.0127, which is in the middle of the three models from the secondary data set. While the CE is 0.9814 and the RMSE is 1.8054, the QSFOA-BPNN model has the best goodness of fit and the lowest error compared to the remaining two models. The prediction performance of stock 601888.SH shows that QSFOA-BPNN > QPSO-BPNN > QGA-BPNN.",

The fruit fly flying routes in the two stock models reveal that all the fruit flies in the QSFOA-BPNN model have very random flight paths, making fruit flies easily jump out of the solution of local extreme value and find the solution of the global optimum.

Furthermore, this article uses the sample data to test three prediction models for two stock closing prices five times. The test results are shown in Table 4 . We can learn from Table 4 that QSFOA performs best in the running time because it reduces calculating complexity with high calculating speed in general. Figure 5 shows the prediction results of the test data in QSFOA-BPNN, QPSO-BPNN and QGA-BPNN. The horizontal axis corresponds to the stock's closing price of actual value, while the vertical axis is the closing price of the predicted value. The closer the sampling point is to the diagonal, the more accurate the prediction results will be. According to the samples' clustering trend, we can see that the three models have a good predictive ability. However, the model optimized by QSFOA can predict the closing price of the two tourism companies more accurately than the model optimized by QGA and QPSO.",

We explore the future economic sustainability of tourism driven by the digital age covering the COVID-19 era. We establish the deep learning models for forecasting, considering that a better structure of BPNN enables us to get better prediction results. For this purpose, this paper adopts the quantum swarm intelligence algorithms (QSIA), including the QSFOA, the QPSO and the QGA, associated with the BPNN adjusted with the number of neurons hidden layer independent variable accuracy analysis for the prediction of the closing price of the stocks. The QSFOA-BPNN model results show that the Utour Group Co., Ltd and China Tourism Group Duty-Free Corporation Limited performs more accurately with the QPSO-BPNN and the QGA-BPNN approaches. It is important to note that our models do not apply to the large volume of data to validate the prediction capability. Therefore, the QSFOA-BPNN model optimized by the QSFOA algorithm can be used as a research direction for future papers.",
