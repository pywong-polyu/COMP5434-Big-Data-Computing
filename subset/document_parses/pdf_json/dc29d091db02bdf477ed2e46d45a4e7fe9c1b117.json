            "text": "BACKGROUND Management of genital warts and herpes creates a significant workload for sexual health services (SHSs). In 2018, primary episodes of genital warts (57 318 cases) and genital herpes (33 867) represented 21% of all new sexually transmitted infections (STIs) diagnosed in SHSs in England. 1 Diagnosis and management of these conditions traditionally require an intimate examination and multiple clinic attendances which may be inconvenient, embarrassing and costly for service users. 2 Costs are similarly high for SHSs due to the requirement for repeat clinic visits and clinician-administered treatment. 3 4 Self-management of sexual health conditions through interactive, online services linked to clinical advice has an increasing evidence-base suggesting that it is both effective and acceptable 5 6 and photodiagnosis has been pioneered within e-dermatology services. Benefits of online self-management and photodiagnosis include reduced opportunity costs for users (travel and time in clinics) and reduced health service costs. 7 Several feebased services exist offering remote diagnosis and treatment for genital warts and herpes.",

Users provide information on their symptoms via an online form and upload up to four photographs of their lesions to receive a diagnosis from specialist sexual health clinicians including one photograph of the whole area affected to ensure that all relevant lesions are assessed. The online form was developed to collect the clinical information relevant to a diagnosis of genital herpes or warts through a process of user-led service design 8 and includes an explanation of why the answer to each question is important (see online supplemental appendix 1 for an example). Users are asked specifically for information about symptoms that require further clinical assessment for example, changes in colour, bleeding with space to report anything that is concerning them. If appropriate, treatment is prescribed and posted to users through a UK-based registered pharmacy and remote specialist clinical support is offered through text/phone. If a diagnosis cannot be made, or if clinically indicated, users are signposted to face-to-face clinical care. Treatment information is provided in online supplemental appendix 2.",

We were interested in the following questions: 1. Who uses an online photo-diagnosis and selfmanagement service for genital warts and herpes? 2. Are users able to take photographs of sufficient quality for remote diagnosis and what proportion of diagnoses can be made through photographs? 3. How is this service experienced by users with these conditions? 4. What combination of remote support would users value to support self-management and through what medium would they prefer this to be delivered?",

Information from the clinical records was used to understand the process of diagnosis including the reasons for signposting to clinic. We considered a diagnosis to have been made when a specialist sexual health clinician with more than 5 years experience of diagnosing and treating genital herpes and warts in face-to-face settings was confident that the following criteria were met: 1. The photographs uploaded were of sufficient quality to enable the lesion to be clearly seen 2. The lesions were sufficiently typical of either genital herpes or warts to make a diagnosis Where there was any doubt that the lesions were typical of genital herpes or warts then the a referral to face-to-face care was made. This approach to diagnosis is consistent with that used in sexual health clinics, where genital warts and recurrent genital herpes (after previous episodes have been confirmed with laboratory testing) are diagnosed by experienced clinicians through a clinical examination. 9 Users of the SH:24 photodiagnosis service can access free, online testing for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, HIV and syphilis.",

Some specifically sought out online services and 'felt surprised and happy' that they existed. Some users felt attending a face-to-face service was not a viable option and would have been unlikely to seek help without an online option. There were three main motivations for deciding to use an online service to manage this episode: rapid access from home, difficulty accessing alternatives and discretion (table 3) Those with a history of multiple herpes outbreaks described wanting to self-manage and feeling more confident to do so. They wanted to avoid repeated clinic visits that were embarrassing, time-consuming and reminded them of their condition. As one user described they were, 'wanting to treat this in a way that, you know, impacts my life less and less'.

Like many services that are designed to identify and treat uncomplicated presentations of health conditions and refer complex presentations to more specialist care, an online photodiagnosis service may involve some users using the online service who are then referred to clinics. The costeffectiveness of this approach depends on the proportion who are referred to speclialist care and the relative cost of specialist care and online care. Our finding that 54% of users were treated online will inform future costeffectiveness analyses.",

Clinical time can then be focused on diagnosis, prescribing and assessing response to treatment.
