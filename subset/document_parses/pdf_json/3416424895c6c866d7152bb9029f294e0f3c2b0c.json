Number of COVID-19 confirmed cases per thousand population as the dependent variable and nine demographic explanatory variables were considered. Different spatial (i.e., Spatial Lag and Spatial Error Model) and non-spatial (Classic Model) regression techniques were employed in the research to detect the geographical relevance of potential risk factors affecting the transmission of COVID-19. Results indicate that population density was crucial for explaining the pattern of COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. Spatial Auto-correlation suggests that the spatial pattern of population density were significantly clustered at a confidence interval of 95%. Again, the regression analysis also shows that population density is an influential determinant for the propagation of COVID-19 in Bangladesh, with densely populated districts like Dhaka and Narayanganj also being among the worst affected areas. The findings of this research will help the government agencies and communities for effective and well-informed decision making in order to develop and implement strategies to contain the further spread of COVID-19 in Bangladesh.",

In terms of the risk of transmission of COVID-19, Haider et al. [11] have classified Bangladesh into the 4th quantile (highest risk) based on the destinations of the passengers travelling from four major cities of China from January onwards. The first COVID-19 patient was confirmed on 8 March 2020 [12] and total confirmed cases were 74,865 as of 11 June 2020. In early March 2020, immigrants (mostly from China, Italy, USA, UK, etc.) returned to Bangladesh, allegedly carrying the coronavirus and eventually infecting more people. The unwillingness of immigrants with regards to following quarantine and social distancing rules could be one of the major causes of community transmission of COVID-19 [13] . The prevailing demographic (i.e., high population density) and socioeconomic (i.e., extreme poverty) structure of the country meant that lockdown measures imposed by the government was not effective enough in containing the spread of COVID-19 countrywide [14] . The government of Bangladesh has taken several measures including the declaration of public holidays, nation-wide lockdown and massive awareness-raising campaigns, but with an increasing number of people being affected and a rising death toll, the overall COVID-19 scenario has shown little signs of improvement till date. It is not obvious which factors are actually aggravating the transmission of COVID-19 in Bangladesh as the causal factors for its spread have not yet been clearly identified.",

Senior citizens (i.e., people age C 60) are more vulnerable to COVID-19, but the Dhaka has the minimum number of senior citizens per 10,000 population (i.e., 270 approx.) while Pirojpur has the maximum (i.e., 657 approx.).

            "text": "Dhaka being the center of majority of the economic activities in Bangladesh has always attracted a huge population to it and its neighboring districts. The sheer number of people that work together in various industries in and around Dhaka, and failure to maintain proper hygiene there, might have been responsible for COVID-19 transmission among them and consequently among other people of these regions. On the other hand, most of the large and medium industries (for e.g., the apparel industries) of this region are located together in a cluster and as a result, maintaining social distance is difficult in those areas. Industrial workers working in Dhaka and Narayanganj (most affected districts during early COVID-19 transmission) eventually left for their native homes following a nation-wide lockdown. However, miscommunication between Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) and government bodies throughout April regarding reopening the industries, only worsened the situation. A vast number of workers had to return to their workplace twice amidst a nationwide lockdown, using local public transport and even on foot from fear of being laid off and uncertainty over receiving their due wages [38, 39] . These unwanted and avoidable migrations might have influenced the spread of Covid-19 in the Dhaka and its adjacent areas.",

This error variance might well be caused by the spatial dependence in the data. So, it is obvious that the classic model is not appropriate to explain the spatial relationship of the problem under investigation.

Among them, population density and number of people aged C 60 have positively and negatively influenced the number of COVID-19 cases respectively. In the spatial lag model, the lag coefficient for confirmed COVID-19 confirmed cases (Rho/q) was estimated as 0.284915 (p value 0.0060) which is significant at a 5% level of significance, indicating that the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in one district depends on the cases of its neighboring districts. A significant coefficient for the variables implies that the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in a given district depends on the change in explanatory variables in the same district controlling the spatial lag of the dependent variable. This result supports the result obtained using Moran's I statistics where some sort of spatial relationship was observed.",

In the spatial error model, the spatial autoregressive term (k) was estimated as 0.51956 with a p value of 0.0001 (significant at 5% level of significance). This suggests that the spatial dependence present in the residuals of the classic model was due to a geographic clustering of overleaped variables or variables which are not considered in the modeling of the risk factors for the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases using the classic regression model. Furthermore, to identify the best fit model regression results for the above three models are shown in Table 3 . The values of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz Criterion (SC) of Spatial Error Model are all smaller and the values of R 2 and Log L are all bigger than the Spatial Lag Model. Hence, Spatial Error Model is a better fit to the study dataset. Again, spatial dependence test was employed to find out the appropriate spatial process to explain the spatial dependence of the modelled residuals (Table 4) .",

On the other hand, COVID-19 confirmed cases per 100,000 were higher in these two districts as well (i.e., 151 for Dhaka district and 73 for Narayanganj district). COVID-19 spread rapidly in these two districts and community transmissions raised the severity. Gazipur, Narsingdi, and Comilla districts have higher population density (i.e., 1500-3000 people per square kilometer) and consequently higher COVID-19 confirmed cases. The Chittagong district (the port city and influential financial center) has 33 COVID-19 confirmed cases per 100,000 with a population density of 1421 people per square kilometer. The southern coastal districts (i.e., Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Barguna, and Patuakhali) have a lesser number of COVID-19 confirmed cases with less population density (less than 1000 people per square kilometer). Population density is relatively higher (1001-1500 less than 1000 people per square kilometer) in the northern region of Bangladesh and COVID-19 confirmed cases were also found to be higher in those districts. Spreading of COVID-19 was lower in the hill tract districts (i.e., Khagrachhari, Rangamati, and Bandarban) having lower population density.",

Three spatial and non-spatial models (i.e., Classic Model, Spatial Lag Model, and Spatial Error Model) were employed to study the nature of the relationship of these factors with COVID-19 transmission. As found by Spatial Auto-correlation, spatial patterns of factor (population density) were significantly clustered at a confidence interval of 95%. The regression models illustrate that population density has influenced the propagation of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. This study analyzed the demographic data pertaining to the factor for the 64 districts of Bangladesh and showed that a higher value of each of the factors was associated with a higher number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. For instance, results show that Dhaka and Narayanganj, the two most densely populated districts of Bangladesh are also placed 1st and 3rd respectively in terms of COVID-19 confirmed cases. It can be claimed that the central zone of Bangladesh (Dhaka and adjacent districts) is more vulnerable to COVID-19 due to its higher population density.",
