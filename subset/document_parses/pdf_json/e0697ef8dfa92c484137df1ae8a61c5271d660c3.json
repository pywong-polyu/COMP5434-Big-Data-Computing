The urgency to deploy serological assays required rapid evaluation of their performance characteristics. We undertook an internal validation of a CE marked lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (SureScreen Diagnostics) using serum from SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive individuals and pre-pandemic samples. This was followed by the delivery of a same-day named patient SARS-CoV-2 serology service using LFIA on vetted referrals at central London teaching hospital with clinical interpretation of result provided to the direct care team. Assay performance, source and nature of referrals, feasibility and clinical utility of the service, particularly benefit in clinical decisionmaking, were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of LFIA were 96.1% and 99.3% respectively. 113 tests were performed on 108 participants during three-week pilot. 44% participants (n = 48) had detectable antibodies. Three main indications were identified for serological testing; new acute presentations potentially triggered by recent COVID-19 e.g. pulmonary embolism (n = 5), potential missed diagnoses in context of a recent COVID-19 compatible illness (n = 40), and making infection control or immunosuppression management decisions in persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positive individuals (n = 6). We demonstrate acceptable performance characteristics, feasibility and clinical utility of using a LFIA that detects anti-spike antibodies to deliver SARS-CoV-2 serology service in adults and children. Greatest benefit was seen where there is reasonable pre-test probability and PLOS ONE",

There has been uncertainty about what proportion of infected individuals produce serum antibodies, how long they persist for, what role they have in diagnosis and whether their detection provides protection against reinfection or disease manifestations upon re-exposure to the virus. These uncertainties, coupled with the fact that antibody testing for other respiratory viral infection is not standard practice and concerns regarding production and validation of rapidly developed new tests [1, 3] , led to hesitancy introducing them into widespread clinical practice.",

Since neutralising experiments are timeconsuming and complex, rapid tests that detect antibodies against spike, such as the SureScreen LFIA and some, but not other technologies [22] [23] [24] are a practical alternative [25] when considered alongside other factors including timing from symptom onset, ongoing symptoms, and cycle threshold or take-off values of PCR results.
