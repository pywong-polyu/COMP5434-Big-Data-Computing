Splenomegaly was present in 12 patients (60%) and 13 (65%) reported comorbidities. According to the DIPSS, 11 patients (55%) were classified as low or intermediate-1 risk, and 9 (45%) as intermediate-2 or high risk. Molecular analysis was performed in all the patients: 15 out of 20 patients (75%) were positive for the JAK2V617F and 5 (25%) for CALR mutation. Over time, 10 patients (50%) were receiving ruxolitinib, at a median total dose of 20 mg/die (range 20-40 mg), and the remaining 10 patients in other treatments (5 patients hydroxyurea and 5 only supportive therapy).

Participants gave written informed consent. After injection, mild pain at the injection site was frequently reported from the majority of the MF patients. No serious adverse events were registered. The serum level of IgG anti-Spike glycoprotein was tested after a median time of 45 days (range 40-60) from the second vaccine dose, using the approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG CLIA (LIAISON\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay, DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy). According to the manufacturer's recommendations, an arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) ratio of < 12.0 was considered to be negative, 12.0-15.0 AU/mL to be borderline, and > 15 AU/mL to be positive. A conversion of AU/mL to binding antibody units (BAU/mL) as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines is possible considering the following equation: BAU/mL = 2.6*AU/mL. Overall, a positive immune response against COVID-19 was achieved in 6 out of 10 patients (60%) in the ruxolitinib group, in comparison with 7 out 10 patients (70%) in the other treatment group (p = NS). Notably, the absolute IgG anti-Spike value was lower in the ruxolitinib group (median 87.9 \u00b1 136.6) in comparison with the other group (median 182.3 \u00b1 160.5; p = 0.17). Six out of 20 MF patients (30%) reported IgG anti-Spike humoral values considered not protective; in univariate analysis, any clinical or demographic variable was found associated with a lower humoral immune response to the vaccine.",
