According to this model, a piece of 35 information is represented by a neural circuit firing in a gamma (>30 Hz) cycle. When maintaining multiple items, this firing is aligned by theta-gamma \"phase coding\" 8,10-12 . That is, each gamma cycle is assumed to be locked to a specific phase of theta oscillations and the sequence of gamma cycles represents the sequential order. Previous studies have provided experimental evidence supporting this model in monkeys 13 and humans 10, [14] [15] [16] . For example, Wolinski et al. 15 demonstrated that working 40 memory capacity (i.e., the number of items that can be maintained in working memory) was increased by slower theta-band (4 Hz) electrical stimulation around the parietal lobe, but decreased by faster theta-band (7 Hz) stimulation. Because the LIJ model implies that slower theta activity carries more gamma cycles, this experimental finding is consistent with the model. In addition, previous studies of other cognitive functions, such as spatial navigation [17] [18] [19] and episodic memory 20 , have also discussed 45 whether and/or how phase coding is essential for processing sequential information.",

Nineteen healthy young volunteers participated 60 in Experiment 1. Data from two participants were removed due to excessively low performance (see Methods). Thus, data from 17 participants were included in the following analyses. As shown in Fig.   1 , two red dots appeared sequentially on the screen for 200 ms each, and participants memorized the 3 locations and their sequential order. Importantly, the interval after presenting these two stimuli was randomized between 500 and 1500 ms, making it possible to infer the temporal variation of RT. This 65 procedure was developed on the basis of a series of studies on the neural mechanisms of attention [22] [23] [24] . After the random interval, a green dot appeared at either of the memorized locations. If the green dot was in the same location as the first red dot, participants were instructed to press the ] key on a JIS keyboard layout (corresponding to the location of the \" key on a US keyboard layout), whereas, if it was in the same location as the second red dot, participants were instructed to press the [ key on a JIS 70 keyboard (in the same position as the [ key on a US keyboard) with their right index finger. Each set comprised 80 trials, and participants carried out five sets, resulting in 400 trials. Although there was no significant difference in the hit rate (mean \u00b1 SD) between the first and second locations (first, 97.6 \u00b1 2.2%; second, 97.4 \u00b1 2.4%; t17 = 0.93, p = 0.3682) (Fig. 1b) , the RT to the second location was significantly longer than for the first location (first, 564.7 \u00b1 171.9 ms; second, 633.0 \u00b1 244.5 ms; t17 = 75 \u22122.57, p = 0.0206) (Fig. 1c) .",

In a typical individual, the time courses for each location fluctuated in the theta range as a function of the random interval (Fig. 2b) .

Hereafter, we refer to the former time course as \"first waveform\", and the latter time course as \"second waveform\". In the first waveform, trials with RTs longer than 3000 275 ms or shorter than 200 ms were eliminated from datasets for the following analyses because of an excessive lack of concentration or mistakes. As shown in Supplementary Fig.1 , to remove the effects of learning and fluctuations of concentration 25 , we subtracted the lower envelope of the time series from the original RT time course. Subsequently, trials with RT exceeding two standard deviations were removed to exclude outliers. These processes resulted in omitting 6.9 \u00b1 3.5%, 4.6 \u00b1 1.4%, and 4.6 \u00b1 280 1.9% of trials in Experiment 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Then, to extract behavioural time courses, we sorted the RTs in order of the length of the interval (Fig. 2a) , then shifted a 50-ms window in steps of 1 ms from 500 to 1500 ms and re-calculated the averaged RT in each window. Both time courses were smoothed and then z-transformed, yielding time courses at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. When analyzing averaged time courses across participants, the z-transformed time courses were used for 285 averaging. To examine the reliability of the results from Experiment 1, we replicated the results using other analyses, as follows ( Supplementary Fig.2) . In an additional analysis 23 , we did not subtract the lower envelope to remove the effects of learning, but used data from the third to fifth sets only with a time window of 100 ms.",

Task Procedure of Experiment 1 (a) Task Procedure. In every trial, two red dots appeared on the screen sequentially and participants memorized the locations and their sequence. After a random interval between 500 and 1500 ms, a green probe dot appeared on either side of the memorized locations. If the probe was in the location of the first red dot, participants were required to press the ] key on a JIS keyboard (corresponding to 425 the \" key on a US keyboard). If it was in the second location, they pressed the [ key on a JIS keyboard (the same position as on a US keyboard) as quickly as possible. The reaction time (RT) to the probe was recorded. (b) Group data (mean \u00b1 SD) for hit rate (percentage of correct answers). There was no significant difference in hit rate between the first and second locations (first, 97.6 \u00b1 2.2%; second, 97.and individual data for reaction time (RT). RTs to the second location were significantly longer than those to the first location (first, 564.6 \u00b1 171.9 ms; second, 633.0 \u00b1 244.5 ms; t17 = Typical and Group Data for Experiment 1 (a) Example distributions of RTs from a participant. Blue and brown dots represent the RTs to the first and second locations, respectively. Each dot represents RT in one trial. RTs were not uniform, but 440 varied as a function of the randomly presented interval. These distributions were normalized and smoothed to extract RT time courses for each participant (see Methods), then used in the subsequent analyses. (b) Typical data for normalized time courses of RT (Norm. RT). We used data from the same participant shown in (a). The blue waveform denotes the normalized RT time course to the first 445 memorized locations, whereas the brown waveform denotes that of the second memorized locations.We clearly observed the phase shift between the time courses of RTs to the first and second memorized locations.",
