The available data from various studies indicate at best moderate clinical benefits only when CCP with high titer of neutralizing antibodies was infused early in infection. The macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be useful to gain further insights in the value of CCP therapy. In this study, animals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the next day, were infused with pooled human convalescent plasma, selected to have a very high titer of neutralizing antibodies. While administration of CCP did not result in a detectable reduction in virus replication in the respiratory tract, it significantly reduced lung inflammation. These data, combined with the results of monoclonal antibody studies, emphasize the need to use products with high titers of neutralizing antibodies, and guide the future development of CCP-based therapies. : bioRxiv preprint that the known and potential benefits of CCP outweighed any known and potential risks [5] .",

Thus, CCP-based therapies require careful screening of many plasma units to identify the relatively few donors who have a sufficiently high titer of antiviral antibodies. Currently the FDA defines high-titer CCP as having a neutralization titer of \u2265250 (in the Broad Institute's neutralizing antibody assay) or corresponding S/C cutoff thresholds defined by FDA for high-throughput binding antibody assays (e.g., \u2265 23 on the Ortho VITROS \u00d2 spike IgG assay, which was the first assay to be qualified for release of CCP by FDA) [15].",

For example, there is consideration of the potential collection and use of CCP derived from previously infected donors who were later vaccinated, which results in increased titers and breadth or neutralizing antibody reactivity against variants of concern (transfusion of CCP from vaccinated donors, including from vaccineboosted previously infected donors, is not currently allowed according to the FDA EUA).",

This urgency sparked a high interest in collection and infusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), collected from people who had recovered from infection and had made antiviral antibodies, with particular focus on infusing CCP into recently infected patients with the hope of ameliorating their disease course. There were multiple rationales for the use of CCP. Despite variable evidence of efficacy, CCP therapy is a classic immunotherapy that has been applied to the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases for more than a century, including more recently SARS, MERS, and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (reviewed in [2] [3] [4] ). In addition, during a pandemic where many infected people survive and are willing to donate plasma, CCP can be collected by blood collection organizations (BCOs) and made readily available at relatively low cost. Finally, the reactivity of CCP evolves with the pandemic, as antibodies derived from recent convalescent survivors are expected to recognize recently circulating variants.",

Although we used a CCP with high neutralizing activity in vitro, the antibodies became diluted so much upon transfusion that by the time they reached mucosal sites, their concentration was probably too low to have a drastic impact on reducing virus replication in vivo. In this context, it is important to note that we inoculated animals with a very high dose of SARS-CoV-2, to induce rapid wide-spread infection of upper and respiratory tract, with peak virus replication occurring within the first 1-2 days. Having high levels of viral replication at the time of CCP administration sets a high bar to detect efficacy, especially as it takes time for passively infused antibodies to distribute and reach peak concentrations at mucosal sites. The difficulty to detect a difference was likely exacerbated by the considerable variability in virus levels in mucosal samples of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals, including untreated control animals, as observed in many other studies [25, [29] [30] [31] . This high variability is likely a combination of individual variability in virus replication, but also the variability inherently associated with mucosal secretion samples, which represent a snapshot in time of viral shedding at a limited mucosal surface. Thus, while small animal group sizes can still allow detection of large differences in virus replication caused by very potent antiviral strategies including passive immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, they lack the power to detect relatively mild-to-moderate antiviral effects.",

The reason that the relatively modest difference (~17%) in interstitial cellularity scores between the study groups was statistically significant, despite the relatively small group sizes, can be attributed to the very comprehensive and extensive scoring system, in which the evaluation of numerous microscopic fields per animal provides a relatively precise assessment of the overall extent of interstitial pneumonia at 7 days of infection. Despite its advantages of being highly rigorous and robust, this scoring system has the drawback of being labor-intensive, which precludes application on large-scale studies. Thus, future efforts can focus on further refining it, by simplification (i.e., pathologist-driven scoring of fewer fields or fewer lobes but achieving statistically similar reliable results) and/or automation (i.e., computer-generated scores).",

Dose-range vaccine studies in macaques found that higher antibody levels were needed to reduce virus replication in the upper airways than in the lower respiratory tract [33] ; this can explain recent observations that some vaccinated people with breakthrough infections with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant can have similar viral loads in upper respiratory tract as unvaccinated people, but yet, remain at much reduced risk for severe illness and hospitalization [34, 35] . Finally, it has been demonstrated in the lungs of SARS-COV-2 infected macaques that the virus does not necessarily co-localize with the lesions and can be found in areas of the pulmonary parenchyma that are not inflamed [36] .

Comparison of these 2 studies, with the lung histology scoring performed by the same pathologists, revealed that animals treated with monoclonal antibodies had significantly lower lung pathology scores than the CCP-treated animals in the current study (Fig.   S10) , indicating the superiority of monoclonal antibodies above CCP to treat early SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Although direct comparison of neutralization data across studies is difficult due to differences in assays and other laboratory conditions, the threshold value observed in this current study is consistent with recent findings from other animal and human studies. A study that used purified IgG derived from convalescent macaques found that a NT50 titer between 50 and 500 in the recipient animals was the threshold to see an effect on reducing virus replication, although no lung histology scoring was reported [37] . In a study with African green monkeys, the administration of a high-titer CCP, derived from convalescent African green monkeys, administered 10 hours after a moderate-dose virus inoculation, resulted in live-virus plaque reduction neutralization titers 50% (PRNT50) of ~ 128 in the recipient animals, that were associated with reduced virus replication and histology, although differences were statistically not significant, likely due to variability and small group sizes [28] . In human studies, it has been difficult to set a threshold for neutralizing activity after CCP infusion, as generally infusions were performed later in the course of infection (i.e. when a de novo antibody responses were already being generated), or studies did not report neutralization titers in the CCP recipients [8, 10].",

However, recent studies have demonstrated that COVID-19 survivors who subsequently received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine made very strong booster immune responses, which also neutralize currently circulating variants of concern [38-44].

Each field was graded on a scale of 0-4, as described previously [27] , based on the number of cells expanding the alveolar interstitium: grade 1, 1-2 cells thick; grade 2, 3-4 cells thick; grade 3, 5-6 cells thick; grade 4, >6 cells thick. The score is allocated according to the most severe region within the field. Altogether, this method resulted in evaluating between 710 to 1634 microscopic fields (at x40 magnification) per animal.
