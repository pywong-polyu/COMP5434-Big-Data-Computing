Millions of primary care workers worldwide have faced significant challenges in attempts to 30 contain and treat the virus. National pandemic plans, quarantining and testing protocols, the closing of 31 borders and lockdown procedures, and strategies to flatten the curve or boost herd immunity have all been 32 implemented in various ways. The pandemic has shown the gaps in primary health care (PHC) 33 worldwide, and the climb it will take to fulfill the public health goals of the Declaration of Astana 34 (Declaration of Astana: Global Conference on Primary Health Care, 2018) and the Sustainable 35 Development Goals 2030 (United Nations Foundation (2021) Sustainable Development Goals). 36",

And, \"We formed Covid-19 clinics (offices) and call 131 centres with family medicine staff (20% of all family physicians and nurses),\" (Bosnia and Herzegovina, 132 male PCC).133 With shifting responsibilities came changes to the scope of practice for most primary care 134 clinicians. Many respondents stated that they were doing much less direct patient care, including a 135 decrease in mental health care (Australia), or saw a complete shift to one area of practice, such as one 136 respondent from Mexico, \"Now we (family physicians) are working in a respiratory triage, where we see 137 only patients with respiratory symptoms and other family physicians see patients without respiratory 138 symptoms,\" (Mexico, female PCC). 139 While in some places primary care clinicians' workloads decreased or disappeared, others 140 experienced an increase in daily activities. Some clinicians assumed job responsibilities of different types 141 of primary care clinicians, such as nursing procedures from home health care staff who could no longer 142 work in-house due to governmental restrictions (Italy), and others switched departments to handle 143 COVID-19 specific patients, \"Being asked to do duties of an emergency physician/internal medicine etc.. 144 primary care doctors are assumed to be footballs to kick into any department that needs staff,\" (Trinidad 145 and Tobago, female PCC). 146 These changes, shifts, and limitations to practice created an environment of uncertainty and stress 147 for primary care clinicians, as evidenced by responses focused on increased anxiety and fear among staff 148 (Australia, Slovakia) and pressures of increased workloads (Democratic Republic of Congo). One 149 respondent from Nigeria stated, \"Heightened fear among doctors across all levels as they are 150 rescheduled regularly across units, especially the GPs,\" (Nigeria, male PCC). 151 Another in Malaysia felt abandoned by the national government, \"Private sector primary care 152 physicians neglected and made to fend for their own.

Shifts to New Technology 197One positive adaptation that survey respondents mentioned was the increase in the incorporation 198 of technologies to handle patient visits. This included digital health and the increased use of e-mail and 199 patient portals, and the use of apps with patients passing photos back and forth to clinicians. Many 200 respondents reported a huge drop off for in-person visits, with their practices switching to 80-98% virtual 201 visits either by phone, video conference, or email (United States, Cyprus, Estonia; seeTable 3). A 202 respondent from Spain commented, \"Mostly the consultation is made by telephone interviews\u2026.We are 203 provided apps to be able to see photos of patients and to work at home (some days of week and not all 204 teams do it),\" (Spain, female PCC). 205 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The implementation of digital health technologies also helped keep primary care clinicians and 206 patients safe from potential exposure and was a convenient way to reach patients during lockdown and 207 quarantine protocols. \"Tele consultations (allowed practitioners) to avoid overcrowding of health centres 208 and unnecessary exposure of vulnerable populations,\" (Saudi Arabia, female PCC). 209 However, the fast uptake in technology meant that some populations were either left out of being 210 able to access care or had difficulties in doing so. This was shown in quotes discussing infrastructure 211 issues to support internet capabilities and video technologies (United Kingdom), higher demands for 212 online services, such as filling prescriptions (Australia), and the technology divide between urban and 213 rural areas, \"Shift to caring for patients virtuallyin many places, especially rural areas, the 214 infrastructure doesn't exist for these types of services so providers and patients both have had to find 215 ways to adapt,\" (United States, female PCC). 216 These accessibility challenges were also coupled with payment re-structuring (Romania) and 217 reimbursement challenges, \"Non face to face consultations have previously been unfunded -but we have 218 had rapid rollout of government subsidised non-face-to-face consultations via telephone or video,\" 219 (Australia, male PCC). 220 221 4.1. Discussion 222 This paper highlights the experiences of individual primary care experts during the first wave of 223 the COVID-19 pandemic to understand how on-the-ground circumstances were influenced by policies 224 and protocols put in place by a variety of countries. Even though the survey's open-text responses were 225 compiled from 69 different countries, representing all socio-economic tiers and political systems, there 226 were numerous overlapping themes in how primary care clinicians and those workers supporting primary 227 care services delivery were impacted. The pandemic has shown what other historical accounts of previous 228 pandemics/epidemics have shown, that they exacerbate the lack of resources, health care access, 229 economic and domestic stability, and death rates among minority and other marginalized groups with 230 sweeping impacts to their communities (Galasso, 2020; Mein, 2020). This pandemic is no exception. Furthermore, our results show that the intentions of the Astana Declaration have not only not been met 232 yet, but that the pandemic has forced governmental responses into the opposite direction in some 233 instances (citation blinded for re-review). 234 There are several similarities in primary care's responses as to how they have been impacted in 235 the current pandemic globally, and these lessons learned should be remembered and incorporated going 236 forward to address future pandemics/epidemics so that mistakes of the past do not recur (Peeri et al., 237 2020). Lessons learned from treating COVID-19 and charting historical trends with previous 238 pandemics/epidemics are currently being compiled (Liu et al., 2020; Krist et al., 2020; Mujica et al., 239 2020). This paper provides additional considerations from the perspectives derived from the on-the-240 ground experiences of primary care experts. 241 <insert Table 4: Lessons Learned> 242 Shared and recurring themes across countries included the impacts of workforce issues, patient 243 care demands, and the incorporation of advanced technologies; all playing a role in how primary care 244 clinicians altered their provision of care during the first few months of the pandemic. Primary care was 245 often at the mercy of governmental protocols and mandates which affected the workforce with 246 employment shifts and challenges in providing patient care. Primary care workforce changes included 247",

            "text": "262 Respondents expressed clear feelings of stress, anxiety, and fear over the possibility of contracting the 263 virus given the absence of adequate personal protective equipment in primary care settings. These fears 264 were compounded by perceptions of job insecurity, as well as serial uncertainty in their everyday 265 schedules, scope of practice, and patient care responsibilities. Mental and emotional health needs of 266 health care workers can lead to burnout, moral distress, and post-traumatic stress syndrome, as reported 267 during other epidemics (Restauri & Sheridan, 2020) and preliminary findings of COVID-19 are showing 268 similar patterns (Amanullah & Ramesh Shankar, 2020; Dutour et al., 2021; Khoo & Lantos, 2020; 269 Sasangohar et al., 2020). As the pandemic drags on, primary care clinicians will need more mental and 270 emotional support to prevent burnout. 271 Numerous respondents commented on shifts in roles and responsibilities and shared concerns 272 about disruptions in their abilities to care for their usual patients. Many countries and health care 273 disciplines established essential versus non-essential patient care guidelines early on (Ferorelli et al., 274 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Moletta et al., 2020), and this delineation ruptured the holistic continuity of care 275 model that primary care prides itself on delivering.

This shows the need for a well-funded, comprehensive PHC strategy and infrastructure to curtail 46 and combat future pandemics/epidemics(Prado et al., 2020).While there are numerous qualitative studies focused on individual responses to COVID-19 in 48 specific countries or regions (Al Ghafri et al., 2020; Gomez et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020; Verhoeven et 49 al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020), there is less information on exploring primary care experts' experiences during 50 the pandemic on a multiple country scale spanning the globe (Rawaf et al., 2020). In this paper we aim to 51 present the challenges of patient care and the impact on primary care associated with the uncertainty of 52 rapidly adapting to changing governmental and public health policies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 53 that were experienced by primary care experts multinationally. This paper is an analysis of one question's open-ended text responses that was part of a larger 57 survey compiling primary care experts' perceptions of how their countries adapted to the COVID-19 58 pandemic. The study question, \"Since the first identified case of COVID-19 in your country, have the 59 roles of a typical primary care team in your country changed?\" and the accompanying text box asked 60 respondents to elaborate on their answer if they wanted. We chose this question because we wanted to 61 examine respondents' perspectives and experiences for similarities in primary care responses across 62 countries. The larger survey employed a convenience sampling of primary care experts, including 63 clinicians, academics, and policy-makers, and encouraged them to use snowballing to recruit more 64 participants. The online, anonymous survey consisted of 34 questions to gauge national pandemic 65 preparedness and adaptive response from a primary care perspective. The survey was available in English 66 and Spanish and open from April 15 -May 4, 2020. Ethical approval was granted for three years on 9 67 April 2020 by the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee (UAHPEC); Ref 68 There were 1131 survey responses recorded of which 1035 (91.5%) were usable, with 96 (8.5%) 70 excluded due to incompleteness. These respondents represented 111 countries from all socio-economic 71 levels and political systems. Complete demographic and methodological details from the survey have 72 been published elsewhere, but included an examination of cumulative death rates by respondent country 73 compared to primary care strength, an analysis of political, economic, and medical decision making that 74",
