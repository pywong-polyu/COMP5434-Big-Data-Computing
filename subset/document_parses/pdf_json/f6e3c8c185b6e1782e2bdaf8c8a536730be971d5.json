For ASPEN-COVID-19, a loading dose was included to rapidly attain rNAPc2 plasma levels approximating those achieved at steady state, as COVID-19 patients ill enough to be hospitalized are at immediate risk for the conditions that lead to micro-or macrovascular thromboses. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies following single doses of rNAPc2 demonstrated a dose dependent increase in international normalized ratio (INR) ranging from 1.5 at 3.0 \u00b5g/kg to 1.75 at 5.0 \u00b5g/kg and 2.1 at 7.5 \u00b5g/kg. Based on these data, an initial dose of 5 \u00b5g/kg followed by 3.0 \u00b5g/kg on Days 3 and 5 was estimated to be equivalent to prophylactic dose heparin. A dose of 7.5 \u00b5g/kg followed by 5 \u00b5g/kg on days 3 and 5 was estimated to correlate with a higher intensity of anticoagulation approximating therapeutic heparin. Given the ~50-hour half-life of rNAPc, clinical effects of rNAPc2 are expected to begin to decline by day 8.

Tissue factor activates the coagulation cascade, potentiates viral infectivity, and mediates inflammation associated with viral illness through protease-activated receptor signaling and activation of toll-like receptors (28, 29) .",

Recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2) inhibits tissue factor and the extrinsic pathway. Given the prominent role of tissue factor in the viral propagation and viral-induced hypercoagulability, tissue factor may offer a more precise target in COVID-19 to both prevent thrombotic events and reduce viral progression, potentially speeding recovery.",
