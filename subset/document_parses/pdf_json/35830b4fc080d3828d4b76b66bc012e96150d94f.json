            "text": "The COVID-19 fatality rate is $57% worldwide. The investigation of possible antiviral therapy using host microRNA (miRNA) to inhibit viral replication and transmission is the need of the hour. Computational techniques were used to predict the hairpin precursor miRNA (pre-miRNAs) of COVID-19 genome with high homology towards human (host) miRNA. Top 21 host miRNAs with >80% homology towards 18 viral pre miRNAs were identified. The Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) between host miRNAs and viral pre-miRNAs hybridization resulted in the best 5 host miRNAs having the highest base-pair complementarity. miR-4476 had the strongest binding with viral pre-miRNA (\u0394G = \u00c021.8 kcal/mol) due to maximum base pairing in the seed sequence. Pre-miR-651 secondary structure was most stable due to the (1) least minimum free energy (\u0394G = \u00c024.4 kcal/mol), energy frequency, and noncanonical base pairing and (2) maximum number of stem base pairing and small loop size. Host miRNAs-viral mRNAs interaction can effectively inhibit viral transmission and replication. Furthermore, miRNAs gene network and gene-ontology studies indicate top 5 host miRNAs interaction with host genes involved in transmembrane-receptor signaling, cell migration, RNA splicing, nervous system formation, and tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling in respiratory diseases. This study identifies host miRNA/ virus pre-miRNAs strong interaction, structural stability, and their gene-network analysis provides strong evidence of host miRNAs as antiviral COVID-19 agents.",

            "text": "coronavirus, there is still a significant gap in our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pathology. 8 One of the recent emerging areas for effective treatment strategies for COVID-19 is the field of microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are genomically encoded small noncoding RNA molecules that are 20-25 nucleotides base pairs in length and regulate the expression of post-transcriptional genes. 9 It is well known that miRNAs are encoded by the intronic region of the DNA from animals, plants, and certain viruses to regulate their various molecular and biological processes. 10, 11 Approximately, 30 424 mature miRNAs were found in 206 animals, whereas the human genome encodes approximately 3000 miRNAs. 12 The viral miRNAs not only regulate the host gene expression but also regulate their own gene expression. 13 RNA polymerase-II transcribes miRNA genes and forms primary miRNA in the nucleus. Through enzymatic action of the RNase III ribonuclease disease, primary miRNAs are divided into 70-90 long nucleotide base-pair precursor hairpin called precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). 13, 14 The pre-miRNAs are bound with exportin-5 enzymes and Ran in the nucleus and are exported to the cytoplasm where biogenesis of miRNAs occur. 14 RNase III ribonuclease Dicer further cleaves the pre-miRNAs to the hairpin loop structure known as duplex mature miRNA. 14 The duplex RNA guided strand (active strand) is loaded into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) aimed at degrading or repressing translational activity by messenger RNA. 13 Perfect complementary between the viral mRNA's 3 0 -untranslated region (UTR) and the mature host miRNA seed sequence (2-7 base pair) is sufficient to lead to cleavage, but imperfect complementary can hinder viral mRNA translation. 13, 15 It is known that miRNAs have a potential role in the immunological process and are involved in the regulation of the immune system through the activation of the immune cells. 16 Studies investigated the miRNAs role as an antiviral agent against many diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus-1, 17 herpes simplex virus, 18 dengue, 19 influenza virus, 15 and hepatitis C virus. 20 To prevent and treat the highly pathogenic coronavirus with the help of the antiviral agent is important. As a result, it is highly recommended that new biological strategies for the treatment of viral diseases be created. 21 In the epithelial cells, the expression change of the host miRNAs has a role in the pathogenesis of chronic and severe acute respiratory tract infections. 22 Our recent studies have shown how the viral RNA stabilizes monomeric and dimeric subunits of the protein complex by suitable interactions that have been mimicked by screening compounds from various drug-approved databases, which show high inhibitory potential against viral mRNA. 1 This study computed any possible human miRNA targets for the SARS-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) genome. It also emphasizes the host miRNAs and COVID-19 viral genome interaction that will help better understand the role of host pathogens and establish new antiviral therapy against COVID-19.",

Humans are infected with the current pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19), which has resulted in severe respiratory infections, 29,30 with symptoms such as diarrhea, cough, and breathing difficulties. 31 However, a lack of thorough understanding of the fundamental molecular pathways limits developing the novel therapeutics. MiRNAs are genomically encoded, small non-coding RNA, which are approximately $22 nucleotides long that normally target the mRNAs and regulate their expression at the post-transcriptional level.Targeting the viral mRNA by the host miRNA is an essential mechanism for regulating further the viral expression in the host. Hence, recognizing target viral mRNA with high complementation with the host miRNA seed sequence is an essential mechanism for inhibiting the viral progression.32 miRNA is an important type of regulatory RNA, which mainly inhibits gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. 33 According to our study, the COVID-19 genome sequence with NCBI ID: NC_045512.2 was 100% conserved compared with other variants (MT435086, MT339041, MT066156, and MT507794.1). 34 Several computational methods were used to predict the top 5 human miRNAs: miR-4476 (\u00c021.8 kcal/mol), miR-548-1d (\u00c018.5 kcal/mol), miR-3202 (\u00c018.1 kcal/mol), miR-1296 (\u00c016.8 kcal/mol), and miR-651 (\u00c014.9 kcal/mol), which get strongly hybridized with the viral pre-miRNA with stable MFE. The miR-4476 strongly binds with the target viral pre-miRNA pre-miR-4476 sequence at the 3 0 end region with the least free energy (\u0394G) of \u00c021.8 kcal/mol. The hybridized structure showed high complementarity with the seed sequence of host miRNA having eight base pair long region. Due to this strong complementary region, the host miRNA-4476 can be considered as strong anti-viral agent among the top 5 identified host mi-RNA and can strongly inhibit the target sequence (Figure 2A). In comparison with other host miRNAs, the miR-548-1 having target with pre-miR-548-1d, which has the binding minimum energy of \u00c018.5 kcal/mol (Figure 2B), can also be considered a good target. The stability of miR-548-1 is slightly lower than the miRNA-4475 due to the shorter seed sequence length of only six base pair long as compared with miR-4476 having eight base pairs. Similar results were observed for the other targets but with less stable free energies and less seed sequence base pairing, complementary base pairing, and supplementary base-pairing resulting in the overall lower stability of the other structures. Therefore, it could be assumed that the length of seed sequence, complementarity, and supplementary base pairing is essential and critical for stabilizing the hybridized viral pre-miRNA structure (Figure 3). However, a recent study by Sharma et al. (2020) predicted 22 potential miRNA from 5 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 linked with 12 host miRNAs.34 It is known that having G-U pairs in the seed sequence at viral 3 0 pre-miRNAs decreases the stability of the target structure.35 Our hybridization results showed a minimum number of G-U pairs in the seed sequences of 3 0 of all five viral pre-miRNAs that strongly contribute to the top 5 host miRNAs binding with viral pre-miRNAs with overall superior stabilities. Usually, the secondary structure of most miRNA's plays key transcriptional roles in modulating the miRNA-mRNA associations that translates to the various miRNAs having different degrees of gene susceptibility. RNA's secondary structure guides mRNA folding, structural stability protection, and RNA-binding proteins recognition sites and functions as a substrate for enzymatically active",

            "text": "The MFE structure's frequency in the ensemble of secondary structures, as well as the ensemble's variety, indicates whether the bases are fundamentally unpaired, weakly paired, or firmly paired. Our results show that the frequency of pre-miR-651 is 4.56%, the value of MFE is \u00c024.40 kcal/ mol with maximum number of strong bases pairing, minimum number of non-canonical paired bases and has longer length of pre-miRNA sequence as compared with other frequencies of the predicted secondary structures, which results in having a very high stable structure (Figure 6). The interaction analysis from the host miRNAs-viral miRNA might help identify the key regions of the formed duplex secondary structure between the miRNA and mRNA. This secondary structure with their base-pair interactions will help understand the type of drug candidates for developing either the new chemical entities or screening the approved drugs as repurposing druggable candidates. As we observed a strong interaction of the viral pre-miRNAs with the top 5 host miRNAs, we further tried to keep their role in other gene regulations. The network analysis showed that all the selected top 5 host miRNAs are involved in various pathological diseases also show strong interaction with 4 other genes (SDC4, NAV2, SMU1, and SPATA2) (",

Recent research has discovered that host miRNA plays a role in a variety of regulatory pathways, including growth, virus protection, hematopoiesis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, as well as ACE2 expression during COVID-19 infection. Viral miRNAs have been shown to cause mRNA degradation in host cells, regulating various molecular pathways.42,43 As a result, it is crucial to annotate the novel coronavirus's miRNA in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the virus and create new anti-miR/antiviral therapy tools. Based on our theoretical findings, we believe that the host miRNA-4476 plays a significant role in the host-pathogen interaction and that recognizing this relationship would aid in the development of future antiviral therapeutics.5 | CONCLUSIONWe predicted 21 possible candidate human miRNAs using computational approaches and a collection of bioinformatics techniques that demonstrated >80% homology with 18 viral pre-miRNA sequences.These 21 miRNAs were further utilized to hybridize with the viral pre-miRNAs and predict the best probable antiviral agents based on their structural binding energies. A total of five human miRNAs showed perfect complementarity with the 3 0 region of the precursor sequence of COVID-19. The human miR-4476 had strongest interaction due to the long seed sequence size and maximum complementarity with viral-pre-miR showing a stable structure with the MFE of about \u00c021.80 kcal/mol. These hybridization results suggest that the miRNAs from viral precursor's sequences would be the best target candidates by the human miRNAs. Thus, the five host miRNAs identified in this study may be exploited for use as antiviral agents. Similarly, secondary",
