            "text": "Background: Infectious disease outbreaks present unique challenges to study designs for vaccine evaluation. Test-negative design (TND) studies have previously been used to estimate vaccine effectiveness and have been proposed for Ebola virus disease (EVD) vaccines. However, there are key differences in how cases and controls are recruited during outbreaks and pandemics of novel pathogens, whcih have implications for the reliability of effectiveness estimates using this design. Methods: We use a modelling approach to quantify TND bias for a prophylactic vaccine under varying study and epidemiological scenarios. Our model accounts for heterogeneity in vaccine distribution and for two potential routes to testing and recruitment into the study: self-reporting and contact-tracing. We derive conventional and hybrid TND estimators for this model and suggest ways to translate public health response data into the parameters of the model. Results: Using a conventional TND study, our model finds biases in vaccine effectiveness estimates. Bias arises due to differential recruitment from self-reporting and contacttracing, and due to clustering of vaccination. We estimate the degree of bias when recruitment route is not available, and propose a study design to eliminate the bias if recruitment route is recorded. Conclusions: Hybrid TND studies can resolve the design bias with conventional TND studies applied to outbreak and pandemic response testing data, if those efforts collect individuals' routes to testing. Without route to testing, other epidemiological data will be required to estimate the magnitude of potential bias in a conventional TND study. Since these studies may need to be conducted retrospectively, public health responses should obtain these data, and generic protocols for outbreak and pandemic response studies should emphasize the need to record routes to testing.",

            "text": "Study designs to evaluate new vaccines during outbreaks and pandemics are challenging for logistical, epidemiological, social and ethical reasons. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Novel and poorly understood pathogens can rapidly overwhelm local health systems, subsequently enabling other crises, or can require intensive control policies, complicating both response efforts and research. [8] [9] [10] [11] However, some key pathogens are only routinely observable under these conditions, like Ebola virus disease (EVD) and others on the World Health Organization (WHO) R&D Blueprint priority list. 12 During outbreaks of highly pathogenic infections there may be pressure to introduce experimental vaccines as quickly as possible, 13, 14 as well as resistance to classical randomized controlled trials. 15 For EVD, the existence of a licensed vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) [16] [17] [18] [19] further complicates trials for new vaccines. Such circumstances suggest alternative evaluation strategies, and a test-negative design (TND) study has been proposed to evaluate a two-dose vaccine in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). [20] [21] [22] This design estimates vaccine effectiveness from the odds ratio for test outcome conditional on vaccination status, and has lower misclassification bias than traditional case-control studies. 23 , 24 TND studies have been used to estimate the effectiveness of vaccines against influenza, 25 rotavirus, [26] [27] [28] pneumococcus 29 and other pathogens. 30, 31 The approach can also assess interventions such as vector control and riskfactor management. [32] [33] [34] TND studies recruit people with symptoms, test those recruits using a highly sensitive and specific method to separate cases (test-positives) from controls (test-negatives), and finally sort them by vaccination status. 35 TND studies can be retrospective, potentially using stratification by other factors to limit confounding effects. For influenza, TND studies usually recruit people seeking care for influenza-like illness, ascertain vaccine status by self-report, and determine infection status by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), though specifics vary. 25, 30 To obtain unbiased estimates, the following criteria must be met: (i) transmission occurs in a population with partial vaccine coverage; (ii) vaccination status does not affect symptom rates unrelated to the target pathogen; (iii) given symptoms in an individual, care-seeking behaviour does not vary by underlying cause; (iv) an individual's past recruitment as a control (even multiple times) must not prevent subsequent recruitment as a case; and (v) there is no misclassification of individuals' infection or vaccine status. 33, 36 Here we examine how outbreaks present novel misclassification problems for TND studies and how this can bias TND vaccine effectiveness estimates, and we quantify how that bias varies with differences in vaccine distribution, recruitment, risk of infection and testing practice. We introduce a hybrid design that can address these biases, and we identify alternative steps to mitigate potential bias.",

            "text": "Our analysis describes vaccination during EVD outbreaks, but our work has general implications for evaluating interventions in other infectious disease settings with a public health response that includes testing, for example efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We have focused on self-reporting and contact-tracing, but the challenges are generic when there are distinct, but potentially undistinguished, primary and secondary recruiting processes. For example, more active general-population surveillance could still qualify as the primary recruitment in our model, as long as it were random with respect to intervention status. Likewise, geographical follow-up could be a secondary process, as long as intervention status were correlated with the secondary process (e.g. for dengue, adjacent households followed up, as long as vector control reached some areas and not others).",

If the study analysis is able to restrict recruits to only selfreporting individuals, then there is no bias (left panel). However, as For Review Only contact-traced test-negative individuals are increasingly included (moving right across panels), bias range increases to between 1% overestimate and 5% underestimate. However, this range is notably smaller than if only recruiting from the targeted population ( Figure 5 ). As with restricting recruitment to targeted individuals only, higher levels of coverage lead to wider bias range. These ranges reflect the same parameters used in Figure 6 , including targeted fraction p_in 2(0.4,1). In this figure, the overestimate bounds (upper ribbon lines) closely align possible sources of bias, such as different exposure risk between groups, testing errors or errors in ascertaining vaccine status. Further investigation of the reliability of these studies for estimating effectiveness during outbreaks remains critical. However, as we have shown, use of this design in an outbreak setting will need to account for the realities of control activities and plan to collect data on testing route or otherwise accommodate the mix of recruitment routes.",
