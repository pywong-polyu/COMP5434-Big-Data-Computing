It might, for example, help to discriminate between different narratives that claim to do so. In this spirit, two influential accounts of the near-collapse of shadow banking in the US financial crisis of 2008 are analysed: one developed by Mark Gertler and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and the other presented by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission of the US Congress. Using a common two-sector framework, key features of these contrasting accounts of the market for banking services are presented, along with their corresponding diagnoses of what precipitated financial crisis. To see what the experience of Covid might imply about their relative credibility, four aspects of the current pandemic are considered: how it began from a small biological shock; how it gets spread by contagion; the significance of externalities; and how it may end with a vaccine. But the reader is left to form his or her own judgement.",

In both cases, he promises, 'I will follow economic tradition and demonstrate the ideas via modelstales or fables 1 \u2026 But I will not use formal language, which would make the models easier to understand for the few who are familiar with this language, but would pose an impenetrable barrier for all the rest. ' It is in this spirit that two influential accounts of near-collapse of shadow banks in US financial crisis of 2008 are examined here. This is not intended, however, as an intellectual exercise of comparing market and non-market mechanisms for allocating resources. Rather it is to see what we might learn from the health crisis -by comparing two influential but sharply contrasting accounts of the market for banking services and of what went wrong in the financial crisis; then seeing what the current experience of the Covid pandemic might imply about their relative credibility.",

So it might be thought that the existence of well-established credit rating agenciesand the active role that they play in US securities markets 8 -could have ensured that issues of information asymmetries were largely finessed -with conservative banks borrowing at low rates of interest compared with risky banks paying much higher rates, for example.

With more expected profits to be made on the upside, but extra losses transferred to creditors on the downside, hidden risk raises the expected ROE for the banksassuming creditors also believe the rosy ratings. 11 It is the contention of Goodhart and Lastra (2020), indeed, that \"the limited liability of equity holders is by far the biggest source of moral hazard and risk shifting in a capitalist economy\"; and the diagram from their paper, see Fig. 3 , conveys this critique most cogently. 12 Even though there is a safe investment that gives a certain return of C to equity holders, they can expect to do better if the bank invests in risky securities -as, for example, one with the same mean but two equi-probable payoffs, A which is highly profitable and D where losses will drive the bank into insolvency.

The increase of perceived risk when the truth is revealed will make these assets less attractive to both sectors. For passive investors the rise in downside risk (from z to z \u00c0 > z) makes their demand schedule steeper, as indicated by the anti-clockwise movement in the figure. The demand curve for shadow banks, subject to a binding VaR constraint, shifts to the left (from K at e/z to K\u2032 at e= z \u00c0 at the top of the figure) as the unit risk increases to its true value; and becomes steeper as the lower asymptote moves down to q\u2212z \u00c0 , the correct lower bound. Hence equilibrium will, on impact, move from A to B as shown, with a fall in the price but not much trading of assets. 13 This reduction of demand is not the end of the story, however. With assets 'markedto-market' at lower prices, the fall in shadow bank equity permits less asset-holding as the VaR constraint binds tighter.

Improved efficiency stems from the comparative advantage that wholesale banks having in managing certain types of loans. Improved stability arises because retail banks act as a buffer to absorb loans that wholesale banks sell off, in effect improving the liquidity of secondary loan markets. On the other hand, the growth of wholesale banking system makes the economy more vulnerable to a crisis. As occurred in practice, the high leverage of wholesale banks makes this sector susceptible to runs that can have highly disruptive effects on the economy. A contractionary disturbance that might otherwise lead to a moderate recession, can induce a run on the wholesale banking sector with devastating effects on the economy, as experienced during the Great Recession.

Although the models with wholesale and retail banks treated separately are more revealing, it is clearly impossible to do them justice in a short piece.

The anticipated return on the liabilities of end-use borrowers is perceived as non-stochastic; so, except for unanticipated shocks, lending involves no risk! The competitive edge of bank intermediation lies not in its capacity to take on risk but in the assistance it can provide to enable borrowers achieve potential gains in productivity. Banks can do this with unflagging efficiency, but for non-banks (households) there are 'management costs' reflecting their lack of expertise in screening and monitoring investment projects; and these costs increase more than in proportion with the amount of assets being handled in the non-bank sector. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 below, based on the reported calibrations, with expected productivity growth of assets ('capital') of all borrowers measured in percent per annum on the vertical axis. The productivity payoff for those holding bankintermediated assets is measured from the left hand axis (as in Figs. 2 and 4) , and for household-managed assets measured from the right. With bank intermediation, all borrowers could expect to achieve the national rate of productivity increasewhose steady state value is calibrated at 5% p.a. in the simulations. While a few households can match this on their own, efficiency diminishes as non-bank handling of assets expands, as indicated by the schedule HH, with calibrations suggesting the least efficient household will achieve less than half potential productivity growth that banks can deliver. (2015): a productivity shock followed by a bank run In this model of riskless intertemporal optimisation -unlike the basic model of section 2 where perceived asset risk gives rise to liquidity preference -shadow banks pay generous interest rates on their liabilities 17 ; and households discount asset yields by the rate of time preference. So, as shown in Fig. 5 , the steady-state asset demands for both sectors are shifted below expected payoffs by the rate of interest paid on 'deposits', which matches the rate of time preference. As bank demand is also subject to a net worth constraint, 18 the pre-crisis equilibrium involves direct financing, as shown at A in the figure, where the asset price is unity and banks take about two thirds of the market.",

Yet, in the FCIC telling, the banking crisis is like what happens in Shakespeare's Tempest, where it emerges that the fierce storm that opens the play was called up by Prospero, one of the players! For, in the Congressional narrative, it is the behaviour of the players themselves that generates much of the action. There are CRAs ready to mis-rate risky assets for a fee; shadow bankers seeing this as a way of shifting risk onto creditors despite the VaR rules in place; and creditors lending freely -until they find out what's happening and respond with swingeing haircuts to bank collateral! Minsky famously argued that capitalist economies are unstable because of their financial markets and institutions. This narrative supports no such universal proposition: but it does sound a clear note of warning -that capitalist economies can be destabilised when financial markets and institutions put profits before purpose. 30 Here, as in Rubinstein's fable, the choice of narrative is left to the reader. But we can conclude on a positive note. For it appears that regulatory reaction to the near-collapse of shadow banking -by making the system more resilient to risk whatever its sourcehas put banks in better shape to handle the subsequent Covid pandemic! The Social Dynamics of BER, i.e. Burnside et al. (2016) BER use a version of SIR, but it is considerably modified as follows:",

When members of any group meet those of another, beliefs can be affected: in particular, those with greater confidence can persuade others to adopt their beliefs. Unlike the SIR model, where the transition from S is to I and then to R, in BER there is greater mingling; thus one can transfer from Vulnerable to either of the other two groups; and there is also switching between the groups.",

            "text": "The SIR Model for Spread of Disease (Smith and Moore 2001) There are three groups in the population, Susceptible, S, Infectious, I, and Recovered, R, which evolve as follows:\u1e60where \u03b2 is the number of close contacts per period between susceptibles and those already infected; \u03b3 measures the rate at which the infected population ceases to be infectious; so \u03b2/\u03b3 is the 'reproduction ratio' -the initial rate of spread; and the constant population is normalised at 1. The dynamics of S and I are shown in the phase diagram below, along with the peak level of Infected population (P),the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) and the specific level of Herd immunity (S \u221e ) where infections cease in the long run with no intervention. The parameters used are based on the Hong Kong flu epidemic in New York City in the late 1960's.No indications are given here for non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, lockdowns, and test/trace /isolate measures 31 ; but the dashed line illustrates the impact of a vaccine for about half the population that takes the susceptible population promptly below the Herd Immunity Threshold, without affecting the level, S \u221e , where infections finally cease. (More or less vaccination would affect this level) (Fig. 7) .",
