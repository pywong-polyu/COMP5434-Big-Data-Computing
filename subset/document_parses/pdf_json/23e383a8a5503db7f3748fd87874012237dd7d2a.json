            "text": "Introduction: COVID-19 has disrupted daily life and societal flow globally since December 2019; it introduced measures such as lockdown and suspension of all non-essential movements. As a result, driving activity was also significantly affected. Still, to-date, a quantitative assessment of the effect of COVID-19 on driving behavior during the lockdown is yet to be provided. This gap forms the motivation for this paper, which aims at comparing observed values concerning three indicators (average speed, speeding, and harsh braking), with forecasts based on their corresponding observations before the lockdown in Greece. Method: Time series of the three indicators were extracted using a specially developed smartphone application and transmitted to a back-end platform between 01/01/2020 and 09/05/2020, a time period containing normal operations, COVID-19 spreading, and the full lockdown period in Greece. Based on the collected data, XGBoost was employed to identify the most influential COVID-19 indicators, and Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were developed for obtaining forecasts on driving behavior. Results: Results revealed the intensity of the impact of COVID-19 on driving, especially on average speed, speeding, and harsh braking per 100 km. More specifically, speeds were found to increase by 2.27 km/h on average compared to the forecasted evolution, while harsh braking/100 km increased to almost 1.51 on average. On the bright side, road crashes in Greece were reduced by 49% during the months of COVID-19 compared to the non-COVID-19 period.",

Road traffic volume, public transport users, and overall mobility activity reduced significantly (Apple, 2020; Google LLC, 2020; Moovit, 2020) . For example, a study in the city of Santander, Spain, analyzed the impact of COVID-19 confinement and demonstrated that overall activity decreased by 67% and public transport use decreased by 93% (Aloi et al., 2020) , while forecasts on travel demand revealed less traffic, public transport usage, and congestion or flow levels (Aloi et al., 2020; De Vos, 2020) . In the same context, nearly 80% of people in the Netherlands reduced their activities outdoors, and subsequently elderly people had a greater decrease (de Haas et al., 2020) . A behavioral change in mobility as a result of COVID-19 could also be on track, as according to de Haas et al. (2020) 27% of Dutch people stated that they will work from home more frequently, while 20% expressed the willingness to cycle and walk more in the future. Road traffic crashes were found to be reduced as road traffic and pedestrian volume decreased (Aloi et al., 2020) . Furthermore, data provided by TomTom showed that traffic volumes decreased https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2021.04.007 0022-4375/\u00d3 2021 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. by 70-85% in the majority of European cities (ETSC, 2020; TomTom, 2020) . Despite a dramatic decline in traffic volumes due to COVID-19 restrictions, in urban areas there was a 35% increase in speeding and an almost 200% increase in stunt driving offences in the March 15-31, 2020 timeframe, compared to the same period last year (City of Toronto, 2020) .",

Time series forecasts of driving indicators based on the normal (pre-lockdown) phase are used to compare observed driving behavior with a normal evolution of itself, so as to quantify the change during lockdown.",

The overall number of road crashes as well as crash fatalities reported across United States was also reduced (Wagner et al., 2020) . Although the number of road crashes was in general positively correlated with the amount of traffic volumes, the number of fatalities, surprisingly, was observed to experience an increase at some states during COVID-19 period (Vingilis et al., 2020) .",

Moreover, Vingilis et al. (2020) investigated the COVID-19 disease and its effects on road safety and it was revealed that travel decreased and drivers were exposed to a lower risk of collisions. Inada et al. (2020) indicated that empty roads triggered some speed-related traffic law violations among drivers, such as speeding, failing to stop at a stop sign, red light running, and failing to yield to pedestrians. In addition, Neuburger and Egger (2020) revealed an increase in risk perception of COVID-19, travel risk perception, and travel behavior over a short period of time. However, the aforementioned studies were limited to discussions over the impact of COVID-19 and did not provide quantifiable results on the impact of the pandemic on driving behavior.",

For example, Aloi et al. (2020) conducted an empirical study and concentrated exclusively on urban mobility and COVID-19. Only descriptive results were included in that study and the authors demonstrated the change of mode choice, purpose of trip, number of trips, macroscopic traffic flow, public transport trips travel time and demands, and general trip features during lockdown. It was also revealed that, in Tokyo, speeding increased by 52% in March 2020 compared to March 2019, while the police officially enhanced enforcement of fines and penalties for speeding during the following months (Inada et al., 2020) . Similarly, Katrakazas et al. (2020) provided descriptive evidence from Greece and Saudi Arabia on the deterioration of road safety levels during the period of the lockdown. In particular, it was shown that reduced traffic volumes due to lockdown led to a slight increase in average driving speed by 6-11%, but more importantly, to more frequent harsh accelerations and harsh braking per 100 km (up to 12%). Additionally, during March and April 2020, which were the months where COVID-19 spread was at its peak, mobile phone use while driving increased by 42%, while driving within the risky hours (00:00am-05:00am) dropped by up to 81%. Furthermore, spatial patterns of speeding pre (2019) and post (2020) the COVID-19 outbreak were visualized and compared in order to examine if the spatial extent of speeding increased (Lee et al., 2020) .",

Their results indicated that after the appearance of COVID-19 pandemic and its corresponding restrictions, driving days per week decreased by 37%, while vehicle miles driven dropped by 35. Nevertheless, the data used were concerned with self-reported driving behavior, and as a result a bias existed. Within-subjects general linear models were used in Roe et al. (2020) to investigate driving behavior of older adults during COVID-19. Indicators used included mean length in miles, the average speed in miles per hour of each trip, along with the mean number of three types of aggressive behaviors (i.e., harsh braking, harsh accelerations, and speeding) per mile per trip. It was clearly highlighted that participants reduced the proportion of days driven during the pandemic compared with the same period the year before. At the same time, trips per day showed a similar decline. Participants also took shorter trips, drove slower, had fewer speeding incidents, and had different trip destinations.",

Another study reported that the seasonal ARIMA models predicted more accurately, compared to the best performing k-NN (k-nearest neighbors algorithm) forecast models (Smith et al., 2002 in Kumar & Vanajakshi, 2015 .",

Regarding data collection, data from smartphone sensors have been shown to allow for continuous and rapid data collection and seamless storage and analysis. Since smartphones are programmable, flexible implementation possibilities become available. However, there are increased demands in data storage and analysis, and considerable upfront costs during development of the data handling infrastructure, with much lower costs as time progresses and participant numbers increase .",

Furthermore, a number of hyperparameters can be optimized for each XGBoost ensemble, such as learning rate (eta), gamma, maximum tree depth, minimum child weight, number of rounds and mean squared error. The selection of the optimal values is conducted by examining large numbers of hyperparameter combinations, as described by Bischl et al.

The three components (i.e., trend, seasonality, and residuals) for the timeseries of the considered indicators were analyzed. It was observed that the seasonal component for all three indicators changed over time, and similar patterns were observed for consecutive months. However, later observations displayed greater difference. With regards to average speed and speeding, there was an overall increasing trend through the months, which means that there was a significant rise in average speed and speeding during the period of COVID-19 pandemic. Taking into consideration harsh braking/100 km, a smaller seasonal trend was evident. With regards to the non-seasonal trend, values reached a maximum during mid-March, but started to decrease thereafter. Lastly, the contribution of random noise was negligible for all the examined variables. As described in the methodology, the next step in the time series pipeline was to check for stationarity. For that purpose, the ADF test was performed for the 1st difference (Y t -Y t-1 ) of average speed, speeding, and harsh braking/100 km. In order to eliminate the seasonal effect from the time series observations, a seasonal first differencing was utilized for all considered time-series. The first difference was used because all the original time series were not stationary. Such a transformation also assisted to consolidate the variance of a time series. Moreover, differencing can help stabilize the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, and therefore eliminating, or reducing, trend and seasonality. Table 10 illustrates the ADF test for the original variables, while Table 11 depicts the ADF test for the 1st difference of each variable. In addition, Table 12 illustrates the Box-Ljung Test (white noise check) for the examined variables, which was performed on the 1st difference of average speed, speeding and harsh braking/100 km.",

Initially, the importance of COVID-19 indications (e.g., cases, casualties, lockdown countermeasures) was investigated using the feature importance extracted from XGBoost algorithms. The number of total cases was one of the two most important factors for three out of the three examined indicators (i.e. speed, speeding, and harsh braking/100 km). As a result, it can be derived that the spread of the virus had a significant effect on driving behavior. Total distance and trip duration were also among the most influential factors for all examined indicators. This can be explained by the significant decrease in trip duration and distance driven during the lockdown phase as seen in Fig. 6 . The effect of the lockdown initiation was not found to have a significant effect on driving behavior indicators, as was indicated in section 5 of the current paper. This is probably explained by C. Katrakazas, E. Michelaraki, M. Sekadakis et al. Journal of Safety Research 78 (2021) 189-202 the fact that Greek drivers did not change their behavior due to the lockdown but rather because of the spread of the virus that led them to minimize trips and car driving. The authors recognize that there is no immediate causal connection between total COVID-19 cases and/or quarantine presence and road safety, in the form of an established road safety risk factor or measure. The findings of the exploratory analysis through XGBoost, however, suggest a correlational value of the parameter of number of cases at least temporally. Therefore, they provided additional incentive for the time-series modelling and examination of trends that impact the three examined road safety indicators, as the pandemic progresses.",

Conversely, the minimum difference (-5.30 ) between actual and forecasted values of average speed was found in 03/05/2020, a day before the gradually lift restrictions in Greece, when drivers started to restart their business activity and return to their daily routines. On average, it was demonstrated that observed speeds are 2.27 km/h higher than the forecasted ones, but as seen from the maximum and minimum values a lot of variance existed. This finding can be explained by the fact, that with emptier streets and much lower volumes, average vehicle speed tends to be increased. This finding can be supported by Inada et al.

This finding can be supported by previous studies in which it was found that less vehicle traffic volumes and empty roads led to higher speeds and harsh events (Carter, 2020) . Results from the current research are also consistent with findings reported by Wagner et al. (2020) , who analyzed U.S. data from the second quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter. It was revealed that the total number of road crashes and fatalities reported across states was reduced, while drivers were more willing to take risks that included speeding, driving while impaired, and not using their seat belts. These drivers, along with a potential reduction in law enforcement and safety messaging, were identified as possible factors that created an environment favoring risky driving. The same finding was recently reported by Brodeur et al. (2020) who used differencein-differences in order to evaluate the impact of Stay-at-Home orders on road crashes for five states in the United States and a 50% reduction in road crashes was identified. However, some of the conclusions delivered from Lin et al. (2020) were found to be different compared to the present ones. In particular, the impact of COVID-19 on road traffic safety in Los Angeles and New York was examined. Results indicated that the pandemic has disproportionately affected certain age groups and that nonfatal road crashes decreased, while the number of fatal crash cases remained the same during the pandemic (Lin et al., 2020) .",

Measurements regarding speed were the ones demonstrating the larger difference. The most reliable forecasting model for speed demonstrated that speeds increased by 2.27 km/h on average and up to 7.5 km/h on a national holiday day during the lockdown. Furthermore, the increase in speeds also assisted in manifesting an increase in harsh braking/100 km, which is supported by recent literature. The number of road crashes and road traffic fatalities and injuries decreased during the COVID-19 period (i.e., from March to Table 17 Road crashes and persons injured from January to April 2020 in Greece (Hellenic Statistical Authority (2021)). April 2020), compared to non-COVID-19 period (i.e., from January to February 2020). Nevertheless, this paper is not without shortcomings. The developed models for speeding have limitations and do not seem to capture the trend and seasonality of the original time series effectively. More sophisticated models, such as deep neural networks (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)) could have a better fit on the time series data and provide better forecasts. Furthermore, rates for harsh acceleration events per km were not found statistically significant in this work, but the aforementioned sophisticated models could succeed in forecasting using these variables as well.",
