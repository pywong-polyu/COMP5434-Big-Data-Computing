This article analyzes the impact that the COVID-19 and the state of alarm has had on Spanish social service professionals. An ad hoc questionnaire was used, administered on-line, individually, voluntarily and anonymously to 560 professionals working in social services, both in the public and private sectors, based throughout Spain. This questionnaire has five different parts: socio-demographic profiling, impact that the health crisis has had on the practice of professional functions, degree of knowledge of the measures imposed to guarantee the protection and safety of professionals and users, impact that it has had on the professional and personal development of social services professionals and, the fifth and last part, degree of adaptation of the measures aimed at the care of the vulnerable population. These results are discussed based on the situation in which professionals working in this sector find themselves in the face of the changes they are experiencing in the development of their work, and we are able to determine the profile of the workers who have felt most affected by the situation, with the consequent and foreseeable mental and emotional affectation that this implies. These professionals tend to value more negatively the set of measures developed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on Spanish social services.",

However, the spread of the virus was exponential, so much so that the government decreed a state of alarm among the harshest in Europe that confined all citizens to their homes, allowing only sporadic outings for shopping, going to the doctor or handle some banking transaction. All socio-economic activities were suspended, except for essential activities concerning the production, distribution and marketing of basic necessities. Among them, the activity of Spanish social services. This set of measures has had a great impact on the entire population, considerably increasing unemployment, contracting economic activity as never before and making the living conditions of millions of people, including the users of social services, even more precarious.",

This led to the cessation of almost all the activity that had been taking place. Social intervention projects were cancelled, home help for the elderly and dependents was limited, and thousands of aids that contributed to the achievement of a minimum level of welfare for large sections of the Spanish population were no longer provided. The authorities quickly understood the impact of limited social services and declared them to be essential services. Thus, on 26 March 2020, 12 days after declaring the state of emergency in the country, the Spanish authorities, by order SND/295/2020, declared the social services and their workers to be essential, which allowed these services to continue, although subject to the state of emergency.",

These guidelines for action have also affected homeless people, with the aim of ensuring the provision of social services and establishing measures to achieve their confinement. Recommendations were also issued to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and the state of alarm in segregated settlements and highly vulnerable neighborhoods. These recommendations have been extended to programs for the protection of children and adolescents, volunteering and intervention in primary care social services.",
