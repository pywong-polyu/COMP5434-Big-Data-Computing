A total of 1221 Chinese adults with mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 37 (9) years, 37.3% males and 62.7% females, body mass index (BMI) of 29.0 (4.0) kg/m 2 , triglyceride (TG) 2.04 (1.45) mmol/L, and waist circumference (WC) 95.8 (10.7) cm were included and classified into four phenotypes: normal TG & normal WC (N-N); normal TG & high WC (N-WC); high TG & normal WC (TG-N); high TG & high WC (TG-WC). Participants in TG-WC group had the highest BMI, WC, blood pressure (BP), insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and fatty liver. Participants within N-WC group had a significantly higher risk of fatty liver (adjusted OR 3.50 [95% CI 2.05-5.97]), as well as TG-N (adjusted OR 2.59 [95% CI 1.61-4.16]) and TG-WC (adjusted OR 4.12 [95% CI 2.28-7.46]). The risk of elevated HOMA-IR was significantly higher in TG-N (adjusted OR 2.16 [95% CI 1.33-3.50]) and TG-WC (adjusted OR 2.04 [95% CI 1.22-3.40]). The risk of elevated HbA1c was significantly higher in the TG-WC (adjusted OR 2.79 [95% CI 1.47-5.31]). Hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype can be a potential and cost-effective method to identify individuals with a high risk of fatty liver and glycometabolic disorders. OPEN",

These remind us that obesity and diabetes have brought pathophysiological changes to the biological systems of the human body. Therefore, there is a high priority to develop specific phenotypes of obesity and diabetes to better assess the risks and efficient screening, and to further engage patients into individualized treatments.",

            "text": "Heterogeneous subgroups among the overweight/obese based on phenotypic differences for metabolic risk factors have been observed previously 4 . The complexity of phenotypes may contribute to some of the variations in symptomatic outcomes of diabetes, fatty liver, and mortalities related to obesity. Obesity, especially increases in visceral fat deposits, have been recognized as one of the leading causes of all metabolic risk factors 5 . However, overweight/obese individuals with similar levels of adiposity measured by body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference (WC) can display different metabolic profiles characterized by lipid, insulin, and glucose concentrations 6 . Insulin resistance has elucidated most of the pathophysiology of the metabolic syndrome with www.nature.com/scientificreports/ a significant contribution to hyperglycemia 7 . Furthermore, a major contributor to the development of insulin resistance is an overabundance of circulating fatty acids mainly derived from triglyceride 8 . Hence, the main factors to identify high risks of obesity and diabetes are visceral fat and abnormality in triglyceride concentrations. The hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype is characterized by the simultaneous presence of elevated serum triglyceride (TG) levels with an increased WC. Hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype has been proposed as a cost-effective method of screening in clinical practice to overcome the major barriers of the high cost of measuring visceral adiposity and insulin 9 . Previous studies conducted with overweight/obese populations, found a higher risk of diabetes in such phenotype among the elderly [10] [11] [12] . It was also suggested that hypertriglyceridemic waist was more prevalent in young and middle-aged adults 10 . Fatty liver is considered to be a hepatic injury associated with the metabolic syndrome in parallel with obesity and diabetes 13 . The prevalence of fatty liver has continued to grow in recent years. Most of the patients with fatty liver disease are asymptomatic and ignored. The diagnosis of fatty liver is complicated and is depended on abnormal imaging results and liver enzyme activity following biopsy examinations, which are also expensive and invasive 14 . The association between the hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype and fatty liver disease needs further scientific investigation.",

            "text": "The concept of the hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype was first proposed by Lemieux et al. based on the evidence that high TG or WC alone were inadequate to identify the metabolic triad 9 . This phenotype has been widely accepted in risk assessment or prediction of high visceral fat 25 , diabetes 26 , hypertension 27 , metabolic syndrome 28 , atherosclerosis 29 , cardiovascular diseases 30 , and renal dysfunction 31 . All these results support that the hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype is a cost-effective screening tool that can be used in clinical practice and is an efficient and effective phenotype that can be used for health management. However, the application of this phenotype in the identification of fatty liver disease is still limited. Previously, a cross-sectional study focusing on children/adolescents found that hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype was related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 32 . In the adult population, Liu et al. demonstrated that phenotypes combining TG and BMI were a better indicator of fatty liver disease among premenopausal women, and that WC alone was associated with the disease in postmenopausal women 33 . This finding was also supported by Yu et al. who observed that the hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype was significantly associated with a higher risk of abnormal liver function in Chinese adults 34 . In our study population, overweight/obese adults suffered from visceral adiposity and glycometabolic disorders, that are conditions closely linked to fatty liver disease 35 . Interestingly, during the subgroup analysis, the identification ability of hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype for fatty liver and abnormal glycometabolic profile was less effective in the obese and hypertension subgroups. We speculate that lower heterogeneities and small sample size may have contributed to the decrease in predictive validities. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ We also found an association between hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype and insulin resistance, which was in agreement with some of the previous studies that investigated abnormal glucose metabolism in female, overweight, and normal subgroups. A meta-analysis concluded that participants with the hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype had more serious insulin resistance problems and higher glucose concentrations 36 . In our study, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ following adjustment for potential confounders, the risk of high glucose was not significantly different for phenotypes. This may be the result of the regulation of \u03b2 cells. At the early stage of insulin resistance, \u03b2 cells can increase secretion to maintain normal glucose tolerance 37 . Elevated blood glucose can appear when \u03b2 cells cannot release sufficient insulin. Further to this, some of the studies concentrated on the hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype and levels of HbA1c, but there were no studies that demonstrated a specific association between phenotypes 38, 39 . The findings of this study demonstrate that the hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype was associated with a high level of HbA1c concentration especially in the overweight and normal BP populations. There are several limitations in the current study that need consideration. A relatively small sample size and wide confidence intervals around the estimates of associations may have resulted in low predictive ability within the subgroups of the males, the obese, and the hypertensive. It can also be speculated that there was relatively low sensitivity and specificity of the hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype in the Chinese population sampled due to the relatively low TG and WC observed 34 . Referring to the diagnosis of fatty liver, imaging results and liver enzyme activity following biopsy examinations, which are gold standard, were not used in the current study. In addition, we were not able to categorize non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which might lead to a bias in the findings. However, we included alcohol as a confounder, and the associations were persistently significant. The target population in our study was Chinese overweight/obese adults, which may not represent normal weight adults and different populations. The clinical relevance of our findings, while exciting, need further experimental investigation using larger population samples and sub group analysis.",
