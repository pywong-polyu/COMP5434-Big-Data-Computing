As a result, it is being used earlier for medical students in Undergraduate Medical Education (UME) as a learning tool for the basic sciences including gross anatomy. There is little literature, however, to support its utility for basic science education in students currently seeking a bachelor's degree. This study consisted of fourteen currently enrolled bachelor students with previous instruction in human anatomy and physiology. Students participated in an ultrasound didactic and an interactive ultrasound experience with volunteers. Before and after this session, students were asked to complete an assessment measuring their spatial understanding of the human anatomy and their ability to locate structures using ultrasound. Wilcoxon's signed-rank tests comparing assessment scores showed significant improvement on both portions of the assessment. Based on this improvement, we suggest that ultrasound is a valid educational tool which can be used at the bachelor-level to effectively enhance students' learning of anatomy and provide hands on experience with modern technology. Further research with larger samples will be necessary to determine whether it would supplement or replace more traditional teaching modalities.",

Feilchenfeld et al,, in their systematic review, concluded that there is a lack of conclusive empirical evidence showing quantitative improvements in learning with ultrasound [5] . The majority of studies show a positive, subjective impression shared by learners [10, 11] rather than objective evidence. Those studies that have measured learning gains focus on undergraduate medical student learners [12, 13] , not bachelor students. Because there is a gap in the literature describing the effectiveness at earlier educational levels, the present study sought to evaluate the utility of ultrasound as an anatomical learning tool for bachelor students. Given widespread demonstration of positive, qualitative endpoints, the research team opted to measure objective, quantitative endpoints which are lacking in the wider literature for this group of learners.",

Assessments were administered through Qualtrics XM (Qualtrics, Provo, UT).

Students were evaluated by medical students who had completed the preclinical curriculum at the UNC School of Medicine. In order to correctly identify a structure and receive credit, students were expected to place the ultrasound probe and indicate on the monitor what a given structure was.

Given participants' prior exposure to the material in their prerequisite anatomy course, their improvement on the content assessment shows that ultrasound serves as a valid method for helping students understand the spatial relationships between anatomic structures in contrast. Further investigation would be needed to fully determine superiority or non-inferiority of ultrasound in comparison to more traditional teaching modalities and determine if ultrasound could serve as an alternative or simply supplemental modality.

These concerns were discussed by the research team prior to our study and are discussed below. The first concern relates to consent. While the hands-on nature of learning may be appealing and entertaining to some, other learners may feel uncomfortable both being touched or touching others in an activity such as this. Adequate informed consent, both for the volunteers and students, is important prior to engaging in these learning activities. Such conversations should include an understanding of what body parts may need to be uncovered and/or palpated. Draping procedures should be implemented for volunteers who do not wish to remain exposed for extended periods and perhaps alternative assignments should be available to learners who do not wish to participate. Such assignments should be administered in a way which protects their privacy in making this decision, an important wider consideration when adopting ultrasound into bachelor-level basic science curricula. In UME, there is an expectation of learning using others in the physical exam and in other parts of the curricula. This expectation is not inherent to basic science curricula and therefore merits discussion with students.",

            "text": "Another primary concern involves liability with regard to imaging. In UME, ultrasound instruction is often carried out with clinically trained instructors. Ultrasound, after all, is fundamentally a clinical tool which can be adapted to the learning Fig. 2 Scavenger hunt graph environment. As such, the potential exists for incidental, pathologic findings to be present on imaging. While many findings may be benign or normal anatomic variants, it is unlikely that graduate teaching assistants or even many faculty will have appropriate medical expertise to assess whether findings are clinically significant and merit further examination by a health professional. While there is evidence-based support that anatomists can teach using ultrasound as well as clinicians [14] , there is little information to address their ability to detect and identify normal anatomical variants from pathologic variants on their volunteers. Clear procedures should be communicated to volunteers who are being scanned prior to the activity regarding (1) whether instructional staff have any clinical training and at what level, (2) steps that will be taken should an abnormal finding be discovered, and (3) the possibility that any present abnormalities may not be recognized by instructional staff at the time of the activity. Additionally, discussion of abnormal findings should occur privately between instructional staff and volunteers without the presence of learners. In this study, all instructors were non-licensed professional students or basic science faculty. While no abnormalities were readily detected, instructors were prompted to notify the research team and a referral would have been made to the campus health services center at the university.",

The use of this tool should be further studied at the bachelor level to determine whether it may even be superior to more traditional teaching modalities. In incorporating this modality as a tool earlier in medical education, it may spare space in later curricula for more advanced teaching at the UME level. Programs should evaluate and determine the cost-effectiveness of this learning modality in comparison to more traditional ones to determine whether it conveys a financial advantage. Any discussion of its use, however, should include proper consent procedures for students and volunteers as well as adequate procedures to address abnormal findings seen on imaging.",
