The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initially emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

A large number of Wenzhou citizens live and work in Wuhan and were hence infected during the early COVID-19 outbreak. Many of them returned from Wuhan to Wenzhou just before the lockdown Our results show that the exposure group had a significantly higher proportion of persons infected without a known source (63/76, 83% versus 6/116, 5%, P<0.0001) (Table 1). Only 13 of 76 (17%) patients in the exposure group had a point source determined compared to 110 of 116 (95%) patients in the non-exposure group. The exposure group had a higher incidence of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared to the non-exposure group(Table 1), as reflected by the following parameters, including higher temperature (37.4\u00b10.8 versus 37.1\u00b10.6 \u2103, P=0.0034), lower white blood cell count (4.4\u00b11.6 versus 5.2\u00b11.7, \u00d710 9 /L, P=0.0013), lower lymphocyte count (1.07\u00b10.52 versus 1.34\u00b10.62, \u00d710 9 /L, P=0.002), higher creatine kinase (150\u00b1199 versus 103\u00b1107 U/L, P=0.035), and a higher proportion of severe and critically ill cases (30% [23/76] versus 9% [11/116], P<0.0001). The exposure group also had a slightly lower cycle threshold (Ct) values (28.5\u00b15.6 versus 30.3\u00b14.6, P=0.065) of RT-PCR for the ORF1 gene of SARS-CoV-2, which is inversely correlated with a slightly higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load. No significant difference was observed in anyWe found a high Odds Ratio for severe COVID-19 outcomes for those who had been infected in the high transmission setting of Wuhan, especially if no point source was identified, compared to those infected in a low transmission setting. While decreased lymphocyte count and elevated CRP are known risk factors predictive of severe disease 3 , we believe this is the first study that showed exposure to a high transmission setting increases the risk for disease severity. We hypothesize that this is due to repeat exposure to multiple points of transmission sources or contacts in a setting with wide community transmission such as Wuhan early on in the outbreak. We found that the viral load in patients infected in the high transmission setting of Wuhan was higher than for those infected in the low transmission setting of Wenzhou. A viral dose-dependent immune response may be associated with more disease severity and hence the higher mortality observed in Wuhan, as previously reported. 4 Indeed, the exposure group had a higher viral load, higher temperature and lower lymphocyte", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Abbreviations: SD, standard deviation; Ct, threshold cycle; CI, confidence interval.Note: Continuous variables are described as mean\u00b1SD [95% CI].
