In addition, opportunities to observe and learn surgical procedures can be hampered by geographic barriers and political institutions that emphasize operating room efficiency [1] . The learning curve associated with vitreoretinal surgery can be long and requires the development of key surgical skills. Medical professionals today have access to several tools, and the use of online resources has become part of the educational process [2] . Surgical videos are an example in which the combination of figures, captions, and diagrams can be added to facilitate learning. Studies have demonstrated the benefits of multimedia in learning by converting cognitive input into long-term memory [2, 3] . A wide range of free online retinal surgical videos is available on different social media sites, which provides access to information in a fast, practical, and inexpensive way, and eliminates the limitations imposed by geographic and time barriers [4, 5] . Studies in several medical areas have reported that YouTube currently is the main platform used by surgeons to prepare for surgical procedures [1, 2] . Surgical videos on YouTube are tools that can be useful and appropriate to complement surgical learning, assuming that the content has an educational purpose and the video has good quality and detailed explanations. Both experienced surgeons and trainees can benefit from watching surgical video content, either to review a rarely performed procedure, improve technical details, or discover different solutions that other colleagues have performed. However, the quality and utility of surgical videos on YouTube should be questioned since there is no adequate control, and the content can be posted by anyone, without a review and quality-control process. In addition, the perception of the utility of the videos and critical analysis about the presence of inappropriate content may vary depending on the experience of the surgeon viewing the video.",

Educational and institutional videos designed to provide patient information or marketing were excluded. A total of 1054 videos from 12 You-Tube channels were listed, and from these, the top five videos on each channel based on the number of views were selected.

The descriptions of the channels included the number of views, followers, and number of videos posted. The overall image quality of the videos was rated as poor, moderate, or good. The use of the videos as an educational tool for vitreoretinal surgery was classified using the Likert 5-point scale (1 useless to 5 very useful). For each video, the examiners answered the following questions \"Have you learned something new from this video?\" and \"Did you see something inappropriate or controversial in the video's educational content?\" To assess surgical performance, examiners applied the items from the Casey Eye Institute Vitrectomy Indices Tool for skills Assessment (CEIVITS) to each video, which was validated as a tool to assess basic vitrectomy maneuvers [6] . The CEIVITS is comprised of 10 items including positioning and incisional techniques for sclerotomies; preparation, positioning and checking the infusion line; surgical microscope focus and navigation; technique for removing the core vitreous; membranectomy technique; fluid-air exchange, and sclerotomy sutures. Each domain is accessed on the 5-point Likert scale (1 indicating worst to 5 best). For each item, the examiners scored 0 points if a step was not visible in the video, 1 if it was partially visible, and 2 if it was clearly visible. If the surgical step was unrelated to the procedure shown in the video, the examiner marked it as \"does not apply\". Data extracted and parameters evaluated are shown in Table 1 . The Channel and Videos characteristics are detailed in Additional file 1: Table S1 .",

The form was further shortened to reduce fatigue and improve the overall style according to guidelines for conducting and reporting survey research [7, 8] . In the second phase of the study, 75 retinal surgeons with different levels of experience were invited to participate in the survey through e-mail or online messaging applications that contained a link to an online form generated using Google forms. Retinal surgeons and fellows were invited from lists of retinal medical societies and contacted individually. The project was described on the first page, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Upon agreeing to participate, the evaluator was directed to a page containing three questions about demographic data (age, country, and length of career as a retinal specialist). The evaluator then watched the videos and answered three multiple-choice questions (required), one on a linear scale (required), and two descriptive (optional), and classified each of the 10 videos in a table according to the parameters of the CEIVITS scale [6] . All responses were anonymous and stored in a password-protected account on the server that generated the survey. Two authors (LFAL and JMBP) analyzed the results.

These videos have been viewed on the platform by more than 1 million people worldwide and have been available online for an average of 4.53 years. Considering the growing number of vitreoretinal surgical videos posted on YouTube and other platforms and the trend toward increasing use of social media among surgeons, it is important for the scientific community to verify the educational value of these new e-learning tools [9] [10] [11] [12] . The importance increases when considering that currently there are no control tools that evaluate the posted content, and there are no guidelines proposed by medical retinal societies to guide how to properly prepare a surgical video in this area. However, since the evolution of technology reduces limitations by geographic locations and access to qualified mentors, surgeons-in-training can watch surgical videos on the Internet, and this allows greater contact with different surgical techniques, facilitating the search for additional information in scientific articles and discussions with more experienced colleagues.",

As expected, the evaluation of the quality of the images did not differ significantly among the groups. Previous studies in different medical fields have reported the generally poor image quality of the YouTube videos [13] [14] [15] . Unlike these studies, the image quality of the retinal surgical videos was not a limitation in the current sample. Only 6% of the videos were considered poor; 60% of the videos were rated as good and 33% as moderate. The greater access to new technologies that acquire high-quality images in surgical cameras, especially in retinal surgeries with availability of recordings captured using 3-dimensional visualization systems such as NGENUITY \u00ae (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA), tend to improve the content of the images shown in conference discussions and posted on the Internet.",

Even with the difference observed between the senior surgeons and the other two groups, the average utility score in this group was 3.47 on a scale of 1-5. The general average of the study sample was 3.83. Similarly, the analysis of the educational content found that the fellows learned something new from the videos 34.76% of the time (p < 0.05), and the more experienced surgeons reported learning something new 19.17% of the time. This result indicates that videos can be useful even for experienced surgeons. The retinal specialty has a wide range of techniques and different surgical indications, and, therefore, the surgical videos available online can be important sources of complementary knowledge. The topics most frequently addressed in the current sample were rhegmatogenous retinal detachments, macular holes, and intraocular lens implantation in the absence of adequate capsular support. The complexity and range of techniques to treat retinal detachments and the recent publication of different techniques for treating macular holes and intraocular lens fixation justify the surgeons' greater interest in these topics [16] [17] [18] . However, a rate of 26.85% for controversial and/or inappropriate content was found in the videos. Contrary to expectations, no significant difference was seen among the groups, and even the fellows had similar rates in the critical evaluation of the videos compared to the surgeons in the more experienced groups.",
