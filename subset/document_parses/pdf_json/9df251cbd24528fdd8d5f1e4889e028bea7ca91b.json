Adolescent cannabis users had higher levels of anhedonia compared to age-matched controls, whereas adult users had lower levels of apathy and anhedonia compared to age-matched controls. Cannabis dependence was associated with higher levels of apathy and anhedonia within both adult and adolescent users. These results indicate that individual differences within cannabis users may be more important than user status per se, in predicting apathy and anhedonia. We also found that levels of apathy and anhedonia had increased since the onset of the COVID-19 lockdown, and that this increase was larger in dependent compared to non-dependent cannabis users. Our results add to the growing body of evidence on the adverse mental health impact of the COVID-19 lockdown, and highlight groups with potentially increased vulnerability.",

Lockdown measures intended to mitigate the spread of the virus have imposed a significant constraint on our ability to engage in activities we normally find rewarding, and many have reported feeling a loss of motivation and purpose during the pandemic (Minds, 2020) . Meanwhile, the use of cannabis appears to have increased (Winstock et al., 2020) . Though the association between cannabis and reward processing is unclear, some previous research has linked cannabis use with reduced motivation (Pacheco-Col\u00f3n et al., 2018a) , placing users at potentially increased risk of anhedonic and amotivational responses to COVID-19 lockdown measures.",

Apathy refers to a loss of or reduction in motivation, and anhedonia to a loss of interest in or pleasure from previously rewarding activities (Robert et al., 2009; Treadway and Zald, 2011) . One recent large-scale study by Petrucci et al. (2020) found that problematic cannabis use correlated with apathy, and a longitudinal study of over 3000 participants by Leventhal et al. (2017) found that anhedonia predicted future cannabis use during adolescence. Adolescents may be predisposed towards harmful effects of cannabis, including apathy and anhedonia, due to the important neuromaturation that takes place during this time (Bossong and Niesink, 2010; Lubman et al., 2015) . However, some studies do not find higher levels of apathy or anhedonia in cannabis users (Dumas et al., 2002; Barnwell et al., 2006; Pacheco-Col\u00f3n et al., 2018b) , thus more research is needed to understand this relationship.",

Social distancing has meant increased isolation and loneliness, which are important risk factors for mental health problems (Vatansever et al., 2021) , and negatively impact social cognition (Bland et al., 2020) . These measures may be especially hard on adolescents, given the particular importance of peer interaction during this time (Blakemore, 2008; Kilford et al., 2016) . Indeed, several studies suggest that adolescents have faced severe psychosocial consequences due to lockdown (Duan et al., 2020; Loades et al., 2020; Minds, 2020) , and that vulnerable adolescents are at particular risk (Fegert et al., 2020) . The COVID-19 lockdown could also have potentiated the relationship between cannabis use and apathy and anhedonia. Cannabis users experiencing problems related to abuse and dependence may have had particular difficulty coping with the additional stress brought on by the pandemic. Finally, these vulnerability factors could interact and exacerbate problems (Fegert et al., 2020) , thus placing adolescent cannabis users at enhanced risk.",

Cannabis dependence was assessed with the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS; Gossop et al., 1995; Martin et al., 2006) . Anhedonia was measured with the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS; Snaith et al., 1995) . The SHAPS consists of 14 items covering a wide range of pleasurable experiences, and is a reliable and valid measure of anhedonia both in adult (Franken et al., 2007) and adolescent (Leventhal et al., 2015) samples. Apathy was measured with the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES; Marin et al., 1991) . The AES is an 18-item self-report questionnaire with cognitive, behavioural, and emotional dimensions, and has been demonstrated as valid and reliable (Raimo et al., 2014; Lueken et al., 2017) . Responses on both scales were coded so that higher scores indicated higher levels of apathy or anhedonia, respectively.

Covariates in all models were days per month of alcohol use, days per month of cigarette use, regular illicit drug use (yes/no), self-reported depression (yes/no), and self-reported anxiety (yes/no), as well as all individual two-way covariate interactions with Time. These covariates were included due to their potential interaction with cannabis use (e.g. Patton et al., 2002; Fergusson et al., 2006; Millar et al., 2021) , and to separate apathy and anhedonia from general anxiety and depression. Multiple comparisons correction was performed using the Benjamin-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) procedure for AES and SHAPS independently for the effects of interest, with a priori q < .05. Partial eta squared (\u03b7 p 2 ) values were used as measures of effect size. Finally, bivariate Pearson correlations were computed between variables of interest.

Rather, adolescent cannabis users might be more vulnerable to apathy compared to adult cannabis users, and to anhedonia compared to adult users and adolescent controls. There are several potential explanations for this enhanced vulnerability in adolescents. Adolescence is an important period of prolonged neuromaturation during which external factors, such as cannabis use, may be especially powerful in influencing brain and cognitive development (Bossong and Niesink, 2010; Lubman et al., 2015) . Prolonged cannabis exposure during adolescence could contribute to blunted reward processing in the brain, increasing the susceptibility to anhedonia (Volkow et al., 2017) . However, one large longitudinal study by Leventhal et al. (2017) found that cannabis use did not predict future anhedonia in adolescence, but rather anhedonia predicted future cannabis use. These results A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t suggest that anhedonia might be a contributing factor to cannabis use in adolescence, or might co-occur with other factors which predict cannabis use.",

Firstly, our results suggest that adolescent cannabis users have higher levels of anhedonia compared to adolescent controls, and higher levels of apathy and anhedonia compared to adult users. There was no evidence of higher apathy or anhedonia in adult cannabis users, compared to controls. Secondly, within users, cannabis dependence is associated with significantly higher levels of both apathy and anhedonia. These results suggest that individual differences within cannabis users may be more important than user status per se, in predicting apathy and anhedonia with cannabis use, and that adolescent dependent users might be particularly vulnerable. Future studies should investigate which factors make some cannabis users especially vulnerable to apathy and anhedonia, in addition to age and dependence.",
