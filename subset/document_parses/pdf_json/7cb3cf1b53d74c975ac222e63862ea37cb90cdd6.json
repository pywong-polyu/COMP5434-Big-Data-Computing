            "text": "The increased democratization of the creation, implementation, and attendance of academic conferences has been a serendipitous benefit of the movement toward virtual meetings. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the transition to online conferences and, in parallel, their democratization, by necessity. This manifests not just in the mitigation of barriers to attending traditional physical conferences but also in the presentation of new, and more importantly attainable, opportunities for young scientists to carve out a niche in the landscape of academic meetings. Here, we describe an early \"proof of principle\" of this democratizing power via our experience organizing the Canadian Computational Neuroscience Spotlight (CCNS; crowdcast.io/e/CCNS), a free 2-day virtual meeting that was built entirely amid the pandemic using only virtual tools. While our experience was unique considering the obstacles faced in creating a conference during a pandemic, this was not the only factor differentiating both our experience and the resulting meeting from other contemporary online conferences. Specifically, CCNS was crafted entirely by early career researchers (ECRs) without any sponsors or partners, advertised primarily using social media and \"word of mouth,\" and designed specifically to highlight and engage trainees. From this experience, we have distilled \"10 simple rules\" as a blueprint for the design of new virtual academic meetings, especially in the absence of institutional support or partnerships, in this unprecedented environment. By highlighting the lessons learned in implementing our meeting under these arduous circumstances, we hope to encourage other young scientists to embrace this challenge, which would serve as a critical next step in further democratizing academic meetings.",

Spurred by the cancelation of the yearly Canadian Association for Neuroscience meeting, and the indefinite postponement of a planned symposium highlighting the growing computational neuroscience community in Toronto, we decided to create an entirely new meeting to fill this void left on our academic community's calendar. Starting a meeting from scratch allowed us to create something unique, rather than simply porting a physical conference into the digital space. The result was a \"trainee-focused\" meeting, considering that it is these young scientists who will likely be most affected by the loss of the presentation and networking opportunities that conferences typically provide [4] .",

During CCNS, the 4 organizers were in constant communication using instant messaging tools. All the organizers were available at a moment's notice to troubleshoot potential technical hiccups and provided constant real-time updates regarding the individual tasks to be performed. For example, using a Slack channel, the organizers were all immediately made aware of when each stage of a speaker's setup (getting them into their session, initiating screen sharing, and finally being prepared for the session to begin) was completed. This was invaluable to ensuring that the conference proceeded smoothly regardless of any \"behind the scenes\" hurdles.",

While there are a handful of viable options, we chose the Crowdcast platform (Crowdcast.io). Not only was this platform cost-effective (see further discussion on pricing below), but we also felt that it best facilitated a level of interactivity approximating that seen at a traditional conference. Some useful features of this platform included the ability to have a continuous \"chat\" alongside of the presentation, a designated space to ask questions where others could \"up-vote\" questions that they most wanted to see answered, and the availability of talk \"replays\" that were automatically generated at the end of each session. Importantly, Crowdcast allows for these replays to be hosted on their platform indefinitely for a modest fee and thus remain available to the general public; indeed, we have seen a few dozen \"late registrations\" to the conference in order to view these replays. The entire set of CCNS sessions can be found at crowdcast.io/e/CCNS. Crowdcast also gives full \"ownership\" of the content to the creator, and as such, we have downloaded raw video files of all of our sessions and will be able to make them public via an alternative hosting platform if necessary.",

Regardless of the choice, it is crucial that the organizers of any online meeting be sufficiently fluent in the intricacies of that platform. Prior to CCNS, we familiarized ourselves with Crowdcast by using it to host regular lab meetings, most of our organizing committee meetings, and multiple \"walkthroughs\" of the CCNS itinerary. This allowed us to nimbly adjust to the inevitable technical glitches that arose during the meeting itself, having seen many of them during our practice sessions. We also offered all of our prospective speakers the opportunity to do a \"test run\" of their talks directly in the Crowdcast platform. This high comfort level was vital; it was clear that our intricate understanding of Crowdcast and the fact that most speakers had seen the platform in some form prior to the meeting proper eased some of our speakers' anxieties, especially considering many of them were presenting online for the first time.",

Indeed, it is not uncommon for the combination of travel, accommodations, and registration fees to sum to thousands of dollars for large meetings. For young researchers who have yet to secure significant funding sources, or those located in areas that make travel additionally challenging, this often makes attendance at these meetings an untenable proposition [5] . Moreover, physical meetings already pose additional challenges, beyond the obvious financial ones, to those with health problems for which accessibility is a major concern [6]. Our success is further evidence that such barriers can be scaled by virtual conferences. The total costs for CCNS were limited to the short-term subscription to Crowdcast, which amounted to a few hundred dollars, allowing us to make our meeting completely free to attend; the goal of a free-to-attend meeting is likely obtainable for most online conferences at a similar scale.",

Given the amount of international engagement garnered by CCNS, we plan to improve its accessibility to the international audience by doing something in this vein in the next iteration of our meeting. Another challenge is that sufficient internet connectivity to view live content is not ubiquitous, although the ability to view talks on replay (which is more easily done with weaker internet connectivity) is one small step toward addressing this gap.",

We did this in 3 main ways: First, we began each themed session with a \"tutorial\" talk to provide an introduction to the field accessible to trainees at various levels and with various backgrounds; second, we held a panel discussion each day with our speakers in which trainees could ask questions of these speakers on a variety of topics that might not come up in a traditional conference question and answer (Q&A) period; and third, we highlighted the work of trainees by including a designated time in the conference itinerary for their presentations, rather than making these talks appear \"secondary\" by scheduling them alongside other sessions or at inconvenient times.",

Many of these occur outside of the conference proper in conversations over coffee or drinks facilitated by the critical mass of similarly minded scientists in the same location. The onus is on the organizers of future online meetings to find creative solutions for mimicking these types of interactions in the virtual setting, with the best potentially defining the conference landscape for years to come. For example, there has been considerable recent interest in emerging technologies that combine \"explorable\" computer role-playing game (CRPG)-type virtual physical environments with video-conferencing functionality, allowing naturalistic conversation between attendees when their avatars are nearby in the virtual space. Given the scientific community's capacity and appetite for technical challenges and tool development and the manifested need for new solutions to this problem, it seems reasonable to expect major developments in this area in the coming years.",

This element of conference democratization arises naturally from a variety of the features of a virtual meeting highlighted in our \"rules,\" including the ability to easily make content available for replay and include speakers who might not traditionally be spotlighted at physical meetings (due to either travel limitations or the relative lack of emphasis on trainee work). Perhaps the most important way in which this democratization can be achieved is via significantly reduced (if not eliminated) costs of attendance. On this note, it is concerning to hear of many conferences that are moving into the online setting, but not making corresponding adjustments to their fees. The academic community would be remiss if it did not seize this opportunity to make science more accessible via a significant reduction in the costs of conference attendance.",
