On March 22, Vietnam suspended entry to the country for all foreigners, and Vietnamese citizens entering Vietnam were required to isolate for 14 days. On 1 April, the Vietnamese government announced the risk of a nationwide outbreak of COVID-19 and implemented a strict national social quarantine for 15 days. The quarantine was implemented at family, village, commune, district, and provincial levels, and all people were required to stay at home, and only go out for necessary purposes such as buying food, obtaining medication, or emergencies, or for work at factories which were allowed to remain open or as essential service providers. In public areas or outside offices, schools, and hospitals, people were strictly required to wear masks, wash hands with disinfectant, maintain a minimum distance of 2 m from others, and not gather with more than one other person [3] . From mid-April to the end of July, no new cases were reported, and the country began to open up. On 25 July, the country experienced a second wave of infection in Da Nang province, when a second strict social quarantine was implemented in Da Nang. As of 7 Jan 2022, Vietnam had reported more than 2.4 million confirmed cases, more than 38 thousand deaths, and over 2.2 million recovered individuals [4] . The total number of reported cases is higher than in neighboring Laos and Cambodia, but lower than in Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia [2] .",

Many PLHIV have inconsistent income derived from domestic occupations such as housecleaning, informal employment such as servants, cleaners, and paid sex workers, involving activities that requires social interaction, and physical distancing may have directly affected their income, access to health care, and ability to afford medications [5] . Moreover, the social isolation and financial challenges resulting from physical distancing may disproportionately affect the mental health of PLHIV. One recent study of the mental health of PLHIV in China during the pandemic found a high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia [6] . Poorer mental health could in turn worsens antiretroviral (ARV) treatment adherence [5] .",

Many PLHIV do not disclose their status to their family, and quarantine within the family could result in difficult situations such as questions about medications or treatment side effects. Because many PLHIV choose to receive treatment in clinics far from home to prevent disclosure, the shutdown of public transport during quarantine could be a barrier to access to care [7] . A study in Rwanda found that less than half of ARV patients attended scheduled clinic appointments for medication refill during COVID-lockdown [8] , similar to a U.S. study which found that the percentage of PLHIV missing ARV refills increased [9] . Low treatment adherence puts PLHIV at risk of both poor viral load control with increased risk of both opportunistic infections and HIV transmission, and it is estimated that with the COVID pandemic, deaths due to HIV could increase by up to 10% in countries with high prevalence of HIV [10] .",

During quarantine, all entertainment facilities, hotels, and hostelsplaces of work for FSW-were closed, so this group in particular lost significant income. As one participant explained, Preceding the conditions imposed by COVID, finding employment was more difficult for PWID in general because methadone treatment programs mandate daily clinic visits which can interfere with job requirements, many PWID have a criminal history, and HIV status represents an additional barrier due to stigma and discrimination towards PLHIV. As one individual described, \"If [you're] using drugs, the police will inform the commune committee, so the whole commune knows, [and] it is difficult to find jobs.\" (PWID, 44 years old). Moreover, when taking methadone in combination with ARV medication, the dose of methadone must be increased. As a result, PWID may feel hot, sweat profusely, and find it extremely difficult to do manual work outside in the heat. Some resort to theft as described by one male participant: \"[I] Just go stealing, [because] no one gives money to a drug user for buying drugs, not even for buying food.\" (PWID, 45 years old). The barriers for earning an income during COVID-19 were thus compounded for PWID.",

A large proportion of PLHIV in Vietnam are employed in the informal sector [17] , where their jobs as servants, cleaners, or sex workers are dependent on social interactions with others. During the COVID-19 quarantine when social activity was reduced sharply, informal employment was affected immediately and severely, much more than office work. The MSM and TG in our study expressed more interest in and willingness to learn new skills in order to earn better incomes to cope with similar situations, while a more resigned, almost fatalistic attitude was common among PWID and FSW. Age could be a factor in this observed difference in attitude, as FSW and PWID were on average 15 years older than the MSM and TG in our sample. Research has shown that in middle adulthood, some cognitive functions (i.e., fluid intelligence, inductive reasoning, memory) begin to decline [18] which could in part explain the perceived reduced capacity to respond and adapt to unforeseen life events as described by middle-aged PWID and FSW in this study.

However, not all health facilities made these accommodations, and some study participants struggled to get around travel restrictions to access treatment. Prior to 2010, Vietnam's national HIV/AIDS treatment program received substantial financial support from international sources [23] , and PLHIV could receive ARVs for free. Since international financial support for treatment has been substantially reduced [24] , PLHIV in Vietnam must now either pay out of pocket or buy health insurance to cover the cost of HIV care. Because many PLHIV have informal employment, they must therefore buy voluntary health insurance so the loss of income due to COVID has affected their ability to buy insurance and therefore afford treatment. Even those who have health insurance from employers may still choose to buy another health insurance or pay out-of-pocket because of the fear of disclosing their HIV status if they use employer-provided insurance. Health systems have made great efforts to respond to the emergency situation caused by COVID, however, there is much room for improvement.",

In Vietnamese society, non-normative sexual orientation and gender identity are highly stigmatized [23] , and while lesbian, gay, and some bisexual individuals are not necessarily easily identified by their appearance, TG individuals are often more easily recognized, and consequently a source of amusement and targets of mockery [25, 26] . Their struggle with gender identity, other mental health issues, and the interaction between ARV and hormone treatment may result in more challenges for their treatment adherence, as has been found in several studies in the United States [27] [28] [29] [30] . Gender confirmation surgery remains illegal in Vietnam, and TG individuals cannot legally change their gender or name on identification and other legal documents [25] . Thus, their legal and economic empowerment is limited. The unique situation of TG persons, particularly within the context of Vietnamese societal attitudes towards TG individuals, limitations of public policy, and inadequate health services tailored to TG people put TG individuals at higher risk of more severe effects of emergency situations such as the COVID pandemic.",

First, due to its design, this study could not estimate the magnitude of the effects of COVID-19 pandemic in a representative sample. We used a convenience sampling strategy, so our findings may not reflect the experience of individuals who are not represented. All PWID and MSM were recruited from Nam Tu Liem OPC which may have had somewhat different responses to COVID-19 than other OPCs. All TG participants and FSW were recruited from formal peer groups. Second, the mean age of PWID and FSW groups in our sample was much older than the mean age of MSM and TG groups. It may reflect the characteristics of PLHIV in Vietnam as drug use practices have had a tendency to change from injection to oral/nasal consumption over the last decade so there are fewer new HIV infections among PWID (31) . Third, fewer young FSWs participated in peer groups compared to older FSWs, and their experience may thus be underrepresented; nonetheless, the reduction in demand for sex work during the COVID-19 quarantine may be similar for young and older FSWs. Fourth, the statistical analysis of employment status differences was affected by very small cell sizes in terms of statistical significance, and therefore the changes for the total sample and for each group should be considered primarily as trends. Finally, TG participants were reluctant to share details about obtaining ARVs from unreliable sources, and therefore this topic needs further exploration.",

Therefore, the first priory for supporting PLHIV during future public health emergencies should address income and social support in order to mitigate effects on mental health and ARV treatment. Income support should be tailored to the capacity and characteristics of each group with its respective challenges such as identity issues of TG, the limited capacity and psychological barriers of FSWs to change jobs, and the regular visits to OPCs during working hours for methadone treatment and not uncommon criminal histories for PWID. Second, national and provincial medical authorities should provide clear guidelines for healthcare facilities to support the continuum of care for PLHIV during public health emergencies, including safeguards to protect health information and HIV status. Healthcare systems must further strive to retain PLHIV in care, including developing telehealth strategies and officially including these approaches in the healthcare system. Third, beyond the healthcare system, physical distancing policies should take into account the needs of PLHIV to ensure their continuum of care as well as their confidentiality so that general public health prevention will not come at the cost of treatment adherence. Finally, given their multifaceted challenges to accessing care and treatment, future research should focus on the complex circumstances of TG individuals living with HIV, in order to develop appropriate interventions and policies for this highly vulnerable group. In the meantime, policymakers should evaluate legal and insurance requirements that represent barriers to care for TG individuals, strengthen community-based organizations that support TG, and institute a public campaign to provide more knowledge about the TG population to tackle stigma and discrimination toward this population.",

One participant described their identity issues as follows: I think I am multi-sexual. Sometimes, I want to be female, sometimes not. I feel that there are several persons living inside me. I experienced episodes of depression\u2026 depending on my mood and the weather, then I change accordingly. (TG individual, 20 years old).",

As one young TG individual explained, To be able to receive health services in Hanoi under health insurance, I have to register my temporary accommodation with the local police in Hanoi. When I went to the local police, they said it takes a very long time to register accommodation, and if I want to speed it up, I would have to pay money. So I don't buy health insurance.
