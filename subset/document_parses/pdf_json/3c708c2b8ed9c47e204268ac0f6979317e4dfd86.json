            "text": "Single stranded RNA viruses were known to cause variety of diseases since many years and are gaining much importance due to pandemic after the identification of a novel corona virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)). Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to infect humans and they are OC43 CoV, NL63 CoV, HKU1 CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome, SARS CoV, and SARS CoV-2. Virus replication weakens the immune system of host thereby altering T-cell count and much of interferon response. Although no vaccine or therapeutic treatment has been approved till now for CoV infection, trials of vaccine against SARS CoV-2 are in progress. One of the epitopes used for vaccine production is of the spike protein on the surface of virus. The work focuses on designing of multi-epitope vaccine construct for treatment of seven human CoV infections using the epitopes present on the spike protein of human CoVs. To address this, immunoinformatics techniques have been employed to design multi-epitope vaccine construct. B-and T-cell epitopes of the spike proteins have been predicted and designed into a multi-epitope vaccine construct. The tertiary structure of the vaccine construct along with the adjuvant has been modelled and the physiochemical properties have been predicted. The multi-epitope vaccine construct has antigenic and non-allergenic property. After validation, refinement and disulphide engineering of the vaccine construct, molecular docking with toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been performed. Molecular dynamics simulation in aqueous environment predicted that the vaccine-TLRs complexes were stable. The vaccine construct is predicted to be able to trigger primary immune response in silico.",

            "text": "Coronavirus (CoV) belong to large and enveloped subfamily viruses contain sense single strand RNA that are categorized into four genera namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, among them alpha-and beta-CoVs known to infect humans (Yi et al., 2020) . Seven different types of corona virus that infect humans of alpha CoVs includes 229E and NL63; and beta-CoVs includes OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 (Waleed, 2020) . S, M, N, structural proteins are encoded by genome of CoV and are common for all types of virus whereas E proteins are encoded in human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and HCoV-NL63 genome, while HE protein is encoded by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 genome apart from structural proteins. The spike (S) protein mediates receptor-binding and fusion with the host cell membrane. The membrane (M) protein plays an important role in viral assembly. The nucleocapsid protein (N) regulates viral RNA synthesis, and may interact with M protein during virus budding. The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein found only in the beta-CoVs and hemagglutinin moiety binds to neuraminic acid on the host cell surface thereby permitting initial adsorption of virus to the membrane. HCoV-229E genome consists of 27,317 bases that infects humans and bats (Lim et al., 2016) . Along with HCoV-OC43, it causes common cold (Gaunt et al., 2010) . HCoV-229E is associated with a range of respiratory symptoms, ranging from the common cold to pneumonia, HCoV-229E encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope I, membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). HCoV-NL63, a member of Coronaviridae is large-envelope virus of positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of $27,553 bases in length that contains a cap structure at its 5 0 end and a poly (A) tail at its 3 0 end. The genome consists of 5 0 and 3 0 noncoding regions (NCRs), and the genes encodes for four structural proteins namely spike (S), envelope I, membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Kim et al., 2018) . The HCoV-OC43 genome encompasses 30,738 nucleotides of which 5 0 two-thirds of the genome consists of two large replicase open reading frames (ORFs) and 3 0 end includes several structural and accessory protein genes: an envelope-associated HE glycoprotein gene, a spike (S) glycoprotein gene; an envelope I protein gene; a matrix (M) glycoprotein gene; and a nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein gene (Vijgen et al., 2005) . The genome of CoV-HKU1 is 29,926 nucleotides; polyadenylated RNA with GC content is 32%, which is lowest among all known coronaviruses. The genome organization is with the characteristic gene order 5 0 -replicase, spike (S), envelope I, and membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N)-3 0 . Both 5 0 and 3 0 ends contain short untranslated regions (UTRs). The 5 0 end of the genome consists of a putative 5 0 leader sequence (Woo et al., 2005) . The first imported MERS-CoV strain was named ChinaGD01 and 30,114 nucleotide long, including the 3 0 and 5 0 UTRs (Lu, 2015) . The genome structure is a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) encoding replicase polyproteins (ORFs 1ab and 1a), structural proteins (E, N, and M), a surface (spike) glycoprotein (S), and sulphidral proteins (ORFs 3, 4a, 4 b, and 5) (Mackay & Arden, 2015) . MERS-CoV has been assumed to be transmitted from bats and spread to humans through intermediate hosts (Coleman & Frieman, 2014) . SARS genome contains 29,751 bases with 5 0 cap structure and 3 0 polyadenylation tract. This complex then associates with the M protein in the membranes of the ER, and virus particles form as the nucleocapsid complex buds into the lumen of the ER (Marra et al., 2003) . The single-stranded RNA genome of the SARS CoV-2 was 29,891 nucleotides in size, contains two flanking UTRs and a single long ORF encoding a polyprotein, it is arranged in order of 5 0 -replicase (orf1/ab)-structural proteins (Spike (S)-Envelope I-Membrane (M)-Nucleocapsid (N))-3 0 and lacks the HE gene (Chan et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Studies revealed that several viral structural proteins such as small envelope I, membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) play important roles in SARS infection (Simmons et al., 2004) . The 180-kDa spike protein plays a central role in the host cell attachment and entry processes and comprised of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, N-terminal domain, and receptor-binding domain, while the S2 subunit contains a fusion peptide, heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain I, and cytoplasmic domain (CP) (Chan et al., 2020) . Coronavirus S proteins contain short amino-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence motifs (von Heijne, 1984) . Although some coronavirus spike proteins cleaved between the S1 and S2 regions as part of activation process, unlike SARS-CoV spike not cleaved before, internalized inside the host (Xiao et al., 2003) . The more variable amino-terminal region of the spike protein (S1) seems to contain the receptor-binding activity (Wong et al., 2004) . The more conserved S2 region contains the transmembrane anchor, palmitic acid acylation site (Thorp et al., 2006 ) that is important for membrane fusion (McBride & Machamer, 2010) , and the coiled-coil fusion motor domain (Bosch et al., 2003) . High-resolution X-ray crystallography structures obtained for coronavirus spike protein reveals SARS-CoV in conjunction with angiotensin-I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (PDB ID: 3D0G, 3D0H, 3D0I, 6ACC, 6ACD) a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003) and HCoV-NL63 (Hofmann et al., 2005) (PDB ID: 3KBH). Image analysis of cryoelectron micrographs of SARS-CoV (Beniac et al., 2006) and other coronaviruses (Neuman et al., 2006) confirms that spikes exist as a homotrimer in the native perfusion state on virion-and protein-mediated fusion to its receptor-binding triggers conformational changes including disulphide reshuffling (Lavillette et al., 2006) . Spike protein is incorporated into virion through interactions with the membrane protein M (Godeke et al., 2000) . There are different kinds of receptors for different virus for effective binding to its host. 229E virus enters the host cell by binding to the aminopeptidase N receptor (Fehr & Perlman, 2015) . NL63 virus enters its host cell by the ACE2 receptor (Brielle et al., 2020) . OC43 virus enters its host cell by binding to the N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid receptor (Li, 2016) . HKU1 virus enters its host cell by binding to the N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid receptor (Lim et al., 2016) . MERS-CoV virus enters host cell by binding to the DPP4 receptor (Fehr & Perlman, 2015) . SARS CoV virus infects the epithelial cells within the lungs and enters the host cell by binding to ACE2 (Ge et al., 2013) . SARS CoV-2 virus enters the human cells by binding to ACE2 receptor (Letko et al., 2020) .",

Each predicted epitope is given a score known as Protrusion Index value by the server. Maximum score is 1 and higher the score better is the predicted epitope. For each protein, a number of epitope has been predicted. For cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte (CTL) epitope prediction NetCTL 1.2 webserver was used (Larsen et al., 2007) . This server predicts the MHC-I-binding epitopes by using neural network algorithm. The server gives a score based on predicted MHC Class I-binding affinity, proteosomal C terminal cleavage and TAP transport efficiency. Higher score indicates high specificity of the epitopes towards MHC-I. The epitope with score >3 was further analysed. Helper T-cell lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes were predicted in IEDB webserver (Wang et al., 2010) . The server predicted the MHC-II-binding epitopes using IEDB recommended consensus approach.

The server gives a percentile rank to the predicted epitopes. Lower rank indicates good binders. Hence, the epitopes with percentile rank of <1 were further analysed for their ability to induce IFN-c production by using the IFNepitope server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/ifnepitope/).

The complex was found to be stable after that. The average RMSD of this complex was 0.5 \u00c5 which is higher than all other complexes. The RMSF of vaccine construct showed that the N-terminal residues and the residues between 40 and 65 positions have highest movement ( Figure 5(B) ). The N-terminal of the vaccine construct (residue 1-121) consists of the adjuvant and is involved in interaction with TLRs. However, when the vaccine construct is bound to the TLRs, the RMSF of the highest fluctuating residues of the construct has decreased. This can be due to interaction with TLRs. Radius of gyration of vaccine construct after 30 ns simulation was calculated to be 45.74 nm. However, the radius of gyration of vaccine-construct-TLR complexes ranged between 29.47 and 35.67 nm.

MERS CoV outbreak was seen in 2003, SARS CoV Other HCoVs, 229E, NLC3, OC43, and KU1 causes mild respiratory symptoms but 229E and KU1 is also known to cause pneumonia. Until the outbreak of SARS CoV-2, there is no approved treatment for any of the HCoV infection. After the outbreak of SARS CoV-2, researchers are trying to develop vaccine against SARS CoV-2. B-cell, CTL, and HTL epitopes are used as antigenic determinants for efficient vaccine production had much focused on spike (S) protein, which is gaining much attention in research. Here in this paper we had focused on antigenic determinants on the Sprotein of HCoVs and their use as effective vaccine candidates through in silico approach. Sequence comparison of S- proteins of human corona viruses shows similarity towards the C-terminal end. However, tertiary structure shows a similar Y-shaped conformation of the S-proteins. To get insights and details about various antigenic determinants of S-proteins of virus different lengths of B-cell epitopes were predicted using ElliPro server. CTL epitopes were predicted using NetCTL 1.2 server and HTL epitopes were predicted using IEDB server. The HTL epitopes were checked for their ability to produce IFN-c using IFN epitope server. HTL epitopes predicted for HCoVs 229E and KU1 didn't have the ability to produce IFN-c. All the predicted epitopes were further checked for allergenic, immunogenic, and toxic properties. The high-scoring epitopes (as per the servers) with antigenic, non-allergenic, and non-toxic properties were selected for vaccine construct designing. Multi-epitope vaccine construct was designed by linking the selected B-cell and HTL epitopes with GPGPG linkage. The CTL epitopes were linked by AAY linkers. 50S ribosomal protein, which is a TLR4 agonist is used as an adjuvant and linked to the N-terminus with EAAAK linkage .Also, for ease of protein purification, 6\u00c2 His tag is added at C-terminus, thus yielding a final construct of 1189 amino acids. Immunogenic properties such as antigenic and allergic predictions performed using VaxiJen v2.0 and AllerTOP v.2 server indicates designed vaccine construct is antigenic and non-allergic in nature.",

The stability of the TLR-vaccine construct complexes were checked by performing a 30 ns molecular dynamics simulation in GROMACS 4.6.5 software package. CHARMM force field and SPC/E water model was chosen for molecular dynamics simulation. The average RMSD of the vaccine construct alone was 0.08 \u00c5. Upon binding to TLRs, the average RMSD of the vaccine construct increased. The vaccine construct-TLR complexes were found to be stable. TLR4-vaccine construct complex showed fluctuation at 3 ns. After 3 ns, there was no major fluctuation in the RMSD profile of TLR4-vaccine construct complex. RMSF profile of the vaccine construct showed the presence of two highly fluctuating regions.

The outbreak of MERS and SARS CoV caused severe damage to some countries but till date no vaccine or treatment has been approved. The present outbreak of SARS CoV-2 has triggered the importance of vaccine. Thus, in this work, we have employed immuneinformatics tools to design multi-epitope vaccine construct against the S-protein of seven HCoVs. The S-protein is the medium by which the viral genome transfers to human cells. Thus, the vaccine construct designed is expected to trigger host immune system to generate antibodies against the Sprotein epitope and restrict the entry of viral genome to host cells. This multi-epitope vaccine may help in boosting the host immune system against seven HCoVs.",
