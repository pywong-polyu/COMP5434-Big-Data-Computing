This rising violence reinforces the importance of intersectionality for understanding systemic racism. Racial and ethnic inequalities in health are now understood within the context of racism intersecting with other forms of social marginalization [6] . Racism and its effects can differ within social characteristics such as sex (e.g., physical violence is more likely against men, and sexual violence more likely against women). Aggregated marginalization (sexuality, gender, disability, social class, religion, race/ethnicity) compounds differential risk for adverse social exposures and structural conditions. Hence systemic racism is intersectional. We must recognize social oppressions are interconnected, linked by power dynamics and maintained by social stratification [6] .",

It also reduces access, impairs environmental conditions, and restricts opportunities for social mobility. Chronic exposure to social and economic disadvantage can lead to premature cellular aging through increased allostatic load and compromised immunity [7] . Racism also increases risk for \"toxic stressors\" \u00c0which includes violence exposures, family and community instability and conflict, forced institutionalizations (incarceration), and poverty-across life stages. These toxic stressors combined with inadequate support negatively impact health and development [8] . Simultaneously, health systems contend with institutional racism. Health institutions maintain under-representation of certain groups, such as Blacks and Hispanics, among physicians and specialists, and over-representation of these in highly burdened and lower paid front-line providers such as nursing aids and technicians. Equitable professional development and advancement opportunities are not prioritized at an institutional level [9] . Consequently, decision-makers in health care are less likely to be people of color, and this may in part explain why we see greater distrust and under-utilization of health care services [10] .",

Primary strategies for measuring racism include self-reported experiences of discrimination and capturing racism as a social stressor. These strategies limit our understanding to internalized and interpersonal racism, not systemic racism. In order to improve our understanding of systemic racism and its health impacts, we must: (1)Measure the broader scope of systemic racism pathways -economic, environmental, and political injustice; inadequate health care; violence and trauma; and state-sanctioned violence; [2] (2)Measure perceived social norms related to the acceptability of racism and stereotyping the operationalization of norms in institutions, such as police or healthcare; (3)Develop and use measures to capture diversity and intersectionality. Incorporate nuanced metrics of racism, such as migration and citizenship, intergenerational effects, and period-specific (e.g., post-hate crime) contexts; (4) Create equitable research partnerships with communities most negatively impacted by systemic racism.",
