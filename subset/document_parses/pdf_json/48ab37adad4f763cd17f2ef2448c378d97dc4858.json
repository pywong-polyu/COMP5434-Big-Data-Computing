Here we elucidate the molecular mechanism of these drugs by combining experiments and simulations. In vitro assays confirm the hypothesis that both drugs act by inhibiting the human protein TMPRSS2. As no experimental structure is available, we provide a model of the TMPRSS2 equilibrium structure and its fluctuations by relaxing an initial homology structure with extensive 280 microseconds of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) and Markov modeling. We describe the binding mode of both drugs with TMPRSS2 in a Michaelis complex (MC) state preceding the formation of a long-lived covalent inhibitory state. We find that nafamostat to has a higher MC population, which in turn leads to the more frequent formation of the covalent complex and thus higher inhibition efficacy, as confirmed in vitro and consistent with previous virus cell entry assays. Our TMPRSS2-drug structures are made public to guide the design of more potent and specific inhibitors. S1",

Together with its activation, the binding of S-protein to ACE2 [11] , triggers the cell-entry process [12] .

This approach provides an ensemble of equilibrium structures of the protein-drug com- plex and also drug binding kinetics.

We then measured the protease activity of the transfected cells using the fluorogenic peptide substrate BOC-QAR-AMC, following incubation of the cell with increasing inhibitor concentrations. Peptide-digestion induced a minimal increase in fluorescent signal in control cells without exogenous TMPRSS2 expression (unnormalized mean enzyme activity = 2.4), while TM-PRSS2 over-expression resulted in a much faster peptide digestion (normalized mean enzyme activity = 12.8). Therefore, our assay is mostly specific for TM-PRSS2 [19] . Significantly lower enzyme activity at higher drug concentrations can thus be attributed to TMPRSS2 inhibition.",

In contrast to peptide catalysis, the drug's guanidinobenzoyl group stays covalently linked to the catalytic serine with a small off-rate, rendering it an effective chemical inhibitor [35] . In our MD simulations, we sample different conformations of the complex formed by the enzyme and each of the drugs, and we can thus elucidate how they bind and how specificity (or lack thereof) arises before the catalytic step.

Interestingly, in this inverted orientation of nafamostat, the guanidinium head mainly interacts with Glu299, with the drug reactive center slightly displaced from the oxyanion hole, while the other orientation keeps the amidinium head mainly nearby Val280, with the ester center well positioned for the reaction. This observation is in agreement with several crystal structures of acylenzyme intermediates between different trypsins and guanidinobenzoyl molecules bound to the S1 pocket (e.g. PDBs 2AH4 [36] , 3DFL [37] , 1GBT [38] ).

Moreover, we note that the k cat of acylation of these drugs may depend on their leaving group pKa's. Indeed, leaving groups with a low pKa will require less assistance from acid catalysis and will be easily displaced by the nucleophilic serine, favoring the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. We expect the leaving group of nafamostat to have a lower pKa than the one of camostat, following the values of similar molecules such as naphtol (9.57 [39] ) and 4methylphenol (10.26 [40] ), respectively. This suggests that the k cat of acylation will be also slightly faster for nafamostat, further contributing to its superior inhibition of TMPRSS2.",
