To date, several vaccines have received approval by the regulating authorities and are being rolled-out in most countries (including South Arica) as a strategy to end the global pandemic. While experts agree that large scale vaccination of populations is the best strategy to gain control of the pandemic through sufficient 'herd immunity', convincing citizens that vaccines are safe, effective and necessary is an essential component to any effective vaccination programme.",

            "text": "Vaccine hesitancy refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite its availability, and has been encountered since the invention of vaccines in 1796 by Edward Jenner [1] . Alarmingly, this has not diminished with growing scientific sophistication and improved education. The World Health Organisation strategic advisory group of experts (SAGE) on vaccines, produced a report on vaccine hesitancy in 2014. It categorised reasons for vaccine hesitancy into three groups: confidence (trust in healthcare professionals, vaccines, and their effectiveness), complacency (low awareness of the risks of vaccine preventable diseases and the importance of vaccine) and convenience (availability of and accessibility to vaccines and healthcare services) [2] . The role of healthcare workers (HCWs) in instilling confidence in the general population about vaccine safety and efficacy has been documented in previous studies [2, 3] . Evidence suggests a strong link between vaccine hesitancy among HCWs and the general population. The HCWs with positive attitudes to, and more knowledge regarding vaccines, produce higher vaccination rates in their patients [4] .",

Out of the South Africans surveyed (approximately 500 participants), only 64% reported that they would agree to get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, being the fifth lowest vaccine acceptance of the 27 countries sampled [5] . Of concern is that the reported acceptance of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among HCWs was largely below this global average; ranging from 27% in the Democratic Republic of Congo to 75% in France [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Reasons for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy among HCWs included concerns regarding the expedited vaccine development, political interference, current political climates, and concerns regarding serious side effects despite proven safety and efficacy [11] . Certain demographic factors were found to be associated with higher rates of vaccine acceptance among HCWs: male sex, older age, higher level of education, physicians, pharmacists, frontline HCWs and having previous vaccination for seasonal influenza. In addition, perceived individual vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 due to co-morbidities and/or high virus exposure within the workplace positively influenced vaccine acceptance [7, 10, 12] .",

Health care workers have suffered high infection rates, especially in the Eastern Cape province, with 11,262 HCWs infected and 262 deaths by the 18 February 2021 [13] . Getting good buy-in and close to 100% vaccine coverage of the HCW populations is imperative in the region. Beside the promise of high HCW vaccination uptake reversing the negative impact of COVID-19 disease on health services, its potential positive knock-on effect on the success of the mass roll-out of vaccines for the general population makes it compelling. However, there is currently no published data on the perceptions and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among HCWs in South Africa, which this study sought to address. Therefore, this study assesses the risk perceptions, level of acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and further, examines the influencing factors of vaccine hesitancy among the HCWs in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.",

All staff were given an opportunity to participate in the study over a period of six weeks between November and December 2020. This study adopted a multi-stage cluster sampling technique in order to ensure a representative sample of HCWs recruited across the various domains within the hospitals. In order to ensure inclusivity, exposure areas were pre-defined as clusters in accordance with the risk assessment by Iversen et al. as high risk (Accident and Emergency unit, acute respiratory (person under investigation/COVID- 19) wards and intensive care units (ICU)); Intermediate risk (non-respiratory admission wards, outpatient departments (OPDs) and other clinical areas) and low risk (administrative offices and other non-clinical areas) [16] . Participants were then conveniently sampled within each cluster, with voluntary participation. In addition, a proportionate sample of the various professional categories was recruited. In order to avoid time variations in the main outcome measure between the two hospitals, participants were recruited concurrently. Four research assistants and two research nurses who were proficient in English and IsiXhosa (local language), were trained for two days and were allocated to a study site.",

Vaccine acceptance was significantly higher in HCWs with tertiary education in this study. While there was no significant difference between any professional category of workers, education level was a major factor.

This is in contrast to other studies that have reported higher vaccine acceptance with HCWs who were male, of older age and with co-morbid illnesses [7, 10, 12] . Unsurprisingly, HCWs' overall vaccine beliefs significantly correlated with their willingness to accept SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The belief that vaccines are needed to end the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reflects a broader understanding that vaccination is important on a population level. The belief that all HCWs should receive the vaccine reflects an understanding of the importance of protecting HCWs as a high-risk group. Individuals' confidence in vaccinations in general was measured by asking whether vaccines were considered generally safe, which also correlated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine acceptance.",

Hence, these results need to be interpreted in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine information that was available at that time. With the rapid vaccine development and deployment globally to date, as well as subsequent concerns raised by regulatory bodies over rare but severe adverse events such as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia (VITT), an individual's perception of vaccine safety may change daily [28] . More so, there is emerging evidence that the South African variants of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.351) have some resistance to neutralisation by convalescent plasma and certain vaccines [29, 30] . This information may further erode the confidence in vaccines and thus, negatively impact the level of acceptance of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines at the population level. Future studies could potentially explore how the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 influence the level of acceptance of the vaccines against the virus.",

Vaccines routinely offered to adult HCWs in the South African state sector are Hepatitis B and an annual influenza vaccination, but these are voluntary. Having experienced adverse events from vaccines in the past also correlated with vaccine refusal in this study. These two vaccine questions gave some insight into the reasons for HCWs' vaccine refusal in this context. Rather than specific concerns with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine safety, efficacy or need, this sub-group appears to have a general distrust or fear of vaccines, partly informed by past vaccine adverse events. Adverse effects of vaccines have been reported previously to lead to vaccine refusal [31, 32] .",

The first two are strongly rooted in an individual's cultural and religious beliefs, and informed by their level of education, and access to scientifically sound information. South Africa has a strong emphasis on human rights, and the health minister has emphasised that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination will be entirely voluntary. However, the success of the country's ambitious vaccination programme, depends on high levels of uptake of the vaccine by eligible citizens to achieve herd immunity. This is particularly crucial among HCWs, who are both at high risk of infection, as well as being an essential work-force in the COVID-19 response. Positive attitudes toward vaccination amongst HCWs will result in higher uptake amongst the general public. While the high levels of acceptance in this survey were encouraging, the almost 10% who did not plan to get vaccinated need to be engaged and their concerns addressed for the success of the national programme.",

In addition, the binary nature (yes/no) of the main outcome (vaccine acceptance) did not allow for better understanding of the timing of acceptance of the vaccine. While the majority of the staff will probably accept the vaccine immediately whenever it becomes available others might choose to defer till more people have received the vaccine in the country. Perhaps, a five-point Likert scale showing varying degrees of opinions on vaccine acceptance would have shed more light on the overall perceptions and attitudes of the staff. Though, the investigators provided extended access to all eligible participants, the potential bias due to the convenience sampling and voluntary participation of the HCWs cannot be ignored. Notwithstanding the limitations, the findings are reassuring that HCWs were willing to accept and recommend the vaccine to other HCWs. The staff who chose not to accept the vaccine need further engagement targeting their fears about adverse events and myths surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. It should also be noted that this study was implemented in November and December 2020 prior to the roll-out of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in South Africa. Therefore, uptake of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by the HCWs should be monitored in light of the findings reported in this study.",
