Systematic tests where the performance of alternative physico-chemical disinfection methods is systematically compared and optimized must be based on reliable protocols. These protocol are currently not adequately addressing the neutralization related issues: the neutralization of the tested disinfectant after specified conditions of concentration and contact time (CT) is necessary to prevent continued disinfection after the intended contact time; moreover such neutralization is often necessary in practice and on a large scale to prevent adverse health and ecological impacts from remaining disinfectant after the target CT is achieved. Few studies adequately assess the extent of neutralization of the chemical disinfectant and are intended to optimize on-site disinfection practices for waste matrices posing high microbial risks. Hence, there is a need for effective and reproducible neutralization protocols in chemical disinfection trials and practice. Furthermore, for most of chemical disinfectants used in healthcare settings there is no practical methodology to reliably and conveniently measure the residual disinfectant concentration after its neutralization and also determine the optimum concentration of the neutralizer. Because some neutralizing compounds can themselves be toxic to the test microorganisms, it is necessary to optimize neutralization procedures in disinfection experiments for the development of infection control practices using accepted positive control microbes. In the presented work, a stepwise bioassay-based protocol using representative faecal indicator microbes is described for optimizing chemical disinfection and subsequent disinfectant neutralization of any infectious faecal waste matrix.

Such chemical neutralization of disinfectant chemicals in disinfection experiments is standard practice to allow for reliable culture based assays of faecal indicator bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis (APHA, 2010a; c)) as bacterial pathogen surrogates, bacteriophages such as somatic coliphages (APHA, 2010d; Gall et al., 2016) , FRNA phages (Shahrampour et al., 2015) , Bacteroides phages (Ebdon et al., 2012) , and bacteriophage \u03c66 (Casanova and Weaver, 2015b) (Casanova and Weaver, 2015a) as virus pathogen surrogates in complex sewage and faecal waste matrices. Failure to achieve adequate chemical neutralization of the disinfectant used in an experiment can result in flawed disinfection kinetics estimates based on CT conditions because inactivation could continue after the experiment is completed due to variable and unknown remaining concentrations of the disinfectant or its biocidal by-products. Such overestimation may result in flawed disinfection protocols that produce inaccurate disinfection kinetics.

After attempted neutralization, residual disinfectant may be present at low concentrations and be active, unless the chemical agents or its antimicrobial effects are shown to be absent. Therefore, it is necessary to reliably assess neutralization efficacy of the disinfectant and determine the minimum required amount of neutralizer to assure absence of the disinfectant at the end of the specified contact time (T).

The presented work aims to provide a reliable but simple method to determine if a chemical disinfectant in a complex faecal matrix is neutralized adequately by using a bioassay procedure that documents the culturability of target microbes. The described protocol aims to ensure that adequate neutralization of the disinfectant is achieved, so that it does not interfere with subsequent culture-based microbial analysis of the processed sample. The use of bacterial and viral indicator organisms spiked into pasteurized or autoclaved wastewater is preferred to the use of naturally occurring organisms in waste matrix samples for two reasons. First, the use of non-pathogenic indicators protects the health and safety of laboratory researchers. Second, the use of culturable indicator organisms enables high initial titers to be used, simplifying the process of quantifying disinfection performance and subsequent chemical neutralization of the disinfectant, based on quantifiable microbial levels (i.e. counts higher, therefore statistically more significant and ultimately more accurate).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The need for standard protocols to compare available disinfection methods"}, {"text": "There are few reported studies that evaluate the impact of neutralizing agents on the survival of faecal indicator microorganisms and in some the neutralizing compounds show antimicrobial properties (Lyon et al., 2012) .

Here a brief explanation of the rationale of our final choice. Recent years have shown emerging numbers of outbreaks associated with enveloped viruses such as Ebola virus (Baize et al., 2014) , Coronaviruses such as SARS (Hsieh et al., 2004) or viruses associated with the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (Haagmans et al., 2014) . Their high persistence towards disinfection methods coupled with their low infectious dose and high numbers of infectious viruses excreted with human waste lead required biosafety facilities of levels 3 or 4 to safely handle them. Therefore, enveloped bacteriophages \u03c66 (Vidaver et al., 1973) are currently discussed as suitable surrogates due to several of their advantageous characteristics such as the non-human pathogenic nature of both \u03c66 and P. syringae, their bacterial host (Wei et al., 2009 ) which allows their handling under bio safety level 1 (equivalent to minimal containment) (Gallandat and Lantagne, 2017) . In addition, \u03c66 is easily cultivated, can be analysed rapidly using established culture techniques such as plaque assays and iscompared to other enveloped bacteriophages of the family Cystoviridae (Mindich et al., 1999) well described and characterized in literature (Laurinavicius et al., 2004) . Still, a recent study by de Carvalho et al.

Microbial growth or viral infectivity was not precisely quantified, especially when high numbers of colonies or plaques were observed. The semi-quantitative classification of assay plates based on the observable extent of microbial growth/inhibition in the neutralized control plates and neutralized disinfected plates is shown in Table 1 . Assessment was performed by comparing each plate representing the neutralized sample to an equivalent control (bacterial or viral) plate on which a replicate aliquot of the same bacterial (or viral) suspension at the same titer was inoculated on the same type of agar, but to which no disinfectant was added and therefore, giving optimal bacterial or viral growth. The incubated plates were then compared, and the results scored using the operational definitions described in Table 1 . After obtaining confirmatory results for two sets of trials using bacterial indicators, \u03c66 as a viral indicator was introduced to confirm these results. The indicator virus was chosen due to its structural and behavioural similarities to high risk enveloped viruses such as Ebolavirus and Avian influenza virus, and was prepared as described by Casanova and Weaver (2015a) . After the neutralizer was added to the disinfectant and the virus stock was spiked into the mixture, the sample was plated using the double agar layer (DAL) method modified from US EPA Method 1602 (EPA, 2001) .
