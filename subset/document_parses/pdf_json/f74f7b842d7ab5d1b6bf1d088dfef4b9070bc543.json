In such settings, preventive health initiatives are limited, and healthcare systems may be poorly prepared to meet this challenge [2, 3] . Similar to other LMICs, injuries are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Nepal. The estimated proportion of deaths due to injury in Nepal increased from 6.31% to 9.21% between 1990 and 2017 [4] . The injury mortality rate was estimated at 59 per 100,000 population in 2017, doubling the rate calculated from the 2001 Nepal census (30 per 100,000 population) [5] . Young and middle-aged adults experience a greater burden of injuries than other age groups, and there will be more young and middle-aged adults with disabilities secondary to injury in the future [6] .",

In Nepal, the total costs of RTIs alone were estimated at USD 122.88 million, which is equivalent to 1.52% of the gross national product [10] . Injury prevention is relatively new to the public health agenda for Nepal, and the burden of injuries is not well quantified, with most of the literature reporting small hospital case series [11] . Sources of routine injury data collection are also limited [12] . Therefore, there is little evidence to understand the actual burden of injury, the associated risk factors, or the populations at risk.",

Cases included in the study were people who had sustained any new injury presenting to either of the two study hospitals within seven days of the injury event. Injury cases with repeated attendance in the same hospital for the same injury, previous attendance in the other study hospital for the same injury, and hospital attendance for an injury that occurred more than seven days prior to presentation were excluded. The respondent could be the injured person or, if the injured person were unconscious, dead, or under 18 years of age, a family member or caregiver.",

Data included the demographics of the patient and details of the injury event and outcome (date of injury, place of occurrence, activity at the time of injury, mechanism causing the injury, severity of the injury, and disposition). The injury severity was classified as 'minor' (superficial injury such as bruises or cuts), 'moderate' (injures requiring skilled treatment), or 'severe' (injures requiring intensive management), depending on the level of requirement for skilled emergency care intervention. A standardised data collection form was developed from existing tools [13, 23, 24] , adapted for the Nepal context, and piloted prior to data collection.

These factors are likely to contribute to why road traffic injuries were the leading cause of ED attendance in our study. A similar hospital-based injury surveillance study conducted in India reported that more than half of the patients admitted to the ED had road traffic injuries [17] . In line with the findings of our study, the Indian study also reported that the majority of the victims of road traffic injuries were young men aged 25-44 years. Our data support action to reduce road traffic injuries and suggest that targeting road safety interventions towards young men in Nepal may be appropriate.",

Snakebites are more common in warmer and wetter months, particularly in terai (plains) regions [35] . Stray dogs are very common in Nepal, and rabies is endemic. About 35,000 animal bites were reported through the Hospital Management Information System in 2017/18, of which 33,000 (94%) were dog bites [36] . These factors may explain why animal/insect-related injuries were the third leading injury cause of attendance in our study, accounting for 20% (1293/6434) of the total unintentional injuries. We found that more than half (52%, n = 673) of the animal/insect-related injuries in our study were dog bites. The ready availability of the anti-rabies vaccine at Hetauda Hospital may account for the high number of attendances recorded. Our data suggest the need for public awareness campaigns on the prevention of dog bites and multi-agency rabies prevention programmes.",

Of these self-harm deaths, 31.6% (24/76) were caused by poisoning, 65.8% (50/76) by hanging, and 2.6% (2/76) by other mechanisms. Our results support those from an earlier scoping review that reported higher rates of self-harm and suicide among women and younger age groups [37] .

Clinical staff record basic information about patients, such as the reason for attendance and disposition, on a paper-based ED register-no electronic record system is available. In our study, the number of injury cases collected by the data collectors was more than that recorded in the hospital ED registers. This was because the clinical staff were so busy that they did not have time to record all attendances in the register. Therefore, our study provided a more complete record of injuries than previously available, and suggests that retrospective studies relying on ED register data may miss injury cases presenting to hospitals. Collecting data electronically enabled us to monitor the quality of data on a daily basis and provide immediate feedback to the data collectors. Consequently, the data quality was maintained throughout the study period, which improved the validity and utility of the results.",

These findings may assist hospitals to better understand the type and severity of injury patients they are treating, and may therefore inform training for clinical teams and inform the resources they need. Local government may also find such data valuable when deciding on the local allocation of funding to improve health in the local community, by raising awareness of injury risks or reducing exposure to injury hazards. The process evaluation suggests that rich injury data can be collected, but this is dependent on having dedicated data collectors in Eds, as existing staff do not have the capacity to capture the additional information.
