The momentum to address NTDs has increased in the past 2 decades due to several factors including advocacy for new approaches to control and eliminate these diseases, increased commitment from pharmaceutical donors to provide drugs, renewed governments' commitment, and the recognition that these diseases should be addressed as part of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) agenda where they are considered as \"other diseases\" of MDG [2] .",

Lebanon has experienced several NTDs with different epidemiological characteristics. Some are endemic and mandatorily reportable to the LMPH [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , while others are mainly imported from other countries. Though it is a small country, Lebanon accommodates large numbers of refugees and migrant workers. The 2011 Syrian crisis has led to an influx of Syrian refugees into the country. They resided in several unorganized settlements without appropriate infrastructure [9, 10] . Additionally, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, originating from Africa and Asia, are registered in the country; however, it is believed many more are working without valid registration [11] . The Lebanese diaspora is almost as twice the number of populations of residing in Lebanon and is distributed throughout the continents, in various areas known to be endemic for certain NTDs [12] . The recent economic crisis and the severe devaluation of the Lebanese currency that followed political unrest stemming from the popular October 17, 2019, uprising have forced more people to seek job opportunities outside the country [13, 14] .",

As of 2013, the year that marked the eruption of the Syrian crisis and the influx of refugees to Lebanon, the country witnessed its first leishmaniasis outbreak (Fig. 3) . The most significant risk factor for the spread of leishmaniasis is war as it results in population displacement and clustering leading to increased exposure [8] . The spread of leishmaniasis is also influenced by poor nutrition, socioeconomic status, and environmental changes [44] . Syria is the country with the highest prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the MENA region [45] . More than 6.5 million Syrians were displaced after the Syrian civil war facilitating the spread of leishmaniasis to neighboring countries including Lebanon, Iraq, and Turkey [46] . As of January 2019, an estimated number of 1.5 million Syrian refugees are present in Lebanon (Fig. 4) [47] . The most recent data posted on LMPH website show 263 cases of CL imported from Syria, with no evidence of local transmission (Fig. 1) . It also reveals that the distribution of cases has been mostly in regions closer to the Syrian border mainly Beqaa and North Lebanon, the two poorest areas in the country with underdeveloped sanitary infrastructure [8, 48, 49] Leprosy Lebanon is a country with very low prevalence of leprosy at less than 0.1 per 100 000 population [50] . In Lebanon, cases are mainly distributed in Akkar and Mount Lebanon [51] . Akkar is considered one of the poorest and underdeveloped areas in North Lebanon, and Mount Lebanon, despite its high socioeconomic standard, is the most densely populated area. Leprosy is likely to be under-diagnosed due to lack of knowledge and awareness among healthcare workers mainly in countries with very low prevalence. Only a few physicians are trained to recognize the typical skin anesthetic lesions or peripheral nerve pathology associated with the disease [52] . The WHO has published in 2018 clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of leprosy in endemic countries, but no similar WHO guidance exists for non-endemic countries, such as Lebanon [53] .",

A study done in 2013 showed a significant increase in the number of reported dog bites between 2000 and 2013, with a total of 5280 animal bites reported to the LMPH with an annual average of 431 bites per year [63] . Additionally, the number of dog bites increased between 2013 and 2016 from 709 in 2013 to 1271 in 2016, with a total average of 1004 bites (Fig. 3) . The Syrian crisis in 2011 and the Lebanese garbage crisis of 2015 might have contributed to the doubling of reported dog bites during that time [64, 65] . Despite the low incidence of rabies in Lebanon, the risk remains significant because of the open nature of Lebanese-Syrian borders, the absence of appropriate control over the wild life, and the failure of both Lebanese and Syrian authorities to implement proper control measures in all districts of their countries, an effort that has been severely weakened after the Syrian war [63] . The ability of animals to cross borders, the reports of imported cases from many countries, and the higher incidence of rabies in border areas emphasize the importance of regional cooperation to control the prevalence of the disease.",

Even though only one case of fasciolosis in Lebanon was identified in the literature [24] , more cases are likely under-diagnosed especially given Lebanese citizens' frequent travel to the aforementioned countries, their habit of consuming raw vegetables, and the rich livestock population. Spread of human fasciolosis depends on several factors which include climate, farming practices, human dietary habits, animal population, and the presence of intermediate hosts. Livestock husbandry is an important part of farming in agricultural activities in the MENA region and one of the main propagators of fasciolosis [71] . Environmental changes, variations in human behavior, a move toward urbanization, immigration, dam building, and expansion of irrigation all facilitate fasciolosis spread [71] .",

Ethiopia has one of the largest burdens of NTDs in Africa with the five most common NTDs in the country being: Lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminths, and trachoma [72] (Table 1) . Moreover, many migrant workers are present without a work permit; therefore, their actual numbers are unknown, making it more difficult to monitor disease trends among this group. The Lebanese diaspora is distributed all over the world ( Table 2 ). The largest number of Lebanese immigrants is in South America, followed by Africa and the Arab Peninsula. The risk of importing diseases from these countries is directly related to their distance to Lebanon, i.e., to the likelihood that a Lebanese immigrant would revisit his country. Therefore, Lebanese in Africa and Arab Peninsula are more likely to revisit Lebanon than those residing in South America or Australia. Therefore, Lebanon is at risk of importing leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, dengue, Human African Trypanosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, and schistosomiasis among others.",
