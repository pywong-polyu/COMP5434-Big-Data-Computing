Setting Qualitative interview study within a clusterrandomised pilot trial, involving four London maternity services. Participants Individual interviews were conducted postnatally with 10 women who had received blood transfusion for severe postpartum haemorrhage and had consented to the trial. We also interviewed four 'recruiters'-two research midwives and two clinical trials practitioners who conducted trial recruitment. Results Consent procedures in the ACROBAT pilot trial were generally acceptable and the intervention was viewed as low risk, but most women did not remember much about the consent conversation. As per trial protocol, recruiters sought to consent women before hospital discharge, but this time pressure had to be balanced against the need to ensure women were not approached when distressed or very unwell. Extra efforts had to be made to communicate trial information to women due to the exhaustion of their recovery and competing demands for their attention. Participant information was further complicated by explanations about the cluster design and change in transfusion process, even though the consent sought was for access to medical data. Conclusion Our findings indicate that deferred consent procedures raise similar concerns as taking consent when emergency obstetric research is occurring-that is, the risk that participants may conflate research with clinical care, and that their ability to process trial information may be impacted by the stressful nature of recovery and newborn care. A future trial may support more meaningful informed consent by extending the window of consent discussion and ensuring trial information is minimal and easy to understand.

However, a key concern for research in the emergency setting is that such events proceed quickly and treatment is administered rapidly, especially if the situation is life-threatening: thus, obtaining consent during an emergency may not be appropriate or meaningful-a concern which has been expressed by both women with experience of severe PPH 5 6 and research staff obtaining consent . 7 8 In recent years, deferred consent procedures have been used to avoid delay in administering emergency research interventions. Deferred consent involves enrolling a patient in a trial and administering the intervention according to criteria approved by ethical review, and then requesting the patient's informed consent as soon as possible after the emergency has been resolved for the use of data already collected and for their continuation in the study. 9 10 Previous studies have found high levels of support for emergency paediatric or cardiac research in the absence of advance consent, [11] [12] [13] or with deferred consent. 9 14 15 A qualitative study that explored the issue of deferred consent with women enrolled in a trial of PPH treatment, found no difference in perceived acceptability of consent processes between those who gave consent while their PPH was ongoing and those who gave consent retrospectively. 6 We sought to build on this research by exploring the deferred consent approach that was adopted in the Administering CRyoprecipitate in Obstetric Bleeding At an earlier Time (ACROBAT) pilot trial for severe PPH. Shared learning from trials conducted without prior consent is an important way to inform peer and ethics review processes in this area. 16 The ACROBAT study ACROBAT was a pragmatic, non-blinded, clusterrandomised pilot trial, involving four maternity services in London. The trial aimed to recruit all women >24 weeks pregnant within these services who needed a blood transfusion for management of active bleeding within 24 hours of delivery. The intervention group received earlier administration of cryoprecipitate (within 90 min of the first request of red blood cells for transfusion) compared with standard care, where cryoprecipitate is given later, or not at all in the haemorrhage management. The study protocol (including patient-facing documentation) and findings in relation to the feasibility of intervention delivery and main study outcomes are published separately. 17 18 Advance consent for participation was waived with Research Ethics Committee approval (Ref: 18/LO/2062). Women in both intervention and control sites were approached by the research team postnatally for written, informed consent to collect their routine, deidentified, clinical data. The study design focused on recruiting women before they were discharged from hospital, to allow more immediate discussions about the research and to reduce expected attrition postdischarge. If consent (or refusal) was not obtained before discharge, participants were provided with the study information materials at discharge and consent was subsequently attempted either in person or remotely after discharge.",

The perspectives and concerns of the PPI group informed the questions that were explored in the interviews and the interpretation of the findings. The purpose of the interviews was to learn more about how deferred consent processes worked in practice and how women responded, in order to inform plans for a full-scale trial. 20 METHODS 199 women (from both intervention and control clusters) were included in the pilot trial between March 2019 and January 2020. Of these women, 129 (65%) provided deferred consent for data collection. The rate of refusal to consent was low (9.5%). Anonymised routine data in the absence of consent was collected in 25.1% of cases, because participants were not given study documentation prior to hospital discharge or could not be contacted postdischarge. 17 Of the women who provided consent to participate in the trial, 58 (45%) agreed at the time of consent to be contacted later about a qualitative interview. Interview recruitment began in August 2019 while the trial was ongoing. LS telephoned women who had given birth at least 3 months previously across all four sites, to invite them to interview. Many of these calls went unanswered or the telephone number that had been provided did not work. Other women explained that since giving birth they had moved country, had travelled to stay with family or that they no longer wished to take part in an interview. For those women who agreed to be interviewed, the interviews were arranged for a time and date that best suited them. All interviews were conducted by LS, a female qualitative public health researcher, with experience of conducting sensitive research interviews. A hospital setting was avoided for the interviews in case it triggered difficult memories for a participant. Most interviews took place in participants' homes and one took place in a caf\u00e9 local to the participant. Babies were present during all interviews. In one interview, the woman's partner joined in during parts of the interview conversation. Written informed consent was obtained prior to each interview. An interview schedule was used (online supplemental Appendix A), but the interview also provided space for discussion of topics raised spontaneously by the participants.

In order to get a full picture of each woman's situation and to assess when consent was appropriate, recruiters reviewed the available clinical notes and consulted with the staff in charge of women's care. At times they also had to make their own judgements depending on how tired or unwell a woman appeared on first approach. In general, the recruiters preferred to approach eligible women when they had moved from the high dependency unit to the postnatal ward. Women often spent only 1 day on the postnatal ward before discharge and there was additional pressure to try to recruit women who delivered on a Friday, as they would likely be discharged over the weekend (when recruiters were unavailable).",

They attempted to assess each woman's individual situation to ensure the timing of approach would be as sensitive as possible, which is an approach found to be appreciated by women recruited to emergency obstetric research. 6 Recruiters in this study felt they had to make extra efforts to communicate the trial information to women due to their exhaustion and the competing demands for their attention, but most of the women we interviewed did not remember much about the conversation that was held about the research in the day(s) immediately following the birth. Other studies where women provided research consent in the intrapartum or immediate postnatal period have similarly reported recall difficulty and confusion about the nature of the research consented to. 6 8 This does not necessarily mean that the consent provided at the time of recruitment was uninformed. Participants may have felt fully informed at that time, but may not have remembered much about the conversation when interviewed several months later. While women typically retain clear and consistent memories of their labour and birth, 28 they may more easily forget interactions and conversations with hospital staff who were not a part of the actual birth experience. The window for seeking deferred consent in a trial of this nature could potentially be extended to ensure it does not rely on a particularly stressful period for the women recruited. PPI group members recommended that postdischarge recruitment in the full trial may allow for more meaningful discussion about the research with participants. Indeed, two of the trial participants we interviewed who had provided consent in the week(s) after discharge felt they had greater capacity to process the trial information at the later period than they would have had in the day(s) immediately following the birth. Of concern is that a postdischarge model of consent risks a lower overall recruitment rate. One potential option for future research is engaging community postnatal midwifery services in supporting postdischarge consent processes-however, this would increase demands on resources, for staff training and governance. Another option could be to adopt a model of extended consent discussion, also known as ongoing, or continuous consent, where women first provide consent predischarge and then one to 2 months later are followed up to revisit the information about the trial, address any questions or concerns they have and confirm that they continue to consent for their data to be included. 29 This option may allow for the high consent rates to be maintained, while also providing greater opportunity for meaningful discussion about the research. Further research is needed to explore effective ways of establishing or continuing contact with participants for postdischarge consent, and perhaps the full ACROBAT trial could provide such an opportunity.",

            "text": "The ACROBAT pilot trial did not require much active participation from women, as the data and blood samples needed had already been collected, and this is likely to have supported recruitment. However, the information women received about the study and the consent conversation itself was still complicated by the requirement on recruiters to explain the cluster design of the study and the transfusion process, which may have led to some of the confusion expressed by women interviewed about what they had consented to. It is a common challenge in research recruitment that the details of complex medical protocols need to be communicated to participants due to ethics and sponsor requirements, 3 making it harder for participants to understand what is being asked of their participation. Recruitment for the ACROBAT pilot trial was essentially about obtaining consent to use data rather than consent to an intervention (indeed, 'deferred' consent is perhaps a misleading term in this context). The PPI group had a key role in arranging the content of the trial PIS to make it clearer to women what they were being asked to do, but perhaps for a future trial, the research team and PPI group need to develop a further simplified version of the PIS that focuses on the collection and use of data/samples needed for trial outcomes as this is the aspect of the research that actually requires consent. Further information (eg, on overall trial design, cryoprecipitate) could be provided in a separate document if requested. Reducing the focus on the intervention in this case may also reduce the conflation between research and clinical care.",

Yet, the women interviewed largely had no recollection of seeing the information materials and the recruiters we spoke with had not received contact from any women in relation to their content, which confirmed the concerns of the PPI group about the effectiveness of antenatal information. This may be because the information was provided passively, that is, available in waiting rooms for women to pick up or read themselves, rather than actively communicated during antenatal care. The passive approach to providing information is generally favoured to prevent causing unnecessary distress about a rare complication. We found mixed opinions about this approach from both the PPI group members and women interviewed, where some felt that information in advance would create anxiety, while others thought that information ought to be provided before the birth, particularly to women in high-risk groups. It is a key challenge for trial teams in obstetric emergency research to attempt to reconcile diverse views and preferences in deciding how and when to provide information about research.",

Although the rate of trial consent refusal was low and recruiters offered explanations for refusal from their encounters with women in recruitment conversations, there is still a possibility that those who refused may have provided further perspectives on the consent process in an interview. Furthermore, our interview sample came from the pool of women who had agreed to be contacted at a later date about an interview (only 32% of the overall total recruited to the trial) and the women within that pool who then agreed again to be interviewed when contacted in the postnatal period. Therefore, the women we interviewed may have been particularly motivated towards research participation and may be more inclined to see benefits of research.

In the design of the ACROBAT pilot trial, the trial team decided against approaching women for consent at the time of the PPH emergency, due to concern that the urgent and stressful nature of the event would jeopardise treatment and women's capacity to make an informed decision about participation. However, our qualitative findings showed that there are similar concerns about informed consent when approaching women postintervention, at least when this occurs in the short window between birth and discharge. Women may still be in recovery and less capable of attending to complex information about a study they were enrolled in, and finding the appropriate time and sufficient time, to explain the study information is challenging for recruiters. A future trial of this kind will likely face the same balancing act between designing feasible research and supporting well-timed, meaningful informed consent. One potential option for improvement may be through extending the window of discussion for consent for the use of data (perhaps through a twostep model of consent, or by obtaining consent postdischarge), though this is likely to incur additional demands on study resources. Trial teams should also ensure that the consent process is supported by trial information that is minimal and easy to understand.
