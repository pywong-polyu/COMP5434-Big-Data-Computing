Method: Young subjects who have been followed up with a primary diagnosis of OCD in a university hospital were reached by telephone or online programs to assess symptom profile, symptom severity and exacerbation during pandemic. Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive (CY-BOCS) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scales were used to rate symptom profile and severity before pandemic and during pandemic periods. Results: There was a significant increase in the frequency of contamination obsessions (p=0.008) and cleaning/washing compulsions (p=0.039) during pandemic period. CY-BOCS obsessions (p<0.001), compulsions subscales (p<0.001) and total scores (p<0.001), and CGI-S scores (p<0.001) during pandemic period were statistically higher than before pandemic period. There was a significant relationship between the change in CY-BOCS scores with talking/searching in the social environment about COVID-19, daily preoccupation about COVID-19, duration of OCD diagnosis and diagnosis of COVID-19 in someone familiar. Conclusions: Young subjects with OCD may develop additional symptoms and worsen already existing symptoms of OCD during COVID-19 pandemic.",

Prolonged lockdown has been shown to have negative effects on the mental health of children and adolescents and can induce stress, anxiety, and depression Wang et al., 2020) . Another study reported that children isolated or quarantined during pandemic outbreaks were more likely to develop acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, and grief (Sprang and Silman, 2013) . In a review of the psychological effects and consequences of restraint and quarantine as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, most studies reported negative psychological effects, such as post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger (Brooks et al., 2020b) . Pandemics have serious psychological and social effects along with their biological effects. Those with mental health problems are especially sensitive to these negative effects and are prone to worsen because of a pandemic (Davide et al., 2020; \u00d6zdin and Bayrak \u00d6zdin, 2020) . Although studies are increasingly focusing on the mental health effects of pandemics on adult patients (Gao et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , relatively few studies focus on the effects of pandemics on children and adolescents . Chen et al. demonstrated that COVID-19 influenced symptoms of mental disorders, including OCD, fear, hypochondria, depression, and neurasthenia, in college students .",

Davide et al. stated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in the severity of obsession and compulsion in adult cases with OCD (Davide et al., 2020) . Since the strategies that combat infectious diseases contain repetitive behaviors by nature, these strategies can worsen OCD (Banerjee, 2020) . OCD symptoms may worsen due to additional emphasis on self-hygiene in the current health advice for preventing COVID-19 contamination. Although there are case reports of adult patients with worsening OCD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic (Kumar and Somani, 2020; French and Lyne, 2020) , the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on OCD symptomatology, symptom severity and exacerbation, and other related factors have not been studied in young populations.",

Ninety subjects were identified according to their medical records as candidates for inclusion in the study, and 61 subjects met eligibility criteria and were included in the study. Thus, 29 subjects were excluded from the study, either because they lacked a Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) score from before the pandemic period (n=11), because they could not be reached (n=10), or because they did not consent to participating in the study (n=8). Eligibility criteria included the following: a) an OCD diagnosis according to DSM-5 criteria; b) Scores from the Clinical Global Impression (CGI-S) scale and CY-BOCS scores from before the pandemic; c) no diagnoses of autism or schizophrenia spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities, or substance use disorders; and d) verbal informed consent and assent to participate in the study. Of the study participants, 53 subjects continued medicated treatment and seven subjects completed their medicated treatment during the pandemic (See Table 1 for additional information on patients' treatments). Subjects who underwent cognitive behavioral therapy (i.e., exposure-response prevention) before the pandemic discontinued their therapy during the pandemic. Remission status was defined as a CY-BOCS score \u226412 (Mataix-Cols et al., 2016), and 55.7% (n=34) of individuals comprising the sample had demonstrated remission before the pandemic.",

Important findings were obtained in our study-the severity of OCD symptoms increased during the pandemic in more than half of the study subjects. Studies have shown that contamination obsessions and compulsive handwashing are among the most common OCD symptoms (Bloch and Storch, 2015; Coskun et al., 2012; Coskun and Zoroglu, 2009; Stein et al., 2019) . Little research has concerned adult subjects who report exacerbated OCD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic usually presented through the worsening of contamination obsessions and cleaning/washing compulsions (Davide et al., 2020; French and Lyne, 2020; Kumar and Somani, 2020) . In their very recent study, Davide et al. reported that a significant increase in obsession and compulsion severity emerged, and both the remission status of OCD symptoms and having contamination symptoms before the quarantine were significantly associated with greater worsening of OCD symptoms during quarantine (Davide et al., 2020) . It has been reported that hand washing during pandemic is considered to be one of the safest measures against infection, and since these hygienic measures are emphasized in media sources, it has worsened the symptoms of patients with OCD who Table 2 Types and severity of OCD symptoms during and before pandemic. (1) Y. Tanir, et al. Psychiatry Research 293 (2020) 113363 have concerns about contamination, hygiene, and cleanliness (Banerjee, 2020; French and Lyne, 2020) . Of the four basic dimensions of OCD, the contamination and cleaning-washing dimensions in particular were reported to be associated with exaggerated threat and inflated responsibility (Wheaton et al., 2010) . Intensive expression of health problems related to COVID-19 and measures to be taken, as presented in the media and in social life, may increase the perceptions of threat and responsibility in people with OCD. In addition, cleaning compulsions frequently seen in patients with a fear of contamination are directly related to behaviors such as the use of washing and protective equipment due to the outbreak of COVID-19 (Banerjee, 2020) . Contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions were found to be the most common symptoms both before and during the pandemic in the current study. In addition, as expected, there was a significant increase in the frequency of these symptoms, which means that more subjects developed contamination and cleaning/washing symptoms during the pandemic among our sample. This finding is consistent with previous reports regarding adult subjects. However, to date, the researchers were unable to find any study or report that considered the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents with OCD.",

            "text": "In our study, CY-BOCS ratings of obsessions and compulsions, plus overall CY-BOCS scores as well as CGI-S scores, showed statistically significant increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than one-third of the subjects having an increase of at least 30% in total CY-BOCS scores. In addition, more than half of the subjects identified as remitters before the pandemic relapsed with clinically significant symptoms. Importantly, there was a significant relationship between the changes in CY-BOCS scores with talking/searching in the social environment about COVID-19, daily preoccupation with COVID-19, the duration of OCD diagnosis, and the diagnosis of COVID-19 in someone familiar to patients. Some of these findings are consistent with the limited literature regarding adult subjects who reported exposure in social environments and media as important factors for the exacerbation of OCD symptoms (Banerjee, 2020; Kumar and Somani, 2020; French and Lyne, 2020) . Our study confirms that these findings also apply to young subjects with OCD. However, in contrast to the available literature, we also found that the duration of a subject's OCD diagnosis and a COVID-19 diagnosis in someone familiar were both associated with an increase in OCD symptom severity during the pandemic. The reason for the relationship between the duration of OCD diagnosis and the worsening of symptoms may be that these patients and their families better noticed the worsening of OCD symptoms. Moreover, having someone familiar be diagnosed with COVID-19 is a clear source of stress for children and adolescents, which may worsen OCD symptoms. In our study, almost half of the subjects reported having someone familiar to them be diagnosed with COVID-19. The total number of COVID-19 cases in Turkey is 172,000 as of June 9, 2020, but this rate may be unpredictably higher. However, the high rate of COVID-19 diagnoses may signal an exaggerated threat to this particular population, causing increased attention to be paid to COVID-19. All findings from our study may prompt several preventive mental health approaches for young subjects with OCD-limiting or avoiding overexposure to media or social environments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, encouraging good parenting and communication skills to cope with a child's OCD-related worries or behaviors, anticipating the worsening of any OCD symptoms, and complying with treatments may help children and adolescents with OCD, as well as their parents, during the pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020).",

First, this was a cross-sectional study conducted during the pandemic and may not reflect long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people with OCD. In addition, subjects were assessed by telephone or via online interviews due to home confinement for this age group. Finally, the worsening of OCD symptoms may be a natural course of an individual's disorder, which may or may not be attributable to COVID-19. Further studies with larger samples, more structured interviews, and long-term follow-ups are needed on this subject.",
