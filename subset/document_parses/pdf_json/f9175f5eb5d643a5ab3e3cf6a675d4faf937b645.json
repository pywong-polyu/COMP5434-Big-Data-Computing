The high frequency of emphysema and COPD in AATD patients could partially explain our data, since in our cohort only 29/113 patients (25.7%) reported lung obstruction and only one SARS-Cov-2 infected subject reported clinically-diagnosed COPD. A recent meta-analysis on Table 1 Demographic characteristics and clinical data of the full cohort and according to COVID-19 testing. SARS-Cov-2 infection showed that individuals with pre-existing COPD have a fivefold increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 [9] . Our data is not able to indicate a worse prognosis of COVID-19 in AATD patients, since none of our infected subjects required intensive care. A recent analysis identified a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetically susceptible locus in patients with Covid-19 and respiratory failure confirming the potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system [10] . The gene cluster 14p32.1 where SERPINA1 lies, didn't prove to be associated with COVID-19. Nevertheless, low frequency variants (such as those related to a rare disease like AATD) could contribute substantially to the missing heritability of a genetic trait and a possible association with specific clinical conditions can only be revealed in selected cohorts.",
