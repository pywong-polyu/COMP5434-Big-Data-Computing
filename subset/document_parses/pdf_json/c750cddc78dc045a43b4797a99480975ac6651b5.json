Verbal abuse (57.6%) was the most common form of non-physical violence, followed by threats (33.2%) and sexual harassment (12.4%). The prevalence of violence against HCWs was particularly high in Asian and North American countries, in Psychiatric and Emergency departments, and among nurses and physicians (2) .",

The violence experienced by dental healthcare workers was both physical and nonphysical (shouting, bullying, and threatening) and also included sexual harassment (3) , and in most cases, male patients, or coworkers were responsible. Violent events ranged from 15.0 to 54.0% with a mean prevalence of 32%, and physical abuse ranged from 4.6 to 22% (3).",

Many countries have reported cases of violence, and some are particularly affected by this problem. A Chinese Hospital Association survey collecting data from 316 hospitals revealed that 96% of the hospitals surveyed experienced workplace violence in 2012 (6) , and a study done by the Chinese Medical Doctor Association in 2014 showed that over 70% of physicians ever experienced verbal abuse or physical injuries at work (7) . An examination of all legal cases on violence against health professionals and facilities from the criminal ligation records 2010-2016, released by the Supreme Court of China, found that beating, pushing, verbal abuse, threatening, blocking hospital gates, and doors, smashing hospital property were frequently reported types of violence (8) . In India, violence against healthcare workers and damage to healthcare facilities has become a debated issue at various levels (9) , and the government has made violence against HCWs an offense punishable by up to 7 years imprisonment, after various episodes of violence and harassment of HCWs involved in COVID-19 care or contact tracing (10) . In Germany, severe aggression or violence has been experienced by 23% of primary care physicians (11) . In Spain, there has been an increase in the magnitude of the phenomenon in recent years (12) . In the UK, a Health Service Journal and UNISON research found that 181 NHS Trusts in England reported 56,435 physical assaults on staff in 2016-2017 (13) . In the USA, 70-74% of workplace assaults occur in healthcare settings (14) . In Italy, in just one year, 50% of nurses were verbally assaulted in the workplace, 11% experienced physical violence, 4% were threatened with a weapon (15); 50% of physicians were verbally, and 4% physically, assaulted (16) . In Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Turkey many nurses have been physically attacked or verbally abused in the workplace (17) . According to the South African Medical Association, over 30 hospitals across South Africa reported serious security incidents in just 5 months in 2019 (18) , and in Cape Town violence against ambulance crews is widespread (19) . In Iran, the prevalence of physical or verbal workplace violence against emergency medical services personnel is 36 and 73% respectively (20) . The World Health Organization lists Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Lebanon, Mozambique, Portugal, Thailand as other countries where studies on violence directed at HCWs have been conducted (21) .",

HCWs worldwide generally advocate for more severe laws, but harsher penalties alone are unlikely to solve the problem. Importantly, evidence on the efficacy of interventions to prevent aggression against doctors is lacking, and a systematic review and meta-analysis found that only few studies have provided such evidence (29) . Just one randomized controlled trial indicated that a violence prevention program decreased the risks of patient-to-worker violence and of related injury in hospitals (30) , whereas contrasting results in violence rates after implementation of workplace violence prevention programs have been observed from longitudinal studies (29) . There is no evidence on the effectiveness of good place design and work policies aimed to reduce long waiting times or crowding in waiting areas (29) . More studies are clearly needed to provide evidence-based recommendations, and interdisciplinary research with the involvement of anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists should be encouraged. However, certain measures have to be taken and can be corrected, should they be shown as ineffective in properly conducted studies.",

First, staff shortages, so common in public hospitals worldwide, should be acted upon, and increased funding should be allocated to employ more doctors and nurses. Hence, the duration of each patient encounter would be augmented, particularly in overburdened public hospitals, allowing the (often young) (32) doctors to develop a meaningful relationship with the patient. Second, healthcare organizations and universities should considerably improve the communication skills of current and future HCWs to reduce unrealistic expectations or misunderstanding of patients and families. Third, HCWs who denounce any verbal or physical violence should be fully supported by their healthcare organizations; this would reduce the huge issue of under-reporting of workplace violence (33, 34) . Good courses should be organized for HCWs to learn how to identify early signs that somebody may become violent, how to manage dangerous situations, and how to protect themselves.",

Staff should be increased and security officers should be placed, particularly at night, in remote Health Posts and Emergency Departments and at particular times (violence tends to happen in the evenings/nights, when more patients under the influence of drugs and alcohol present); the number of night shifts should be limited (23) . Efforts should be made to improve job satisfaction of HCWs (25) . Finally, media should cease to contribute to the general public's distrust toward HCWs and institutions. Many patients report their negative experiences of medical care to news or media outlets which are highly interested in these stories and very often do not check the information before publishing it (24) . These biased media reports may exacerbate the tension.",
