Moreover, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, Ddimer levels, and leukocyte count were significantly higher in severe than in non-severe cases of COVID-19 [8] . A meta-analysis of 6320 patients from 52 studies [9] has included 36 laboratory parameters showed that the progression to severe phenotype also associates with elevated levels of neutrophils, prolonged prothrombin time, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IL-6, and IL-10 on admission to the hospital. However, most of these studies were conducted in Asian countries. European countries were not presented in this analysis, and we have reacted to the need for locally relevant data on disease course severity.",

Probably, a relatively favorable epidemiological situation in Latvia in Spring 2020 resulted in the hospitalization of patients in a better condition compared to Zhang et al.

Eosinophils are granulocytes, which can destruct viruses by phagocytosis during the non-specific immune response phase, similar to neutrophils. Therefore, the decreasing of eosinophils on admission to the hospital can be explained by more intensive eosinophils destruction than other groups of blood cells or by impaired hemopoiesis of these cells. Simultaneously, eosinophils and lymphocytes correlated positively, and both demonstrated a negative correlation with CRP. It confirmed a tendency of decrease in eosinophils and lymphocytes, associated with the increasing inflammatory process during the COVID-19 course.",

[13] , the rise in LDH level indicates an increase in the activity and extent of lung injury in critically ill patients with COVID-19. As a marker of cardiac involvement, troponin T level is also elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 [16] . In our study, both tissue damage indicators were higher in patients with severe than moderate or mild disease course. These findings confirm previous results [1, 10, 16, 17] .",
