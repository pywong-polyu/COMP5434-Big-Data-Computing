The recommendation to wear a face mask affects millions of people, even to the athletic population during sports practice in fitness facilities, as recent evidence reports they contribute to reducing virus spread, when the pulmonary ventilation substantially increases [2] . However, although some authors suggest that the use of a face mask can increase carbon dioxide rebreathing, causing hypercapnic hypoxia and, consequently, a decrease in tissue oxygenation, as well as increasing the resistance to inspiration and respiration, thus increasing the work of breathing [3] [4] [5] , other authors suggest that it has minimal impact on physiological function during exercise [6, 7] or even no impact on exercise [8, 9] , generating controversy when using the face mask during exercise, by comparing a wide range of face masks (surgical, FFP2/N95 or cloth masks).",

On the other hand, other research has been carried out with the intention of elucidating the impact of the use of masks at a biological level, such as the possible decrease in tissue oxygenation, previously described. A previous study discovered that, at constant load (steady state exercise), using SM was associated with a significant increase in airway resistance, reduced oxygen uptake, and increased heart rate [13] . Furthermore, some studies compared pulmonary and cardiovascular capacity, at maximal load, using SM and FFP2/N95 in healthy adults [14] [15] [16] , showing that there is a significant reduction in performance (Pmax and VO 2 max) with FFP2/N95, whereas that reduction, although present, is not that consistent with SM. Therefore, according to these studies, medical masks have a marked negative impact on cardiopulmonary capacity that significantly impairs strenuous physical and work activities. Additionally, subjects manifest a progressively higher Borg scale value from no mask < SM < to FFP2/N95, suggestive of a greater dyspnea when masks are worn, at maximal load [14, 15] . Likewise, different studies show a perception of discomfort associated with the use of masks [4, 15] . Among other perceptions, participants report feeling, at high exercise intensities, respiratory resistance, heat, shortness of breath, claustrophobia and general discomfort [4, 17, 18] .",

An example of these innovative products is the Emotion reusable respirators (Texcon y Calidad \u00ae , Toledo, Spain), that have been recently approved according to the European standard UNE-CWA 17553:2020 [20] , providing increased breathability and attempting to counteract the main difficulties reported by society in breathing [21] [22] [23] , such as warmth, anxiety/claustrophobia, alteration of breathing pattern from nasal to oronasal, etc. We believe that research into the use of these new fabrics in the field of sport could contribute to the safe practice of sport without compromising its performance. However, to our knowledge, no scientific literature has analyzed pulmonary and cardiovascular performance with this type of mask, as well as perceived recovery. The main hypothesis of this study was that the FFP2 mask modifies cardiopulmonary function, reducing sports performance, while the Emotion mask does not modify them, thus not reducing work capacity, because they are more breathable. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate whether cardiopulmonary performance, as well as perceived ventilation, exertion, and comfort, are affected using the FFP2 mask or the Emotion mask in young female athletes.",

Calculation via G*Power determined that a sample size of 11 participants was needed to achieve adequate statistical power. In order to finally have this sample, a 20% dropout rate was estimated, so the final sample was calculated as n (1/1-R), where R is the proportion of expected dropouts, so the final sample was 11/0.8 = 14 subjects. The study was carried out on 3 consecutive days, at the same time of the day for each participant. All tests were conducted during the month of June 2021, in the Exercise Physiology Laboratory (Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain), with environmental conditions of 26.6 \u00b1 1.5 \u2022 C temperature, 29.2 \u00b1 6.7 % relative humidity and 721 \u00b1 25 mmHg atmospheric pressure. The participants were scheduled according to their menstrual cycle, as detailed below. They were asked to eat a similar diet and to avoid caffeine on all three days of the study. To ensure rest, they were not allowed to engage in physical activity 24 h before the tests and the hours of sleep were checked. On the first day of the study, prior to the start of testing, the participants were required to have a negative antigen test result for COVID-19. Then, a medical evaluation was thoroughly performed, as well as an evaluation of body composition, a resting electrocardiogram and two baseline spirometries wearing a respiratory mouthpiece or an ergospirometry mask (ErgoMask, Jaeger-CareFusion, Hoechberg, Germany). Below, a graded exercise test (GXT) with the ErgoMask until exhaustion followed by a confirmatory test was carried out. On days 2 and 3, both a basal spirometry and a GXT were performed wearing the FFP2 mask (FFP2) or the Emotion mask below the ErgoMask (ErgoMask+FFP2 and ErgoMask+Emotion, respectively). The order of the ErgoMask+FFP2 and ErgoMask+Emotion was randomly and counterbalanced assigned for days 2 and 3.",

Therefore, the aim of this control was to evaluate participants under similar sex hormone status during the three consecutive testing days. Based on the current considerations for research in sport and exercise science with women as participants [26] , the first day of the menstrual cycle started with the onset of menstrual bleeding. Furthermore, eumenorrheic participants performed a urinary ovulation test (Ellatest, Alicante, Spain) to detect the luteinizing hormone surge occurring 24-36 h before ovulation from 3 days before the predicted ovulation day by the calendar-based counting method until a positive test was recorded, as previously indicated [26, 27] . In accordance with this, participants with eumenorrheic cycles were evaluated during the mid-follicular phase (day 6 to 10 of the cycle) or during the mid-luteal phase (+5 to +9 days after confirmed ovulation). Moreover, to further discard ovulation during the evaluation period, participants also performed a urinary ovulation test from two days before starting the evaluation period to two days after finishing it. On the other hand, monophasic oral contraceptive users were evaluated during the second half of the 21 days of pill consumption (active pill phase) as sex hormone levels are fairly stable during these days [26] . Moreover, all participants ingested the oral contraceptive pill upon awakening in the morning to avoid the hormonal surge produced in the hours following ingestion, and pill consumption was verbally confirmed with the participants daily from two days before starting the evaluation period until finishing it.",

A difference of less than 2% in the maximum oxygen consumption value between the GXT and the confirmatory test was used as a criterion for determining a true VO 2 max [32] . The first and the second ventilatory threshold (VT1 and VT2, respectively) were set at the point of maximum agreement of the most common methods of assessment published previously [33] . Briefly, VT1 was calculated: (1) according to the V-slope method, whereby VT1 is the break point of the VCO 2 -VO 2 relationship (VCO 2 is carbon dioxide production and VO 2 is oxygen consumption); (2) as the first exponential increment in ventilation (VE); and (3) as the first rise in the VE/VO 2 relationship without increments in the VE/VCO 2 relationship. VT2 was determined: (1) as the second rise in ventilation; (2) as the intensity that accompanied a second rise in the VE/VO 2 relationship with a concurrent rise in the VE/VCO 2 relationship. All tests were evaluated by 2 researchers, and a third researcher was asked in case of controversy.",

Mauchly's sphericity test was carried out to evaluate whether the sphericity assumption of the variances was violated, in which case the Huynh-Feldt correction was applied. Bonferroni post hoc tests were conducted where significant differences were found in any of the analyzed factors. ANOVA effect size was calculated by partial eta-squared (\u03b7 p 2 ) and small, moderate and large effect corresponded to values equal to or greater than 0.001, 0.059 and 0.138, respectively [34] . Pairwise comparisons effect size was calculated by Cohen's considering d < 0.5 as small, d < 0.8 as moderate and d > 0.8 as large [35] .

However, reality has proven otherwise. Anyway, there is still an important concern about the safety of face masks in high-intensity training, and how they can affect performance. We chose to study an athletic population, as previously done by Egger et al. [16] , to have a specific approach to maximal-intensity exercise, and we chose to do it on a treadmill rather than a bicycle ergometer, in contrast to all recent studies [14] [15] [16] , to better mimic their everyday athletic gesture. This study ratifies that face masks, both FFP2 and Emotion, are safe for healthy, athletic people to practice sport with, even at high intensities. Regarding performance, several previous studies [14] [15] [16] have reported a significant reduction in cardiopulmonary and global performance with the use of face masks, both surgical and FFP2. This is the first study to analyze physical response to the use of a specially developed face mask, Emotion reusable respirator, compared to no mask and with the use of FFP2. Interestingly, cardiopulmonary performance was globally very similar with no mask and the use of Emotion, this way improving previously reported results from cloth and surgical masks [4, [13] [14] [15] [16] . On the other side, it was significantly lower with FFP2, confirming previously reported findings [14, 15] .",

This decrease responds to the reduction of breathing frequency (Bf) because tidal volume remains the same as no mask all through the test. It is noticeable how this difference is progressively lower as intensity goes up, confirming the possibility of adaptation to the use of the mask. In contrast, with the FFP2 mask, this adaptation is not possible: VE starts decreasing at VT1 (by a mean of 9.3 L/min, 19.3%), and continues to decrease until peak exercise to a mean of 20.1 L/min (22.3% of maximum VE reached with no mask). At VT1 and VT2, tidal volume does not change compared to no mask and Emotion, so this reduction responds only to the decrease in Bf, which, at the same time, can be explained by the increase of both Tins and Texp. Maximum TV is reached at VT2: from VT2 to peak exercise, not only does TV not increase, but it decreases substantially, with a much steeper augmentation of Bf compared to no mask and Emotion, probably because of respiratory muscle fatigue, which induces breathing to be shallower but faster. Physiologically, from VT1 on, the increase of ventilation is necessary to prevent acidosis, but when reaching VT2, this increase is mandatory, as acidosis is already established, to prevent pH from going dangerously down [36] . As it is, the observed change in the breathing pattern allows the participants to keep up with the required VE with a slightly lesser effort.",

On the other side, there is a significant, though not as high as probably expected, by terms of comparison to previous data [14] [15] [16] , decrease of VO 2 max with the use of FFP2 (by a mean of 2.9 mL/kg/min, 6.3% of VO 2 max with no mask, whereas Mapelli et al. [14] reported a reduction of 10%, Fikenzer et al. [15] of 13% and Egger et al. [16] of 19%). Without any obstacle that can potentially impair ventilation, VCO 2 output is comparable to CO 2 production in cellular respiration during exercise. However, as we have already seen, both masks are an obstacle impairing ventilation (although to different extents), so VCO 2 output cannot be assumed to be equivalent to CO 2 production until proven otherwise. Provided one exerting body should not change CO 2 production from one test to the other (meaning, if testing protocols are the same, cellular respiration processes should also be the same), VE, and, thus, VE/VCO 2 , form the meaningful parameter to understand VCO 2 output. There were no differences between no mask and Emotion in VCO 2 all through the test (suggesting that the obstacle Emotion produces in ventilation is not enough to diminish VCO 2 output), whereas there is a significant decrease with the use of FFP2, but only at VT2 and peak exercise. Nevertheless, this decrease is proportionally not as high as the decrease in ventilation, as beautifully shown by the difference in VE/VCO 2 , which is significantly lower with the FFP2 (25.7, versus 27.8 with Emotion and 28.9 with no mask), thus suggesting that, as long as we are referring to healthy individuals, face masks may trigger the improvement of ventilatory efficiency to keep up with exercise requirements.",

They are both mediated by autonomic control, due to neurohormonal response to tissue and myocardial oxygen demand. This, and the fact that tests were carried out over three consecutive days, explain why heart rate has demonstrated to be the only submaximal parameter to remain unaltered despite both the masks, all through the seven times of measurement of the tests. This is an important finding concerning people who practice endurance sports and adjust the training intensity according to HR in both VT1 and/or VT2: the use of face masks does not modify VT1, VT2 or maximal heart rate. Arterial pressure during rest, at peak exercise and at recovery also shows no difference between no mask and both face masks.",

Nonetheless, as a more sensitive parameter, time to exhaustion was significantly longer with Emotion than FFP2, and even longer (though not significantly) than that with no mask. This last finding can be justified as the learning effect of performing three maximal exercise tests over three consecutive days, the first one always being the one with no mask. However, this learning effect can only be benefited by the Emotion and not FFP2, as tests with the face masks were randomized, and thus, this effect counterbalanced. In any case, more importantly, the most meaningful finding is the shortest time (by almost one minute compared to no mask, 42 s compared to Emotion) and lower speed (1 km/h compared to no mask, 0.76 km/h compared to Emotion) to reach VT2 with the FFP2. To this, there a physiological explanation: as VCO 2 output is impaired by the use of the mask, the excess of CO 2 that is produced from VT1 on (when HCO 3 buffers the excess of lactate in blood) [37] cannot be properly exhaled, so compensation mechanisms fail and metabolic acidosis appears earlier, and so VT2 overcomes sooner, being, this way, shifted to the left. No such differences are statistically significant with Emotion compared to no mask. This is the first study conducted on women. In addition to that, one of the main strengths of this study is to investigate, not only healthy, but also athletic individuals. Thereby, we made sure we started from the basis of the best possible physical conditions, that VT2 could be easily surpassed, and that maximum oxygen uptake could be reached. As previously mentioned, VT2 has proven to be the point in which cardiopulmonary performance trends go down when wearing FFP2, so the main strength of this study is the ability to identify this point and explain the physiological mechanisms to which such impairment responds.",

Despite having checked the tightness of the masks, it is not possible to be sure that there were no leaks. We did place a saturometer in the ear of the participants, but we were only able to assess reliable SpO 2 measures from immediate recovery onwards, probably due to peripheral vasoconstriction induced by high-intensity exercise. The lack of data on blood testing impedes giving further explanations to some of the findings, like, for example, if the fact that VT2 overcomes sooner affects the total amount of lactate produced. Further studies should be conducted to assess safety and performance with face masks on the general population, especially sedentary people and patients with cardiovascular, pulmonary and neuromuscular disease.",

The FPP2 mask, however, produces significant ventilatory impairment at high intensities, so it is not recommended (though neither totally discouraged, as long as we are assessing healthy individuals) to use an FFP2 mask to train at workloads above VT2.
