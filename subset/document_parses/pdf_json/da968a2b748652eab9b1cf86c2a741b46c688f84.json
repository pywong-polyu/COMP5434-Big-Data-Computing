X-ray images, computed tomography (CT) images and test kits (RT-PCR) are three easily available options for predicting this infection. Compared to the screening of COVID-19 infection from X-ray and CT images, the test kits(RT-PCR) available to diagnose COVID-19 face problems such as high analytical time, high false negative outcomes, poor sensitivity and specificity. Radiological signatures that X-rays can detect have been found in COVID-19 positive patients. Radiologists may examine these signatures, but it's a time-consuming and error-prone process (riddled with intra-observer variability). Thus, the chest X-ray analysis process needs to be automated, for which AI-driven tools have proven to be the best choice to increase accuracy and speed up analysis time, especially in the case of medical image analysis. We shortlisted four datasets and 20 CNN-based models to test and validate the best ones using 16 detailed experiments with fivefold cross-validation. The two proposed models, ensemble deep transfer learning CNN model and hybrid LSTMCNN, perform the best. The accuracy of ensemble CNN was up to 99.78% (96.51% average-wise), F1-score up to 0.9977 (0.9682 average-wise) and AUC up to 0.9978 (0.9583 average-wise). The accuracy of LSTMCNN was up to 98.66% (96.46% average-wise), F1-score up to 0.9974 (0.9668 averagewise) and AUC up to 0.9856 (0.9645 average-wise). These two best pre-trained transfer learning-based detection models can contribute clinically by offering the patients prediction correctly and rapidly.",

Patients aged more than 50 years and having diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and chronic respiratory diseases are advised to follow precautions and preventions strictly. Many studies indicate 80% of mild-tomoderate patients recovered without hospitalization.

Early diagnosis will allow for quarantining patients, rapid intubation in specialized hospitals and monitoring of the diseases' spread. There is a great need for the system to identify an infection to predict future patients quickly. Hence, we can minimize the death rate with the help of early diagnosis and immediate treatment. The medical tool specification (PPE package, ventilators, beds and masks) will increase if the disease spreads further. The most appropriate molecular assay is RT-PCR, which detects the SARS-CoV-2 RNA using nasal or throat swabs, but kits of these have some significant disadvantages. These disadvantages include a potential lack of methodology, resourceintensive, low production, less sensitivity, as compared to CT images, and their diagnosis time is 6-9 h [3] [4] [5] [6] .

Studies have shown that non-COVID-19 patients with community-acquired infections caused by agents such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumoniae are present [7] . The CT symptoms are identical to those found in patients with COVID-19. Symptoms such as fever, cough and tiredness are not peculiar to COVID-19 pneumonia and are seen in pneumonia cases infected with the virus. In comparison, clinical practice has demonstrated no abnormality in CT images of certain COVID-19 patients, raising the complexity of diagnosing new coronavirus pneumonia infections in patients [7] . RT-PCR testing could be inaccessible in all confirmed cases due to the rapid dissemination of COVID-19 pneumonia [7] . A detailed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with clinical symptoms and CT signs by an easy-to-implement approach will be helpful to implement selective and efficient isolation. Another type of test is also called an antibody test, which is a slow process and takes about 9-28 days to validate the patient as 'positive.' There is a risk that the infected person can multiply the infection these days if the quarantine is not successful.",

In this type of pandemic situation, a substantial increase in chest CT's is necessary. We require highly experienced radiologists, but there is a shortage of them [8, 9] . This will help improve their performances by providing them with a computer-aided alternative. Moreover, radiologists have some issues, too; the COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the radiologist's assessment and evaluation of CT and X-Ray images. The work can be time-consuming, and it is often riddled with intraobserver variability. To overcome these limitations, we need an advanced Artificial Intelligence system that is reliable and reproducible. With these systems, we may reduce the dependence on radiologists. Discussing from the other perspective, World Health Organization (WHO) has strongly recommended exhaustive testing of potential suspects and citizens living in hotspot areas, but the guidelines are not sincerely followed due to the scarcity of the resources/personnel/testing-kit. So it is an immediate priority to develop and test Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based fast and robust alternative approach that can help limit the rate of spread because prior studies, like lung cancer detection [10] , heart disease prediction [62] , liver lesions in CT scans [63] , have justified the performance of AI-based models in clinical practice. These AI-assisted models have high accuracy, which will aid clinical in best decision making. Prior studies [11, 12] conclude that manual examination in the case of X-ray images provides precise recognition of the disease in 60-70%, and in the case of the CT images, manual analysis performance lies between 50 and 75%. The experienced radiologists decide based on prior clinical experience; however, such verdict is easily influenced by subjective factors and individual proficiency. More automated and intelligent methods are needed to search globally, especially in regions with limited resources. Deep learning has been a cornerstone in AI healthcare and medicine for over a decade. Then there should be a computer-based (deep learning approach) alternative for diagnosis of the disease. It supports users in the COVID-19 screening. The last issue in using the manual methods for evaluating chest X-rays is the low sensitivity of ground-glass opacity (GGO) nodules. Hence, early detection of the disease using X-ray is not possible. Deep learning can differentiate between nodules that an untrained human will not detect.",

It was noted that COVID-19 reveals some signatures which can easily be observed via X-ray images. Deep learning approaches can automatically analyze chest X-rays, which can accelerate the time of the investigation. Applying multiple pre-trained convolutional neural networks proposed by the scientific community and our proposed ones that are selective and reliable to achieve the best pulmonary classification X-ray picture illnesses. The generated results are remarkable and highly encouraging and prove that deep learning is successful, and more specifically, transfer learning with CNNs to the automatic detection of abnormal X-ray images related to the COVID-19 disease. The study is an end-to-end solution for the diagnosis of COVID-19 which can be converted into a low-priced, quick, robust and reliable intelligent screening tool to reduce the error rate in binary classification between COVID-19 patients and healthy people (Non-COVID Pneumonia and Normal). 2. Extensive experimentation (16 experiments) and evaluation has been conducted using 20 pre-trained transfer learning deep models on 4 datasets to validate the best model performance while addressing the COVID-19 detection. Performance is measured by standard metrics such as accuracy, AUC and F1 score. Through 21 premium studies recently published in SCI indexed COVID-19 studies, we have concluded that we are the first to do such an extensive experiment with so many models. 3. We also have designed three novel CNN models (one from scratch, next one hybrid and last one an ensemble model) based on deep transfer learning system with different pre-trained CNNs architecture to detect the use of X-ray and CT images in COVID-19 patients. The models are quick in nature and are highly acceptable for its accuracy. 4. This study contributes to scientific research by recommending two novel best classifier models with over 98% accuracy in the detection of COVID-19 cases in all 15 experiments for the binary class task. These two best performed deep learning models would help radiologists and doctors to diagnose and decide on the disease as a hand and also as a second opinion.",

            "text": "We have recently examined several research studies in world-renowned journals to present what scientists have recently implemented to diagnose X-ray and/or CT image COVID-19 infection using different approaches based on profound learning. Of these, more than 25 studies (Springer's 10, Elsevier's 14, and the Romanian Journal of Information Science and Technology's remaining 1) were shortlisted and recently published in highly indexed journals. Below is a concise summary of the study's key points. We also built Table 1 displayed at the end of this section to present key points of selected analysis. Butt et al. [20] observed CT image radiographic patterns of potential COVID-19 patients using a CNN-based approach. Authors evaluated two CNN models; one was RestNet23, and the other was designed. ResNet-18 was used to extract image features. The CT images dataset achieved an overall accuracy of 86.7%. Das et al. [21] selected X-ray images to identify COVID-19 infection using a deep-transfer learning-based approach using a modified Inception model(Xception). Eleven existing machine and deep learning models/algorithms (including one proposed) were compared; a maximum accuracy of 97.40% justifies the superiority of the proposed model. Alakus et al. [22] selected 18 laboratory findings from 600 COVID-19 patients using four different types of deep learning models and two hybrid models. In the case of tenfold cross-validation, maximum accuracy is achieved by LSTM (86.66%), and maximum accuracy is conducted in the CNNLSTM hybrid model (92.30%) train-test split approach. Ardakani et al. [23] compared ten convolutionary neural networks to diagnose COVID-19 from CT images. Over 1000 images private dataset was selected for training and testing. The authors conclude that ResNet-101 and Xception achieved the best performance of their shortlisted models. Singh et al. [24] used modified XceptionNet to identify COVID-19. The dataset contains 1419 images with fewer than 132 images of COVID cases. Compared to the other three competitive models, the proposed modified model (95.80%) achieved the best accuracy. Panwar et al. [25] proposed a new VGG-16 deep learning neural network, nCOVnet, for X-ray detection. The limited COVID-19 images, 142, are selected for training and testing; the proposed model's performance is not compared with any other pre-trained or modified image. Limited data achieved an overall accuracy of 88.10%. Wang et al. [26] applied deep learning to chest X-ray images for two purposes (discrimination and location). For COVID-19 discrimination, the first objective was lung features extraction, and the second objective was to identify infected pulmonary tissues from each detected chest X-rays. Abraham et al. [27] selected X-ray images to investigate COVID-19. The authors chose 10 CNNs and 15 multiCNNs for performance evaluation. The best result was obtained in combining five pre-trained CNN's: SqueezeNet, DarkNet-53, MobileNetV2, Xception and ShuffleNet. Authors also used correlation-based feature selection and Bayesnet classifier to identify infection. Bayesnet 's performance was compared to seven other classifiers. The authors also showed that Bayesnet's accuracy (91.15%) is equivalent to 5 CNN's best combination.",

            "text": "Authors, Toraman et al. [28] , suggested a novel small number of layer-based imagenet, Convolutional CapsNet, for X-ray diagnosis. The model uses tenfold cross-validations to generate outputs in two classes, binary classification (COVID-19 and No-Findings) with 97.24% accuracy and multi-class classification (COVID-19, No-Findings and Pneumonia) with 84.22% accuracy. Researchers, Ozutark et al. [29] , used deep neural networks to find COVID-19 infection using potential patient X-ray images. The investigators used the presented model for you to look only once at real-time object detection system. DarkNet model used to perform binary classification with 98.08% accuracy and multi-class classification with 87.02% accuracy when using [32] applied customized VGG16 deep learning model for COVID-19 chest X-ray detection. The approach consists of three phases: first, pneumonia detection, if the answer is yes, the next phase is called, which distinguishes between COVID-19 and pneumonia, and finally the last phase is implemented to locate the areas in the COVID-19 presence X-ray. In the subsequent study by Panwar et al. [33] , a fusion of deep learning (VGG-19 inspired model) and Grad-CAMbased color visualization approach was employed on chest X-ray and CT-scan images for COVID-19 infection detection in the form of binary image classification. Grad-CAMbased color visualization approach was used to interpret and explains the detection of radiology images. The system attains an overall accuracy of 95.61%. Goel et al. [34] proposed an optimized OptCoNet picture classifying model to automatically detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images with six CNN architecture layers. The Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm played the role of optimizing hyperparameters required for training the CNN layers. Authors Jain et al. [35] compared three models, Inception V3, Xception and ResNeXt, in the subsequent study recently published to examine their efficacy detecting COVID-19 infections in patients with radiation images. The public repository has been selected for approximately 575 COVID-19 images; the Xception model is the most exact. Researchers suggested a deep CNN(DeTraC), which DCompose, Transfer and Compose for the classification of X-ray chest pictures of COVID-19 in the subsequent empirical study of Abbas et al. [36] . Five different CNN pre-trained ImageNet models were used for DeTraC 's transfer learning phase. Combining VGG-19 and DeTraC, model achieved the highest accuracy by 97.35%. For X-ray pictures detection, Practitioners Zebin et al. [37] used VGG-16,ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0. In the following study by Pun et al. [38] , researchers have used five pre-trained CNN models to identify chest X-ray infections in patients from 153 COVID-19 shortlisted images. In the subsequent article by Gianchandani et al. [5] , the authors proposed two different ensemble deep transfer learning models to predict subject disease and classify subject patient images into binary and multi-class problems. Researchers selected two different datasets for validation of the proposed models. The proposed ensemble model's performance (VGG16 + DenseNet) was compared with VGG16, ResNet152V2, InceptionResNetV2 and DenseNet201 and found to be best with 96.15% accuracy on the binary dataset. Later, in the case of Kaur et al. [39] authors used the same dataset of [5] for their experimentation. Researchers show the novelty in their work by proposing modified AlexNet architecture for feature extraction and classification. Strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm-II(SPEA-II) was employed to tune the hyperparameters of this modified imagenet. The proposed model's performance was compared with 09 models in which it performs the best with more than 99% accuracy. They tested for classifying images of the patients into four classes. Another approach was developed by researchers in [40] by ensembling the deep transfer learning models, ResNet152V2, DenseNet101 and VGG16. They gather approximately 11,000 images to classify them into four classes (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Tuberclosis and Healthy). The model's performance was compared with 06 existing models, and the generated results reveal that the proposed one was the best with more than 98% score (in all parameters like Accuracy, AUC, F-measure, sensitivity and specificity). Jaiswal et al. [41] presented a pre-trained deep learning architecture (DenseNet201) to classify COVID-19, infected patients, on the basis of their CT scan. They evaluate the performance with the other three competitive models (VGG16, InceptionResNet and DenseNet) on five efficiency measuring parameters. Authors conclude that their presented model with more than 96% score (in all parameters like Precision, Recall, F-Score, Specificity and Accuracy).

Deep learning with convolution is an effective way to simplify data processing. Computer models learn to perform classification tasks from pictures, text and sound. DL methods using several neural network layers can precisely extract and acquire specific characteristics from the data. These models are reliable, often sometimes outperforming humans. These models are trained by inputting a wide range of data. In Deep Learning, superior model efficiency can be observed as data quantity increases. With traditional methods, the output is the same after an initial wave. With vast volumes of data, Deep Learning will also be an optimal alternative to current classification methods. Additionally, CNN deep learning has fascinating advantages like low processing time, superior performance, high computing power and reliable outcomes (Prediction). Recent advancements in neural network architecture design and training have allowed researchers to solve previously unsustainable DL method learning tasks. Profound learning algorithms are contrasted with traditional algorithms. Convolution neural networks are one of the most popular DL approaches in medical imaging. The DL approach is a multi-stacked convolutionary algorithm. The CNN is composed of a convolutionary layer, a nonlinear layer and a softmax layer, a maximum or average pooling layer. Convolutionary layers also use pooling layers to increase invariance and reduce function map computing costs. It subsamples, the convolutional layer to reduce the feature map's size and computes the maximum and average function over the convolutional layer and are called max pooling and average pooling concerning the function they perform. Spacing in the pixels of the image is used with pooling and is called stride. The number of parameters in the model grows as networks deepen to optimize learning performance. Deep learning models require large volumes of data. Deeper networks lead to more complicated computation and more difficult training data. We don't have many photos to train, check and evaluate data. It appears too small to train a deep CNN, and we need a definition of transfer learning. Transfer learning uses the CNN model in an extensive database to understand the objective mission (e.g., diagnosis of COVID-19 from X-ray CT scans) with limited preparation details. Learning transition is the mechanism by which previously acquired information is passed to an alternate mission. This means",

Transfer learning (TL) considers the standard neural architecture and prepared weights on broad datasets and then changes the weights of the goal task with limited training data. Transfer learning is a technique used to pretrain models to its best growth so that we can have better efficiency than the present model we are using. It is a machine learning approach in which a model designed for one task is used as the foundation for a model on a different task. Given the large computing and time resources needed to build neural network models on these problems and the massive leaps inability to provide on similar problems, it is a common method in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. When modeling the second mission, transfer learning is an optimization that makes for faster development or increased results. Transfer learning enhances the learning of a new task by transferring information from a previously learned similar task. When modeling the second mission, transfer learning is an optimization that makes for faster development or increased results. TL is associated with multi-task learning and paradigm drift, and it is not solely a field of research for deep learning. Transfer learning is common in deep learning due to the immense resources needed to train deep learning models or the vast and challenging datasets used to train deep learning models. Deep learning only fits with transfer learning if the model features learned from the first challenge are standard. Shift learning entails initially training a base network on a base dataset and task and then repurposing or moving the learned features to a second target network trained on a target dataset and task. This process is more likely to succeed if the functionality is universal, applicable to both the base and target tasks, rather than unique to the base role. By reducing errors, an ensemble of transfer learning networks can be a stable solution. It generates optimum outcomes from the integrated networks for the fewest errors necessary. The convolutional neural network architecture is designed utilizing pre-trained models after data preprocessing. Researchers also applied the same approach in the recently published study for COVID-19 prediction [5, 41, 43, 44] . Researchers in their work [5] designed ensemble deep transfer learning models to predict this disease from chest X-ray images. Authors focused that TL uses feature extraction capabilities of pre-trained models on large datasets such as ImageNet, capturing class boundaries well. TL not only eliminates the need for a large dataset but also provides quick results. This motivates authors to incorporate these techniques into their proposed deep learning framework for COVID-19 classification. The authors of [43] employed a deep convolutional neural network as the backbone. They suggested three improvements (i) stochastic pooling to replace average classical pooling and maximum pooling methods; (ii) developing conv block by combining conv layer and batch normalization, and (iii) creating a fully connected block by combining dropout layer and fully connected layer. In the following study [44] by Zhang et al., the authors developed a novel method combining DenseNet and optimization of transfer learning setting (OTLS) strategy to solve COVID-19 prediction. Authors suggest that transfer learning is a solution to (i) accelerate developing CNN and (ii) avoid overfitting. Authors explore that with this technique's employability, researchers can develop a better performing deep neural network rapidly. The authors of [41] justify that hyper-tuning of Deep transfer learning models (DTL) can improve the results further; a DTL model with DenseNet201 was suggested in this study.",

Authors further explored that three elements are paramount to support the transfer are (i) The triumph of pretrained models supports the user get rid of hyperparameter tuning\" (ii)The initial layers in pre-trained models can be thought of as feature descriptors which extract low-level features and (iii) The target model may only need to re-train the last several layers of the pre-trained model. In this technique, we take one model, for example, VGG-16, and train it first; then we freeze all the models' layer; after that, we apply layers from our side on the model so we train the model on that part using the weights of VGG-16. This is a solid and robust technique for increasing the efficiency of the model. In other words, our approach is to train a solid, deep network to extract comprehensive visual properties by preparing broad data sets and then translating the network weights of this deep network into a small dataset's targeting mission. Fine-tuning is used to fine-tune the model we are using after the transfer learning technique; we used two parameters for fine-tuning early stopping and reducing rl over plateau. This technique helps to make the graph straighter and to reduce ridges in the graph. Early stopping is mainly used to stop the model when the validation accuracy or testing accuracy reaches its best height and when the loss is minimum in validation accuracy and training accuracy. For example, if we have used 50 epochs to train the model, the training is more sure to stop before 50 epochs when minimum loss and maximum accuracy have been reached. A general algorithm for all the models can be visualized as given below. models must be good in various ways; they must have different prediction errors. Combining projections from several neural networks introduces bias, which offsets the volatility of a single learned neural network construct. The result is forecasted that are less vulnerable to the particulars of the training data, training scheme selection, and the chance of a successful training run. In addition to minimizing prediction uncertainty, the ensemble can provide better predictions than any single model. This method is part of a broader class of techniques known as \"ensemble learning,\" which defines methods that aim to make the best use of predictions from Nonlinear methods include neural network simulations. Nonlinear methods include neural network simulations. This means they can discover dynamic nonlinear interactions in results. The disadvantage of this adaptability is that they are vulnerable to initial conditions, both in terms of initial random weights and statistical noise in the testing dataset. Since the learning algorithm is stochastic, each time a neural network model is learned, it can retain a marginally (or dramatically) different version of the mapping function from inputs to outputs, resulting in other performance on the training and holdout datasets. As such, we should consider a neural network to be a system with a low bias and a high variance. When trained on massive datasets to accommodate the high variance, allowing some variance in a final model designed to render predictions can be disappointing.",

As a result, we used Ensemble learning with a voting classifier to reduce our model's errors. The voting classifier also aids in reducing the likelihood of overfitting, thus improving the models' overall accuracy. Ensemble approaches are among the most appealing techniques. First and foremost, it connects the distinct core model through the Ensemble framework and generates a new optimal predictive model. Bagging is a form of ensemble process that uses bootstrapping and aggregation to create the ensemble system. Bootstrapped selected a random section of the dataset and built a decision tree for each random partition of the dataset.

First a model of VGG-16 from scratch is being downloaded and put upon the base model after that own model is created with layers of average pooling 2D with pool size 4, 4, Flatten layer, Dense layer of 64 neurons with ReLU activation, Dropout layer of 0.5 and dense layer of 2 neurons with Softmax activation. All these layers have been fine-tuned using early stopping and reducer lover plateau. Also due to the less quantity of images these images have been passed through data augmentation with batch size 16 and which flips the images, rotation angle set to 15 degrees and fill mode is nearest. The optimizers which have been tested are SGD, Nadam, AdaGrad. Here Nadam comes out to be best which fits the data for each dataset. In early stopping, the patience level is 5 and the learning rate for the optimizer is 0.001. Experiment has been performed up to 50 epochs. ResNet-101 has been applied in transfer learning fashion here, a model is put on the top of the base model which includes the following layer;Flatten, Dense(64),Batch Normalization, Activation tanh, Dropout 0.25,Dense 64,Batch Normalization, Activation tanh, Dropout 0.25,Dense 32,Batch Normalization, Activation tanh, Dropout 0.5,Dense 2,Activation Softmax. All these layers have been fine tuned and data augmented with batch size 16 and rotation angle 15 degree to increase the quantity of images. In fine tuning we have used early stopping with patience level of 5. Here also we have used optimizer Nadam with learning rate 0.01 to get the accuracy. Experiment has been performed upto 50 epochs. Xception net is used for classification of images in a more pr\u00e9cised way with some different layers as its base model and head model keeps the same as we have stated above like from the scratch. Its base model includes the layers of Global Average pooling 2D, Dense 200, Activation ReLU, Dropout 0.4, Dense 170,Activation ReLU, Dense 2 and Activation Softmax. This net is also data augmented with the same rotation angle of 15 degrees and fill mode to the nearest having early stopping with patience value of 6 setting up the best weights quality also using reduce rl over plateau for the softening of the graphs and to increase the accuracy of each dataset on which we have worked on. Optimizer here which we have used is Nadam which remains top in the list. Experiment has been performed upto 50 epochs. InceptionV3 net is a highly rated net and been applied in the phase of transfer learning having base model of Flatten, Dense 1024,Dropout 0.25,Dense 2 and Activation Softmax. This model also used data augmentation and fine tuning with early stopping having patience level of 5 and batch size of 16; the optimizers tested were nada, Nadam, SGD and AdaGrad. Experiment has been performed upto 50 epochs. InceptionResNetV2 net was proudly said to be used in transfer learning phase with data augmentation and fine tuning with early stopping and reducer lover plateau batch size 16 optimizer Nadam learning rate of 0.001 patience level 5. It's base model includes the following layers, Flatten, Dense(64),Batch Normalization, Activation tanh, Dropout 0.25,Dense 64,Batch Normalization, Activation tanh,Dropout 0.25,Dense 64,Batch Normalization, Activation tanh, Dropout 0.25,Dense 64,Batch Normalization, Activation tanh, Dropout 0.25,Dense 32,Batch Normalization, Activation tanh, Dropout 0.5,Dense 2,Activation Softmax. Experiment has been performed upto 50 epochs. It also has early stopping with patience level of 5 and having the best weights set this model is the best as compared to any other model having the less data leakage value as compared to other models it also used data augmentation which has a value of 15 degree angle of rotation batch size of 16 and 50 epochs. The epochs in all the cases remains same that is 50. MobileNet is another deep learning net which has been applied in the transfer learning fashion with head model as a mobile net and base model as stated below: Global average pooling 2D, Dense 1024,Activation ReLU,Dense 1024,Activation ReLU,Dense 512,Activation ReLU,Dense 2 and Activation Softmax. The optimizer here which we have used is Nadam with learning rate of 0.001with early stopping patience level 5 batch size 16 50 epochs. Data augmentation is applied with rotation angle of 15 degree. We have also used the best fit here in this case. DCGAN model has been trained on two models which are imposed on discriminator and generator. In this model discriminator has been used for discriminating the images from the right and wrong images the architecture of the discriminator and generator has been added.",

Such modifications made are highly practical for detection as LSTM runs faster than any CNN network. LSTM has been mostly used to compile the code in regression task but after some modification in transfer learning phase it can be used for image classification as it helps to classify the images; most of the aspects of it remains the same as the other models but the basic difference in this model is that there is large difference between the base model which we have used here.",

We are the frontrunners in using this LSTMCNN model for COVID-19 detection from X-ray and CT images to the best of our knowledge (Fig. 9 ). have created weights, and we have used those weights in another model. By doing so, we finally conclude that in between performance may decrease, but after passing those weights of the best model, it helps for sharpening of slopes and ultimately increases in accuracy. For each phase, we have trained the model on batch size 16 with Nadam as an optimizer. It can be analyzed that maybe the accuracy for a single model is less but cumulatively each model's accuracy comes out to be best.

            "text": "In classifying the images into COVID-19 and Non-COVID, this subsection presents the output of the models shortlisted. Confusion Matrix is a performance calculation used to solve classification problems in Deep Learning where output can be two or more classes (Refer Table 5 (1,2,3,4) (1,2,3,4) 5 16 (1,2) (3) 5 Unknown Example Fig. 11 Representation of the Confusion Matrix used in proposed work TN applies to people who do not have an infection, and the result is negative, and FN is a disease patient, but the test is negative which means prediction is negative, and a person is COVID-19 positive, the worst. Figure 11 shows the confusion matrix for proposed work where Negative (0) represents normal and Positive (1) represents COVID-19. Sensitivity (a true positive rate) and Recall (the number of true positives separated by the sum of a number of true positives and false negatives) are the preeminent measures of diagnostic precision. The evaluation shows us the frequency at which CNN accurately predicts COVID-19 infection. The sum of sensitivity and false negative incidence is the number of true negatives divided by the total number of checks. The accuracy is the number of true negatives divided by the number of true negatives and false positives. The sensitivity measure calculates just how much of the positive cases were correctly predicted, while the specificity measure determines just how much of the negative cases were correctly expected. The research shows that CNN's medical reporting is reliable for individuals who don't have COVID-19 infection. The recall is the number of accurate outcomes. Precision is how close to the target the sample comes. F1-score tests the accuracy of a source. The F1-score is a metric used to gauge model accuracy. It represents both accuracy and the test which is a recall for the computation of the score. The method incorporates the accuracy and recall of the model to determine a single value, the harmonic mean. Precision is the amount of significance the measurement has with the outcome. Precision can be defined as the number of true positives divided by the number of true positive and false positive. Accuracy is the most critical metric used to measure the efficiency (trueness) of the classifier model. The algorithm calculates the ratio of correctly defined photos vs the overall number of photographs in the dataset. Sensitivity and specificity scores help assess the accuracy of performance. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) is a graph of a classification model that shows how well a classification performs to decrease classification thresholds. A ROC curve maps True and False Positive against True Positive at differing degrees of classification. The Receiver Operational Characteristic (ROC) study shows a reliable calculation of COVID-19 classification. The region under the ROC curve indicates the sensitivity of the measurement; it is a curve drawn as the relationship between 1-specificity and sensitivity, showing the characteristic representation of the classification. The field under the curve is a partially independent vector. The plot of True Positive Rate versus False Positive Rate is the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. By calculating the degree of separability between different groups, the ROC reflects the model's investigative competence. It explores how our CNN can discriminate between normal and COVID-19.",

Table 11 . For all performance appraisal metrics, which shows the best models, we have complied Table 12 . We conclude that our selected models have demonstrated auspicious efficiency by achieving greater than 99% maximum accuracy and more than 96% average accuracy. Similarly, executing a maximum AUC greater than 0.995 and an average performance greater than 0.96, we have achieved fantastic performance. Finally, our models have produced the best F1 score of more than 0.99 again, focusing on F1 score, the average performance is also excellent with a value of 0.9682. Considering all the model's average performance over all the experiments, we infer from Tables 11, 12 that LSTM generates the highest average of 0.9645 AUC. In contrast, the highest generated standalone value of 16 experiments is greater than 0.99. When we tried to compare our performance with other shortlisted studies, we realize that a fair comparison cannot be made because of the difference in the chosen datasets, performance metrics and validation. However, in a comparatively large dataset, we have justified the use of ours. The scale of the dataset that other researchers have chosen is slightly smaller. For instance, in the study [25] , the subject model achieved 88.10% accuracy on 284 images (142 COVID images). When the performance comparison is made between ours and [24] , we find that in the case of [24] , the number of tests, the number of models chosen for research and the size of the dataset is smaller, the accuracy shown by the model is 95.80% which is lower than that of average performance and highest performance.",

The system provided a total accuracy rate of 86.7%.

Binary classification has also been performed by authors where the model generates a 99% and 0.985 accuracy and F1 score, respectively. Binary classification has also been carried out; our highest results are also in the same line as that produced in this report. Besides, the authors have not compared their proposed model to other existing models, and the number of models tested and the size of COVID-19 images used in experiments is also smaller than that of our research. Researchers from the following study [31] present a deep SqueezeNet-based, COVIDiagnosis-Net, Bayesian optimization-based method to diagnose the disease from X-ray images. The experimentation was carried out on 5310 images that contain only 66 images of COVID-19. Overall, the technique yields 0.9826 precision and 0.9825 F1-score.

Jain et al. [35] compared three models, Inception V3, Xception and ResNeXt, in the following study just published; authors shortlisted the public repository for about 575 COVID-19 images.

In this context, we want to assure that there is a very rare chance of this in present empirical work. Data augmentation was used to correct the imbalance dataset and avoid overfitting during training. The Xception model was the best performer, with the highest accuracy and F1 score of 97.97% and 0.95, respectively. Researchers suggested a deep CNN (DeTraC) that decomposes, transfers and composes for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images in the subsequent empirical analysis by Abbas et al. [36] . Just 105 COVID-19 images were in the database selected for function, 70:30 split ratio training-testing was preserved. For the transfer learning stage in DeTraC, five dissimilar ImageNet pre-trained CNN models were used. The highest accuracy of 97.35 percent was achieved by combining VGG-19 with DeTraC. Practitioners Zebin et al. [37] used VGG-16, ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 for classification and 202 shortlisted COVID-19 images were split into training-testing ratios of 80:20. In the case of EfficientNetB0, the best accuracy of 96.8% was achieved. The investigators engaged five pre-trained CNN models in this final analysis by Punn et al.

A rise in patients, insufficient government planning, and an increase in funding (people and services) add to the crisis. The situation is more difficult because the RT-PCR test kits (having lower sensitivity) are not readily available in certain countries. The patients have not been diagnosed as expected (suspected or proven) and have not been placed in an isolated area, resulting in hotspots (potential infection source). The detrimental impact is profound in all industries like engineering, tours and tourism, vehicles, culture, and the education market. A report (https:// www. dento ns. com/ en/ insig hts/ alerts/ 2020/ march/ 11/ COVID-19-and-its-impact-on-the-global-econo my) predicts the global loss of 1.1 trillion dollars. To date, the exact solution to this deadly disease is not found, and even the just retired first citizen of the USA got also infected from it. It is a common challenge to differentiate and reliably diagnose COVID-19 from other diseases. We proposed a system in which a fully automated end-to-end chest X-ray and CT interpretation was evaluated using well-known and designed deep-learning-based approaches. The system extracts what they need on their own, and there is no need for human intervention. When training is done on large datasets, network weights are trained and fine-tuned on small datasets. The data is standardized, and preprocessing steps are carried out first, and then models produce outputs by differentiating the input images from unsafe ones.",

This will satisfy the immediate need for human society to explain its practical applicability. Anyone can see the results within 5 s from our trained models with high accuracy and discriminative ability; it can also play an assistant's role during X-ray/CT imaging in radiology departments of hospitals / medical colleges. To check the outcomes, all the standard performance evaluation indicators such as Accuracy, AUC and F1-score are validated. Our hybrid and ensemble deep learning model offer a unique benefit in this study. The user can pick the deep learning model's best output to identify each diseased case separately.",

The best results were found using our LSTMCNN model and our proposed ensemble deep transfer learning model. We have used these two robust deep learning-based models to characterize and detect the infection; they can recognize chest X-ray/CT images abnormalities. The outputs of these auspiciously performing model(s) can be used as a second opinion and can help physicians make the best decision and accurate diagnosis by effectively detecting abnormalities. These models capture radiographic features from low-level image data and can recognize complex patterns that radiologists may overlook. These models reduce wait times for diagnosis. Using these models, hospitals can identify and isolate the patients early, preventing the virus from spreading in the community, ultimately saving the life and money. Besides, it reduces the exposure of nurses and medical staff to the outbreak. We can use this proposed system to guide isolation in a real-time setting for patients at risk for COVID-19. Preliminary analysis of the samples can help in determining whether quarantine measures are appropriate. Our best performing, fully automated, inexpensive, rapid and accurate binary classifier models can be employed in health care centres situated at remote locations to analyze X-ray and CT images to resolve the issues like the absence of qualified radiologists and wait for the testing kits to arrive.",

Intense experimentation is performed in this work, where 16 experiments are performed using 20 models. The proposed models are tested over three well-known datasets and one private dataset to prove their versatility. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed models achieved incredible accuracy for binary classification and outperformed the other shortlisted competitive COVID-19 classification models. Health practitioners and researchers may leverage these models to improvise this infection's prediction in this worldwide ongoing pandemic situation. Although two of our models (LSTMCNN and ensemble deep transfer learning model) produced an encouraging performance in a considerably more extensive dataset, it has few limitations worth mentioning. The method is limited to 2 class classifications, COVID-19 and Non-COVID, of the X-ray and CT images. Testing in multi-class classification (like COVID-19, normal and pneumonia) is not performed in this work. Moreover, the segmentation of the infected region is not performed. In this study, it is believed that patients have a single disease if it exists.",

This study was a unique study on COVID-19 diagnosis and maybe the first of its kind. The experimental findings show that 86.66%, 0.9189 and 0.6250 respectively, were the highest produced accuracy, F1-score and AUC values when identifying patients with infection. Two approach tests, tenfold cross-validation and train-test split was conducted. LSTM performs best in the previous strategy, while one CNNLSTM combination performs best with 92.30% accuracy, 0.9300 F1-score and 0.900 AUC in the latter. Researchers[23] have experimented with a private dataset for clinical screening of COVID-19 infection using 10 pre-existing transfer-learned structured convolutionary networks. A single experiment on a moderate size dataset (510 COVID-19 images) was performed during the study. Researchers propose ResNet-101 and Xception as the best performing model that can play an adjuvant instrument in the radiology departments of medical colleges/hospitals due to this experimental research. These models obtained the highest AUC (0.994) and accuracy (99.51%), however, the number of tests, the size of combined datasets, and the number and form of selected models are more significant.The authors of",
