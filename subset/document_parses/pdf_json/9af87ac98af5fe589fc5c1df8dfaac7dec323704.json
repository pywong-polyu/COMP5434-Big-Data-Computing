            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global threat, and host immunity remains the main mechanism of protection against the disease. The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a major antigen and its engagement with human ACE2 receptor plays an essential role in viral entry into host cells. Consequently, antibodies targeting the ACE2-interacting surface (ACE2IS) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein can neutralize the virus. However, the understanding of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still limited, and it is unclear how the virus protects this surface from recognition by antibodies. Here, we designed an RBD mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS and used it to characterize the prevalence of antibodies directed to the ACE2IS from convalescent sera of 94 COVID-19-positive patients. We found that only a small fraction of RBD-binding antibodies targeted the ACE2IS. To assess the immunogenicity of different parts of the spike protein, we performed in vitro antibody selection for the spike and the RBD proteins using both unbiased and biased selection strategies. Intriguingly, unbiased selection yielded antibodies that predominantly targeted regions outside the ACE2IS, whereas ACE2IS-binding antibodies were readily identified from biased selection designed to enrich such antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies from an unbiased selection using the RBD preferentially bound to the surfaces that are inaccessible in the context of whole spike protein. These results suggest that the ACE2IS has evolved less immunogenic than the other regions of the spike protein, which has important implications in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",

As of October 25th 2020, over 42 million cases have been confirmed globally, leading to 1.1 million deaths (https://www.who. int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/ situation-reports/). A number of drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 are currently in clinical trials, yet no agents or vaccines have been approved by the government agencies. As such, the host immune responses remain the main source of protection against the virus. Still many aspects of the immune responses and the strategies employed by the virus to evade them are unknown.",

            "text": "The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is mediated by a virus-surface spike glycoprotein that forms a trimer (Figure 1(A) ). 1, 2 The spike protein is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit interacts with the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial step in cell attachment, whereas the S2 subunit plays a role in the fusion of the viral and cellular membrane, a crucial step in cell entry. 2, 3 The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit is the domain that binds ACE2 with an affinity in the low nanomolar range, 2, 4, 5 and this interaction initiates the conformational change of the spike protein from the pre-fusion state to the post-fusion state. Consequently, antibodies targeting the ACE2-interacting surface (ACE2IS) located in the RBD of the spike protein can compete with the RBD-ACE2 interaction, serving as neutralizing antibodies. Indeed, such antibodies isolated from COVID-19 patients showed potent neutralization effects and are being developed as therapeutics. [6] [7] [8] [9] Thus, eliciting antibodies targeting the ACE2IS from the immune system should be critical for controlling and preventing COVID-19.",

            "text": "A region of an antigen is considered immunogenic if it is readily recognized by antibodies, although many aspects in the immune responses of the host can influence the overall immunogenicity. It has been shown that antibodies and antibody-like binders derived from unbiased selections disproportionately target functional surfaces of a protein. 10, 11 Thus, protein-protein interaction interfaces such as the ACE2IS in the RBD of the spike protein are expected to be highly immunogenic. From the viewpoint of viral evolution, there should be a strong selective pressure favoring the protection of a region that is crucial for the viral life-cycle from host immune attacks. For example, the CD4binding site of the HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein is situated in a deep cleft heavily protected by glycosylation. 12 However, studies revealed that the spike proteins of coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are less densely glycosylated than the other viral spike proteins including, HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin envelop. 13, 14 In particular, the RBD is less shielded by glycans as compared with the rest of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. 14, 15 The RBD and the ACE2IS are the most distal parts of the spike protein in the assembled virus and thus it should be more accessible to antibodies and B-cells. Taken together, the ACE2IS of the SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be substantially more immunogenic than anticipated based on its surface exposure. Intriguingly, a number of studies of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses in COVID-19 patients have revealed that, although most convalescent plasmas from COVID-19 patients contain antibodies targeting the spike protein and the RBD, they have low neutralization activity. [16] [17] [18] Thus, analysis of the immunogenic surfaces, or the \"immunogenicity landscape\", of the spike protein and the RBD in terms of eliciting high-affinity antibodies should provide important insights into the antibody response to COVID-19 as well as vaccine design, because the spike protein and the RBD are the antigens in most first- The RBD in complex with ACE2 (PDB 6M0J).

The ACE2IS in the RBD is mainly composed of three contact regions, CR1, CR2 and CR3 (Figure 1(B) ). 19 From each contact region, we chose a key residue (N487, Q493 and N501) that forms hydrogen bond (s) with residues in ACE2, and mutated them to Lys residues to disrupt both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions (Figure 1 (B), Supplementary Figure 1 ). We term this mutant as RBD-T hereafter. Binding analysis using ACE2-expressing cells showed that the RBD bound to ACE2 with high affinity (K D~2 0 nM), consistent with previous reports, 1,2,5 and that RBD-T nearly completely lost binding to ACE2 (Figure 1 (C)). Likewise, these mutations should disrupt binding of neutralizing antibodies targeting the ACE2IS (see below). We note that not all neutralizing antibodies would fail to bind to RBD-T, because some neutralizing antibodies do not directly bind to the ACE2IS. 20 A binding assay using the RBD and RBD-T is a straightforward method to determine whether antibodies recognize the ACE2IS or not, and thus we utilized the RBD-T as an epitope analysis tool for anti-RBD antibodies.",

Strikingly, more than 60% of the signal was lost in the presence of the RBD-T competitor in 80% of the serum samples, indicating that the majority of the antibodies that bound to the RBD in convalescent sera did not target the ACE2IS ( Figure 2 (A) and (B)).

The recovery of antibody clones in the in vitro selection primarily depends on the strength of binding to the antigen, and thus analyzing specificity and epitopes of enriched antibodies enables us to determine the immunogenicity landscape of the antigens from the point of the direct antibody-antigen interaction under welldefine conditions. We used a synthetic antibody library that is constructed based on both intrinsic amino acid bias in immune repertoires and knowledge of structures and functions of naturally occurring antibodies. 21, 22 This, and closely related antibody libraries, have generated numerous highaffinity antibodies to diverse proteins. 23 Of importance for this study, this library uses the IGHV3 framework, which is closely related to the IGHV3-53 germline that is frequently found in RBDbinding antibodies (see Discussion). 24 We first performed selection for antibodies against the spike protein and the RBD in an unbiased manner, that is, we did not incorporate steps that might bias the recovery of antibodies binding to different epitopes ( Figure 3 (A)). Clones from the 3rd and 4th rounds of selection were randomly picked, and their sequences and binding specificity were characterized in the phage-display format. We identified 95 unique clones out of 120 randomly picked colonies from the spike selection campaign (Figure 3 (A)). Strikingly, 89% of the clones bound to the spike protein but not the RBD or RBD-T (\"Spike only\" binders), indicating that these antibodies recognize the surfaces of the spike protein outside the RBD or the surfaces that partially consists of the RBD (Figure 3 (A) and (B)). Only 11% of the clones showed ability to bind to the spike protein as well as the RBD and RBD-T (\"Spike + RBD\" binders), and antibodies binding to the ACE2IS, as judged by the ability to bind to the RBD but not to RBD-T, were not identified from this selection.

            "text": "We have shown that the ACE2IS is more difficult to target with our synthetic antibody library than the rest of the RBD and the spike protein. Because no synthetic library can completely recapitulate the human antibody repertoire, one might view that these results are a reflection of limitations of our library, rather than the antigenic landscape of the spike protein. The following considerations strongly suggest that this is not the case. Neutralizing anti-RBD antibodies from recovered patients show clear biases in germline usage. The IGHV3-53 germline is the most frequently used IGHV gene for neutralizing anti-RBD antibodies and the residues in CDRH1 and CDRH2 encoded by the IGHV3-53 germline are important for RBD binding. 24 Our synthetic antibody library is based on the human V3 germline sequence, and residues in CDRH1 and H2 are diversified based on intrinsic amino acid bias in native immune repertoires. 21, 22 It has only minor differences, two substitutions in CDRH1 and a single residue insertion in CDRH2, from IGHV3-53 (Supplementary Table 1) . Thus, our library should be more predisposed to generating anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies than a library that faithfully recapitulates the human antibody diversity. More importantly, we have identified several antibodies binding to ACE2IS by utilizing biased selection (Figure 3(A) ). If the architecture of our library were substantially mismatched to the germline sequences required for RBD binding, our ACE2IS-binding antibodies would be rare clones containing unusual sequences that are not expected from our library design. However, the sequences of the ACE2IS-binding clones match our library design (Supplementary Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 1 ), suggesting that we should find many clones if the ACE2IS were highly immunogenic. Taken together, although our library does not fully recapitulate human antibody repertories, it covers a large fraction of the antibody sequence space capable of producing anti-RBD antibodies.",

Our data suggest that the spike protein has highly immunogenic surfaces outside the RBD, which enrich antibodies that target these epitopes and deplete antibodies to the RBD. The structure and conformational dynamics of the spike protein offer possible mechanistic basis for the low immunogenicity of the RBD. The RBD in the up conformation is largely exposed on the spike surfaces, whereas the RBD in the down conformation is buried in the spike protein (Figures 1(A) and 4(A) ). Structural studies of the spike protein revealed that zero, one or two RBDs but not all three RBDs in the spike trimer form the up conformation at a given time. 1, 2, 25, 26 Consequently, the RBD is largely in the down conformation and most of the RBD is less exposed than the rest of the spike surfaces (Figure 4(A) ). Furthermore, it has been reported that the RBD in the up conformation shows higher mobility than that in the down conformation. 25 Thus, both a lack of the complete exposure of the RBD and conformational mobility of the RBD probably contribute to the challenges in recognizing the RBD by antibodies when the spike protein is used as the antigen.",

One possible explanation for the minimal immunogenicity of the ACE2IS is its conformational flexibility. Although the ACE2IS is well defined when bound to ACE2 or to an antibody, it is disordered in the free spike structures (Figure 4(B) ), 1, 2, 4, [27] [28] [29] [30] suggesting that the ACE2IS is inherently flexible. It is difficult to generate antibodies to a flexible region, due to a large loss of conformational entropy upon binding that disfavors binding.

Most of vaccine candidates utilize the spike protein or the RBD as antigens (https:// www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscapeof-covid-19-candidate-vaccines). In our studies, 89% of antibodies from the unbiased selection for the spike protein recognize regions outside the RBD, and 83% of antibodies from the unbiased selection for the RBD recognize the surfaces on the RBD that are inaccessible in the context of the spike protein. These data imply that potent neutralizing antibodies targeting the ACE2IS may not be induced efficiently by only immunizing with the spike protein or only with the RBD. Consistent with this view, it has been reported that the majority of spike-binding antibodies that were generated in a patient during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection were not neutralizing and bind outside the RBD. 31 Similarly, Juno et al. observed a high frequency of B cells that target the spike protein outside the RBD in recovered patients with COVID-19. 18 Our data demonstrate that the ACE2IS can be readily targeted by antibodies in the biased selection. Although such control of the human immune responses using designed antigens is impossible in the course of natural infection, we envision that a two-step vaccination scheme using the RBD followed by the spike protein could improve the efficiency of eliciting antibodies targeting the ACE2IS that confer strong viral neutralization.",

The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 8% CO 2 for 7 days. The cell culture supernatants were collected by centrifuge, and supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1 mM PMSF. The recombinant proteins were purified from the filtrated supernatants using a HisTrap excel column (GE Healthcare). The purified proteins were biotinylated in vitro using the BirA enzyme in the presence of 0.5 mM Biotin and 10 mM ATP. The biotinylated proteins were further purified using the HisTrap excel column, and dialyzed into PBS. Purity of proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 (GE Healthcare) for the spike protein and a Superdex 75 10/300 (GE Healthcare) for the RBD and the RBD triple mutant showed a monodispersed and single peak with the expected molecular mass (Supplementary Figure 1) . Synthetic human antibodies in the biotinylated format were expressed and purified as described previously. 22 Establishment of ACE2-expressing A549 cells A549 cells were transfected with pLenti.ACE2 lentiviral vector that encodes ACE2 and puromycin resistance. 33 After two days, the cells were selected in medium containing 2 lg/ml puromycin and cloned at limiting dilution. Individual cell clones were screened by flow cytometry for high ACE2 expression and a single cell clone was expanded.",

The beads were mixed with the equal volume of PBSB containing 15 nM of biotinylated RBD or biotinylated RBD-T and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Biotin at a final concentration of 2.5 lM was then added to the solution and incubated for 5 min. The beads were washed once using a magnetic stand and resuspended at 0.5 mg/ml. Five microliters of the beads were aliquoted in each well of a 96-well filter plate (Millipore), the liquid was removed using a vacuum chamber and the wells were washed once with 150 lL of PBST containing 1% (w/v) skim milk. Serum samples were heat-treated at 56\u00b0C for 1 h and diluted 158fold in PBST containing 1% (w/v) skim milk, and 25 lL each was added to the plate. For competition reactions, biotinylated RBD-T and streptavidin were mixed in such a way that all the biotin binding sites of streptavidin (tetramer) were occupied with RBD-T, and the complex was added to the serum solutions at a final concentration of 1 lM (calculated as monomer). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature with mixing on a shaker, the wells were washed twice with 150 lL of PBST-BSA (PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20). The staining with a secondary antibody (anti-human IgG (FC gamma specific)-Alexa488, Jackson Immunoresearch), diluted 1/800 in PBS containing 1 % BSA, was performed in a total volume of 25 lL for 30 min at room temperature with shaking.
