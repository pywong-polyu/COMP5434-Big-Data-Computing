To explore the emotional change of the public in China at the outburst of the pandemic at different phases, to establish an online working platform and create a new model of an online intervention to hold public emotions under pandemic, and test its effectiveness, so to give advisement for government emergency management system. We established an online organization to work for this program ad innovated a model of online group counseling with online emotional support accompany group (OESAG) right after the outburst of a pandemic. We analyzed 53 OESAGs from February 10 to April 9, including 555 application forms, 253 feedback from members, and 139 feedback from group leaders by using NVivo and SPSS to explore the evolution and characteristics of public emotion during COVID-19 and the effectiveness of OESAG. Our results showed that the emotional changes of members ranged from shock to depression to positive. The public's emotions swiftly changed from stress, anxiety, and isolation, to the hope of returning to work or finding a job during the pandemic with the help of OESAG. OESAG has effectively regulated the negative emotions of members by conducting psychological crisis intervention to provide members a space to communicate with each other, especially the female and frontline staff. Policy makers can set up an online systematic psychological crisis intervention system as soon as possible to make up for the lack of psychological assistance in the emergency management system.",

While a lot of people lost their lives, others have been quarantined and kept a social distance from others. Many people have thus reported feelings of rejection, isolation, panic, and depression (Naqvi, 2020; Taylor et al., 2020b) , and some have even committed suicide (Elbogen et al., 2020) . These are all causes of mental health problems (Li et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021) , psychological crisis (Abir et al., 2021; P\u00e9r\u00e8s et al., 2021) , and even PTSD (Budden, 2009; Fenster et al., 2018) , which may, in turn, bring an unstable society and potential decrease in productivity. Psychotherapy is very important under this pandemic, but it is also difficult to perform traditional in-person psychological interventions. Also, individual psychotherapy fails to meet the huge demand. Thus, a model of online group psychotherapy needs to be innovated.",

On February 10, February 18, and March 8, 2020, the number of people infected with the COVID-19 pandemic in China was 37,626, 74,185, and 80,735 , and the cumulative number of deaths was 1,016, 2,004, and 3,119, respectively. Although the increase in the number of infections has declined, the cumulative deaths are still increasing, and this may cause a psychological crisis for the Chinese public. Data from China, for example, suggests that 25% of the general population has experienced moderate to severe levels of anxietyor stress-related symptoms in response to COVID-19 (Qiu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . Likewise, there is evidence of considerable distress specific to COVID-19. Indeed, several investigators have reported elevated levels of fear of infection (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Lee and Neimeyer, 2020; Mertens et al., 2020) , as well as an elevated prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder . Recent research based on data collected in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic from a large American and Canadian population-representative sample suggests that epidemic-related distress may comprise a network of five interconnected symptom categories-danger and contamination fears, socioeconomic concerns, xenophobia, traumatic stress symptoms, and compulsive checking and reassurance seeking-corresponding to a COVID stress syndrome (Taylor et al., 2020a,b) .",

However, there is no social-psychological service guarantee mechanism in the emergency management system of China. The emergency management life cycle can be divided into four parts: disaster prevention and mitigation, emergency preparedness, emergency response, recovery, and reconstruction. Emergency response has attracted the attention of the government and the public (Kong and Sun, 2021) . As an important part of emergency response, psychological intervention and assistance have not received enough attention in China. This is not conducive to the recovery of the public psychological crisis during and after the pandemic. Therefore, we have designed the online emotional support accompany Group (OESAG) to make up for the lack of psychological intervention and psychological assistance in the emergency management system of China. By providing virtual space for members who are our psychological crisis intervention object to share their emotions, they are able to see and be seen by themselves and others to support each other and get feedback to make them feel connected, supported, safe, and secure, and they can be empowered to endure the vulnerability under pandemic. OESAG was created right after the pandemic and got provided to the public during the pandemic; emotional data before and after the group psychotherapy was also got collected to describe the emotional change of the public and intervene in emotional distress during the pandemic. Furthermore, we would improve the effectiveness of OESAG in psychological crisis intervention during COVID-19 by using the triangulation method which combines qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, and case analysis.",

Emotion differs in the positive-negative dimension and can be divided into different categories of emotions such as interest, enjoyment, sadness, anger, fear, etc (Izard, 2009; Izard et al., 2011) . In order to adapt to changes in the environment, people's emotions are constantly changing, and when stimulated by changes in the external environment, people's emotions are activated (Levenson, 1999) . COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern that has caused a huge psychological crisis (Elbogen et al., 2020; Brouzos et al., 2021) . A psychological crisis refers to an individual encountering an event or situation that has a significant psychological impact and cannot effectively cope with it using existing psychological resources. It may cause an imbalance or dangerous state in cognition, emotion, body, or behavior (Everly and Mitchell, 2000) . The occurrence of major emergencies, including COVID-19, whose transmission methods are complicated and fastchanging, has caused panic and powerlessness among the public to a large extent. The mental health of the public has been greatly affected by psychological crises or even psychological diseases emerging in some areas (Tang et al., 2020; Abir et al., 2021) .",

Group counseling is widely used in psychological counseling for children and youth groups who have experienced disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes (Grolnick et al., 2018) . This activity has a significant effect on post-disaster mental health (Austin and Godlesk, 1999) .

The project was conducted between February 10 to 17 (phase one), 2020, February 18 to March 1 (phase two), and March 8 to April 9 (phase three). OESAG was conducted via the online working platform we established. A total of 53 groups were recruited.

All the data are listed in Table 1 . NVivo (Version 12.0, Qualitative analysis software, QSR International, Melbourne, Australia) and SPSS (Version 22.0, IBM, USA) are used for data analysis. We analyzed the application forms at three periods to understand the emotional change of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyzed the feedback forms to explore the effectiveness of OESAG by triangular mutual printing methods which included qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, and case analysis. Specifically, we used NVivo 12 to analyze the feedback forms of group members and leaders to explore the effect of OESAG on public psychological crisis intervention by extracting highfrequency words from responses to the feedback forms of group members and leaders, used SPSS 22 to explore the reliability and validity of the feedbacks of group members and leaders, and used the case analysis to further confirm the results of the qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis.",

The members had more needs for \"support, \" \"company, \" \"anxiety, \" \"relieve, \" etc. The demands of the members in the first period focused on the work stress caused by the pandemic, so they were more willing to establish connections with others in hopes of obtaining company and psychological support from OESAG. OESAG can help members relieve anxiety and provide professional psychological support advice. In the second period, \"support\" and \"company\" were still the main demands of the members, and their anxiety had increased significantly. Compared with the first period, members in the second period mentioned \"understand\" and \"listen, \" expressing their desire to have listened to and to relieve anxiety through OESAG. As the pandemic gradually stabilized, the demands of the prospective members changed significantly in the third period, and \"work\" began to become the main topic of concern for the members again. The recovery of online work and part of offline work increased the sense of reality for members and their work stress caused by the pandemic was alleviated. As the public gradually returned to normal work or looked for new jobs, the demands for \"psychological support, \" \"relieve stress or anxiety, \" and \"emotional adjustment\" were apparent.",

They include themes of OESAG, group dynamics of OESAG, the psychological crisis of focus members, and goal achievement evaluation of OESAG. The leaders' feedback form in the first period is relatively simple and is different from that of the latter two periods, so we did not conduct a word cloud analysis on the leaders' feedback for the first period. Figure 5A shows the word cloud figure of the themes of OESAG. The key words for OESAG's themes are pandemic, anxiety, self, stress, study, life, etc. Since people can only stay at home due to the pandemic, there were anxiety and pressure on their lives, studies, and work. On the one hand, people are threatened by the pandemic and had a sense of panic; on the other hand, because of the pandemic, they had to stay at home, which was inconvenient to their daily life, study, work, etc. Some people may even lose their jobs. Therefore, they needed a platform to talk and vent their emotions so that they can receive emotional support from others. Figure 5B presents the word cloud figure about the group dynamics of OESAG. The main words are cohesion, relationship, support, sharing, conflict, etc. During the pandemic, people stayed at home and faced conflicts in various aspects such as family relations, study, work, etc. By guiding the group members to share their own experiences and emotions, the leaders gave them a sense of security in the group to break through the psychological defense and resistance between members, thus establishing a relationship of mutual trust, safety, and stability. Furthermore, the group was able to form a cohesive force and strong group dynamics to ensure the achievement of group goals. Figure 5C shows the word cloud figure of the psychological crisis of focus members. The key words are work, anxiety, sharing, pandemic, support, women, etc. Leaders also focused on describing the focus members, especially female focus members, who suffered a greater psychological impact from the outbreak as well as higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression . They found that the pandemic not only brought anxiety to members' work or study, but also great challenges to front-line staff (such as teachers, police, community workers, psychological counselors, and civil servants) whose emotions are also in need of attention (Zhang et al., 2021) . Figure 5D presents the goal achievement evaluation of OESAG. The key words are achieved, support, company, sharing and get, etc. Most leaders believed that the goals of OESAG have basically been achieved. Group members had enough time to speak and share their own feelings and experiences, thus a link through mutual listening, companionship, and support was formed to relieve the tension caused by the pandemic. However, there are also a few leaders who thought that OESAG had some problems. The problems include lack of group dynamics, not enough participating members, and separation of individual members. These are aspects that we need to think through and improve on in the future.",

The specific questions are tabulated in Tables 3,  4 . And the options are very incompatible, incompatible, and very incompatible, and members or leaders can choose the corresponding options according to their conditions. Table 3 shows the reliability and validity analysis of members' goal achievement in the group. Each item's coefficients of Cronbach's alpha are all above 0.8, and the total coefficient of Cronbach's alpha is 0.880, which is also above 0.8, indicating that the reliability effect is very good. In addition, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) is 0.830 > 0.6 (Kaiser and Rice, 1974) , and the significance level of Bartlett's test of sphericity is Sig = 0.000 < 0.050, indicating that the significance test (Pett et al., 2004) was passed and the validity was proven to be good. In summary, the good reliability and validity once again prove that members had basically achieved their goals.

Table 5 shows the effectiveness evaluation of 80 group members on OESAG. The items of effectiveness evaluation include: \"I was very close to other members in the group, \" \"I had new discoveries and learning in the group, \" \"I was being listened to carefully by other members in the group, \" \"I felt very safe in the group, \" \"My emotions in the group were vented, \" \"I became more positive after joining the group\".

The remaining members believed that these items were either \"not sure, inconsistent, or very consistent, \" which is a minority. Therefore, we can see that most of the group members had a positive evaluation of OESAG and believed that they have gained a lot from OESAG. Table 6 shows the effectiveness evaluation of 36 group leaders on OESAG. The items of effectiveness evaluation include: \"Members had new discoveries and learning in the group, \" \"Members listened carefully to each other, \" \"Members felt very safe in the group, \" \"The emotions of the members in the group were vented, \" and \"Members became more positive\". The ratio of group members who believed these items were \"consistent to very consistent\" is 94.45, 100, 91.67, 97.22, and 91.66%, which are all above 90%. These data indicate that most of the group leaders have a positive evaluation of OESAG and believe that OESAG has a positive effect on group members by effectively addressing their psychological crisis of members.",

In the feedback after OESAG, the member 03BJ-XHJ felt \"listening, and I felt that I was being cared for and concerned with, and this promoted the smooth progress of everyone's communication.

This is a reflection of the process of the member being paid attention to and building trust with the group. \"Pay attention to everyone and allow them to speak and maintain a good communication atmosphere\" (Case 03BJ-XHJ). This engages the members to start self-exposure, and members feel that \"it is very necessary for everyone to communicate together as their own problems will appear smaller in the group, and the power of the group is great\" (Case 03BJ-XHJ). In addition, the member 03BJ-XHJ also found that \"there is something beyond my reach. Although there is no answer yet for my own question, I was able to start thinking on my own and needs to be completed by myself \" (Case 03BJ-XHJ), which is an explanation of self-effort and a manifestation of loneliness.

Firstly, the mentality trajectories of members ranged from shock to depression to positive. As the pandemic gradually stabilized, \"work\" became the main topic of concern once gained for the public, and their stress or anxiety mainly came from returning to normal work or looking for a new job which is consistent with the Kubler-Ross Change Curve (Kubler-Ross, 1969 ). In addition, OESAG conducted psychological crisis interventions on group members through online methods which have effectively played a role in regulating the negative emotions of members. Due to COVID-19, people ad to stay home and maintain a social distance from others. This exacerbated their feelings of rejection, anxiety, and depression (Naqvi, 2020; Taylor et al., 2020b) , which may cause psychological crisis (Abir et al., 2021; P\u00e9r\u00e8s et al., 2021) . OESAG provides a platform for people during the COVID-19 pandemic to share their emotions and help them feel more positive and powerful. Moreover, female groups suffered a greater psychological impact from the outbreak as well as higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during COVID-19 . COVID-19 also brought great challenges to frontline staff such as medical staff. At the initial stage of the pandemic, the government had focused more on the mental health of patients and neglected medical staff (Ang et al., 2013) . However, compared with the general public, they have more direct and long-term contact with patients with COVID-19, exposing them to a higher risk of contracting the pandemic (Montemurro, 2020) and thus more likely to experience negative emotions (Zhang et al., 2021) . Furthermore, OESAG aims to eliminate or reduce the negative emotions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing emotional links between group members. Under the leadership and self-demonstration of group leaders, group members had communicated and shared with each other to form a mutually supportive emotional link to relieve stress, anxiety, or other negative emotions of members. Therefore, policy makers should establish a systematic psychological crisis intervention system and a supportive effect evaluation system as soon as possible to give more attention to psychological crisis intervention for female and frontline staff.",

            "text": "However, OESAG also has its limitations. First, the control of time. Group members have given feedback that the communication was relatively short and it was not enough to fully share their emotions. Second, the number of members in each group should also be managed to avoid having too many or too few members in each group due to absence, late arrival, early leaving, etc. Third, the psychological crisis intervention for different groups lacks obvious pertinence. Finally, due to the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the time of organizing OESAG is relatively urgent, so there is no systematization in the recruitment criteria, and everyone can apply. Therefore, we think OESAG not only provides the function of the experiment but also provides the function of observation and treatment, so we will further establish a systematic platform so that it can be quickly activated to relieve the psychological crisis of the public after a major health incident. This way, we can help the public quickly log on to the platform and get the opportunity to share their own emotions, listen to others, as well as feel the link and support. We should begin by constructing a more structured program to better connect the various processes of the platform and train the leaders more efficiently. We should then aim to set a supportive group to provide people with space to express themselves, be listened to, and feel connected. In this way, the number of people will not be limited to just a consulting group. In addition, if there are enough psychological experts involved, we can establish a broad platform, so the intervention of large-scale government public psychological managers can be initiated in the future. Finally, we should also find ways to further improve the pertinence of psychological crisis intervention for different groups, such as frontline staff, the general public, and patients, in the future.
