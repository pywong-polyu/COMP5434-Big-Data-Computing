To our knowledge, the present study is one of the first studies to address cyberbullying among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional objectives were to reveal the causes and types of cyberbullying that university students from East and Southeast Asia have experienced because of COVID-19, and to explore the relationship between cyberbullying and self-esteem. Of the 525 university students from different East and Southeast Asian countries and varied academic backgrounds who were invited to participate in the study, 310 students agreed and were included. Moreover, a sample of 400 Jordanian undergraduate students, who participated in cyberbullying against East and Southeast Asian students on social media, answered a questionnaire to reveal their reasons for engaging in bullying during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also examined the relationship and differences between sex and nationality. The findings revealed that cyberbullying contributed to low self-esteem in students of East and Southeast Asian descent who were victims of bullying. Men were more likely to be bullies and cyberbullies than women. The bullies admitted that the main reason for cyberbullying was humor, and that they were unaware that their harsh or aggressive behaviors could be categorized as bullying. This study aimed to make a positive contribution to the scant literature on cyberbullying/cyber racism among university students in an Arab country. We believe our findings can help guide the formulation of policies and solutions that address cyberbullying, especially between resident and foreign students.",

Likewise, Arab countries reported similar incidents in Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Tunisia. Discrimination in the media appeared in the form of misleading videos and pictures of Chinese people consuming animals that are not included in the target audience's conventional diet and sarcastic comments directed at East Asian descent in streets, malls, and universities. Individuals of Asian descent became a focus of attention on social media and others blamed them for the spread of the virus, and ridiculed and mocked them in a dehumanizing and insulting manner. Some media reports (e.g., Sky News [19] ) have denounced discrimination against Asians, including physical assaults, insults, blaming, racist jokes, as well as insulting and sarcastic comments and images. These reports demanded that Jordanian people stopped abusing Asian expatriates in Jordan, especially through social media. Although some Jordanians showed sympathy for abused Asians, this did not stop the spread of cyberbullying.",

Cyberbullying victims are also at risk of experiencing loneliness, disillusionment, and distrust of people, and are more likely to engage in self-harm and aggressive behavior toward friends and family [27] . Moreover, cyberbullying can produce shame, guilt, fear, and social withdrawal [28] . Additional negative effects range from suicide to psychological disorders, such as chronic depression and anxiety [29] .",

However, these elements may not translate exactly in the digital world. For example, repetition of the aggression might be absent in cyberbullying, since one image or video might be sufficient to attract many views and reactions on social media. Views, shares, saves, comments, and \"likes\" may continuously revive the victim's bullying experience and establish a cycle of repetition of the original aggression. Additionally, the intention may not be identifiable, as some behavior in cyberspace may be misunderstood as bullying because of an absence of non-verbal cues through cyber communication [30, 32, 33, 34] . Hasse et al. [30] discussed several challenges in defining cyberbullying. They argued that cyberbullying should be termed \"cyber aggression\" since the term \"cyberbullying\" might exclude scenarios where the aggressor and the victim are strangers. Cyberbullying can become a crime if it includes threat of violence, death threats, obscene and harassing phone calls and texts, sexting, sexual exploitation, child sexual abuse imagery, hate speech, or privacy violations [35] .",

Racism can have a negative impact on the health and well-being of those individuals affected by it [37, 38, 39] . Likewise, cyber racism or discrimination based on nationality on social media platforms can also have a negative impact on mental health. Indeed, Cano et al. [38] confirmed that social media discrimination is associated with symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in cyber racism because of the stigma and discrimination resultant from the association created between nationality and the pandemic. There has been a significant increase in racial verbal abuse, harassment, and violence in public spaces, particularly targeting people of Asian descent [41] .

It can lead to serious adverse social, emotional, physical, and psychological effects [43, 44, 45] . Moreover, cyberbullying victims report increased feelings of fear, hopelessness, hurt, sadness, self-blame, and embarrassment [27, 30, 46, 47, 48] . Recent empirical studies involving young people who had been victims of cyberbullying revealed that it can have an emotional and behavioral impact on these individuals. Furthermore, as a way of coping with cyberbullying, young people can develop several coping strategies, which are classified as either passive or positive [49] for example, acts of revenge [50] , avoiding the internet, ignoring cyberbullies or asking them to stop [49, 51, 52] , and seeking social support. Similarly, Wright [50] found that cyber victims used social support (adaptive) and revenge (maladaptive) coping strategies, or a combination of both, to deal with the bullying. In this context, the role and support of parents is crucial in helping to mitigate the negative effects of cyberbullying on one hand and reducing the involvement of adolescents in this type of bullying on the other hand, through parental mediation strategies (i.e., restrictive, co-viewing, and instructive) [53, 54, 55] .",

However, this behavior might lead to problematic internet usage [73] , and increase both the likelihood of being a victim of cyberbullying [76] and a perpetrator [77] . Furthermore, victims of cyberbullying are also likely to be bullied offline [78] . In a study involving university students, Eristi et al.

Furthermore, these different types of reactions seem to be associated with factors such as computer self-efficacy and internet use. Wachs et al.

Hypothesis 1 (H1) states that there are no statistically significant differences in the mean cybervictimization on the Adolescent Cyber-Victimization Scale (CYBVICS) between students of different nationalities. People who are targeted by cyberbullying report negative effects, such as emotional distress, depression, anxiety, social isolation, loneliness, substance misuse/use, self-harm, suicidal behavior, loss of trust in others, and somatic symptoms [34, 45, 56, 63, 79, 80] . Cyber victims often inform a parent or a trusted adult of their abuse [81] . Furthermore, recent studies have shown a negative association between cyberbullying and self-esteem [80, 82, 83, 84] . Low self-esteem is one of the outcomes most commonly associated with cyberbullying among children and young people [80] . Hypothesis 2 (H2), thus, seeks to determine if there is an observable relationship between self-esteem of East and Southeast Asian students and their exposure to cyberbullying. Since the type of cyberbullying tends to differ by sex [85] , it seems important to determine its prevalence across sexes and nationalities among East and Southeast Asian students. This would inform us whether both sexes from different nationalities face the same level of cyberbullying. Thus, hypothesis 3 (H3) states that there exists no significant interaction between the sex and nationality of students of East and Southeast Asian descent on the CYBVICS.",

The survey was conducted in English [86, 87] through an online anonymous survey platform via Google Forms, between March 25 and May 20, 2020. Students who wished to respond were invited via social media sites, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, or Twitter to access the survey through an anonymous link. There are several pre-existing groups on Facebook (such as students' union groups, Art students' gatherings) that allow students to exchange survey links. Participants who consented to participate in the survey clicked \"yes\" on the first question in the survey, which was \"Do you consent to participate in this study?\" Once students selected this option, they were directed to complete the self-administered questionnaire, which typically took 30 min to finish. In order to retain the respondents' interest, the online survey was accessible for two months. Therefore, participants could choose the most suitable time to complete it. The data were collected anonymously. Students personally known to the researcher were assured anonymity and were informed that the data would be treated in strict confidence and only for the purposes of scientific research.",

The four questions finally used in the study surveyed whether students had shared, \"liked,\" uploaded, or written humorous or sarcastic comments about people of East and Southeast Asian descent; and whether they had made posts on social media in the form of doctored photos, videos, songs, memes, rumors, and misinformation regarding COVID-19 (especially on Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube).",

According to Cummings, cyber-victimization transcends age, culture, socio economic status, and a host of other social classification variables [29] .

Therefore, this study took into account the most influential and controversial variables that have been proven to be significant in the study of cyberbullying.

The null hypothesis of homogeneous variance across nationalities was rejected (p < .05). That is why a version of ANOVA not assuming equality of variances was used. More specifically, in order to address both the problems of a relatively small sample size and of non-homogeneity of variance, we performed bootstrapping which is widely recognized as an alternative to parametric estimates when the assumptions of parametric methods are in doubt [92] . In the case of one-way ANOVA, post-hoc comparisons were conducted using the bootstrapped (and thus nonparametric) version of Tamhane's T2 test-a conservative pairwise comparisons test based on a t-test not assuming equal variances. P-values and bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) intervals were obtained based on 1,000 bootstrap samples.

The first data set (Form 1) was used to gather information from the CYBVICS (M \u00bc 29.25, SD \u00bc 6.055) and the self-esteem scale (M \u00bc 12.75, SD \u00bc 3.251). There were two demographic variables for data set 1: sex and nationality. Regarding the sex of data set 1, 60.3% were male and 39.7% were female; as for nationality, 33.55% were Chinese, 19.35% Indonesian, 13.55% Singaporean, 11.93% Malaysian, and 10.32% Thai. The least represented groups were Korean (8.39%) and Filipino students (2.9%) (Figure 1) . Sex was also included as a demographic variable for data set 2; there were 52.5% females and 47.5% males among the Jordanian students. To evaluate the main reasons for cyberbullying that East and Southeast Asian students faced in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic, we measured the frequency distribution of four items asked of Jordanian students. As shown in Table 3 , most of the bullies (99.5%) believed that students of East and Southeast Asian descent were responsible for the pandemic and for spreading the virus, which explains why they engaged in harassing behaviors. However, most Jordanian students (85%) did not intend to hurt and offend their East and Southeast Asian counterparts. Thus, they were bullying these students inadvertently. Harassment was relatively light, as 91.0% of Jordanian students had no reason for bullying other than humor. Thus, the negligence of 91.3% of surveyed Jordanian students resulted in bullying. Regarding awareness, only 8.8% of Jordanian students considered that their actions could be considered bullying. There are statistically significant differences in the mean cybervictimization on the CYBVICS between students of different nationalities. Table 4 shows descriptive statistics for the Cyber-Victimization Scale. As shown in Table 5 , we evaluated the statistically significant differences in cyber-victimization between students' nationalities through a one-way ANOVA (F (6, 303) \u00bc 31.213, p \u00bc .000). We used Tamhane's T2 test with bootstrapping (Table 6 ) to examine which nationalities had a statistically significant difference in mean cyber-victimization on the CYBVICS. All pairs of nationalities were sorted by their Cohen'd effect size estimates. All differences that were statistically significant at the 5% level also had at least a medium effect size (Cohen's d > .5).",

To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to address cyberbullying during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan. The intention of this study was to make a positive contribution to the literature on cyberbullying during the COVID-19 pandemic while focusing on a specific setting, that is, a university in an Arab country. It also aimed to examine the relationship between cyberbullying and self-esteem among the participating students. The results of this study confirm the hypothesis that exposure to cyberbullying is a predictor of low self-esteem, and that both are significantly correlated; previous studies support this. Students who experience cyberbullying, either as victims or offenders, have significantly lower self-esteem than those who do not [45, 56, 70, 93, 94] . Rosenberg [95] defined self-esteem as the \"totality of the individual's thoughts and feelings with reference to himself as an object.\" Self-esteem refers to one's positive or negative disposition toward oneself. Our self-esteem is determined by various factors, such as how well we view our own performance and appearance, and how satisfied we are with our relationships with other people. Thus, when individuals succeed and do something useful, or when they feel that others accept and value them, they develop high self-esteem. Conversely, when they feel they have failed or are being ignored or criticized, they experience low self-esteem [96, 97, 98] . The Health & Wellness Centre of the University of Toronto Scarborough indicates that university students with low self-esteem often experience unhealthy and dissatisfying relationships with friends and family members, impaired academic and professional performance, anxiety, stress, loneliness, depression, avoidance of social interaction, isolation, and academic failure [99] .",

In relation to the causes of cyberbullying against students of East and Southeast Asian descent during the pandemic, our results showed that the main reasons were that the aggressors believed those students to be responsible for the spread of the COVID-19 virus, followed by the fact that the aggressors did not know that their behavior could be categorized as bullying, and that Jordanian students found cyberbullying humorous. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has triggered social stigma toward individuals of a specific nationalities, mainly due to the lack of knowledge about how the COVID-19 virus is transmitted and treated. This has produced fear and confusion about the virus and its consequences. In general, it appears that there has been a societal need to blame someone for the pandemic. Unfortunately, this situation has worsened due to unsubstantiated rumors regarding the virus. Thus, social stigma has been imposed even upon people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have completed their quarantine period. Groups subjected to social stigma experience discrimination, in the form of not being accepted by others who tend to avoid and ignore them, and are denied proper healthcare and access to education, housing, and employment. They are also exposed to verbal abuse and physical violence [25] .",

Moreover, online anonymity reinforces people's dependence on familiar group norms, such as those grounded in nationality, when navigating the digital life, which can foster racist representations online [40] .

Despite the small sample size of the Filipino group, their mean CYBVICS score was higher compared to Thai, Indonesian, and Malaysian students, and significantly lower compared to Chinese, Singaporean, and Korean students. Thus, there was a statistically significant main effect based on nationality. Predictably, Chinese students were vulnerable to cyberbullying during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most Jordanian students held East and Southeast Asian students responsible for the pandemic, based on the announcement by WHO that the COVID-19 virus originated and spread from the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, on December 8, 2019 [1] . Thus, nationality had an important impact on people's exposure to cyberbullying during the COVID-19 pandemic. This result is in agreement with previous studies that cultural differences are a strong predictor of the characteristics and nature of cyberbullies, cyberbullying frequency, or reinforcement [109, 110] . A recent study [111] found that the escalation of COVID-19-related racial discrimination and bullying against non-citizens and people of color in many places around the world. Covid-19-related discrimination and bullying have been triggered by anti-Asian content present in several international social media. During the COVID-19 pandemic, racial discrimination linked to differences in phenotypic traits across racial and ethnic categories, triggered assumptions regarding differences in COVID-19 susceptibility, transmission, and incubation period across different nationalities. Using a snowball sampling, He et al. [112] found that Chinese nationals residing in 70 Western countries reported that since the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 across the world, they had suffered discrimination and social exclusion in various forms. Of the respondents, a total of 25.11% had experienced discrimination and 90% of respondents inside of China exhibited discriminatory attitudes. Nonetheless, our results contrast with those of Adebayo et al. [113] , which concluded that as a behavior, cyberbullying is particular to an individual, rather than typical of a nationality. In other words, their results showed that there is no significant relationship between nationality and cyberbullying behavior.",

First, the percentage of female students of Singaporean and Indonesian nationalities in the study sample was higher than that of female students of other nationalities. In the Jordanian cultural context and Bedouin traditions, confrontation is a behavior exclusively displayed among men; it is not permissible to confront women. Additionally, the fact that female students of Singaporean and Indonesian nationalities identify primarily with the Jordanian and Islamic traditions, and thus, wear the hijab, may act as a deterrent to Muslim male students (the Islamic religion accounts for the main religion of the Jordanian students in the study sample) to abuse females.",

Our result echoes previous studies by confirming that men are more likely than women to be bullies and cyberbullies [114, 115, 116] . In investigating the relationship between sex differences and cyberbullying, most existing studies have focused on the prevalence of cyberbullying rates, without examining the influence of sex on various determinants of cyberbullying perpetration, such as sociocultural variables and psychological determinants [117, 118] . Cyberbullying victimization and perceived online disinhibition enhance the intention to perpetrate cyberbullying, whereas self-control acts as a critical buffer, repressing the propensity to cyberbully others [119] . Zsila et al. [118] found that males were more likely than females to engage in cyberbullying when they had been previously bullied online. Additionally, a high tendency to engage in anger rumination is linked to an elevated risk of perpetration among male cyberbullying victims.",

We also found that cyberbullying could be a catalyst for a decrease in mental health among university students; this was consistent with results of previous studies [48, 67, 123] . According to WHO, communication regarding COVID-19 is necessary to take effective steps to avoid fueling fear and stigma, especially in the media [25, 124] . As media and social conversations are dominated by information on COVID-19, some researchers have referred to this phenomenon as \"infodemic\" of misinformation [125] , in that rumors regarding the virus could spread more quickly than the virus itself. This can also contribute to negative effects, including stigmatization and discrimination of people from areas affected by the outbreak. Owing to the significant impact of the discourse of individuals in the media, the public assimilate their views frequently. Therefore, it is imperative to educate community members about the language they use to describe COVID-19 and its causes, to avoid contributing to social stigma and the prevalence of cyberbullying through social media [25, 124] . Additionally, people should seek information of COVID-19 from reliable sources [125] .",

Furthermore, it is necessary to continue investigating racial and nationality discrimination in the context of cyberbullying. Racial discrimination became a particular focus of scholarly investigation in the 1980s, with the emergence of the \"critical race theory\" [127] . Finally, we support the suggestion of Felipe-Casta\u00f1o et al. [71] regarding the necessity of designing prevention and intervention programs for universities, and increasing students' awareness of both cyberbullying and coping strategies to deal with it.

Second, the researcher's inability to reach other public universities because of the restrictions inherent to the current COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in data collection being confined to a single university. An inclusion of participants from other universities could have contributed to a more detailed perspective of the implications of COVID-19 for East and Southeast Asian students in Jordan. In addition, Chinese students had a high response rate as their percentage was high compared to other nationalities. A random sampling of students from multiple universities (public and private) could have significantly contributed to understanding this phenomenon at the university level in Jordan. Finally, including additional variables, in conjunction with other nationalities and sex, could have provided added value in terms of understanding the differences and impact of COVID-19 among university students.",
