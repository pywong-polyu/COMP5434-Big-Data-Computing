The glycoprotein gp43 is involved in fungi adhesion to epithelial cells, which makes this protein an interesting target of study. A specific stretch of 15 amino acids that spans the region 181-195 (named P10) of gp43 is an important epitope of gp43 that is being envisioned as a vaccine candidate. Here we show that synthetic P10 forms typical amyloid aggregates in solution in very short times, a property that could hamper vaccine development. Seeds obtained by fragmentation of P10 fibrils were able to induce the aggregation of P4, but not P23, two other peptides derived from gp43. In silico analysis revealed several regions within the P10 sequence that can form amyloid with steric zipper architecture. Besides, in-silico proteolysis studies with gp43 revealed that aggregation-prone, P10-like peptides could be generated by several proteases, which suggests that P10 could be formed under physiological conditions. Considering our data in the context of a potential vaccine development, we redesigned the sequence of P10, maintaining the antigenic region (HTLAIR), but drastically reducing its aggregation propensity.",

(a) The primary structure was obtained at GenBank access number AAG36697.1. Secondary structure elements of gp43 were predicted by PSIPRED and are indicated by pink, yellow and grey cells where color refers to, respectively, \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-strand and random-coil structures.

(b) The structural model of gp43 was generated by using AlphaFold software (cyan), which was aligned with the \u03b2-glucanase structure (gray). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ able to induce the aggregation of a non-aggregating peptide also derived from gp43, named P4 (NLGRDAKRHL-SKHWDTFITEDDFKNIAAAGL), but not the peptide P23 (AFEVGAGWYFWTWKTEGAPGWDMQD). Mass spectrometry showed that the fibrils composed of P4 seeded by P10 contains both sequences, suggesting a coaggregational mechanism. P4 and P23 are potent modulators of local and systemic inflammation 9 since they inhibit phagocytosis of zymosan particles and Pb yeast by macrophages. Finally, in-silico proteolysis studies with gp43 revealed that aggregation-prone, P10-like peptides could be generated by the action of several enzymes including proteinase K, trypsin and pepsin. Besides host endogenous proteases, the levels of proteases secreted by Pb, including an aspartyl proteinase (pepsin-like), are increased upon infection 18 , so we envision that P10 or a P10-like peptide may be formed under physiological conditions, giving rise to amyloid fibrils. Altogether these data call attention to the fact that candidate peptides for vaccine development can aggregate in solution with important implications for their efficacy and safety.",

As seen, P10 and P23 are inserted in regions with high aggregation propensity, while P4 is not. There are other regions dispersed along the protein with high aggregation propensities (those with high scores are labelled APR 1-3), including the region encompassing the signal peptide (SP) at the N-terminal region (~ the first 50 residues). Figure 2b depicts the aggregation propensities of the peptides under study, which are compared to the aggregation potential of the entire gp43 as well as with other APRs present in the protein. Overall, the whole gp43 protein has no tendency to aggregate. This is also true of P4 and P23, even though the latter spans a region of gp43 with high aggregation scores (panel A): when analyzed in isolation and normalized to its number of residues, it does not have a high aggregation score. On the other hand, P10 is among the APRs with the higher aggregation propensity scores, like the signal peptide located at the N-terminal region of the protein (N-term 1-35). Interestingly, the region corresponding to P10 in \u03b2-glucanase from Paracoccidioides lutzii (QTLAAIRALANRYAK) has no tendency to aggregate according to Aggrescan (Fig. 2b ; P10-like), probably due to the presence of positively charged residues (marked in bold), two in the middle (R7 and R12) and one at the end (K15) of the peptide, which might act as aggregational gatekeepers [28] [29] [30] . P10 in gp43 (QTLIAIHTLAIRYAN) has only one arginine (position 12). These observations have important implications and will be discussed below.",

On the other hand, in P10, it detected the presence of an APR encompassing almost the entire peptide sequence (residues 2-13; 80% of the sequence). Regarding the peptide P23, Amylpred2 pointed out a short region spanning from residues 6-13 with aggregation propensity (32% of the peptide sequence). In P23, position 14 is occupied by a lysine, which may act as an aggregational gatekeeper. Next, ZipperDB 32 , an algorithm that predicts the ability of a peptide to form amyloid steric zippers, was employed with the three peptides of interest and the data are presented in Fig. 2c (P10) and D (P4). The 3D-profiling method of ZipperDB was the first amyloid predictor built upon 3D structural data. At the core of amyloid fibrils is the cross-\u03b2 spine, a long stretch of \u03b2-sheets formed by the constituent protein or peptide 33 . In an amyloid steric zipper, the side chains from two \u03b2-strands form a tightly interdigitating dehydrated interface, so that the resulting \u03b2-sheet bilayer forms the fundamental building block of the fibrillar aggregates 33 . In the predictor approach, each hexapeptide from the query sequence is threaded onto the experimentally determined 3D-structure of the NNQQNY peptide, and the energetic fit is evaluated by using the RosettaDesign energy function 34 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ According to the data presented in Fig. 2c , in P10 there are several hexapeptides able to adopt an amyloid steric zipper structure, as evidenced by consecutive hot-colored bars (yellow-red) in its N-terminal region, where it reaches the threshold value of -23 kcal/mol. In the graph, the Rosetta energy value of each bar corresponds to the hexapeptide beginning at that position and running + 5 residues to the right. P4 also contains 4 non-contiguous hexapeptides able to form zippers, three of them in its C-terminus and one in the middle of its sequence (Fig. 2d ). P23 does not contain any region in its structure that can be accommodated in a steric zipper structure (not shown).",

Since in-silico approaches indicate that at least P10 has APRs, in-vitro studies were carried out to evaluate their aggregation properties. In order to evaluate the secondary structures of P4, P10 and P23 in solution before aggregation, circular dichroism measurements were performed. The solvent TFE had to be used to keep the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ peptides soluble. As seen in Fig. 4a , P10 and P4, when dissolved in TFE, assume \u03b1-helix-rich structures, while P23 has a spectrum more closely related to a \u03b2-sheet-rich peptide (Fig. 4a, inset) . This secondary-structure data to some extent recapitulates what has been predicted from the gp43 structure, when it was modeled onto the structure of \u03b2-glucanase (Fig. 1) . Accordingly, in this model, P10 and P4 encompass regions of the protein rich in \u03b1-helices, while P23 seems to be in a region of the protein devoid of secondary-structure elements with only a small \u03b2-strand in it. Next, the peptides (100 \u03bcM) were incubated in aqueous solution (pH 7.4, 25 \u00b0C) in the presence of Thioflavin-T (Th-T), a specific probe for amyloid fibrils. Figure 4b shows that P10 forms Th-T-positive aggregates in ~ 10 s, which is suggestive of their amyloidal nature, while P4 and P23 did not. The next set of experiments was performed with P10, since this was the only peptide able to aggregate in solution, in agreement with most of the predictions (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Figure 4c shows the aggregation profiles at pH 7.4, 25 \u00b0C of P10 at 25, 50 and 100 \u03bcM as measured by Th-T and light scattering (not shown), confirming the amyloidal aggregation of this peptide in www.nature.com/scientificreports/ very short times, as well as its concentration dependency. Images of the aggregates formed are depicted in panel D, where it is possible to see mature amyloid fibrils, which present the typical \u03b2-sheet-rich structure measured by circular dichroism (inset of panel F).

We asked whether seeds derived from P10 fibrils (sP10) would be able to seed the aggregation of P4 and P23. Interestingly, the addition of 5% seeds of P10 to a solution with 100 \u03bcM P4 (pH 7.4, 25 \u00b0C), which does not aggregate by itself, was able to induce immediately the aggregation of P4 as seen by Th-T binding (Fig. 5a , green curve) and EM imaging ( Fig. 5b; P4 + sP10) . Similar experiments were tried with P23, but this peptide forms a viscous solution when diluted in aqueous buffer, which makes this type of experiment unfeasible. This result suggests that seeds composed of P10 catalyze the aggregation of P4, even though P4 does not tend to aggregate in solution. It may be that the steric-zipper architecture predicted for P10 fibrils catalyzes the aggregation of P4 through the unique region of P4 with propensity to form zippers (TFITED; Fig. 3b ).",

As seen, a peptide with the molecular mass of P4 (3,426.5) was present within these fibrils, as well as a peptide with the expected P10 mass (1,697.8). Other molecular masses Aggregation propensity of P10-like peptides derived from gp43 proteolysis: in-silico analysis. Another important feature to be considered is that gp43 is secreted from the yeast cells during infection, thereby being exposed to several proteases from the host. Besides, although in lower quantities then other secreted proteins, the levels of gp43, together with GAPDH and aspartyl proteinase, are increased and these proteins secreted during yeast biofilm formation 2 . This latter protease may also target gp43, fragmenting this protein into small pieces. Thus, we examined whether gp43 could be processed by different proteases by using the program ExPASy PeptideCutter 39 . Table 1 presents the result of these analyses showing only the primary sequence of the peptides in which P10 or P10-like peptides are formed. As seen, proteinase K digestion of gp43 is able to release the peptides R-P10 (P10 with an extra R at the N-terminal) and R-P10(-2) (the same as R-P10 shortened by two residues at the C-terminal), while trypsin generates (+5)P10 + R (P10 with five extra residues at the N-terminal and R at the C-terminal) and P10 + R (P10 with an extra R at the C-terminal). Pepsin, which is an aspartic protease of the same family as Pb protease, also gave interesting results and the fragments generated by its enzymatic activity are (+7)P10(\u22122) (P10 with seven residues at the N-terminal shortened two residues at the C-terminal) and (\u22123)P10(\u22122) (P10 shortened three residues at the N-terminal and shortened two residues at the C-terminal). In all cases, the cleavage products contain the APR present in the P10 sequence. In the last column of Table 1 are presented the amyloidogenic propensities of all peptides derived from gp43 digested with proteinase K, trypsin and pepsin calculated by Aggrescan. Aggrescan shows that P10 and all P10like peptides derived from in-silico enzymatic digestion of gp43 exhibit substantial aggregation propensity scores, even higher than A\u03b2 1-42 (Aggregation propensity score = 6.4). Exceptions to this behavior are (+5)P10 + R and (+7)P10(\u22122), which display much lower aggregation propensities than the other products of digestion. This indicates that the additional residues inserted at the N-terminal of P10 diminish its aggregation propensity, probably because these short extensions include charged residues, R, K and D, which display gatekeeper properties preventing their aggregation: (+5)P10 + R contains one D and one R at its N-terminal extension, plus an additional R at the C-terminus, while (+7)P10(\u22122) contains two K and one D at its N-terminal extension.",

There are interesting studies proposing that aggregation of antigens might be a strategy of phagocytic cells to concentrate and preserve the integrity of these antigenic peptides before their insertion into the MHC-II cleft and displacement of CLIP from the cleft 47 . Thus P10, when cleaved from gp43 during antigen processing in early/late endosomes (pH > 5), might form aggregates very fast inside these compartments until the pH is acidified by the fusion with lysosomes, generating the endolysosomes (pH < 5). This brings about the dissociation of the peptides from the aggregates to bind into the MHCII cleft, followed by migration to the cell membrane and presentation to another immune cell. Further in-cell studies are necessary to tackle this possibility, to answer whether aggregation of antigenic peptides would be a useful physiological strategy.",

P10 seems to be solvent exposed in gp43, which makes sense since P10 is an effective epitope of Pb. Furthermore, a comparison between the primary sequence of P10 in gp43 (QTLIAIHTLAIRYA N) and that of the homologous region in \u03b2-glucanase from Paracoccidioides lutzii (QTLAAIRALANRYA K) reveals an important feature (the amino acids that differ between them are in bold), namely, the presence of two additional charges in the sequence of the enzyme (underlined, R and K), one in the middle and the other at the extreme of the C-terminal. Charged residues have gatekeeper properties that avoid the aggregation of peptides and proteins [28] [29] [30] . Interestingly, the corresponding stretch of P10 in \u03b2-glucanase has no tendency to aggregate as evidenced by bioinformatic analyses (Fig. 2b) . Besides, P10 in \u03b2-glucanase lacks the HTLAIR sequence known to be the antigenic region 40, 41 , which precludes its use as a vaccine candidate against Pb.",

Peptide samples were prepared by diluting stock solutions immediately before measurements to a concentration of 100 \u03bcM in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) 5% (soluble samples) or in PBS (aggregated samples). CD spectra were recorded at the indicated times of incubation, scanning from 260 to 190 nm on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter equilibrated at 25 \u00b0C. Each spectrum shown is the accumulation of 10 scans. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In-vitro aggregation assays. For in-vitro aggregation, P4, P10 and P23 stock solutions were diluted in PBS under agitation in the presence of Thioflavin-T (ThT; 50 \u03bcM), a specific fluorescent probe for amyloid fibrils. ThT fluorescence emission was measured at 485 nm by exciting the samples at 450 nm. To measure light scattering (LS), samples were excited at 320 nm while emission was collected at 320 nm. For the seeding assays, a solution containing 100 \u00b5M previously formed P10 amyloid fibrils was sonicated (40 kHz) during 30 min for mechanical fibril fragmentation. Five \u03bcL of a seed suspension were added to a freshly prepared P4 peptide solution at 100 \u03bcM under agitation. Seeds were used at the final concentration of 5% unless otherwise stated.",

After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed carefully, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 \u03bcL of a 9 M urea solution and incubated overnight under agitation. After that, the sample was diluted to 1 \u03bcM in 3% acetonitrile Wnano Acquity system (Waters, Milford, MA) for mass spectrometry. Proteins were desalted online using a trap column (Waters Symmetry C18, 180 \u03bcm \u00d7 20 mm, 5 \u03bcm) for 5 min and the liquid chromatography was performed with 3% to 85% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, 0.5 \u03bcL/min flow, in a HSS T3 130 C 18 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm analytical column (Waters, Milford, MA) for 58 min.

Electrospray mass spectra were recorded using a Synapt HDMS quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration timeof-flight spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) interfaced to the nanoAcquity system. Capillary voltage was set at 3500 V, source temperature was 80 \u00b0C and cone voltage was 40 V. The instrument control and data acquisition were conducted by a MassLynx data system (Version 4.1, Waters), and experiments were performed by scanning mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of 400-2000 using a scan time of 1 s, applied during the whole chromatographic process. A 320 fmol GFP -Glu Fibrino Peptide solution in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic solution was set at a 0.5 \u03bcL/min flow and acquired during 1 s after each 15 s of the main chromatogram to calibrate spectra using Q-Tof 's LockSpray (Waters, Milford, MA).",

In red is shown the ThT signal of the seeds alone in solution and in black is the ThT emission when free in solution. (b) TEM images of the amorphous aggregates formed by P4 alone (P4, upper left), P10 fibrils (P10, upper right), seeds of P10 (sP10; lower left) and aggregates formed when P4 is seeded by P10 (P4 + sP10; lower right). (c) Mass spectrometry analysis of P4 fibrils grown in the presence of P10 seeds showing the expected molecular masses of P10 (mass: 1,697) and P4 (mass: 3,426). These data suggest the incorporation of P4 into the P10 seeds giving rise to the appearance of hybrid fibrils. All experiments were performed at pH 7.4, 25 \u00b0C.",
