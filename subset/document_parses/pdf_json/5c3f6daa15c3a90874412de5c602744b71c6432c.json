            "text": "1. As for COVID-19 vaccine, the most frequent concern from families is on the safeness for children aged 5-11 years [3] . While COVID-19 vaccines were developed rapidly, all steps were taken to make sure they are safe and effectivive for children. During the development of COVID-19 vaccines, phases overlapped to speed up the process, but all phases were completed as required for a clinical trial. COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11 years were developed and tested in the same way as adult COVID-19 vaccines. In clinical trial, vaccine side effects were examined and appeared to be mild, similar to those seen with other vaccines recommended in infancy [4] . Data produced by the industry has been reviewed and analysed by Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, by European Medicines Agency in Europe and Italian Medicines Agency in our Country. So, actually, the vaccine can be considered safe and effective to the target population who will receive it, namely children aged 5-11 years. To enforce this consideration, over 5 milions of children in the world already got one and in some cases two shots, without safety concerns. Over 7 millions of COVID 19 vaccine shot, just 8 myocarditis have been demonstrated correlated to the immunization. All the children had mild symptoms and promptly recovered. Unlike the mild side effects that some may experience after vaccina- [6] . In fact, even children who develop mild symptoms may be affected by sequelae weeks or months after recovering. Getting COVID -19 even if with mild symptoms is not advisable as it does neither guarantee a stronger immunity nor allow a long protection against the virus. It has been demonstrated that people who got an infection maybe re-infected later in life. In children who have had prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the administration of a single dose of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine may be considered, preferably within 6 months from the infection and no later than 12 months after its resolution. A 2 dose schedule is suggested if the infection happened more than one year before the infection. 4. Finally, children vaccination contribute to stop the spread of COVID-19 in the community and may help protecting those unvaccinable for age or for underlying medical conditions. 5. As for safety concern, one of the mayor doubt is on pubertal development and fertility. There is neither evidence nor plausible scientific base to state that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, may interfere with puberty and female or male fertility. To date, there is no evidence that vaccine ingredients or antibodies developed following COVID-19 vaccination may interfere with pregnancy. On the contrary, evidence suggested that females who received COVID-19 vaccine met no problems in becoming pregnant [4, 7] .",
