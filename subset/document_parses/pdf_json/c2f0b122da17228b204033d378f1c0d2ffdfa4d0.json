            "text": "In many enveloped virus families, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV), a crucial, yet unexploited, step in the viral life cycle is the release of particles from the infected cell membranes. This release process is mediated by host ESCRT complex proteins, which are recruited by viral structural proteins and provide the mechanical means for membrane scission and subsequent viral budding. The prazole drug tenatoprazole was previously shown to bind to the ESCRT complex member Tsg101 and to quantitatively block the release of infectious HIV-1 from cells in culture. In this report, we show that tenatoprazole and a related prazole drug, ilaprazole, effectively block infectious HSV-1/2 release from Vero cells in culture. By electron microscopy, we found that both prazole drugs block the transit of HSV particles through the cell nuclear membrane, resulting in their accumulation in the nucleus. Ilaprazole also quantitatively blocks the release of HIV-1 from 293T cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 0.8 to 1.2mM, which is much more potent than tenatoprazole. Our results indicate that prazole-based compounds may represent a class of drugs with the potential to be broad-spectrum antiviral agents against multiple enveloped viruses by interrupting the cellular Tsg101 interaction with maturing virus, thus blocking the budding process that releases particles from the cell. IMPORTANCE These results provide the basis for the development of drugs that target enveloped virus budding that can be used ultimately to control multiple virus infections in humans.",

This indicates that the human immune system evolved to target the ESCRT pathway to control viral infections and supports that this is a natural target. Another group identified single-nucleotide polymorphic sites in the 59 region of Tsg101, located at positions 2183 and 1181 relative to the translation start signal, which affect the rate of AIDS progression among Caucasians (25) . These data support the hypothesis that variation in Tsg101 affects the efficiency of Tsg101-mediated release of viral particles from infected cells, altering plasma viral load levels and subsequent disease progression. Taken together, these investigations indicate that Tsg101 and ESCRT proteins present a natural antiviral target.",

Most notably, we identified one prazole drug, ilaprazole, that blocks the release of both HIV-1 and HSV-1/2 from cells with an efficiency more potent than that reported for tenatoprazole. Ilaprazole acts in the low-micromolar range without detectable cell toxicity at inhibitory concentrations. To further define the mechanism of action of these prazole drugs on HSV infections, we identified the site of blockage of herpesvirus release, which appears to be different from that of HIV-1. While the blockage of HIV-1 particle release is at the outer cell membrane (3) , the prazole drugs appear to first block the passage of herpesvirus through the nuclear membrane. This prevents particles from being released into the cytosol, where maturation of their envelope membrane occurs to produce infectious virus and where they bud from the cell. With the prazole-based inhibitors being effective in both HIV and HSV, targeting Tsg101 could lead to a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy.",

We screened chemical compounds using a fluorescence thermal shift (FTS) assay (27, 28) to identify small molecules that bind directly to a truncated form of Tsg101 (amino acids [aa] 1 to 145), which contains the ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) ubiquitin-binding domain (Fig. 1 ). The UEV, which contains the PT/SAP-binding domain in addition to the ubiquitin-binding domain, provides chaperone functions to HIV-1 Gag, which is independent of its interaction with the PS/TAP motif, and contains the prazole-binding site (3). This truncated Tsg101, called Tsg101-UEV, was used because fulllength Tsg101 has significant solubility issues in aqueous solution. Tsg101 is an adaptor protein and thus lacks a readily deployable functional assay, making the FTS assay a tractable approach to identify interacting compounds. FTS monitors protein thermal denaturation using SYPRO orange, a dye that fluoresces when bound to hydrophobic surfaces, which allows monitoring of the changes in hydrophobic surface exposure during protein denaturation (27) . Since ligand binding affects protein thermal stability, it can be detected through modulation of protein thermal denaturation (melting) as a shift in the melting temperature (T m ). Tsg101-UEV has a well-defined melting curve suitable for FTS. We used the FTS assay to identify compounds that bind to Tsg101-UEV.",

This specific binding is consistent with a previous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure in which tenatoprazole forms a covalent disulfide bond to Cys73 in the UEV domain of the protein (3). This disulfide bond formation can be prevented by including the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) in the assay Thermal shift data of three human proteins not related to Tsg101 by the lead compound tenatoprazole are shown. The effect of the prazole compound on the thermal stability of these three proteins is negligible, indicating that the dramatic modulation of the thermal transition of Tsg101 by the prazoles is due to a specific interaction.

Based on these initial HSV-2 antiviral assay results, we selected ilaprazole for further antiviral profiling and tested it against HSV-1 (Table 3 , 2nd to 5th columns) and HSV-2 (Table 3 , 6th to 8th columns). Ilaprazole was slightly more effective against HSV-1 than against HSV-2, with EC 50 calculations ranging from 3 to 9 mM. These results do not indicate if the observed lower EC 50 against HSV-1 than against HSV-2 is significant or reflects differences between different viral isolates since the two herpesviruses can be distinguished by sequence analysis, and both types can cause oral and genital lesions. Ilaprazole's potency is an improvement over tenatoprazole, which inhibited in the high-micromolar range (Tables 1, 3, and 4). Like tenatoprazole, ilaprazole caused a significant drop in total virus, again not as strong of a decrease as that one detected with virus released from cells. Additionally, ilaprazole was even more effective in inhibiting virus release at 72 h than at 24 h after a single application of the drug (72-h EC 50 , 0.8 to 1.2 mM) ( Table  3 , compare the 2nd and 4th columns). Significant inhibition was still observed 4 and 5 days after a single application of the drug (data not shown). The inhibition caused by tenatoprazole against either virus began to fall off after 48 h (data not shown). We also tested for toxicity in the range of effective concentrations and did not observe cell toxicity using the 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay reagent and the WST-1 reagent over a 24-h period (Table 4) . Thus, ilaprazole is more potent and has longerlasting effects than tenatoprazole.",

Similar results were obtained with HSV-1-infected cells (Fig. 4E to H). Particles are seen in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in the absence of the drug and just in the nucleus in the presence of the drug. These results are similar to the effect of tenatoprazole on HSV-2-infected cells (Fig. 2) . The lower total infectious virus titers shown in Table 3 are consistent with a blockage of the virus passaging out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm where membranes are exchanged and virus becomes infectious.",

            "text": "Tsg101 binding to the proline-rich viral L domains in Gag (1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13) is required for virus particles to be released from cell membranes of infected cells. Tsg101 is a member of the ESCRT-I complex of proteins involved in cell endosomal sorting. The ESCRT-I complex recruits proteins from the ESCRT-III complex with AIP1 (17) , which provides the mechanical means for the scission of virus particles from cell membranes. Thus, blocking the PT/SAP L-domain sequence from interacting with the host ESCRT complex causes the virus budding defect, and three lines of independent evidence support this idea. First, drugs targeted to this specific interaction in HIV-1 cause virus budding defects in infected cells without detectable off-target effects (3). Second, a research group identified noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 59 region of Tsg101 that correlate with viral loads, implicating Tsg101-mediated viral particle release in disease progression (25) . Third, viral infections activate a host innate immunity mechanism, through interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), that specifically disrupts virus budding complexes (21) . In response to this immune system defense, many viruses encode enzymes that prevent or reverse ISG15 conjugation to cellular proteins to avoid the budding blockade (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) . Taken together, this evidence indicates that targeting this interaction may lead to an effective antiviral strategy. Note that Pawliczek and Crump (30) (20) showed that the release of a different herpesvirus was susceptible to blockage by a prazole drug. They also used an HIV-1 Gag mutant bearing a disrupted PT/SAP motif (P7L-Gag) whose virus egress was independent of Tsg101 to demonstrate that the release of this virus mutant was still blocked. This indicates that prazole drugs in particular are effective in blocking the budding process. While the prazole analogs block the release of lenti-and herpesviruses, the inhibition is manifested in different regions of the cell. The drugs block the release of HIV-1 at the outer cell membrane by preventing the pinching of virus particles from the membrane (3). In contrast, herpesviruses, which assemble in the nucleus, appear to be first blocked at the passage of the virus through the nuclear membrane. Because the prazole drugs form a covalent bond to Tsg101, this strongly suggests that the ESCRT proteins are important for the herpesvirus particles to be released from the nucleus of the cell where they are formed. This is consistent with a recent report by Arii et al. (18) that the ESCRT-III protein complex mediates herpesvirus movement across the nuclear membrane and regulates its integrity. The finding that the prazole drugs cause a significant drop in total infectious herpesviruses reported here can be explained by the trapping of immature particles in the nucleus. This prevents them from migrating into the cytoplasm to exchange enveloped membranes, which makes them infectious. Also, the accumulation of the dense material in the nucleus observed in the electron micrographs suggests that prazole drugs may interfere with normal particle assembly in addition to blocking the passage of the particles through the nuclear membrane.",

            "text": "The use of prazoles represents an exciting potential case of repurposing existing drugs to act as antiviral therapeutic agents. Currently, omeprazole is marketed as a prodrug for the treatment of acid reflux disease. Other prazole drugs are marketed for the treatment of acid reflux disease in China, India, and South Korea (Yi Li An, Adiza, and Noltec, respectively), indicating reasonable bioavailability and a known clinical safety profile. The prodrugs are acid activated into derivatives that form disulfide linkages with proton pumps (26, 61, 62) . The prodrug, but not the charged sulfonamide derivative, can cross the plasma membrane barrier. The antiviral activity of tenatoprazole has been suggested to be the result of forming a covalent disulfide bond with Tsg101 (3). While the binding site for tenatoprazole is near the ubiquitin (Ub)-binding pocket and not the L-domain-binding site, biochemical and confocal imaging data independently demonstrated that tenatoprazole disrupts the binding of Tsg101 to the PT/SAP sequence (3) . While the precise biochemical mechanism remains to be clarified, our FTS results support that it may be related to allosteric changes in Tsg101 after the drug forms its covalent linkage with Cys73. Previous reports did not detect off-target effects of the prazole drugs affecting Tsg101 metabolism inside cells (3) . A possible exception is noted in a recent epidemiological study in the American Journal of Gastroenterology by C. V. Almario and colleagues (63) . In these studies, there was a small correlation between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and patients taking commercially available prazole drugs, such as omeprazole, for acid reflux disease. However, this does not preclude the use of the prazole compounds described in this paper. The drugs used by the patients, such as omeprazole, have weak antiviral activity ( Table 2 ). In contrast, ilaprazole has potent antiviral activity. At a dose of 10 mg of ilaprazole/day, plasma concentrations are around 2 mg h/ml, which is within the range needed for antiviral activity (64) . The prazoles that we tested here also appear to be nontoxic to Vero, HeLa, and 293T cells at the concentrations used to inhibit the budding of herpesviruses and HIV-1. To improve the potency of the prazole drugs, we have synthesized 53 analogs of ilaprazole. Several of these appear to have stronger binding to Tsg101 detected by the FTS assay. We are now testing these analogs to see if they have more potent antiviral activity than ilaprazole.",

However, those authors did not definitively identify the mechanism of action of the prazoles and also concluded that the potency of the prazole compound used, omeprazole, is too low to reach therapeutic levels in vivo. A mechanism posed by those authors is that the prazoles lead to an increase in the lysosomal pH, which is the potential mechanism for lysosomotropic drugs such as chloroquine (66) . In contrast to omeprazole, we hypothesize that ilaprazole may allow for therapeutic levels to be reached in vivo. In the case of ilaprazole, which is marketed in several Asian countries, as discussed above, our strong in vitro results lay the foundation for a potential fast track to broad-spectrum antiviral clinical testing, alone or in combination with other drugs, in these countries. We are currently working to determine if ilaprazole or our novel compounds have activity against SARS-CoV-2 with or in combination with remdesivir. This would further the potential broad-spectrum antiviral capacity of the prazole compounds described in this report.",

Tsg101-UEV was grown in LB broth with kanamycin (30 mg/ml) in Rosetta2(DE3)/pLysS E. coli competent cells (EMD Millipore) and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at room temperature for 3 h.

The fluorescence thermal shift (FTS) assay uses the thermal shift elicited by the effect of small-molecule binding on protein stability. The FTS assay monitors protein thermal denaturation using the environmentsensitive dye SYPRO orange, which fluoresces when bound to hydrophobic surfaces, taking advantage of the changes in hydrophobic surface exposure in protein denaturation. The discovery of small molecules binding to the target protein utilizes the observation that ligand binding affects protein thermal stability and therefore can be detected through a shift in the protein's thermal denaturation (melting) temperature (T m ). We have employed the FTS assay to reveal changes in the thermodynamic properties of Tsg101 elicited by its interaction with a small molecule. The recombinant Tsg101 fragment (amino acids 1 to 145), prepared as described above (but without a label), has a thermal unfolding profile suitable for using the FTS assay as a primary screening assay for high-throughput screening (HTS). A fluorescence dye, SYPRO orange (Invitrogen), was used for assay detection. The dye is excited at 473 nm and has a fluorescence emission at 610 nm. The dye binds to hydrophobic regions of a protein that are normally buried in a native protein structure. When a protein is unfolded, the dye interacts with exposed hydrophobic surfaces, and the fluorescence intensity increases significantly over that observed in aqueous solution. The Tsg101 fragment was premixed at a concentration of 2 mM with a 5\u00c2 concentration of SYPRO orange in HEPES buffer (100 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl [pH 7.5]). Next, 10 ml of the protein-dye mix was added to an assay plate, and 10 to 50 nl of the compound, equal to 10 to 50 mM, was added with an Echo550 acoustic-transfer robot (Labcyte, CA). The plate was shaken to ensure proper mixing, sealed with an optical seal, and then centrifuged. The thermal scan was performed from 20\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C with a temperature ramp rate of 0.5\u00b0C/min. Fluorescence was detected on a CFX384 real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Comparison of the thermal denaturation profiles for Tsg101-UEV in the presence and absence of tenatoprazole and other prazoles revealed destabilization of the native protein structure, indicating that the compound interacted with Tsg101-UEV.",
