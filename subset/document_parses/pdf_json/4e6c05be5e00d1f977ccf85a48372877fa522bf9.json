While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis, 5 these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and antibody production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human primate models. Moreover, we show that type I interferons are unable to control SARS-CoV2 replication and drive pathologic responses. Thus, the hACE2-AAV mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patientderived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds. This represents a much-needed platform for rapidly testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.",

We found that while control infected mice did not develop anti-spike antibodies, AAV-hACE2 B6/J mice mounted a significant antibody response between 4-and 7-DPI, which continued to increase at 14 DPI (Fig. 1h) . Next, to assess the neutralization potential of these antibodies, we performed plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT) using SARS-CoV-2, and found PRNT75 at a serum dilution of 1:1024 as early as 7 DPI (Fig 1i) .",

However, others have reported elevated interferon signatures in the lungs of COVID-19 patients 12 . To assess both the cytokine and interferon response to SARS-CoV-2 infected AAV-hACE2 mice, we performed RNA sequencing from infected lung at 2 DPI. In contrast to the control infected mice, AAV-hACE2 mice developed clear signatures of cytokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). In fact, the majority of the differentially expressed upregulated genes were either ISGs or cytokines (Fig. 2a) . Interestingly, neither type I, nor type II, nor type III interferons seemed to be upregulated. Using the Interferome database (http://www.interferome.org/), we mapped the top upregulated genes to their transcriptional regulation by either type I, II, or III IFNs (Fig. 2b) . We found that while most of the genes shared regulation by type I and type II (and some by all 3 IFNs), a distinct subset of 45 genes that were specific to type I interferon signaling was elevated in the infected lung. We next performed gene ontology analysis of the top upregulated genes, which revealed enrichment of gene clusters in virus-host interaction, immune response, as well as immune cell recruitment and activation (Fig. 2c) , consistent with the proinflammatory immune cell infiltrates seen in patients. To analyze the concordance between our model and the recently published patient lung autopsy gene expression from Blanco-Melo et.al., we found that 73% of our shared upregulated genes were ISGs (Fig 2d, e) . These results indicated that our mouse model largely recapitulated the transcriptome changes observed in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.",

We found modest elevations (~10 fold) in viral RNA of IFNAR -/but not IRF3/7 -/relative to WT B6/J AAV-hACE2 at 2 DPI, though these differences were lost at later time points during infection (Fig. 3a) . Viral replication was only slightly enhanced in IFNAR -/or IRF3/7 -/mice over wild type mice, similar to what has been previously been shown in SARS-CoV-1 14 . In contrast, we found a loss of recruitment of Ly6C hi monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages in mice deficient in IFNAR or IRF3/7 (Fig. 3d,e) . Additionally, we found reduced activation of CD4 + , CD8 + , or NK cells in IRF3/7 -/infected mice, and a complete loss of activation of these cell populations in IFNAR -/infected mice ( Fig. 3f-h) . In contrast, we observed robust recruitment of neutrophils in the infected IFNAR -/mice (Fig. 3i ). This may reflect the loss of IFNmediated regulation of inflammasomes leading to neutrophil recruitment [15] [16] [17] . These results were consistent with previous reports of pulmonary type I interferon signaling representing a major driver of both recruitment and activation of proinflammatory immune cells in viral infections including SARS-CoV-1 14 and other respiratory viral infections 18 . RNA sequencing at 2 DPI from the lungs of infected WT, IFNAR -/-, and IRF3/7 -/mice reveal markedly elevated ISGs and cytokines profile. Heat map analysis of the top 100 upregulated genes showed significant elevation of antiviral ISGs (Rsad2, IRF7, OASL, Ifit, STAT2, MX2) as well as monocyte recruiting chemokines (Cxcl10, Ccl7, and Ccl2), which were not upregulated in either IFNAR -/or IRF3/7 -/infected mice (Fig. 3c ).",

We found an acute inflammatory immune response characterized by infiltrating monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, as well as activated T and NK cells. We also found gene signatures of acute ISG response which clusters most closely with type I interferon response. In addition to the acute inflammatory response, these mice develop rapid SARS-CoV-2 S-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies between 4-and 7-DPI. While none of the mice exhibited infection-related mortality, this may reflect the immune status of the challenged mice, which were 6-12 weeks old healthy adult mice. Future studies in aged, immunocompromised, and/or obese mice may elicit more dramatic phenotypes, similar to the effect of these comorbidities in human COVID-19 disease.",

Subset of differentially expressed genes in a that were significantly upregulated in lungs of COVID19 patients (from Blanco-Melo et al 2020)., d, Upregulated gene list from human samples (Blanco-melo et. al. 2020) was graphed (left panel) and used to perform hierarchical clustering for differentially expressed genes from lungs of AAV-hACE2 SARS-CoV-2 infected mice (blue, mouse ISGs; gray, other genes)., e, Go Enrichment Analysis was performed on significantly upregulated genes to identify enriched cellular processes. , IFNAR knockout and IRF3/7 double knockout mice were transduced intratracheally with an adeno-associated vector coding for hACE2 (AAV-hACE2) and infected with SARS-CoV-2 two weeks later. a, Viral titers in the lung of mice were measured using qPCR against SARS-CoV-2 N (Control and WT were from the same experiment as Figure 1b) . b, Lung homogenates tittered on VeroE6 cells. c, Heat map of top 100 upregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2 infected C57BL/6J mice transduced with AAV-hACE2 versus SARS-CoV-2 infected AAV-GFP transduced mice. d-i At day two post infection, lungs of mice were made into single cell suspensions for flow cytometry.",

            "text": ". While endogenous type I interferon signaling seems to have little effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication, it clearly orchestrates a proinflammatory immune response and may cause immunopathology in patients. Type I interferon signaling is important in protecting against viral infections 20 . Despite the use of type I interferon in the treatment of both MERS and SARS-CoV-1, its endogenous role is less clear with reports of protective effects for MERS 20 and pathogenic effects for SARS-CoV-1 14 . Notably, overactive or unregulated interferon signaling causes pathology in influenza 21,22 , congenital Zika 23 , and SARS-CoV-1 14,24 infection. The role of type I interferon signaling in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 is critically important to understanding the protection provided by both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system and to elucidate any pathogenic effects. These data are especially concerning given current use of type I interferon as a therapeutic for the treatment of COVID-19. Our results indicate a pathological role of type I IFN in COVID-19 respiratory inflammation. Here we present clear evidence of both the lack of antiviral activity as well as the potential harms of endogenous type I interferon responses in COVID-19 patients. While a similar technique was previously used to develop the first MERS mouse infection system 25 , to our knowledge this is the first report that vector based hACE2 delivery to the mouse respiratory tract is sufficient to enable robust SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the preparation of this manuscript, two publications 5,26 reported SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis in different transgenic hACE2 expressing mice. Additionally, infectious models in both hamsters 27 , ferrets 11 and nonhuman primates 28 have also been reported. These models are valuable and have provided much-needed tools for the study of SARS-CoV-2 disease. The hACE2-AAV mouse model described here offers a broadly-available, highly adaptable animal model to understand critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, replication, pathogenesis, with authentic patient derived virus. This model provides a vital platform for testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.",

The coating buffer was removed, and plates were incubated for 1h at RT with 200\u03bcl of blocking solution (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20, 3% milk powder). Serum was diluted 1:50 in dilution solution (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20, 1% milk powder) and 100\u03bcl of diluted serum was added for two hours at RT. Plates were washed three times with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) and 50\u03bcl of mouse IgG-specific secondary antibody (BioLegend #405306, 1:10,000) diluted in dilution solution added to each well. After 1h of incubation at RT, plates were washed three times with PBS-T. Plates were developed with 100\u03bcl of TMB Substrate Reagent Set (BD Biosciences #555214) and the reaction was stopped after 15 min by the addition of 2 N sulfuric acid. Plates were then read at a wavelength of 450 nm and 570nm.",
