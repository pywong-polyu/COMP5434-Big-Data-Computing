This paper investigates changes in SU and ORB among young men during the COVID-19 crisis (i.e. March-June 2020). Methods: Before and during the COVID-19 crisis, 2,344 young Swiss men completed questionnaires covering SU (i.e. alcohol, cigarettes, illegal cannabis), ORB (i.e. gaming, watching TV series, internet pornography) and sociodemographic and work-related characteristics (i.e. deterioration in the work situation, change in working hours, change in working hours from home, healthcare workers' and other professionals' contacts with potentially infected people, linguistic region, call up to military or civil protection unit, living situation, age). Results: Latent-change score models showed significant decreases of 17% for drinking volume and frequency of heavy episodic drinking, and a significant increase of 75% for time spent gaming and watching TV series. Subgroups showed greater relative increases. Frenchspeaking participants, those who experienced a deterioration in their work situation and healthcare workers in contact with potentially infected people reported increased cigarette use. Those without children increased gaming, whereas those who worked fewer hours, experienced a deterioration in their work situation or were French-speaking did more gaming and watched more TV series. Those who lived alone or were German-speaking watched more internet pornography. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 crisis, young Swiss men drank less alcohol and spent more time gaming and watching TV series. Changes in SU and ORB were not homogenous in the young Swiss men population.

            "text": "The coronavirus disease pandemic had a major impact on everyday life in Switzerland. This global health crisis' first wave and the government measures implemented to limit the virus' propagation had the potential to significantly affect individuals' health behaviours, notably the use of alcohol, other substances and other reinforcing behaviours. The Swiss Federal Council introduced measures to limit the propagation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) on 16 and 20 March 2020 (Swiss Federal Council, 2020a, b) . These included closing borders, schools, nurseries, bars, and non-essential shops, severe limitations on restaurant opening, physical distancing measures (\u2265 two meters distance, bans on gatherings of > five people), and health and safety measures in supermarkets (distancing, limited numbers of shoppers admitted simultaneously). People were also recommended to stay at home, work from home and avoid public transportation. These measures led to fewer hours worked and to increases in the unemployment rate among significant segments of the workforce (Faber, Ghisletta, & Schmidheiny, 2020) . On 16 March 2020, Switzerland had registered 43.9 cumulative confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In Switzerland, about 71% of the population lives in the German-speaking, 24% in the French-speaking and 5% in the Italian-or Romansch-speaking regions (Swiss Federal Office of Statistics, 2016) . The prevalence of confirmed cases was more than three times greater in French-and Italian-or Romansch-speaking regions than in German-speaking ones (Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, 2020). On that date, Switzerland was among the top 9 countries worldwide with the highest numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (World Health Organization (WHO), 2020).",

            "text": "Although anecdotal media reports stated that alcohol (Blum, 2020; Wilson, 2020) and tobacco (Bonzom, 2020) sales increased at the start of the COVID-19 crisis, it was unclear whether these reports reflected real increases in the use of both substances and how these behaviours would evolve in the long run. Border and bar closures combined with an economic downturn may have reduced the availability (including accessibility) of alcohol (Rehm et al., 2020) and social opportunities to use it. The same may be true for other substances. For example, cannabis (with a concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] \u2265 1%) is illegal in Switzerland, and smuggling from abroad is an important source for the domestic illegal market (Zobel, Esseiva, Udrisard, & Samitca, 2020) . As availability is an important factor of demand (Gmel, Holmes, & Studer, 2016) , this could have reduced substance use in the general population. However, experience from previous and current crises suggests that the pandemic may have induced stress and anxiety (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Brooks et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2005; Marmet et al., 2021a) , at least for some population subgroups, such as those who lost their jobs, faced major changes in their work situation, were socially isolated, or were healthcare and essential workers (Brooks et al., 2020; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Marmet et al., 2021) . In line with the stress-response-dampening theory (Sayette, 1999; Sher, Bartholow, Peuser, Erickson, & Wood, 2007; Sher & Levenson, 1982) , distress may lead individuals to increase their substance use to relieve stress and reduce anxiety. This is supported by results showing positive associations between COVID-19 related stress and substance use (Callinan et al., 2021; Rolland, Haesebaert, Zante, Benyamina, & Haesebaert, 2020; Taylor, Paluszek, Rachor, McKay, & Asmundson, 2021) . There were also anecdotal media and industry reports of the increased involvement in other reinforcing behaviours, such as social media, gaming, internet pornography and TV series, from the start of the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis (La Presse.ca, 2020; Mestre-Bach, Blycker, & Potenza, 2020; M. Perez, 2020; S. Perez, 2020; Schultz, 2020; Shanley, 2020) . This may have been a consequence of burden, stress and anxiety caused by COVID-19 (Brailovskaia & Margraf, 2021; Rolland et al., 2020; Zhao & Zhou, 2021) , and of the increased availability of digital activities during the crisis. For example, the internet pornography industry seems to have seized upon the situation to offer free content for a limited time (Mestre-Bach et al., 2020) . Reduced working hours and government recommendations to stay at home may also have increased the time available for these activities.",

Consequently, substance use and other reinforcing behaviours may have increased in these subgroups. Accordingly, the study's second aim was to investigate whether the COVID-19 crisis affected substance use and other reinforcing behaviours differentially in certain cohort subgroups. Specifically, those who had lost their job or had major changes in their work situation, and those who were socially isolated or had more spare time (e.g. living alone, being childless), were hypothesized to report increases in both substance use and other reinforcing behaviours. Healthcare and essential workers were hypothesized to report increases in substance use, but not necessarily increases in other reinforcing behaviours, as they would not have had an abundance of spare time. When the questionnaire was being answered, Switzerland's German-speaking regions were less affected by COVID-19 than Frenchspeaking regions (Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, 2020), despite the implementation of identical measures to limit the virus' propagation. Thus, the German-speaking subgroup may have been less subject to the stress of being infected or infecting others. We therefore hypothesized changes in substance use and other reinforcing behaviours to be smaller among German-speakers than among Frenchspeakers.",

Bootstrap (5,000 draws) and 95% bias-corrected percentile bootstrap confidence intervals were used to account for potentially skewed distributions. When significant associations of changes in substance use and other reinforcing behaviours with sociodemographic and work-related characteristics were found, a simple slope analysis was used to test the significance of changes in each subgroup (Aiken & West, 1991) . LCS modelling used the responses of participants who had completed at least two-thirds of the COVID-19 assessment (n 5 2,344). Of these, 151 (6.4%) participants had a missing value on at least one item. These missing values were handled using full information maximum likelihood (FIML). Non-respondents (questionnaire not completed or less than two-thirds completed) had significantly higher scores on pre-COVID-19 cigarette and illegal cannabis use than did respondents (questionnaire at least two-thirds completed) to the COVID-19 assessment (see Supplementary Table S2 ). As a sensitivity analysis, LCS were also tested on the total sample (n 5 4,407; including all nonrespondents), and missing data were handled using FIML.",

Results showed significant decreases of approximately 17% for drinking volume and HED frequency. These reported changes may reflect the immediate impact of COVID-19 measures on the availability of alcohol (Rehm et al., 2020) . Since alcohol use is one of the main risk factor for mortality and morbidity (Rehm, Taylor, & Room, 2006) and HED is one of the strongest predictor of alcoholrelated harm, e.g. blackouts, accidents, problem with the police, violence, among young adults (Gmel, Rehm, & Kuntsche, 2003; Wechsler, Davenport, Dowdall, Moeykens, & Castillo, 1994) , a decrease in alcohol use is good news for public health. The open question is whether this decrease will be maintained over time. As opposed to alcohol use, significant increases of approximately 75% more time spent gaming and watching TV series were found. This result may reflect participants' increased free time and the availability of special offers during the COVID-19 crisis, as well as the engagement in these activities as coping mechanisms in response to the increased stress and burden caused by the COVID-19 crisis. High involvement in such activities is not problematic by itself (at least for gaming; Kir aly, T oth, Urb an, Demetrovics, & Maraz, 2017) . Gaming may even be beneficial to relieve stress, reduce loneliness and increase well-being in general (Johannes, Vuorre, & Przybylski, 2021; Johnson, Jones, Scholes, & Carras, 2013; Kaye, Kowert, & Quinn, 2017; Reinecke, 2009) . This was also found in the context of the COVID-19 crisis (Barr & Copeland-Stewart, 2021) . Thus, moderate increase in time spent gaming and watching TV series may be an adaptive response to the changes in daily routines and stress caused by the crisis. However, for a minority of users, high involvement may progress into long-lasting problematic patterns of use. Professionals and policymakers may play a role to limit involvement in these activities by providing recommendations. As proposed by Kir aly et al. (2020) , these may include making a schedule of daily activities to keep a daily routine, the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle (e.g. regular physical activity, regular sleep, healthy food) and of social activities with family members and social interactions, the use of relaxation techniques and digital wellbeing apps, the awareness and regulation of one's screen time, and seeking help from professionals or help lines if needed.",

During lockdown, fathers spent more time on childcare because nurseries and schools were closed, grandparents were recommended not to look after children, and children were at home. Childless participants almost certainly had more free time available for gaming. Furthermore, participants living alone watched more internet pornography, whereas viewing by others did not change significantly. Being forced to stay at home during lockdown, social interactions and activities were particularly limited for those living alone, and they were likely more prone to social isolation (Marmet et al., 2021) . They may have watched more internet pornography to pass the time and to counter potential decreases in their real-life sexual activity.",

They also decreased their cigarette use by less than participants living in German-speaking regions. German speakers also showed a bigger increase in internet pornography, which had already been found to be more prevalent in Germanspeaking than in French-speaking regions before the COVID-19 crisis (Studer, Marmet, Wicki, & Gmel, 2019) . Thus, with the exception of internet pornography, differences between linguistic regions may reflect the fact that French-speaking regions were more seriously affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis than were Germanspeaking regions.",

Using self-reported questionnaires may introduce biases such as social desirability or recall bias. Also, because the C-SURF pre-COVID assessment was spread out over almost a year, participants had different time intervals between their pre-COVID and COVID assessments. Despite only about 50% of the participants invited to answer the COVID-study doing so, results from our sensitivity analysis, including all non-respondents, yielded the same patterns of change (although the significance of two coefficients differed from the main analyses). Also, although reported changes in substance use and other reinforcing behaviours could be attributed to the COVID-19 crisis, they could partly reflect seasonal changes or personal developmental changes. The present study's strengths include its large, non-selective sample. More importantly, it did not rely on retrospective pre-COVID period reports, as measures of substance use and other reinforcing behaviours from C-SURF were available.",

            "text": "To conclude, the present study suggests that, during the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis (until June 2020), there was a decrease in alcohol use (but not in cigarette or illegal cannabis use) and more time was spent on other reinforcing behaviours such as gaming or watching TV series (but not internet pornography). Substance use and other reinforcing behaviours increased more in some sample subgroups that were found to experience higher levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 crisis (Marmet et al., 2021) : those reporting changes in their work situation (deterioration, fewer working hours, more time spent working from home), healthcare workers in contact with potentially infected people, the childless or those living alone. These specific changes corroborated the hypothesis that substance use and other reinforcing behaviours were not only more likely to occur if they were available but also that may have served as a coping strategy if individuals experienced heightened stress and isolation during the crisis. One open question is whether these changes will persist, increase or decrease over time. This will depend on further developments in the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures taken to combat it, the occurrence and magnitude of the expected economic downturn, and potential changes in the socio-cultural landscape affecting the usage contexts of different substance and other reinforcing behaviours. Although this initial decrease in alcohol use is good news for public health, caution is warranted because substance use may increase in the wake of the post-COVID economic recession expected to occur in many countries. Close monitoring of further developments in substance use is thus recommended. As regards growing digital activities, efforts to prevent their progression to chronic patterns of excessive use (including addictions) may be needed. All authors had full access to all the study data and accept responsibility for data integrity and analytical accuracy.",
