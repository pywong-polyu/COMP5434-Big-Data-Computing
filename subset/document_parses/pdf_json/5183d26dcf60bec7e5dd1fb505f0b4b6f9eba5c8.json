Initial pulmonary failure does not exhibit classical features of ARDS; hypercoagulability is a common laboratory finding, and pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy has been reported post mortem 1, 2, 3 . Biomarkers cannot robustly identify such patients pre-emptively and no specific interventions exist to mitigate clinical deterioration. Mononuclear phagocytic cells are key immune cells and bind fibrinogen through the CD11b/CD18 dimer CR3, whose activated form can initiate microthrombus formation. Accordingly, we profiled circulating monocyte CD11b/CD18 cell surface density from COVID-19 infected adults who were (i) symptomatic but breathless, (ii) requiring ventilatory support, and (iii) recovering following ICU care for hypoxia.",

Analysis was performed using surplus material from routine CBC specimens. Sample preparation was with the TQ-Prep whole blood lysis system (Beckman Coulter), and antibody staining was with a Duraclone lyophilised antibody panel (B38683, Beckman Coulter, Table 1 ). A minimum of 50000 events were collected: monocytes were defined as CD45 + CD13 + CD33 ++ CD15 +/-SSc int cells. The expression level of each antigen was calculated as its corrected Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI): [raw value arithmetic mean fluorescence in monocytes -raw value arithmetic mean fluorescence in CD45 ++ CD2 + CD56-SSc lo T cells]. We defined \"hypoxic\" patients as requiring ICU Level 3 ventilatory support within 15 days of a PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection; \"convalescing\" as having recovered following ICU care for COVID with minimal or absent oxygen requirements, but at least 30 days from initial diagnosis; and \"well\" as having mild symptoms prompting a positive PCR test within the previous 10 days, but who were neither ever breathless nor hospitalised. No patient in this study had a prior history of malignancy or immunosuppression.",

CBC parameters were not significantly different, however expression of both CD11b and CD18 was higher in COVID-19 patients who were hypoxic requiring respiratory support. Convalescing patients had intermediate levels of CD11b, but CD18 had returned to normal. Levels were not elevated in patients who had SARS-CoV2 infection but remained well, and those requiring ventilatory support for reasons other than COVID-19. Consistent with others, we found that hypoxic COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia, but this was also seen in non-COVID hypoxic patients, and likely represents a stress response.",

CD11b and CD18, which together constitute Complement Receptor 3 (CR3) are key to this 5 . We demonstrate that monocyte CR3 is significantly increased in COVID-19 patients with hypoxia compared with those without respiratory symptoms and non-COVID hypoxic patients. This hitherto unappreciated observation tables monocyte activation as a biomarker for respiratory complications in COVID-19, possibly by driving thrombotic microangiopathy due to increased binding of fibrinogen. Although adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV2 determine subsequent immunity, innate immune responses dictate the early clinical course, and our findings encourage serial tracking of monocyte CR3 expression in individual patients with COVID-19. CR3 may be targeted therapeutically; both non-specifically by early anticoagulation, or directly using several licensed drugs 5 . Such approaches may reduce the likelihood of respiratory failure and could inform a preventative approach to the management of COVID19-mediated respiratory failure in the future.",
