At the beginning of the lockdown, the federal government and some state government had promised palliative measures to citizens of the country to ease the economic burden of the lockdown. However, due to limited resources, the palliative measures could only be provided to the 'poorest of the poor'. This socioeconomic group is mostly resident in the rural parts of the country and constitute 49.66% of the population, (35) .

(17) reported that about 25% of Chinese university students had mild to severe forms of anxiety during the COVID -19; in this study, a higher percentage of Nigerian university students (41.5%) experienced mild to severe forms of anxiety. The higher rate could be associated with different periods of data collection. While Cao et al. (17) collected data in February 2020, before the pandemic reached its peak in most parts of the world, data collection for this study occurred in May 2020, a period during which the cases were increasing exponentially in Nigeria. Some authors, (36) , had reported a lower rate of anxiety, 14.8%, before the COVD-19 pandemic, among undergraduate students in five universities in South-western Nigeria. Again, this is not surprising since several studies that took place in Italy, United States, China and Spain, (18) (19) (20) 32, 37) , have averred that the lockdown/self-quarantine associated with the COVID-19 was putting a lot of psychological strain on college students Further, mild to severe depression was present in 31.9% of university students who participated in this study, of which one-third were adolescents (aged 16-19 years). There was no significant association between the age categories and depression. Therefore this prevalence could be applied to the adolescent age group who participated in this study. Although, there is no national data on the prevalence of depression among Nigerian youths, there are reports of studies carried out in the same geopolitical zone where the present study was conducted. For instance, the prevalence found in this study is higher than that earlier reported for Nigerian adolescents, (38) , in which 21.2% of rural adolescents in south-western Nigeria, were found to have varying degrees of depression. It is not surprising that more participants in this study experienced depression since the COVID-19 lockdown was something that put emotional strain on many people. Likewise, a similar prevalence .

Also, students in states where there was a total lockdown experienced a significantly higher level of depression. This difference is logical since states with lockdown had a higher number of cases, and the students must have experienced increased susceptibility to the coronavirus infection coupled with lack of social gatherings or religious interaction. This is in consonant with what was reported by some authors, in studies involving higher institution students in China, (42, 43) . Another interesting finding is the students' responses regarding their 'willingness to speak to a health professional if they were experiencing anxiety or depression. On the whole, factors that were significant from the univariate analysis and included in the linear regression showed that that not being able to afford three meals in a day; poor family functioning; having a chronic illness and having a total lockdown in the state of residence accounted for 14% of depression seen among participants in the study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 286, "text": "(33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 765, "end": 769, "text": "(42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 770, "end": 773, "text": "43)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(which was not certified by peer review)"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the lockdown associated with COVID-19 has placed a lot of psychological stress on university students as more than a third of those who participated in this study had varying degrees of anxiety and depression.
