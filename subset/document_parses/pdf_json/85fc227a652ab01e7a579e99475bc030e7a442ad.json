His respiratory status rapidly declined, requiring intubation, and emergent admission to the intensive care unit. He was paralyzed and intubated for multiple weeks in the proned position. While in the hospital, the patient had developed an erythematous, indurated nonpainful patch lateral to umbilicus abdominal. Borders were marked for observation with low suspicion for an infectious process at that time. After negative COVID-19 testing and remaining afebrile for 72 h, the patient was discharged to a multidisciplinary rehabilitation center. While rehabilitating, the patient's rash progressed which prompted further evaluation. A limited abdominal ultrasound showed findings most consistent with cellulitis and showed no evidence of focal fluid collections. The patient was started on cephalexin for 7 days. The erythematous patch then worsened, spreading beyond the superior border and becoming more indurated. He was switched to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 7 days with only mild improvement. After vancomycin also failed to improve the condition, an inpatient dermatology consult was requested. A telemedicine consult was performed, and photographs were reviewed of the eruption through the patient's hospital stay. Early images demonstrated well demarcated erythema in areas of pressure. Subsequent photos demonstrated improvement of the erythema and development of alopecia (Figure 1 ). In the absence of leukocytosis and fever, a diagnosis of PA was given, attributed to prolonged pressure during his intensive care unit course rather than infectious causes, and antibiotics were discontinued.",

            "text": "year-old male presented with shortness of breath, cough, and fever. Rapid nasopharyngeal COVID-19 testing was positive. His respiratory status rapidly declined, requiring intubation, and emergent admission to the intensive care unit. He was paralyzed and intubated for multiple weeks in the proned position. While in the hospital, the patient had developed an erythematous, indurated nonpainful patch lateral to umbilicus abdominal. Borders were marked for observation with low suspicion for an infectious process at that time. After negative COVID-19 testing and remaining afebrile for 72 h, the patient was discharged to a multidisciplinary rehabilitation center. While rehabilitating, the patient's rash progressed which prompted further evaluation. A limited abdominal ultrasound showed findings most consistent with cellulitis and showed no evidence of focal fluid collections. The patient was started on cephalexin for 7 days. The erythematous patch then worsened, spreading beyond the superior border and becoming more indurated. He was switched to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 7 days with only mild improvement. After vancomycin also failed to improve the condition, an inpatient dermatology consult was requested. A telemedicine consult was performed, and photographs were reviewed of the eruption through the patient's hospital stay. Early images demonstrated well demarcated erythema in areas of pressure. Subsequent photos demonstrated improvement of the erythema and development of alopecia",
