The aim of our study was to identify environmental and behavioral risk factors of these diseases among schoolchildren in Metro Manila, Philippines. We analyzed data from a multistage cluster sample of grade 5-10 students to investigate WaSH facilities and hygiene practices. Outcomes were self-reported diarrhea and STH infection and observed malnutrition (stunting, undernutrition, overnutrition); we used logistic regression models to explore correlates. We included 1,558 students from 15 schools in 3 cities. Over 14% (212) of students experienced diarrhea only, 29.7% (438) experienced STH infection only, and 14% (207) experienced both diarrhea and STH infection. Over 15% (227) of students were stunted, ~6% (87) were undernourished, and 21% (306) were over-nourished. While diarrhea was associated with poor handwashing, avoiding school restrooms, and lack of a restroom cleaning policy, STH infection was associated with students' dissatisfaction with school restrooms. Risk of having both diarrhea and STH infection increased when school restrooms lacked water or were unclean. Being only stunted was associated with diarrhea, while being both stunted and undernourished was associated with STH infection. These findings demonstrate that adequate water supply and cleanliness of school WaSH facilities must be achieved and maintained to prevent disease.",

While many ongoing programs to prevent diarrhea and STH infection target children < 5, it is uncertain how older children are being affected. School-age children and teenagers should not be ignored as they also bear heavy burdens of diarrheal disease 5 and STH infection 6, 7 and may experience high rates of school absenteeism. 8, 9 STH infection in 2015 and diarrhea in 2016 resulted in ~6.1 million 2 and 74.4 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), 1 respectively. Diarrhea has been associated with high annual costs, ranging from USD $1.3-$1.7 million in Rwanda 10 to USD $926.4 million in China. 11 Malnutrition affects ~1 out of 3 people globally. 12 In 2017 stunting affected 22.2% (150.8 million) of all children < 5. In 2017, while 5.6% (38.3 million) of children were overweight, 7.5% (50.5 million) were wasted or thin. 13 Undernutrition, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), caused 45% of deaths in children < 5. 14 Overweight and obesity caused ~7% of deaths (4 million) and 120 million DALYs. 4 Malnutrition, in all its forms, costs society ~USD $3.5 trillion, or 5% of the global gross domestic product (GDP), annually. 15 Preventing children's malnutrition involves preventing infectious diseases that precipitate imbalanced protein and/or energy intake. Infectious diseases, in turn, can be prevented by improving WaSH, i.e. interrupting routes of fecal-oral disease transmission through proper handwashing, safe handling of food and disposal of feces, and providing increased children's risk for diarrhea or STH infection. We collected data from a subsample of children's households, assessing demographic information, families' handwashing, food security, and homes' WaSH facilities.",

We focused on 2 cities in MM, Navotas and Quezon City (Figure 1 ), because they are considered geographically and sociodemographically representative of the 14 other cities in MM. Our sampling frame (Figure 2 ) was the total number of public schools in Navotas and Quezon City, which consisted of 164 schools in 160 \"barangays\" (the smallest government units in the Philippines) in 8 legislative districts.",

We randomly selected 25 schools from the top of the sorted list to invite to participate in our study. After applying our inclusion criteria ( [1] accessibility of classrooms during school-day hours; [2] availability of WaSH facilities, e.g. toilets, handwashing basins), we identified 15 schools to visit and ask permission from school principals to conduct our survey. One of the 15 schools had served as the location of our previous pilot study wherein we tested our survey instruments. A 16 th school, located in the city of Manila, asked us directly to participate in our study. Before we finished our recruitment of study participants, one of the schools we invited to join our study refused to participate. Thus, our final study sample came from 15 out of 16 originally contacted schools in 3 cities (participation rate: 93.8%). During the second stage of sampling we asked school principals, or representatives who were familiar with students' schedules, to select the class section(s) that we would survey based on scheduling availability to help us comply with the DepEd's \"no disruption of class\" policy. Applying our inclusion criteria, of recruiting students in grade 5 or 6 from primary schools and students in grade 7, 9, or 10 from secondary schools, school principals/representatives selected the class section(s), while keeping the research team blinded. Based on the school's enrollment size, 1-3 class sections per school were selected in order to obtain a target sample of ~100 students per school. All students belonging to the selected class section(s) were invited to participate in our study if they met our inclusion criteria: able to 1) read, comprehend, and answer our questionnaire; 2) operate an electronic tablet independently or with minimal assistance; 3) provide a urine specimen; 4) be measured for height and weight.",

In our study, examining children's feces would not have been feasible due to financial, time, and personnel constraints. Furthermore, it would not have been appropriate or necessary for two reasons: 1) we aimed to measure STH infection prevalence, not STH infection intensity (thus, an egg count was not needed); 2) in the Philippines, public school children living in STH-endemic areas, such as out study site, Metro Manila, undergo biannual deworming. Thus, a child who recently underwent deworming would likely test negative for STH infection (no eggs or worms would be found in his/her feces). This would have resulted in a falsely lower STH prevalence rate, which failed to accurately measure the burden of disease. Another disadvantage of using feces-based measures was that some children may have felt too embarrassed to provide us with a specimen of their feces. For these reasons, we decided to use children's self-report as the measure for STH infection. The rationale for using self-report were: accuracy (depending on children's recall ability), convenience, and affordability. Selfreport enabled us to quickly and easily assess STH infection prevalence in a large study sample. Evidence is limited about using self-report to assess STH infection. However, evidence is available about using children's self-report to assess STH infection-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP). 44, 45 In our study, we defined STH infection as a \"yes\" answer to one question in the questionnaire (\"Have you ever had 'worms'?\").

In schools with 3-5 toilets, students reported significantly greater odds of diarrhea and non-significantly greater odds of STH infection. In schools with 6-18 toilets, students were also more likely to report both of these outcomes but with a smaller aOR, suggesting that disease risk decreases as the number of toilets increases. Furthermore, poor handwashing was associated with increased risk of diarrhea only, demonstrating how crucial it is to provide adequate handwashing facilities and lessons in schools to reduce diarrhea prevalence.

Such a finding is of concern, considering that community interventions using handwashing with soap, assessed via observation, have reduced the risk of diarrheal diseases by up to 47%. 80 An unexpected, non-significant association was found between schools' not providing hygiene lessons and decreased odds of diarrhea only and STH infection only. One reason could be the presence of unmeasured confounders. Another reason is the complicated relationship between exposures and outcomes. Multiple sectors overlap in WaSH management, making it more difficult to pinpoint or address risk factors of diarrhea and STH infection. This may also explain the unexpected association we found between schools' not having a policy for cleaning the restroom daily and decreased odds of STH infection only and decreased odds of both diarrhea and STH infection. However, schools' lack of policy for cleaning the restroom daily was significantly associated with increased odds of diarrhea only.",

As a result, children's risk for diarrhea would be decreased and we would see decreased diarrhea prevalence. Another explanation could be that other routes of disease transmission are more important than quantity or quality of water for this population, as previously described by Weaver and others, 81 citing Moe and others, 82 who reported that Filipino children who drank moderately contaminated water had similar diarrheal disease rates as those who drank uncontaminated water.

[101] [102] [103] Supported by evidence from the above studies, we considered self-reported diarrhea to be a good alternative to other measures of diarrhea, e.g. a review of medical records or interviews with children's parents. A review of medical records would not have been practical because more time and resources would have been needed to acquire permission to access confidential information and physically inspect hard copies of records for each individual child. Another reason is, because diarrhea is not considered to be a \"serious\" illness or reportable disease condition, medical records maintained by schools may not have included this type of information. Diarrhea is not usually diagnosed by a physician via a clinical test, but rather by patient-reported symptoms of having loose/watery bowel movements. Interviews with children's parents would have also been impractical due to increased time and resource constraints. Another reason is, because school-age children do not typically tell their parents about their bowel movements because they think it is unnecessary and/or embarrassing. Thus, had we relied on data from parents' interviews, rather than data provided directly by children, the information could have been incomplete or inaccurate. Considering the sensitive nature of the topic, it was best to ask the children themselves.

Therefore, we used a one-month recall period to capture more cases of diarrhea, some of which may have been missed if we only asked children about the last 7 days. We expect any inaccuracies from our study to not be differential with respect to exposure to inadequate school WaSH; i.e., we do not anticipate that exposure to school WaSH affected the accuracy of children's self-reported diarrhea. Thus, we assume that any non-differential misclassification of outcomes would bias our findings toward, not away, from the null. Future studies using recall periods shorter than one-month may show more pronounced diarrhea risk, depending on the season (dry v. wet). However, using clinical specimens to ascertain diarrhea may show decreased diarrhea risk, as more children could feel more embarrassed to provide researchers with specimens of their loose/watery feces.",

We did not use an egg countbased measure because: 1) our study aimed to estimate disease occurrence, not infection intensity or egg distribution; 2) others consider egg counting to have low analytic sensitivity. 109 Another reason is because STH infection is endemic in the Philippines and public school children are expected, per DepEd policies, 110, 111 which are in line with the WHO 2017 guidelines, 112 to undergo deworming twice per year. Recently dewormed children may have no eggs or worms in their feces. Thus, if had we had relied on egg count to estimate STH infection prevalence, we may have ended up with a lower than expected STH prevalence rate that did not accurately reflect disease occurrence.",

Urine test strips may be preferred in field settings because they allow for point-of-care (POC) measurement that is done on-the-spot, without the need to transport specimens to an external storage facility or laboratory. Others have reported that variability exists between data obtained by urine test strips and data obtained by refractometry, and that urine test strips are not as reliable as refractometry in assessing dehydration. [118] [119] [120] However, others have reported that urine test strips are an acceptable alternative for refractometry in assessing dehydration.

A disadvantage of using urine test strips is that the accuracy of measurements may decrease as urine alkalinity increases (pH > 7). 124 Another way to assess dehydration is to examine clinical features, e.g. dry/chapped lips, dry/sticky mouth, cold skin, dry/sunken eyes. However, the appearance of clinical features may vary from child to child. It is possible that some children in our study had an Usg within normal limits but may have actually been dehydrated. In these cases, because we did not assess for clinical features of dehydration, we would have not been able to accurately identify such children as dehydrated. We did not triangulate our measure of dehydration with medical records, reports by teachers or parents, or children's subjective report of feeling thirsty. Thus, the prevalence rate of acute dehydration that we reported in this paper could be an underestimation.",

We have identified 2 policy and practice areas to close this gap and thereby reduce diarrhea and STH infection in students from similar settings: First, a school administrator may be designated to lead a small team of \"super-users\" (school personnel) to ensure restrooms are being cleaned and maintained, provide hygiene lessons, and promote group handwashing among students. Second, a group of student volunteers may be named as \"restroom monitors\" in each school to ensure that WaSH facilities are properly used and kept clean, and to remind their fellow students to wash their hands after using the toilet/urinal. The promotion of proper handwashing is urgently needed, not only to prevent diarrhea and STH infection but also to help children thrive during the \"new normal\".

Interesting future studies could explore school WaSH facilities and students' diarrhea and STH infection prevalence in other countries in the Global South, e.g. Vietnam and Thailand, where temperatures and rainfall are as high as in the Philippines, but the rates of diarrhea-and STH infection-related mortality are, in contrast with our sample, lower.",

Findings from our study addressed these knowledge gaps by characterizing, via a mixed-methods approach, the WaSH situation in 15 public schools and the prevalence of diarrhea, STH infection, malnutrition, and dehydration in schoolchildren. By linking schools' WaSH facilities and students' handwashing and dissatisfaction with and avoidance of school restrooms with disease prevalence, we provide evidence to support the continued use and fine-tuning of comprehensive school-based WaSH interventions and environmental health and education programs, specifically those which promote proper handwashing. Our findings demonstrate that new school WaSH strategies are needed, on the one hand, to protect children from fecalcontaminated water that drives disease risks, and on the other hand, to ensure children have access to the benefits of water security: good health, hygiene, and hydration. Our study is limited by its cross-sectional, observational design; we make no attempt to measure causal inferences. More studies are needed to understand the complex relationship between schools' WaSH facilities and schoolchildren's hygiene practices and diarrhea, STH infection, and malnutrition in the Philippines. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",
