A growing body of evidence suggests also a notable role of genetic factors in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity [3] [4] [5] , and several studies have identified a robust association at chromosome 3p21.31 locus. However, the functional mechanisms of this association are unclear. The locus includes multiple protein-coding genes, for example, LIMD1, SACM1L, SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, and XCR1, many of which have potentially relevant role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. As genetic variants have been shown to often exert their effect on complex traits or disease via cis-regulation of gene expression [6, 7] , expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping could serve as a mean to pinpoint candidate genes for trait or diseases of interest.",

We hypothesized that genetic regulatory variants for genes pinpointed by the CRISPR screen would show an increased signal for genetic association for COVID-19 in the human population. To this end, we analyzed if eQTLs from lung tissue [7] for these genes would be enriched for overall association signal in data from the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative [4] with six COVID-19-related GWAS (release 3) with different definition of cases and controls. Indeed, we observed inflation of the GWAS association signal for variants that are cis-eQTLs for top-ranked CRISPR hit genes in the hospitalized vs not hospitalized COVID-19 GWAS, compared to all lung eQTLs (l0.1 = 2.14, permutation P-value = 0.046, Fig. 1ab) .

Next, we analyzed if the COVID-19 ANA_C2_V2 GWAS lead variant 3:45867022:C:G affects expression of any of these genes. Using data from the eQTL Catalogue [9] and GTEx v8 [7] , we analyzed all eQTL associations for this variant, and performed colocalization analysis [10, 11] to assess if the eQTL and GWAS signal share a genetic cause. CXCR6 and SLC6A20 stood out, with the eQTL data indicating that the COVID-19-associating variant affects the expression of these two genes (Fig. 1c , Additional file 1: Figure S2 , Additional file 2: Table S1 ). The eQTL affecting CXCR6 is active in memory T follicular helper (Tfh) CD4 + T cells [12] and has a suggestive colocalization with the GWAS (Fig. 1d-e) . The colocalization signal was very strong for the cis-eQTL for SLC6A20 in four tissues from GTEx -esophagus muscularis, breast mammary tissue, skeletal muscle, and tibial nerve (Additional file 1: Figure S3 ). Other genes in the region, such as LZTFL1, FYCO1, and XCR1, also have regulatory variants affecting their expression, but two distinct variants likely drive the GWAS and eQTL signals (Fig 1d-e) . Given that both the CRISPR screen and eQTL data support the causal role of SLC6A20 and CXCR6, it is possible that the COVID-19 GWAS association in the 3p21.31 locus is driven by pleiotropic effects of the same variant on multiple genes in different cell types.",

Inflation estimate l0.1 measures the inflation of test statistics relative to the chi-square quantile function of 0.1. b, Histogram of the permuted log(l0.1) to test the significance of the inflation of variants that are eQTLs for CRISPR screen hit genes (n = 243) in Lung in ANA_B1_V2 COVID-19 GWAS. c, Prioritization of genes in the 3p21.31 locus associated with COVID-19 vs population (ANA_C2_V2) GWAS. The top panel shows the ranking of the genes in the locus according to the second-best guide RNA score in the low MOI (black) and high MOI (blue) pooled CRISPR screens. The middle panel shows the eQTL P-values for the lead GWAS variant 3:45867022:C:G (denoted as a blue tick on the x-axis) in different cell types and tissues from the eQTL Catalogue and GTEx v8, 110 eQTL data sets in total. Highlighted are nine cell types/tissues, where the eQTL P-value for the lead GWAS variant is < 10 -4 for at least one gene in the region. Filled square denotes suggestive",

We measured inflation using the lambda inflation statistic relative to the chi-square quantile function of 0.1, l0.1, i.e., estimating the inflation among 10% of the most significant tests. We calculated l0.1 for two sets of eQTLs: 1) all lead eQTLs in lung(14,113  genes with significant eQTLs in lung at FDR 5%, serving as a background set), 2) all lead eQTLs in lung for CRISPR hit genes (274 out 588 topranked genes have eQTLs in lung at FDR < 0.05).",
