Published studies of vaccines suggest that they are immunogenic, effective and well-tolerated [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .

Two groups were formed-the first comprised those vaccinated with BNT162b2, from whom a sample was taken between three and four weeks after the first dose and a second sample two to three weeks after the second dose-based on previous published studies with this vaccine [6, 7, 9] . In the second group, participants vaccinated with Ad5-nCoV were sampled five to six weeks post-vaccination, with the intention that this was a similar timeframe to the full schedule of the BNT162b2 vaccination.

In the case of the BNT162b2 vaccine S1 IgG antibodies were detected after the application of the first dose in 80.3% of the participants. With the application of the second dose, the seroconversion percentage increased to 98.36%. This result is consistent with the fact that the pharmacist indicates a two-dose vaccination schedule [22] and highlights the importance of applying both doses. Regarding the Ad5-nCoV vaccine, 88.89% of the participants generated detectable S1 IgG antibodies. Both vaccines were reported to generate cellular and humoral responses [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , and both immune responses were reported to be important for the resolution of infection. Regarding the importance of humoral immunity, in animal models, studies show that the generation of IgG and neutralizing antibodies is important to defend against SARS-CoV-2 infection [23, 24] . The media reported mortality from COVID-19 in people vaccinated by BNT162b2 and Ad5-nCoV in Mexico without having official data [25] . In other countries, mortality from COVID-19 was also reported in vaccinated people [26] . Although this study sets the precedent that not everyone who receives a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has detectable S1 IgG antibodies, it has not yet been studied whether vaccination-seronegative people are those most affected when they become infected with SARS-CoV-2. The finding of this work is important as it suggests that the response expected from vaccination at the level of the generation of IgG antibodies does not occur in all cases, and this could vary between vaccines and in different populations. This topic is of high importance and should be studied in greater detail as a priority topic.",

The BNT162b2 vaccine generated very similar numbers of antibodies to those found in people with severe COVID-19 (median of 8.22; manuscript in preparation), although some participants achieved higher numbers of antibodies than those found in people with the natural infection. Participants vaccinated with Ad5-nCoV had lower antibody levels than those who had asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 6.4; manuscript in preparation), determined with the same test. The number of antibodies necessary to confer seroprotection is not known; however, a higher generation of antibodies is associated with a longer duration of seroprotection [30] and greater protection against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants [31] .",

Regarding age, our two groups (one per vaccine) showed very different age averages. This was the case because, in the city of the study, the health authorities indicated the application of the BNT162b2 vaccine in the population group aged 60 years and over, while the Ad5-nCoV vaccine was indicated for the entire educational sector, which includes a population with a wide age range. It should also be noted that, for the group who were over 60 years old, the BNT162b2 vaccine was applied before the Ad5-nCoV vaccine; it was for this reason that there were no people over 60 years old in the second group.",

If age is an important factor in the generation of antibodies, the seroconversion of Ad5-nCoV in older people should be studied since, in this study, the Ad5-nCoV vaccine presented a lower percentage of seroconversion in younger people.",

In this work, some of the possible side effects of the application of the vaccines under study were evaluated. The side effects found in the population that received the first and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine corresponded to those reported in phase-three trials [7] .
