Primarily, it spreads when people are in close contact, but it may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose or mouth.

The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically around 5 days but may range from 2 to 14 days. Fever and chills and dry cough, as well as shortness of breath, are commonly reported symptoms [1] . Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Despite the promising results from in vitro studies, chloroquine has not been shown conclusively to be efficacious in the treatment of COVID-19. However, it is now part of the recommendations for treatment in several countries while awaiting results of planned and on-going clinical trials [23, 36] . These recommendations have been informed by two main sources-an expert consensus on chloroquine phosphate for treatment of COVID-19 from China and a clinical study undertaken in France [26, 37] . These and one other small study reported from China suggest that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine prevent worsening of pneumonia, facilitate clearance of the virus and shorten the duration of COVID-19 [24] [25] [26] 37] . Broadly, this study is asking three different questions, namely (i) does chloroquine phosphate safely improve patient outcome when added to the standard treatment for COVID-19 compared to the addition of placebo; (ii) does hydroxychloroquine sulphate safely improve patient outcome when added to the standard treatment for COVID-19 compared to the addition of placebo?; and (iii) does lopinavir/ritonavir safely improve patient outcome when added to the standard treatment for COVID-19 compared to the addition of placebo.",
