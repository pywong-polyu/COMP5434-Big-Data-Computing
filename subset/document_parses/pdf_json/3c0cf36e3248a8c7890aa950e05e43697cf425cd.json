            "text": "COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, can involve sequelae and other medical complications that last weeks to months after initial recovery, which has come to be called Long-COVID or COVID long-haulers. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to identify studies assessing longterm effects of COVID-19 and estimates the prevalence of each symptom, sign, or laboratory parameter of patients at a post-COVID-19 stage. LitCOVID (PubMed and Medline) and Embase were searched by two independent researchers. All articles with original data for detecting longterm COVID-19 published before 1 st of January 2021 and with a minimum of 100 patients were included. For effects reported in two or more studies, meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed using the MetaXL software to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed using I 2 statistics. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewers and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. A total of 18,251 publications were identified, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of 55 longterm effects was estimated, 21 meta-analyses were performed, and 47,910 patients were included. The follow-up time ranged from 15 to 110 days post-viral infection. The age of the study participants ranged between 17 and 87 years. It was estimated that 80% (95% CI 65-92) of the patients that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed one or more long-term symptoms. The five most common symptoms were fatigue (58%), headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), hair loss (25%), and dyspnea (24%). All meta-analyses showed medium (n=2) to high heterogeneity (n=13). In order to have a better understanding, future studies need to stratify by sex, age, previous comorbidities, severity of COVID-19 (ranging from asymptomatic to severe), and duration of each symptom. From the clinical perspective, multi-disciplinary teams are crucial to developing preventive measures, rehabilitation techniques, and clinical management strategies with wholepatient perspectives designed to address long COVID-19 care.",

Given that LitCOVID includes all articles from MedLine, in the search in Embase we excluded the articles from MedLine and those not related to COVID-19. All types of studies, including randomized controlled trials, cohorts, and cross-sectional studies, were analyzed only when the cases (numerator) were part of a COVID-19 cohort (denominator). Titles, abstracts, and full texts of articles were independently screened by two authors (SLL and TWO). The complete article was reviewed in case of difference of opinion on the inclusion based on title or abstract. Disagreement on the inclusion of a full-text article was discussed with all the authors. The exclusion criteria were: (1) not written in English; (2) have less than 100 patients included in the study.

Measurable parameters included 6 elevated laboratory parameters, i.e., interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin, serum ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP), and D-dimer. Abnormal chest XRay/computed tomography (CT) was also identified ( Figure 2 ). Table 2 presents the prevalence of all the effects that were reported.

This systematic review and metaanalysis shows that 80% (95% CI 65-92) of individuals with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis continue to have at least one overall effect beyond three weeks following acute infection. In total, 55 effects, including symptoms, signs, and laboratory parameters, were identified, with fatigue, anosmia, lung dysfunction, abnormal chest XRay/CT, and neurological disorders being the most common (Table 1, Figure 2 ). Most of the symptoms were similar to the symptomatology developed during the acute phase of COVID-19. However, there is a possibility that there are other effects that have not yet been identified. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss the most common symptoms to illustrate how complex each one can be. However, further studies are needed to understand each symptom separately and in conjunction with the other symptoms. The five most common effects were fatigue (58%), headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), hair loss (25%), and dyspnea (24%).",

There are syndromes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in which it has been observed that after a year, more than two-thirds of patients reported clinically significant fatigue symptoms 15 . The symptoms observed in post-COVID-19 patients, resemble in part the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which includes the presence of severe incapacitating fatigue, pain, neurocognitive disability, compromised sleep, symptoms suggestive of autonomic dysfunction, and worsening of global symptoms following minor increases in physical and/or cognitive activity [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Currently, myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or CFS is a complex and controversial clinical condition without established causative factors, and 90% of ME/CFS has not been diagnosed 21 . Possible causes of CFS include viruses, immune dysfunction, endocrine-metabolic dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric factors. The infectious agents related to CFS have been Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus and herpesvirus 22 . It is tempting to speculate that SARS-CoV-2 can be added to the viral agents' list causing ME/CFS. Several neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported, headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), and anosmia (21%). There are other symptoms reported, which were not included in the publications, including brain fog and neuropathy 23, 24 . The etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients is complex and multifactorial. They could be related to the direct effect of the infection, cerebrovascular disease (including hypercoagulation) 25 , physiological compromise (hypoxia), side effects of medications, and social aspects of having a potentially fatal illness 26 . Adults have a double risk of being newly diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder after the COVID-19 diagnosis 26 , and the most common psychiatric conditions presented were anxiety disorders, insomnia, and dementia. Sleep disturbances might contribute to the presentation of psychiatric disorders. 27 Prompt diagnosis and intervention of any neuropsychiatric care is recommended for all patients recovering from COVID-19. An increase in mental health attention models in hospitals and communities is needed during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Hair loss after COVID-19 could be considered as telogen effluvium, defined by diffuse hair loss after an important systemic stressor or infection, and it is caused because of premature follicular transitions from active growth phase (anagen) to resting phase (telogen). It is a self-limiting condition that lasts approximately 3 months, but it could cause emotional distress 28 .",

Abnormalities in pulmonary function, such as decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, were present among 10% of patients in this meta-analysis. Although these findings are not as high as compared to other available studies of survivors with COVID-19 or SARS, where the estimate of lung dysfunction is 53% and 28% respectively 32,33 , the reasons behind these differences could be distinct follow-up periods, definitions of pulmonary dysfunction, or characteristics of the patient population.

In addition, MERS survivors showed pulmonary fibrosis (33%) 37 .

All of the studies assessed had performed their internal pre-definition of symptoms, and therefore there is the possibility that important outcomes were not reported. Another limitation is that, given that COVID-19 is a new disease, it is not possible to determine how long these effects will last. In order to decrease heterogeneity and have a better understanding of the long-term effects of COVID-19, there is a need for studies to stratify by age, previous comorbidities, the severity of COVID-19 (including asymptomatic), as well as the duration of each symptom. To determine whether these long-term effects either complicate previous diseases or are a continuation of COVID-19, there is a need for prospective cohort studies. The baseline characteristics should be well established.",
