            "text": "Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite capable of infecting a large number of warm-blooded animals and causes serious health complications in immunocompromised patients. T. gondii infection of the feline small intestine is critical for the completion of the life cycle and transmission of T. gondii. Protein acetylation is an important posttranslational modification, which plays roles in the regulation of various cellular processes. Therefore, understanding of how T. gondii reprograms the protein acetylation status of feline definitive host can help to thwart the production and spread of T. gondii. Here, we used affinity enrichment and high-resolution liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to profile the alterations of the acetylome in cat small intestine 10 days after infection by T. gondii Prugniuad (Pru) strain. Our analysis showed that T. gondii induced significant changes in the acetylation of proteins in the cat intestine. We identified 2606 unique lysine acetylation sites in 1357 acetylated proteins. The levels of 334 acetylated peptides were downregulated, while the levels of 82 acetylated peptides were increased in the infected small intestine. The proteins with differentially acetylated peptides were particularly enriched in the bioenergeticsrelated processes, such as tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and oxidation-reduction. These results provide the first baseline of the global acetylome of feline small intestine following T. gondii infection and should facilitate further analysis of the role of acetylated protein in the pathogenesis of T. gondii infection in its definitive host.",

Cats play an important role in spreading of T. gondii, and one infected cat can discharge millions of oocysts in the feces (/Dubey 2001) . The ability of T. gondii to enter and sexually differentiate within intestinal epithelial cells into oocysts constitutes a fundamental step in the biology and transmission of this parasite. A deeper understanding of the molecular events that shape the interaction of T. gondii with the feline intestine is therefore important for developing new intervention to interrupt the production of oocysts, which in turn may reduce the spread of infection to other hosts.",

The orthologous proteins were classified by using orthologous groups of proteins (COG) database (Tatusov et al. 2000) . Functional enrichment analysis was performed to identify the enriched pathways using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Kanehisa 2008) . KEGG pathways were considered significant at a P value of < 0.05. WoLF PSORT algorithm was applied to predict the subcellular locations of the PDAPs (Horton et al. 2007) . For motif analysis, the 11mers amino acid (\u00b1 5 amino acids residues around the lysine acetylation site) of sequences of all DAPs was analyzed using Motif-x software.

Most of these proteins have only a single lysine acetylation site. These results agree with that reported previously (Weinert et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 2016a) . T. gondii infection can alter the expression of genes involved in protein (Cong et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2018 ).

Previous proteomic studies have shown that a large number of protein lysine acetylation events occur in the mitochondria (Gibson 2005; Jardim et al. 2018; Peinado et al. 2014) . As shown in Fig. 4b , mitochondrion was enriched by the proteins with downregulated acetylated peptides. In TCA cycle, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and aconitate hydratase (ACO2) whose structural and functional stability had impacts on mitochondrial energy metabolism (Matasova and Popova 2008; Wang et al. 2009 ) were highly acetylated. In TCA cycle, citrate synthase (CS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC) are rate-limiting enzymes that play roles in regulating the TCA process. TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) are crucial steps for ATP production. In the present study, 44 proteins whose acetylated peptide abundances were downregulated in the infected small intestine were enriched in the OxPhos process (Fig. S2) . The downregulated acetylation of OxPhos process and hypometabolic state seems to be bioenergetic tradeoffs strategy to promote host tissue tolerance to infection.",

These proteins included hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, catalase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, carnitine O-acetyltransferase, acyl-coenzyme A oxidase, superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxin, nudix hydrolase 13, ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 3, and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4.

GO annotation analysis showed that most of the proteins with increased acetylated peptides are involved in promoting apoptosis (Fig. 4a) . Interestingly, GO enrichment uncovered several PDAPs involved in mitochondrial matrix and mitochondrion. Also, we have shown in this study that T. gondii through downregulation of the acetylation of OxPhos can affect mitochondrial metabolism. The cytochrome c protein, which controls redox signaling in mitochondrial OxPhos, is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol to activate caspase proteases that trigger apoptotic changes (Hengartner 2000) . These results suggest a clear impact of T. gondii-induced alterations of protein acetylation on the bioenergetics and apoptotic processes in the cat intestine. Sexual reproduction of T. gondii is a highly elaborate event, which involves parasite proliferation, differentiation and host cell destruction (Dubey et al. 1998) . Following invasion of the feline small intestine, tachyzoites transform into a presexual merozoite that replicates and differentiates into male and female gametes, which ultimately form zygotes. Therefore, it is reasonable to anticipate a significant metabolic burden and an increased cellular destruction during T. gondii infection of the feline intestine. To what extent the acetylated peptides that were found associated with apoptosis and mitochondrial metabolism in the present study can influence the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in the cat small intestine remains to be elucidated.",

            "text": "The acetylated protein of T. gondii tachyzoites has been described previously (Wang et al. 2019 ). However, the acetylation status of T. gondii proteins during intestinal infection of cats was unknown until the present study, where we also identified 40 acetylated proteins of T. gondii. The majority of the acetylated proteins of T. gondii belong to histone H2A, histone H2B, histone H3, and histone H4 families. Histone is an important component of chromatin and plays a key role in regulation of gene expression (Nardelli et al. 2013) . A previous report showed that shock protein 70 (HSP70) and heat shock protein 10 (HSP10) of T. gondii are acetylated proteins (Wang et al. 2019 ). In the present study, HSP70 and HSP10 were also identified as acetylated proteins. HSP70 is a virulence factor expressed during the transformation of T. gondii from tachyzoites to bradyzoites and plays a role in parasite replication and immune responses (Barenco et al. 2014) . Also, we found one acetylated hypothetical protein TGME49_201640 whose function remains unknown and is only expressed in the oocyst and feline enterocyte stage. Bioinformatic analysis showed that this protein is a secretory protein. This suggests that the product of the TGME49_201640 gene might be discharged into host cells and contributes to the interaction between feline enterocyte and T. gondii. The identified acetylated peptides listed in Table S3 may help us to elucidate new biological functions of T. gondii secretome in mediating the interaction between T. gondii and the small intestine of the feline definitive host.",
