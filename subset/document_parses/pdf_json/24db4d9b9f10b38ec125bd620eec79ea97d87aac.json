[11] [12] [13] These concerns about the NHS' ability to cope with large influxes of patients took on a new level of significance in early 2020, when the WHO formally declared COVID-19 a pandemic illness, due to its virulence and the magnitude of the disease's impact globally. 14 As early reports from China were published, it became apparent that a relatively large proportion of individuals who contracted COVID-19 required admission to hospital, 15 for example due to new oxygen requirements, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even multiorgan dysfunction. Forecasts of the potential number of people requiring hospital admission and mechanical ventilation across the UK suggested that the baseline capacity of the NHS would be insufficient. 16 In an effort to ensure sufficient capacity the British government instituted a series of policies, including facilitating the discharge of individuals who had been delayed due to non-medical reasons in an effort to unlock capacity, 17 cancelling all non-urgent clinical work, opening large field hospitals (ie, the Nightingale hospitals) 18 and increasing mechanical ventilator availability for use in clinical areas repurposed to manage patients requiring higher-acuity care. 19 The UK started making significant strides towards rolling back its non-pharmacological interventions in June 2020, including reopening schools and planning for the discontinuation of shielding for vulnerable people, 20 signalling an end to the first wave of the pandemic. 21 Following these changes, there was the potential for a second wave of COVID-19 related admissions at the end of 2020. Understanding regional differences in hospital capacity is fundamental to informing the UK's response to the potential second wave andany future epidemics, as well as for elucidating how to safely wind down repurposed surge capacity, such as operating theatres to allow other much needed clinical activity to restart. 22 However, other than a few isolated news reports of hospitals exceeding their ventilator capacity, 23 it is unclear how well the NHS as a whole managed to respond to the additional demand for beds over the recent months. In this study, we sought to describe the pattern of bed occupancy in hospitals across England during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Bed acuity was organised into general and acute (G&A), beds compatible with non-mechanical ventilation and beds compatible with mechanical ventilation. Occupancy is calculated based on the status of each bed at 08:00 each day, and then later separated by the proportion that had a positive COVID-19 test; there was no available information on the temporal relationship between admission and a positive test and thus these data reflect some combination of community-acquired and nosocomial COVID-19.",

However, one crucial outcome was that it became apparent the definition of critical care beds used prior to 27 April 2020 was not consistent with prior reporting practices of only including level 2 (HDU) and level 3 (ICU) beds, 24 as the newly reported values did not equal the simultaneously reported critical care values. As such, any results pertaining to critical care, HDU and ICU are reported separately in the online supplemental material. NHS England reports trust-level data, whereas we additionally attempted to disaggregate this information into the individual hospitals that the trusts comprise. Not all of the trusts were amenable to disaggregation from the trustlevel data into independently reported sites in the available extracts, resulting in a final sample of 173 unique hospital sites, comprising 91.7% of the total number of ventilated beds and 81.4% of the G&A beds when compared with trust level. The change in data reporting introduced on 27 April 2020 also resulted in variation in information capture; for data prior to 27 April, the results available reflect 89.6% of all mechanical ventilator beds and 86.9% of G&A beds, whereas for data from 27 April onwards the results reflect 93.0% of all mechanical ventilator beds but 77.0% of G&A beds.",

Our analysis suggests that the response of the NHS and British government to COVID-19 was sufficient to alleviate early concerns regarding the number of mechanical ventilators and critical care beds at a national level; however, local variation in demand (ie, regional variation in COVID-19 prevalence) still meant that many trusts reached 100% capacity for both. Moreover, examining occupancy in the context of different organisational units (ie, trust level vs STP level) suggests that the higher order networks (ie, STPs) were not efficiently used to offload disproportionately impacted trusts, as it was theoretically possible to have 95.1% fewer trust-days at 100% mechanical ventilator bed capacity assuming load was better distributed. On the other hand, despite a reduction in overall capacity, G&A bed occupancy levels relatively infrequently reached 'unsafe' levels, even at the individual hospital level. This in part may explain why the field hospitals and independent sector care provider beds were never substantially used. Only a very small fraction of the theoretical maximum field hospital bed capacity was operationalised (1.23%). Similarly, despite signing a 14-week block contract with all of the major independent sector care providers valued at \u00a3235 million, 28 these beds too remained largely unoccupied, with less than 24% of the theoretical maximum beds days for established Figure 6 Peak STP bed occupancy across England. The date on which general and acute bed occupancy (left) and mechanical ventilator beds (right) peaked, based on surge capacities at the STP level across England. The geotemporal pattern of peak occupancy clearly demonstrates that there was always residual general and acute bed capacity at the STP level and that all regions across England experienced similar levels of saturation. However, saturation of mechanical ventilator beds differed substantially by location. STP, sustainability and transformation partnership.

These estimates were later updated to just 18 000 mechanical ventilators, from an estimated baseline of 8000 across the UK. 29 It is difficult to determine the accuracy of these projections, as they were made in the absence of the impact of non-pharmacological interventions. However, the results of our study suggest that, at the population level, UK-based models of ventilator and bed resource utilisation which integrated the impact of nonpharmacological interventions were actually remarkably accurate. 16 30 Arguably the most influential modelling study was that of the Imperial MRC (Medical Research Council) Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis group, where the authors clearly illustrate that with full 'lockdown' (ie, the suite of non-pharmacological interventions that were eventually instituted) critical care bed capacity would not be overwhelmed. 16 The nuance that this modelling study lacked was that it failed to explicitly incorporate the impact of unequal distribution of burden, which manifested in our data as specific hospitals and trusts reaching full occupancy, despite the fact that at the national level there were a substantial number of unoccupied beds. This retrospective analysis also highlights some of the early incorrect assumptions made about the UK's baseline resource availability. For example, in contrast to ministerial statements suggesting that there were approximately 8000 ventilators in the UK prior to the pandemic, 29 our results identified only 4123 operational beds compatible with mechanical ventilation on the first day of reporting in England. Even after acknowledging that our value does not account for the devolved nations (Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland), it is unlikely that the initial figures reported by members of the parliament truly reflected operational capacity, as that would suggest only 50% of such equipment was in England, despite it representing 84% of the UK population. Interestingly, the absolute increase in ventilator numbers due to government incentives (eg, the UK's Industrial Ventilator Challenge) is much more similar to our reported results.",

One example of how this robustness manifested is, unlike other attempts to collect data at a national level to inform the COVID-19 response plan in the UK, 32 the degree of missingness in the data used in this study was minimal (see online supplemental material). Moreover, in light of the unique access to the raw 'SitRep' data, we have been able to not only present our results at the trust level, to which previous endeavours have been limited, 33 but rather have been able to present information at a much more granular layer (ie, hospital/site level), thus providing a much richer understanding of resource utilisation that is less prone to the diluent effects of higher level geographies. Finally, a further strength of this study is the relative simplicity of the analysis; there are no complex statistical methods used as the descriptive summaries presented are sufficient to describe the experiences of nationalised (single-payer) health system in a high-income economy during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Notably though, there are also several limitations to the data set and our analysis. Principally we have no information on individual clinician and patient behaviour that will have inevitably influence these occupancy rates and thus cannot comment on these factors. Second, there are limitations inherent to the SitRep data. In particular, data were not available during February and early March, during which some early 'bed mobilization' was likely carried out, and thus our observation period does not cover the entirety of the first wave (however, we believe it is unlikely that this undermines the major findings of this study). Moreover, changes introduced in 'SitRep' data collection halfway through the reporting period limited our ability to investigate critical care bed occupancy, which was the third bed-specific potential concern identified by forecasting experts. The hospitallevel results should also be interpreted with caution as they are an incomplete representation of the core trustlevel information and thus may not truly reflect the exact position of each organisation; for example, the trust corresponding to the single site that achieved 100% G&A occupancy was never itself at 100% total occupancy. On a related note, the core weakness of the 'SitRep' data is that data are presented as a daily snapshot (at 08:00) and therefore are unable to capture the nuances of the hospital throughput; in essence, both under-reporting and over-reporting of occupancy are possible using this method. As such, any marginal results where hospitals are only just over one of the 'safe occupancy-level' thresholds should be interpreted with caution as they could represent reporting artefacts. Moreover, the use of the occupancy thresholds reflects a limitation of our analysis, in that a proxy for adverse outcomes had to be used given that the necessary information was not readily available to directly explore the relationship between occupancy and patient-level outcome. Finally, the results of this study may not be generalisable to other countries given that it is specific to the UK National Health System infrastructure and reporting systems; for example, it is difficult to draw comparisons with other countries as UK-specific factors such as reporting definitions are likely to mediate the hypothesised occupancy-mortality risk relationship, which will inevitably limit the ecological validity of these results in other geographical settings.",

            "text": "This study illustrates the potential for near real-time results reporting by which to determine the need for and the effectiveness of government policies introduced to address resource utilisation-specific issues as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, due to an unequal distribution of the resource utilisation burden across England, many trusts spent a significant period of time operating above 'safe-occupancy' thresholds, despite the fact that in the vast majority of circumstances there was relief capacity in geographically co-located trusts (ie, at the STP level). Out of the 81 trust-days spent at 100% saturation of their mechanical ventilation beds (which pertains to 23 trusts reaching this threshold), on all but 5 days there was spare capacity at the corresponding STP level, which would have resulted in only 4 trusts reaching 100% saturation at any point (online supplemental SFigure 11). This reflects a key operational issue for policymakers to address in preparing for a potential second wave, and would have been identifiable if the SitRep data had been used for now-casting. Moreover, other policies for which these results may be relevant include the creation of the Nightingale (field) hospitals and independent sector network partnership. Our results suggest that the early investment and the creation of an operational field hospital and independent sector network may yield more overtly positive results in the winter, when G&A occupancy levels regularly exceed 92% 34 ; however, during the first wave of the pandemic they were underutilised.",

However, the burden of need was not equally distributed, and thus in many cases local demand exceeded the supply of beds, especially where it concerned mechanical ventilation. Although several of the policies introduced by the government, both historical (ie, STPs) and pandemic-specific (eg, the independent sector block contract), could have potentially addressed this issue, there is evidence that these interventions were not optimally used. As such, we hope that this paper acts as exemplar for how routinely collected administrative data can be used to evaluate policy interventions, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as highlighting the need for locally relevant (in lieu of national or regional summaries), near-real-time information on service use for operational decision making.
