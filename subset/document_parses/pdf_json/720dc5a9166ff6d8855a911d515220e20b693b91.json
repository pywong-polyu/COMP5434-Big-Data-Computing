A questionnaire related to different aspects of online teaching was developed on a 5-point Likert scale from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree\". Following a pilot study, the questionnaire was shared among surgery residents, and response collection was done. The residents who did not attend at least 90% of scheduled classes were excluded. A total of 55 resident doctors without prior experience of online teaching program were enrolled in the study. All the participants responded to all questions and submitted their responses within stipulated time. On the basis of validity testing, questions 1 and 2 were found invalid and hence deleted. The median value for the total cohort was 4 indicating that majority of residents gave affirmative response. On segregating the result with the year of residency program, similar results were found in the 1st year and 2nd year group; however, the 3rd year group showed a median of 3, thus eliciting that only 50% of 3rd year residents liked online teaching. From the present study, it can be concluded that the online teaching is a feasible alternative to the physical class among surgical postgraduates. The questionnaire utilized in the present study can be used for assessing similar online teaching protocols.",

The teaching institutions were closed, and students were sent home well before the nationwide lockdown was announced. At most of the institutions in India, the medical postgraduates gradually restarted teaching, though on a different \"online platform\" [1] . The palpable panic of this new pandemic and the accessibility to good quality Internet have given a boom to various online educational programs in the form of sharing of clinical material, discussion on social media groups and real-time online teaching on platforms like Zoom\u00ae, GoToWebinar\u00ae, Cisco Webex\u00ae and Google Classroom\u00ae. It has been shown that e-learning can foster learning equivalent to traditional didactic lectures and medical students even find e-learning enjoyable [2, 3] .",

The teaching classes were scheduled on the same days of the week and for same duration as the physical classes before lockdown. All the residents of the 3-year residency program registered with the Department of General Surgery, and the entire faculty members of the department were asked to download the free application of the software in their computer or mobile device. The students who did not attend at least 90% of scheduled classes for any reasons or having previous experience and exposure with online teaching were excluded from the study. The schedule of classes along with the designated faculty moderator was circulated to all the residents and the teachers through e-mail. A dedicated WhatsApp group was created for communication and reminders for the scheduled classes. Rules like use of chat box for in-between class interaction and use of the microphones wherever needed after permission from the speaker were informed to all members. An orientation program for all the teachers and residents was conducted to familiarize the participants to this platform.",

The questions were framed in such a way that response 5 favoured the online teaching while response 1 did not so that all the responses were unidirectional. A pilot study was conducted on randomly selected 10 residents which showed that the questions were valid. Further, the questionnaire was provided to the remaining residents, and the responses were collected for analysis. The questionnaire and response collection were done by an independent assessor PT via e-mail who was not a part of the department teaching or assessment program to eliminate the bias of response of a student to a teacher. The residents were communicated to submit their anonymous response within 24 h of the receiving the e-mail. All the responses were collected within stipulated time and subsequently analysed.",

After deleting the 2 invalid questions, the combined Cronbach's alpha value calculated was 0.905 suggesting a high reliability of the remaining 18 questions. Of the 4 domains to be tested, accessibility ease had 3 items in the questionnaire, and the remaining domains, i.e. communication ease, quality of online teaching and overall opinion, had 5 items each. A median value of more than or equal to 9 in accessibility ease and 15 in the other three domains was considered an adequate or sufficient score for a favourable response in the particular domain with regard to the real-time online teaching [4] .",

After the forced disruption of medical education throughout the world, medical schools and colleges have quickly shifted themselves to online teaching system as an alternative to physical class [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Outbreaks with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the past have shown the utility and success of distant education with online technology. However, information and communication technology may sometimes be challenging to medical students in rapidly updating and adapting with the latest informatics competency requirement for these alternative methods [10] . In India, postgraduate clinical subjects especially like surgery rely largely on traditional bedside clinics or classroom teaching for resident training; however, the recent nationwide lockdown has compelled most of the teaching institutions to embark upon various online video conferencing-based virtual classrooms. The present study has tried to assess the perception of this unprecedented and rather not so planned online teaching program among surgery residents. The present study utilized a structured self-administered simple English language questionnaire that has a proven validity and reliability. We tried to keep the online classes as much close to conventional physical class as possible by keeping the online class schedule and timing same as before lockdown. Thus, we conducted four classes per week each of seminar, case presentation, journal club and surgical radiology of 60-min duration. A similar approach was described by Singh et al. in paediatrics. This was however carried on MBBS students of different semesters [5] with a set of 4 questions assessing the 4-h teaching schedule with a mix of lectures and practical demonstrations/case discussions on a 10-point Likert scale. The questionnaire however lacked a structured approach. A similar Indian study was done among biochemistry students of a single batch using the Google Classroom platform in the pre-COVID time [11] . The assessment was done on a 5-point Likert scale with 9 questions. Although the ease of accessibility was evaluated in this study, specific attributes like audio/video quality and interruptions were not assessed as done in the present study. These problems are relevant to evaluate as the lack of technical skill is an established barrier in implementation of online learning [12] . In era of cyber revolution educators, students and clinicians need to continuously update their skills not only in healthcare advances but also to remain \"digitally literate\". Digital literacy has been defined as follows: (a) the ability to use digital technology, communication tools or networks to locate, evaluate, use and create information; (b) the ability to understand and use information in multiple formats from a wide range of sources when it is presented via computers; and (c) the ability to read and interpret media, to reproduce data and images through digital manipulation and to evaluate and apply new knowledge gained from digital environments [13] . We found interruption of online classes in a significant proportion of students, and this might be because many residents accessed the classes on mobile and possible interruption arising thereof during incoming calls. Further, it is challenging for teachers to continuously engage students due to issues like attention span, multitasking while attending sessions, poor audio and video quality and Internet issues [14] .",

We found that residents felt less inhibition, teachers and students communicated in a coordinated manner and residents also felt that their queries were answered satisfactorily (median score 4 for each). The postgraduate teaching is largely a problem-based learning rather than the didactic lectures. Although the communication was well coordinated, yet the expression of views in online classes score was borderline (median score 3) when compared with physical class. Singh et al. also concluded that majority of the students felt that they were given the opportunity to ask questions (92.3%) and their interaction with the teacher was better than (27%) or as good as (27.8%) that during physical classroom. Students from another study have reported that they attained better knowledge and felt more satisfied due to easy accessibility, flexibility and increased interactivity with coparticipants [15] . However, studies also reported lack of interaction with the teacher and lesser in-depth group discussion for clarification as drawbacks of e-teaching program [16, 17] .",

All the scores were borderline (median score of 3). The borderline scoring of quality indices in comparison with physical class may be attributed to lack of face-to-face interaction, lack of tutor support inperson, adapting to a new change in short time, absence of any formal training and most importantly the psychological issues among residents like resistance to need for change. These are all well-attributed factors to online teaching shown in various studies [18] [19] [20] [21] , but one of the most pertinent reasons could be the psychological stress of contracting COVID infection while working as these residents attended teaching in midst of their hospital duties in pandemic.",

            "text": "Finally, we tried to figure out the overall opinion of the online teaching program and found a paradox. Although residents opined in favour of better utilization of time (median score 4) but regarding preference of same teaching method after lockdown, a similar advise for other fellow students and opinion regarding a good mode of teaching surgery students scored borderline (median score 3). A study from India found that while students were appreciative of the platform, 50% of the students still believed that physical classroom was better than e-classroom. These results and the projected indefinite course of COVID infection force us to rethink of implementing newer teaching techniques complementing the conventional teaching methods. This blended learning combining the conventional face-to-face teaching with e-learning is going to establish in medical teaching institutions [22] [23] [24] . Cyber security as expected was a significant concern in the study. On studying the overall and domain wise response with respect to year of residency program, it was seen that the 3rd year resident's median score was 3 but for 1st year, 2nd year and for all residents combined the score was 4. We feel that the viewpoint of 3rd year residents is extremely important in overall evaluation of quality of online teaching as they have the maximum experience of real-time physical classroom teaching among the study participants. Their assessment of online teaching raises important questions about the actual quality of online teaching. But there may be bias in the opinion of 3rd year students as they were about to have their formative assessment in near future as they were at the end of the academic session and hence may not have been interested in devoting time in preparation of class material or in trying a new modality. On one hand, the resident doctors are keen to play their part in the fight with this novel virus; they are equally concerned about the academic loss resulting not only from lockdown but also the effects of social distancing norms on the regular hustle and bustle of physical classes. Whether things are going to revert to normal, after how long and with what changes remains a mystery to unfold in future.",
