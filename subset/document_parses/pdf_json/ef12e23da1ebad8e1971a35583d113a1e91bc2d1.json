            "text": "Given that HIV can compromise the immune system and that a rapidly growing number of people are being diagnosed with COVID-19, there is concern about whether PWH could be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that, compared with people without HIV, PWH could experience worse COVID-19-related clinical outcomes. Older age and coexisting chronic medical conditions, including those that affect the immune system such as diabetes mellitus, have been identified as potential risk factors for poor clinical outcomes after diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection [4] [5] [6] . PWH are aging and older compared to the general population, and medical comorbidities are common among PWH [7] [8] [9] . However, the intersection between HIV and COVID-19 has not yet been described at the population level. Such an analysis would be critical for several reasons. First, it would enable a comprehensive characterization of the socio-demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes of people with HIV who acquire SARS-CoV-2. Second, such a study would inform additional analyses to quantify the risk for COVID-19 among PWH, particularly in geographic areas and communities hardhit by both conditions. Third, it would identify differences in COVID-19 clinical outcomes for people with and without diagnosed HIV infection. These reasons are even more compelling given the disproportionate impact of both HIV and COVID-19 on Black and Latino communities. Here we present results of a descriptive, population-level analysis of linked data from the NYC HIV surveillance and COVID-19 surveillance systems.",

Providers are required to report all new diagnoses of HIV and AIDS, and laboratories are required to report all positive HIV diagnostic test algorithms, qualitative and quantitative viral load test results (including those that are undetectable), CD4 test results, and the nucleotide sequence generated during HIV genotypic resistance testing ordered by NYC providers or for NYC residents. The registry receives >1 million laboratory reports per year for people living with diagnosed HIV and receiving HIV care in NYC. Surveillance staff verify all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses and collect sociodemographic and HIV-related clinical information for confirmed cases through medical chart review. Sociodemographic information in the registry includes age, sex at birth, race/ethnicity, and residential address, which are derived from patients' medical charts (recorded by the provider and/or collected from the patient directly) and laboratory test results. We use a measure of area-based poverty in this analysis, which is based on NYC ZIP code of residence and defined as the percentage of the population in a ZIP code whose household income is below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Categories include low poverty (<10% below FPL), medium poverty (10 to <20% below FPL), high poverty (20 to <30% below FPL), and very high poverty (\u226530% below FPL). M a n u s c r i p t 4 Since March 2020, results of molecular-based diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 have been reportable to DOHMH for purposes of citywide surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this analysis, only \"confirmed cases,\" defined as individuals with a positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2, were included. Laboratory test result data are received via electronic reporting by testing laboratories. Laboratory tests include basic patient identifying and demographic information; supplemental demographic (e.g., sex at birth, race/ethnicity) and clinical information, including hospitalization history, is extracted, when available, from multiple sources, including patients' medical records, patient interviews, death certificates, and from matches with other disease surveillance registries maintained by DOHMH. Information on previously diagnosed underlying conditions among people with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection is also captured in the COVID-19 surveillance system when available, including asthma, cancer, diabetes, hepatic disease, heart disease, hypertension, immunodeficiency, kidney disease, lung disease, and other underlying conditions.",

Compared with their representation among all PWH with COVID-19, higher proportions of Bronx residents experienced hospitalization, ICU admission, and death, and lower proportions of Manhattan and Queens residents experienced ICU admission and death; lower M a n u s c r i p t 6 proportions of MSM experienced hospitalization, ICU admission, and death, while higher proportions of PWH with a history of IDU experienced hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. Compared with their proportions among all PWH with COVID-19, higher proportions of PWH who were hospitalized, admitted to ICU, and died had earlier HIV diagnoses (e.g., before 1990, or from 1991-1999); relatively small proportions of PWH diagnosed with HIV in the most recent decade (2010-2020) experienced these adverse COVID-19 outcomes ( Table 2) .",

Given that the overall prevalence of HIV in the NYC population was 1.5% in 2018 [11] , this finding suggests that, compared with people without HIV, PWH might not be disproportionately vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, despite this encouraging finding, our analysis demonstrated that, compared with all NYC COVID-19 cases, a higher proportion of NYC PWH with COVID-19 were hospitalized for COVID-19, admitted to the ICU and died due to COVID-19. This may not be due to HIV itself but to the fact that NYC PWH have characteristics in common with people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had poor outcomes. Further analysis beyond this descriptive one is required to identify whether HIV infection is an independent risk factor for poor COVID-19-related outcomes. We also found that, compared with all NYC COVID-19 cases, a higher proportion of PWH with COVID-19 were male, older, and Black and Latino/Hispanic, which is reflective of NYC PWH overall. However, compared with PWH without COVID-19, PWH with COVID-19 were more likely to be Latino and less likely to be White, suggesting pronounced inequities among PWH with COVID-19. More PWH with COVID-19 lived in the Bronx, an NYC borough hit particularly hard by the NYC COVID-19 outbreak thus far.",

            "text": "Our study contributes to the limited published literature on the intersection of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The scientific community has conjectured that PWH may be especially vulnerable to poor outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection due to immunosuppression and/or the presence of other conditions-or, conversely, that PWH could potentially experience protection from the most serious sequelae of COVID-19 because of their history of immune response and/or because of the potential anti-SARS-CoV2 activity of HIV antiretroviral treatments [12] . In our study, we did find that PWH who experienced poor COVID-19-related outcomes, particularly those who had been admitted to ICU or died, had lower CD4 counts (majority had <500 cells/\u00b5L), and that PWH who had been diagnosed with HIV prior to the year 2000 were more heavily represented among those with poor COVID-19-related outcomes. Those with longer time since HIV diagnosis are more likely to be older and have other comorbid conditions which could put them at higher risk for poor COVID-19-related outcomes. We also found a high prevalence of other comorbidities among PWH with COVID-19, which has been identified in other cohorts [13, 14] . We also saw high levels of HIV viral control in our population of PWH with COVID-19, which suggests high levels of antiretroviral coverage, and a relatively low proportion with very low CD4 cell counts. While we found that people with HIV and COVID-19 were more likely to have worse outcomes than COVID-19 cases overall, in a relatively small group of PWH hospitalized for COVID-19 infection in NYC, Sigel et al. found no difference in the frequency of poor outcomes, including mechanical ventilation and death, for hospitalized PWH and non-PWH [13] . Consistent with other studies, we found that PWH do not appear to be overrepresented among those who acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in fact the M a n u s c r i p t 7 prevalence of HIV among NYC COVID-19 cases was slightly lower than NYC's overall HIV prevalence. This analysis did not examine risk for COVID-19 infection and whether risk among PWH may be influenced by differences in their likelihood to self-quarantine, especially if immunosuppressed.",

We found that racial and ethnic inequities in the NYC COVID-19 pandemic overall are mirrored-and even more pronounced-among PWH with COVID-19. Efforts to eliminate racial/ethnic inequities among people living with HIV and for other individuals affected by HIV are central to achieving the goals of NYC DOHMH's ending the HIV epidemic (EtE) strategy [15] . Given the exacerbating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health inequities, including among PWH, this is a critical time for the HIV public health and clinical community to strengthen services and support for people living with and affected by HIV to protect and accelerate progress made thus far toward the EtE strategy. More rigorous exploration of COVID-19 outcomes among PWH compared with people without HIV is needed to understand which factors-older age, higher prevalence of comorbidities and/or HIV itself-may be contributing to worse clinical outcomes. Additionally, the extent to which older age and accelerated aging related to HIV infection may contribute to these outcomes merits further investigation.",

Several limitations of the analysis are also noted. First, reporting lags in COVID-19 case and death data mean that very recently diagnosed individuals and deaths may have been missing from the June 2 nd dataset. Second, SARS-CoV-2 testing availability was not consistent throughout the analytic period; early COVID-19 cases are presumed to be under-ascertained. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection among PWH may have been more likely to be detected given their connection to healthcare. Third, there are important gaps in data collection and availability for NYC COVID-19 cases given that DOHMH is not able to investigate all cases to collect ancillary data; instead COVID-19 laboratory test results are the primary data source and these data typically only contain limited personal information. Importantly, race/ethnicity is missing for 47% of cases in the COVID-19 surveillance dataset. We acknowledge the possibility that data are missing differentially for different race/ethnic groups depending on the data sources available (patient interview or electronic medical record if hospitalized (more complete), vs. laboratory test result only (less complete)). In addition, information on underlying conditions is likely incomplete since this information is captured from clinical data, hospital records, or patient interview when available; the fact that only 39% of PWH with COVID-19 had information indicating immunodeficiency despite confirmed HIV status via the registry match suggests potentially substantial under-ascertainment of coexisting conditions in this dataset. Differential ascertainment of comorbidities is possible if PWH are more likely to be diagnosed with comorbidities since most are in continuous medical care that routinely screens for a range of comorbidities. Lastly, as this is a population-level analysis, we do not have data about potential differences in clinical practices that may exist across NYC hospitals with respect to criteria for hospitalization and ICU admission for COVID-19.",

For PWH, residential ZIP code is based on most recent record available in the surveillance registry (most recent record is >5 years old for 27% of PLWH in 2019). 3 HIV transmission risk information is based on exposures reported prior to HIV diagnosis. \"Heterosexual contact\" includes people who had heterosexual sex with a person they know to be living with HIV, a person who has injected drugs or a person who has received blood products. For women only, also includes history of sex work, multiple sex partners, sexually transmitted disease, crack/cocaine use, sex with a bisexual man, probable heterosexual transmission as noted in a medical chart or sex with a man and negative history of injection drug use. \"Transgender people with sexual contact\" includes people identified as transgender at any time by self-report, a medical provider or chart review or ongoing data collection with sexual contact reported and negative history of injection drug use. \"Other\" includes people who received treatment for hemophilia, people who received a transfusion or transplant, people with other healthcareassociated transmission and children with non-perinatal transmission risk.A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t ",
