Nevertheless, adaptation withing a single gamification campaign might not be enough.

Moreover, the new platform we propose is based on the idea of \"Continuous Engagement\" [9] , and is founded on formalisation of computational models derived from empirical analysis of psychological processes and social practices. The effects of different campaigns should be continuously evaluated to adapt the ongoing challenges to societal fluctuations and upcoming goals (hence, selfadaptive systems). The resulting platform provides the enablers for developing radically innovative tools to motivate in smart(er) communities and societies.

The agents should be able to reflect on the current state of achievement of their goals, reason about how their actions might contribute to achieving their community-wide goal [11] - [13] and, how they can adapt the overall behaviours taking into account the preferences and the needs expressed by each single participant [14] . Research challenges in MAS cover the provision of models and techniques for engagement, action, learning and adaptation such that they perform and are interconnected as a community. This includes micro-level modelling pertaining to the individual actors, but also macrolevel modelling of how group practices emerge from composition of activities at the individual level. The representation of composition operators and how to apply them represent another open research challenge. We need mechanisms to handle how different individuals become part of the same emergent community, how they collectively devise and provide services to the community, and how they collectively adapt to changes in context, interests, incentives and opportunities. If we want to facilitate and foster continuous engagement and collective actions of citizens using MAS, we need to understand how psychological and social processes can combine to pursue self-organisation. Dynamic Social Psychology (DSP) defines social groups as complex systems [15] , where the interaction between heterogeneous individuals or subgroups results in self-organisation and emergent properties at the system level. DSP incorporates social, psychological and cognitive mechanisms, which are empirically verified, in order to study how different psychological and social variables acting as control parameters have an impact the macro, group-level properties.",

Based on motivational digital systems, citizens can share their \"social capital\" with the community. Social capital is an attribute of individuals that enhances their ability to improve a specific societal challenge taking actions in their daily life [16] . These attributes may take different forms, for example reputation, participation, influence, support, among others. Each of these forms is also a subjective indicator (or metric) of one individual's expectations about how other individuals will behave in an n -player cooperative context. In the pursuit of successful and sustainable actions, it is necessary to understand and capture the social practices that lead to the creation of social capital, the group psychology that provides an evaluation of social capital, and the mechanisms by which social capital contributes to reach the common good. We envision to build upon and extend gamification approaches, because they facilitate capturing sustainable practices in an algorithmic form, together with persuasion potentials to promote and incentivize the participation in those practices by citizens. A research challenge related to this aspect is the automatic generation of personalised game experiences and mechanics that are tailored to the user profile (e.g., preferences, habits, game status and history) and to the sustainability objectives promoted by the application. In fact, these techniques shall keep end-users engaged and interested in the long-term with a diversified and enhanced game experience, and at the same time incentivize sustainable behaviours .",

            "text": "From a more technical perspective, modelling gamification mechanisms poses challenges to language design [19] . In fact, each game can be conceived as a set of rules through which each participant interacts with the environment: moves, actions, rewards, etc. are woven together to create an appropriate playground. If we consider the coordination of multiple gamified applications as proposed in our vision, then these rules are expected to grow even more. The recurrent solution of letting domain experts specify the game rules in requirement documents and then hard-code the rules in a corresponding application does not scale-up, especially if frequent adaptations are needed. On the other hand, giving domain experts the possibility of defining themselves game rules and generating automatically the corresponding application raises usability problems: diagrammatic solutions become quickly intractable with the number of variables involved in the game, while expressing constraints in logic formulas would be comparable to writing directly the implementation code. From a broader perspective, the rendering of modelling concepts to the user is an open research problem, and this vision can contribute with appropriate solutions for the gamification domain. In this regard, HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) researchers strongly argue for the benefits of adaptive experiences in gamification [20] . Delivering ad-hoc content to players enhances engagement, and can contribute in the fulfilment of the system's underlying goal [21] . Following hard-coded approaches, on the other hand, can lead to neutral or even detrimental results [22] . Although the proven advantages of tailored game content, many gameful applications still rely on the \"one-sizefits-all\" approach [23] . Even when some kind of adaptation is applied, scholars and practitioners mostly employ hard-coded (i.e., rule-based) adaptation using survey-based profiling [7] . Nevertheless, players' behaviours and preferences can change overtime. As such, dynamic (run-time) adaptation approaches are preferable, which better adapt to unforeseen behavioural changes. Those changes are even more likely to happen in persuasive gameful systems, where modifying behaviours is the goal. Towards this, players' in-game activity and interaction patters can be exploited [24] . While data has been used to learn specific preferences [25] , adjust difficulty [26] , or provide recommendations [27] , those studies tackled specific adaptation problems, often context-dependent. A tentative of a more elaborated adaptation framework was done by Loria [28] . Yet, the framework presented is conceptual, and thus concrete solutions are still needed. Additionally, the framework is designed to adapt a single gameful application. Therefore, an approach to integrate knowledge on players' experiences deriving from several gamification is still lacking.",

It is possible thanks to new technologies [33] and the attention paid by the Local Administration to them. \u2022 Adapt. The outcomes provided by the learning process will show the pros and cons of each city, the critical issues and the strong points of the actions executed by their citizens. Based on this, the aim of this process is to adapt the engagement strategies and to define new challenges for their citizens.

Profiling promotes inclusive and supportive engagement with citizens with diverse profiles and backgrounds (e.g. age, demographics, education, gender, disability, etc.), in order to fully understand the impact of diversity. Based on non-private info associated profiles, our vision allows for creating a positive snowball effect in society, by leveraging the most motivated or active groups in society to progressively involve all the segments of local communities and help make first-person participation, individual commitment and citizen science more appealing, visible, and, eventually, conducive to change. To nurture citizens' motivation to volunteer and act, specific models and tools are used to sustain the extended aspects of volunteering and its impact on society. These include Citizen Science and technology-based crowdsensing envisage the participation of the general public in societal challenges using an open and inclusive approach [35] , [36] . Motivational systems that properly exploit and embed game concepts and elements (gamification [37] ) can support an engagement framework sensitive to diverse user profiles and backgrounds. Different types of incentives (e.g., monetary vs. non-monetary) and nudges are instead based on the fact that citizens tend to be strongly influenced by their family, friends and peers or (local) champions, and even wider through network effects [38] , as such they should be used. Communities of practice, living labs, and crowdfunding are further examples of the different approaches to citizen engagement that can be exploited [39] . \u2022 Adaptive and Continuous Engagement. The advertised value of gamification is the ability to turn unpleasant tasks into entertaining ones and improve users' experiences by fostering internal motivation to perform the task [40] . Although successful gamification examples do exist, positive outcomes cannot be always assumed, as the effects vary with the contexts and implementations [41] . The biggest critique to unsuccessful gamification applications is the \"one-sizefits-all\" approach, in which a static set of gamification elements are implemented (e.g., points, badges or leaderboards). Rather, researchers argue for the acknowledgement of players' diversity [7] . Studying gamification's effects have proved that gamification needs to be adaptive to reach its full potential in several domains (e.g., health, sport, and learning). Interpersonal differences contribute to the perception of game elements, as users are motivated by different elements [42] . Consequently, designers and practitioners should prioritize the diversifications of the motivational affordances implemented towards the development of more inclusive gameful experiences [17] . For instance, as different people are motivated by different things, personalizing the incentives and rewards can be highly beneficial [43] . As a consequence, tailoring at the level of social influence strategies may contribute in a positive way to the effects of persuasive technologies [21] . When individuals' preferences are neglected, in static gamification, researchers observed inconclusive or even negative results [22] , [41] . Thus, how to adapt and personalize gamified applications became an essential research area. Many adaptation strategies rely on static adaptation (i.e. hard-coded or rule-based adaptations), using survey-based profiling approaches grounded in the Psychology literature. Although techniques aimed at understanding players' preferences exist, adaptive gamification is still an underinvestigated topic, especially for what concerns dynamic, automatic adaptation [7] , [44] . Towards this, telemetry datalogs can be precious for learning players' specific preferences [25] , adjust difficulty, and predict churn [45] . Nevertheless, adaptive gamification research still misses consolidated research models and theoretical foundations [17] .",

            "text": "Researchers should further exploit implicit telemetry data [46] to cyclically enhance the adaptation model [7] , leading to the periodical generation of novel content [17] . While an initial tentative in the definition of a conceptual adaptation framework exist [28] , this is only a step towards the right direction and still lacks a concrete, implemented solution. \u2022 Evaluate the positive behavioural change. A problem of gamification as a persuasive technology derives from the difficulty in ensuring a behavioural change. Players can either omit communicating activities misaligned with the system's goal or the the application may even allow a partial recording of players' actions. Consequently, a global view on players' habits is lacking. For instance, if we consider an application for sustainable mobility pushing users to reduce car movements in favour of greener transportation means, we can measure a usage increase but cannot argue for players' reduced car trips. In fact, an increase in green mobility does not imply less kilometres with other means. Our suggested framework also aims at moving forward in the solution direction. In the context of smart cities, knowledge retrieved from several gamification campaigns can be integrated to expand the understanding on players' activity and (positive/negative) contribution to the society. Nevertheless, this is still a complex and challenging task. Researchers and practitioners need to develop algorithms to integrate this knowledge, while also avoiding bias. Positively transforming the way people behave for the benefit of society requires a deep transformation of their habits and behaviours, which must be based on comprehensive impact assessments and simulations that take into account social, health, environmental and climate impacts, as well as economic impact. This challenge aims to propose innovative solutions that provides data analytics, information, recommendations and simulations for city managers to assess, also through what-if analysis, the environmental impact, to evaluate changes as a result of specific measures and actions and to plan optimal and sustainable strategies. The global pandemic COVID-19 is an excellent example for this context. edge (as depicted in Figure 1 ), and profile-based data as explained above. Privacy and ethical issues, therefore, have to become first-class citizens when designing and evaluating this kind of systems. Hartswood et al. [47] discuss these issues in the context of peer profiling. They propose to return the control of data to users, supporting the principles of privacy and transparency. Other privacy-preserving mechanisms based on decentralized data ownership are proposed in the literature as a way to enhance privacy [48] . However, in a world dominated by centralized platforms making profits out of the users' personal data, designers face a major sociotechnical challenge in executing such a paradigm shift. The centralized/decentralized dichotomy affects the scalability of the proposed solutions too, of course, and so centralization may contain within itself the seeds of a move towards more decentralized solutions on technical grounds [49] . A lot of work has been done at the European level on ethical and privacy guidelines for technology development with respect to this topic 2 . We argue that by having a formal and explicit approach to define engagement policies can serve better as a means to define citizens rights in these contexts (in the same way it is done for e.g. in law). As part of our vision, engagement mechanisms should intrinsically support diversity, ethics, etc. The feedback supported by MAPEKloops is relevant to underpin the above, including approaches to protect users by mediating their interactions with the digital world according to their own sense of ethics about actions and privacy of data [50] .",
