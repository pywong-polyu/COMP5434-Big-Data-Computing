However, there is a paucity of published literature on FD medical education programs in Asia. With the formation of the Asia Pacific Medical Education Network (APME-Net) in 2015, a scoping review of an environmental scan of FD medical education programs in main institutions in South East Asia and Australia in 2018 was conducted. Methods: A survey was developed to collect data on FD in medical education after several rounds of discussion with APME-Net members. The representatives from nine countries in Asia and Australia were invited to partner in this research project. They sent the questionnaire to the Dean of all different medical schools after ethical clearance. The data collected was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Only institutions in four countries responded to the questionnaire. The medical/health professions education center/ department/unit has been established in most educational institutions in these countries. These centers/departments/units mostly carry out FD programs to improve the teaching and learning skills of trained participants, particularly clinical teachers via workshops and seminars. Staffing issues and participant buy-in are the current key priorities of the center/department/unit in terms of FD. Lastly, research related FD program has not been well-supported in these countries, hence, the lack of publication in this area. Conclusion: Collaboration between countries to address key areas of interest and develop more standardized and productive FD medical education is required especially in research.",

This is because FD has a significant impact on knowledge, skills, and behaviors as teachers and educators, leaders and managers, and researchers and scholars. As there are not many researches has been carried out in these regions, Singapore, Korea, Japan, and Indonesia are the countries which are involved in this environmental scan to provide a better understanding of the progression of FD.From the data, we noticed that Indonesia has a higher percentage of private medical institutions as compared to the other countries. Given the aim to improve the ratio of medical doctor and total population across regions in Indonesia, the number of quality medical doctors is contributed by both public and private medical schools. Current regulation in Indonesia also allows the establishment of private medical schools so long as the schools fulfil and maintain the expected standards. Most of the medical/health professions education center/ department/unit still rely on the support of part time academic staff with a few full timers. With FD becoming more and more important, all medical institutions consist of a medical/health professions education center/ department/unit in these countries. Majority of the medical/health professions education center/department/unit in these countries carry out FD programs. Beside FD, most medical/health professions education centers/departments/units are involved in curriculum planning and design, course evaluation, research, and medical programs. Usually, the medical/ health professions education centers/departments/units provide support in curriculum development and evaluation. They rarely involve in running a curriculum; however, this is not the case in Japan. Faculties in center for medical education in Japan usually emphasize on teaching basic clinical skills, e.g., history taking and physical examination or medical professionalism. The main principle of carrying FD programs in these countries is to improve teaching and learning skills of trained participants in order to educate the undergraduate and postgraduate students. Apart from improving teaching and learning skills, the institutions in Japan conduct FD programs to bring changes to the whole organization. This purpose has been shared in one of the most traditional FD program in Japan, called Fuji-ken. Only those who are in a leadership position at doctor training institutions (medical schools, medical colleges, clinical training designated hospitals, and so forth) in charge of medical education can apply for Fuji-ken; therefore, it is expected that they are able to assist in organizational changes [14]. The participants being trained mainly comes from uni-professional rather than multi-or inter-professional. They are generally the new staff, curriculum committee members, course convener, as well as clinical teachers, clinicians, and practitioners. Biomedical science teachers, on the other hand, were less-trained mainly in Singapore and Korea probably because priorities are given to the selective group such as clinical teachers who play an important part of medical education as well as",

This can be seen in terms of the incentives provided as well as the funding to carry out FD program. Most FD programs are either fully or partially funded by their respective educational institutions to encourage participants to attend. Some would incentivize participants by making it mandatory as part of job requirements or giving credit points for promotion. This form of incentives provided would definitely motivate not only the participants but also the facilitators to develop beneficial and meaningful FD programs. In addition, lack of funding no longer the main limitations in operationalizing a FD program in these four countries. The lack of support staffs, facilitators, and incentives as well as competing interests (research and/or practice obligations) have shown to be the key limiting factors in these countries. These challenges are not uncommon and have been around for many years as pointed out by Sorcinelli [20] in 2007. One of the primary challenges identified is balancing multiple roles and responsibilities such as a scholar, teacher, and clinician. Suggestion to overcome these challenges is to include coaching and mentoring in the program to support the staff which might be lacking currently. Research in FD within these regions will require a lot of support as shown in the results. Off all the FD studies which have been published, the majority came from the United States, followed by Canada and the United Kingdom [18]. The lack of research publication in this area in Asia is apparent as most of the institutions surveyed within the four countries do not carry out research in FD [21]. However, there are multiple reasons for this. Language might be a barrier for countries whereEnglish is not their first-language. Furthermore, to carry out quality and publishable research in FD is quite challenging. The weaknesses listed by Steinert[19] for the existing research in FD are limited evaluation data, reliance on self-report data and small sample size. A possible solution highlighted by the studies is through partnership between academic institutions. Hopefully, this area will be strengthened with more collaboration and support.",
