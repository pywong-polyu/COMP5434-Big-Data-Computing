She had conceived spontaneously with no history of any medical or surgical comorbidities. Her obstetric history includes one living child and one first trimester spontaneous abortion. At 8 weeks of gestation, she had history of contact with symptomatic COVID-19 positive patient. Although she was asymptomatic, her reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. She was quarantined for 10 days at a local quarantine/ isolation centre and was discharged with further advice of home quarantine as per the prevailing protocol. She remained asymptomatic throughout this period. On a booking visit for antenatal care five weeks later, she was advised routine blood investigations along with ultrasonography for nuchal translucency. The ultrasound evaluation showed fetal demise with changes of hydrops fetalis. Since there was fetal demise the products of conception were sent for further routine evaluation. SARS-CoV-2 testing was done out of scientific curiosity.",

Amniotic fluid was carefully aspirated from the gestational sac and transported in a sterile container. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were done as per the ICMR/WHO Guidelines for RdRP and E genes. Immunofluorescence for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1 and S2 on placental sections was done using monoclonal antibodies (MP Biomedicals, Catalogue number: SKU: 08720301, SKU: 08720411 , Asia Pacific, Singapore) and the Opal 7 (catalogue #NEL797001KT; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA), which uses individual tyramide signal amplification (TSA)conjugated fluorophores.",

The repeat throat swab was taken the day prior to termination (six weeks after the first positive report) which was negative for SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently the ultrasound evaluation (expectedly 13 weeks of gestation) showed fetal demise at crown rump length (CRL) of 38mm corresponding with 10 weeks 5 days of gestation. There was extensive bilateral pleural effusion and subcutaneous edema suggestive of hydrops fetalis (Fig.1 ). She was negative for antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies and anticardiolipin antibodies ruling out this as possible cause of first trimester abortion. IgM antibodies against TORCH were negative which indicates absence of active infection, however IgG antibodies for Toxoplasma gondii, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus and Herpes simplex virus 1 were above the reference range.

The study also provides evidence for vertical transmission of the virus in the first trimester leading to fetal demise. Prior studies have shown persistent viral shedding in feces of COVID-19 patients, the source of this virus is unknown. Herein, we show that while the mother was negative f or SARS-CoV-2 in the pulmonary passage, extensive viremia was observed in the placenta almost five weeks of the initial infection. Both \"E\" and \"RdRp\" gene of SARS-CoV-2 were found in the placental supernatants at viral loads equivalent of that of the maternal nasopharyngeal swab observed earlier. Thus, the virus not just survived in the tissue but is replicative in the placental cells. Along with viral RNA, the viral proteins could be readily detected in the cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts and some villus stromal cells. Indeed, we have shown that all these cell types in first trimester placenta not only expresses the canonical (ACE2) and the non -canonical (CD147) SARS-CoV-2 receptors, they readily express the proteins required for viral endocytosis, replication and release 11 . Thus, the placenta is a permissive site for SARS-CoV-2 replication and such long-term persistence of the virus in any tissues post clearance from the pulmonary sites has not been shown previously. The active viremia of the placental cells was further coupled with extensive placental inflammation as deduced by leucocyte infiltration in the intravillous spaces and decidua, fibrin deposition and lysis of syncytiotrophoblasts of the villus cells.

These observations imply that SARS-CoV-2 not just reside and replicate in placental cells but also mount an inflammatory response. Mother to child transmission of viruses can cause congenital anomalies and is a matter of concern in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Epidemiological evidence suggests a low possibility of mother to child transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, this notion is based on reports of third trimester infections 8, 9 . Also, most reports are classified only as probable case of congenital SARS-CoV-2 infection as the infection of the newborn is reported hours or even days after birth 9 . Our case fully qualifies as congenitally transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection as we not only detected the virus in the placental cells but also in the amniotic fluid and the fetal membrane. Recently, a case of transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a neonate born to a mother infected at term was reported 14 . While SARS-CoV-2 is not a blood borne virus, it is possible that some SARS-CoV-2 particles may have seeped in to the maternal blood stream or transported through the lymphocytes during the course of active infection, resided and replicated in the placenta and eventually crossed the transplacental barrier to infect the fetus. A variety of viral infections, chromosome abnormalities and autoimmune conditions are associated with nonimmune hydrops fetalis 17, 18 . In our case, although the mother was positive for IgG of herpes simplex virus and Toxoplasma gondii, she was negative for IgM of the same ruling out active infection with these organisms as a cause of hydrops. Also, the mother was Rh positive and product of conception was disomic for chromosomes 13, 21, 18 and X ruling out these factors in etiology of hydrops. We believe that the hydrops and fetal demise are due to congenital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the mother to the fetus. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study associating hydrops fetalis and fetal demise with congenitally acquired coronavirus.",
