The median time from onset to admission was 4.0 (2.0-8.0) days. Of the 332 COVID-19 patients, 98 (29.5%) were admitted with liver injury. The rates of aspartate transaminase, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, and total bilirubin abnormalities were higher in the critical group than in the non-critical group. The patient's sex, COVID-19 severity, and a low liver CT density strongly correlated with liver injury (ORs: 2.936, 6.543, and 3.387, respectively). Statistical analysis on drug administration after admission showed that the usage rates of lopinavir/ritonavir, glucocorticoids, and thymopeptides were significantly higher in the abnormal group than the normal groups (p<0.05). Conclusions: Though not severe, the liver injury among COVID-19 patients was pervasive. Being male, COVID-19 severity, low CT density, and medications may be risk factors for liver damage. Following recovery, liver function gradually returns to normal. Methods: This retrospective study screened 332 confirmed COVID-19 patients from January 20 to March 13, 2020. Liver indicators were evaluated on admission. The risk factors, medications, and the dynamic change of liver functions were analyzed.",

Nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia, and diarrhea have also been reported in a few cases. Severe cases mostly developed dyspnea and/or hypoxemia after one week. In severe cases, patients can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct, coagulopathy, and multiple organ AGING failure [5] . Recent studies on COVID-19 have shown that the incidence of liver injury ranged from 14.8-53%, and was mainly indicated by abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, accompanied by slightly elevated total bilirubin (TB) levels [3, [5] [6] [7] . Albumin levels are decreased in severe cases, with levels around 26.3-30.9 g/L [8] . Some data have shown that serum \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GT) levels increase in severe cases and serum ALT levels are normal in both mild and severe cases [9] .",

Chai et al. found that both liver cells and bile duct cells express ACE2 [11] , which might be the main reason that some COVID-19 patients suffer from liver injury. In fact, one study reported that the liver injury observed in COVID-19 patients might be caused by lopinavir/litonavir, which is used as an antiviral for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [12] . However, the study is limited by the small number of patients taking lopinavir/litonavir and with only 8 patients in the normal liver function group. Thus, further studies on a larger population are necessary to confirm this observation.",

Among the 332 patients with COVID-19 included in our study, 190 (57.2%) patients presented with liver injury on admission and during hospitalization. The incidence of the liver injury was consistent with a previous study [12] . From the 332 patients with COVID-19, we found that 98 (27.3%) patients presented with liver injury on admission, which is consistent with previous studies [8, 16] . In our study, the critical group included 18 patients (69.2%), while the non-critical group included 80 (26.1%) at admission. This suggests that critical patients were more likely to suffer from liver injury. A previous study showed the presence of an inflammatory cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 cases [17] , however, whether this results in liver damage in such patients remains to be investigated. Upon further analysis of the data on risk factors for liver injury, we found that patient's sex, COVID-19 severity, and low liver CT density were risk factors for liver injury. The higher degree of liver damage in males in this study could be related to a higher proportion of men among critically ill patients. The prevalence of liver damage in critically ill patients supports the view that COVID-19 is a disease that involves multiple organs; and, presumably, the severity of the disease itself plays a major role in liver injury. The previous study indicated that SARS patients with HBV/HCV infection were more prone to develop liver damage and severe hepatitis [18] . In the present study, the history of chronic liver disease was not a risk factor in the patients with COVID-19. The single-factor analysis revealed that the liver injury was related to complicating disease and drinking history, though it is not further confirmed by the results from the multifactor regression analysis, it might be important for clinicians to be aware of these cases.",

It was unclear whether the steatosis of liver cells caused by the SARS-CoV-2. Is the liver damage likely caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced hepatotoxicity? Previous studies suggested that antibiotics (macrolides, quinolones), antivirals (ribavirin), steroids, and other drugs used for the treatment of SARS patients may result in liver damage [19, 20] . Many medications including antiviral drug, antibiotics, herbal, glucocorticoids, thymopeptides, interferon spray, sedatives and hypnotics, analgesicantipyretics, antilipemic agents, hypotensor, hypoglycemic agents, and drugs for coronary heart disease come with warnings of potential liver injury. These drugs are potential causes of liver injury during COVID-19 [3] . In our study, 234 patients who presented with normal liver function on admission gradually developed liver injury. Our results showed that 92 (39.3%) AGING patients suffered from liver impairment during hospitalization, and so the medications were analyzed among these 234 patients. Liver injury was influenced by some medications such as lopinavir/ritonavir, glucocorticoids, and thymopeptides. Lopinavir/ritonavir is currently considered a therapeutic agent that may have some efficacy against COVID-19, and our results suggest that it is associated with liver damage. In addition to liver damage, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, other adverse reactions are also common. It is recommended to balance the benefits for the patients of the medicine before clinical application and use cautiously. Close monitoring of liver function is recommended during medication, with a high alert for the occurrence of liver damage. Recently, one study reported that liver injury observed in COVID-19 patients might be caused by lopinavir/litonavir [12] , there were just 8 patients in the normal liver function group. To reach a more accurate conclusion in our study we increased the population size and analyzed more drugs. Patients enrolled in this study were treated with a small dose of glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 20-40 mg/d for \u22645 days) when chest CT indicated rapid imaging progression. Whether the occurrence of liver damage is related to the glucocorticosteroids themselves or to exacerbation of the disease requires further validation in more designed controlled trials.",

            "text": "It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 also uses ACE2 as its entry receptor [10] . Chai et al. found that both liver cells and bile duct cells express ACE2 [11] . Bile duct epithelial cells are known to play important roles in liver regeneration and immune response. Based on this, it is possible that the liver injury seen in COVID-19 patients may be due to damage to bile duct cells, but not liver cells, caused by the virus infection. Our findings indicated that about 70% patients had high levels of ALT, which suggest liver cell injury. More interestingly, 44.5% and 31.8% patients had high levels of \u03b3-GT and TB respectively, which indicates injury to bile duct cells. Although we could not confirm whether liver damage was caused by the coronavirus infection or drug induced, our findings indicate that liver damage includes both damage to liver cells and bile duct cells. Thus, further research is necessary to explore the mechanism of liver injury in COVID-19 patients. One study showed abundant SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were observed in cytoplasm of hepatocytes in two COVID-19 cases, which could suggest the SARS-CoV-2 infection contributed to liver injury [21] . In the present study, although we found that liver injury was common in COVID-19 patients, liver injury was generally mild, and no cases of liver failure occurred. Moreover, following the disease recovery, liver function gradually normalizes, which suggests that the liver damage in patients with COVID-19 was temporary. It should be noted that 17 (5.1%) of the 332 patients had their first liver injury before discharge, which is a reminder of the need to monitor liver function changes during the follow-up of COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge. We followed up the data of these patients with abnormal liver tests two weeks after discharge, nearly half of them still had not a full recovery, suggesting the clinicians should pay attention to these cases.",

Thus, a future multi-center study is required in order to validate the predicting factors identified in this study. Secondly, further prospective clinical studies should be designed to investigate whether use of specific medications can cause liver damage. Thirdly, the link between liver damage and inflammatory cytokines should be investigated in the future to elucidate the mechanism of liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, we analyzed whether liver CT density was low or not, but we did not include the detailed CT density values. We did not analyze whether the elevated AST was caused by liver damage, hypoxia, or cardiac impairment in this small proportion of the patients.",
