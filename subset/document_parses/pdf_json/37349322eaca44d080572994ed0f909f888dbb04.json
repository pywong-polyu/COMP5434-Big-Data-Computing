This may limit ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). [3] [4] [5] [6] There is ongoing debate on the best way to ventilate COVID-19 patients. 7, 8 In particular, it is uncertain whether consolidated lung tissue of COVID-19 patients can and should be opened by recruitment maneuvers and using higher airway pressures. 9, 10 The use of recruitment maneuvers and/or higher positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP), however, may have negative effects such as overdistention of already opened alveoli and cardiovascular compromise. 2, 11 If airway pressure is increased, but no reaeration of lung tissue occurs, then use of higher airway pressures can be seen as net-harmful.",

            "text": "In this study, the median percentage of reaerated lung tissue was 14%. This is markedly higher and more variable between patients compared with a previous CT study in COVID-19-related ARDS. 23 A possible explanation for these contrasting findings is the absence of a recruitment maneuver and the lower PEEP levels used in the previous study. The presence of a recruitment maneuver is the main difference between the previous and present study, suggesting that it might be an essential step to achieve reaeration in COVID-19-related ARDS patients. The percentage of reaerated lung tissue was in fact comparable to a previous study in non-COVID-19-related ARDS, 15 although the present study used significantly lower levels of airway pressure after recruitment and thus might result in an underestimation of reaeration potential. Also in line with previous studies in non-COVID-19-related ARDS, there was considerable variation in lung reaeration that was partly explained by the nonaerated lung tissue weight. 24 Duration of mechanical ventilation was also associated with lung reaeration, with a less reaeration potential later in the course of COVID-19-related ARDS. This has not been noticed in studies carried out in patients with non-COVID-19-related ARDS. 15 A limited volume of hyperinflated lung tissue was observed; however, we did not perform an inspiratory CT scan and therefore cannot exclude further hyperinflation during inspiration. We rarely observed > 50 mL over distended lung volume at 20 cm H 2 O PEEP, whereas others have reported > 100 mL median over distended lung volume at 15 cm H 2 O PEEP in non-COVID-19-related ARDS. 24 Moreover, the amount of hyperinflated lung in the present study was markedly lower compared with a previous study in COVID-19-related ARDS as well, even though both studies performed CT during the end of expiration. 23 However, in the assessment of hyperinflation, comparison between studies is hampered by the influence of CT reconstruction parameters. 25 Using high enough airway pressures, lung reaeration can nearly always be realized. However, high airway pressures are associated with significant risks. 11, 26 Therefore, routine or preventive recruitment maneuvers should not be used and, when used, should be tailored to the patients' respiratory and hemodynamic condition. Our finding that lungs of patients with COVID-19-related ARDS can be opened by moving from 10 to 20 cm H 2 O PEEP seems promising for the use of higher PEEP to maintain lungprotective mechanical ventilation. In clinical practice, increasing airway pressures must always be balanced against changes in hemodynamics, dead space ventilation, oxygenation, and lung mechanics and evidence-based management, informed by bedside physiology, is recommended. 27 A recent study suggests that patients with COVID-19-related ARDS show less improvement in respiratory mechanics and CO 2 clearance in response to an increase in PEEP. 28 Our study contradicts several smaller case series in COVID-19-related ARDS that showed limited recruitability. 7 ,29 Yet, our study and a previous study that quantified reaeration based on the recruitment-to-inflation ratio show that the lungs of patients with COVID-19-related ARDS can be reopened. 30 This may be explained by the difference in the technique for assessment of recruitment or might be the consequence of a different case-mix. Alternatively, higher transpulmonary pressures may result in reaeration, but impair gas-exchange when pulmonary angiopathy is prevalent, as has been suggested in COVID-19. 31 This does not, however, provide an explanation for the lack of improvement in compliance that has been reported. 28 We also tested the association between the level of lung reaeration and previously described phenotypes because we recognize that ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome with distinct subphenotypes and speculated that this would also apply to COVID-19-related ARDS. [32] [33] [34] Reaeration was not different between patients with a focal or nonfocal lung morphology. Lung morphology is a validated predictor of reaeration potential and likelihood of overdistention in non-COVID-19-related ARDS. 16 In that study, lung morphology was assessed at 0 PEEP, whereas the lungs of patients included in the current study were exposed to at least 5 cm H 2 O PEEP and most frequently to 10 cm H 2 O PEEP. This might bias the results toward focal morphology, as ventral consolidations are more likely to be opened up at lower PEEP levels. Furthermore, the proposed \"L\" and \"H\" phenotype classification was not associated with response to recruitment maneuvers in our study as both compliance of the respiratory system and lung weight were not associated with the potential for lung reaeration. 35 In addition, we found that patients who were just intubated were more likely to respond to recruitment maneuvers than patients who received several days of ventilation, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that patients progress from an \"L\" to an \"H\" phenotype. 9, 35 Taken together, we confirmed considerable heterogeneity in reaeration potential, consistent with the hypothesis that there is no \"typical ARDS,\" 33 but failed to confirm the association with particular subphenotypes that increase the likelihood of reaeration in this study.",

Lung recruitment in non-COVID-19-related ARDS patients measured by respiratory mechanics and CT shows a very modest correlation in previous studies because respiratory mechanics determine recruitment as improvement of mechanical properties in an already inflated lung, whereas CT assesses recruitment as reaeration of a nonaerated lung. 24 The differences between tissue recruitment and physiological recruitment are referred to as the \"recruitment paradox,\" and our data should be interpreted in this light. 36 The low PEEP CT-scan was performed at the PEEP level that was used just before the CT scans and varied between patients because the CT-scans were performed as part of clinical practice. In a proportion of patients with an early CT scan, the PEEP level at the low PEEP scan was only marginally lower than at the high PEEP scan, which could underestimate the potential for reaeration of the lungs in these patients. However, we found more rather than less reaerated lung tissue in this group, suggesting that this could not be attributed to differences in delta pressure. Furthermore, some patients were ventilated in pressure support mode, which limits the interpretation of respiratory mechanics. Selection bias could have occurred, especially in the group of patients who underwent late chest CT scans, while treating physicians only demanded a chest CT scan in patients with worsening respiratory failure. For the other patients, we have clearly described the risk of selection bias by providing an overview of all consecutive patients.",
