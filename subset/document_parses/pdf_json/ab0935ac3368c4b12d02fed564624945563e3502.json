The approach uses timely epidemiological data that has been widely available for COVID-19. It provides short-term forecasts of the outbreak's evolution, which can then be used for medical resource planning. The method postulates one-and multiwave infection models, which are convolved with the incubation-period distribution to yield competing disease models. The disease models' parameters are estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and information-theoretic criteria are used to select between them for use in forecasting. The method is demonstrated on twoand three-wave COVID-19 outbreaks in California, New Mexico and Florida, as observed during Summer-Winter 2020. We find that the method is robust to noise, provides useful forecasts (along with uncertainty bounds) and that it reliably detected when the initial single-wave COVID-19 outbreaks transformed into successive surges as containment efforts in these states failed by the end of Spring 2020.",

In fact, models and the data that they are built on, have played a central role in forecasting the spread, and consequently preparing for it (see Ref. [4] ), and have become the topic of news reporting (e.g., Ref. [5] ). It would be safe to say that the abundance of COVID-19 data (newly detected cases, as well as deaths; see Ref. [2] ), coupled with models, have been widely used to understand the COVID-19 pandemic and its multiple waves.",

In the current context, this implies an outbreak with multiple waves, each with a potentially different cause. Our focus is on providing accurate, actionable predictions in a timely manner, using the latest available data and without using specialized computational resources, so that such forecasts may be computed daily, and for a multitude of regions. Such modeling efforts do exist (as in Ref. [9, 10] ), and some are quite well-known (see Ref. [3, 14] ). Such a forecasting and planning methodology requires some quantification of the trustworthiness of the forecasts so that appropriate hedges and margins may be included in resource planning and logistics. Finally, it is also helpful for such a methodology to herald the arrival of a new, if incipient, surge/wave of infections, as it indicates the failure of containment efforts. Our methodology provides both these capabilities.",

Multiple waves in the current epidemic have been driven by increased social mixing caused by lockdown-exhaustion (see Ref. [10] ) or the premature opening of the economic activity, followed by flouting of social-distancing rules and super-spreading (e.g., Ref. [16] ). However, there are no direct ways of measuring social mixing in near-real-time. Mobility of a population can be measured quite promptly using mobile phone data, but that is an indirect measure of social mixing -coupled with proper social distancing and other precautions, a mobile population need not spread a disease. The frequenting of restaurants, bars and indulgence in other social activities is a reliable proxy of social mixing, but collecting real-time quantitative data is difficult. Thus a disease model that relies on information on social mixing (or enhanced disease transmission because of it) often has difficulties in predicting the start of a new wave of infections.",

[2] ). Such a model, for a single wave, was developed by the authors in Ref. [21] . It used Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of the infection rate curve as a probability density function, to capture the shortcomings of the estimation process. This infection rate curve, in conjunction with a disease model (specifically, just the incubation period distribution of COVID-19) could be used to provide shortterm probabilistic forecasts of the evolution of COVID-19 i.e., provide bounds on the trustworthiness of the forecasts. The inference and forecasting process is computationally fast, taking less than one hour to process regional data. The model, extended to a multiwave outbreak, would satisfy all the prerequisites of a near-real-time forecasting and planning system for COVID-19 and is the topic of this investigation. It is conceptually simple, as it only requires us to postulate a parameterized, multi-wave infection-rate curve, but poses a few practical challenges:",

We address the question of the number of waves to include in the infection rate curve by model selection i.e., we fit one-and multi-wave models to data and select between them using information-theoretic criteria. Finally, we exploit the \"partition-able\" nature of the infection rate curve's parameters to infer them piecemeal, with the novelty lying in the method by which we use previous inferences to formulate empirical priors for a high-dimensional estimation problem. These priors stabilize the inverse problem and accelerate the computations, thus making the inferences feasible, practical and scalable to a multi-wave epidemic. The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we review our previous model, and in Sect. 3, we introduce the data. The new model and numerical algorithm are described in Sect. 4, which are them proven on two-and three-wave COVID-19 outbreaks, using data from New Mexico, California and Florida. Discussions and conclusions, which follow thereafter, complete the paper.",

The model is an extension of previous work by Safta et al [21] for a single infection wave to epidemics exhibiting multiple infection waves. For the purpose of this work, we assume that once people develop symptoms, they have ready access to medical services and can be diagnosed readily. From this perspective, these forecasts represent a lower bound on the actual number of people that are infected with COVID-19 as the people currently infected, but still incubating, are not accounted for. A fraction of the population infected might also exhibit minor or no symptoms at all and might not seek medical advice. Therefore, these cases will not be part of patient counts released by health officials. The epidemiological model consists of two canonical elements: an infection rate model and an incubation rate model. One or more infection rate models are then combined through a convolution with the incubation rate model to yield the number of cases that turn symptomatic daily. We briefly describe below the mathematical formulation for the single wave model, followed by a description of the multiple wave approach. For more details on the single wave model the reader is refered to Ref. [21] . Finally, some considerations for the data used to fit the models are discussed in this section",

This is the essence of the pseudo-marginal MCMC algorithm [7] guaranteeing that the accepted MCMC samples correspond to the posterior distribution.

A similar dynamic is observed for the second wave. Across these two waves, N 2 and t 2 show stronger connections with the first wave while the infection rate parameters k 2 and 2 are only showing relevant connections inside the second wave. The correlations can be explained by how the infection rate curve varies with each parameter. For instance, i corresponds to the time scale of the infection curve; increasing it makes the curve shorter and will stretch it over a longer time interval. Therefore, to maintain an approximate fit to a set of case data, the symptomatic count N i will need to be increased if i is increased.

In higher dimensional parameter spaces, it can be difficult for MCMC to find a sample with a sufficiently large posterior density value to Fig. 6 Comparison of information criteria (AIC, BIC) and CRPS for the single and two-wave model results for New Mexico proceed to a new sample. This is observed for the twowave model when the prior distribution density p( ) spans a relatively large parameter range.

This empirical prior construction technique is also demonstrated for the threewave model, where tighter distributions for the first two waves were obtained from two-wave model results.

This improved performance is demonstrated qualitatively by model forecasts for various dates in June, July, and August, and quantitatively via information criteria and Continuous Rank Predictive Score results. These performance indicators can be used to determine the appropriate model parsimony for the data available.",

These results indicate the flexibility of the underlying model to capture the initial wave in cases starting in March 2020 along with the subsequent waves starting in June and September 2020. We provide guidance on how to apply the multi-wave model to cases with three or more waves, in particular how to construct informative priors. We also point out that the multi-wave model is unnecessary for cases in which the waves are clearly separated by long periods of low case counts; in these cases it is better to fit separate one-wave models.",

The lack of testing during the early stages of an epidemic suggests the daily symptomatic counts are likely an under-count. However, our approach, with its emphasis on simplicity and reliance on easily observed data is meant to used for medical resource Fig. 8 Comparison of information criteria (AIC, BIC) and CRPS for the single and two-wave model results for California Fig. 9 Comparison of information criteria (AIC, BIC) and CRPS for the single and twowave model results for Florida forecasting in situations with limited available data where more complicated epidemiological models are likely to encounter difficulties. While our approach could be modified to account for factors such as increased testing, this would increase the number of parameters, possibly leading to identifiability challenges during the early stages of the epidemic when data is sparse.
