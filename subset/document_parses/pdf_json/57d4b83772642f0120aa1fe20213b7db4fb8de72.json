Public health policies, including containment measures and, more recently, vaccination campaigns have become crucial to contrast the effects of the pandemic [4] . In parallel, an unprecedented international effort has led to significant advancement in understanding COVID-19 pathophysiology. In this context, the differential performance of interferon (IFN)-driven and antibody-mediated immune responses among individuals emerged as a pivotal mechanism in determining the clinical course of the disease [5] . Curiously, this landmark discovery disclosed an unexpected pathophysiological similarity between acute COVID-19related inflammatory events and chronic aberration in the deployment of the immune response as observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [6] [7] [8] . Moreover, evidence of a potential association between SLE-related pre-pandemic anti-IFN antibodies and COVID-19 has been provided by some authors [9] . These data further stimulated Abbreviations: ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2-related disease; cCOVID, COVID-19 cases confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; IFN, interferon; IQR, interquartile range; noCOVID, patients who were not diagnosed with COVID-19; NRS, numerical rating scale; pCOVID, presumed COVID-19 cases, based on symptoms, serological or imaging findings; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; totCOVID, cCOVID + pCOVID cases. a general interest in studying the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with SLE, who bear a unique combination of potential protective and detrimental factors for COVID-19 and might also constitute a paradigm to assess the wider social impact of the pandemic in persons with chronic diseases [3, [10] [11] [12] . In fact, while favourable demographics (SLE is more frequent in young women, who have lower risk of severe , hyperactive antiviral-like IFN-responses and potential prevention of COVID-related cytokine storm manifestations by chronic immunosuppression/immunomodulation could have constituted potential protective factors for patients with SLE, dysregulation of IFN responses together with altered epigenetics of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, the human target of SARS-CoV-2) and impairment of physiological immune responses by immunodepression might have behaved in the opposite way [9, [13] [14] [15] .",

Nonetheless, a significant geographical variability is consistently detectable among different studies [17] [18] [19] , possibly suggesting that local factors including population-level containment strategies [10, 11, 20, 21] might affect the global impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with SLE. In addition, experimental strategies also varied among studies. Multi-national registries focused on clinical features and disease course of patients with rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 and continuously provide data of increasing robustness about potential risk factors for severe or fatal outcomes, beside potential limitations due to the lack of non-COVID control groups and risk of overreporting of more severe cases [22] [23] [24] . Other researchers analysed population-based data and public health databases, thus complementing registry information with a bird's-eye view of contagion dynamics in patients with rheumatic diseases in the frame of the general population [18, 19, 25] . Complementary to these approaches, cohort studies based on questionnaires or chart review were also frequently reported [3, 10, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] and provided a deeper insight into the multifaceted clinical, social and psychological impact of the pandemic in the specific settings of patients with selected rheumatic diseases or general inflammatory disorder cohorts, despite potential limitations in capturing more severe cases [11, 12] .",

Of note, public health measures implemented during these two timeframes differed significantly, with looser rules prescribed during the second contagion wave when a three-colour regional risk classification was applied (highrisk = \"red\", intermediate-risk = \"orange\", and low-risk = \"yellow\") as compared to a homogenous country-wide \"red\"-zone instituted during the first wave [32] . While data about the early impact of COVID-19 in patients with SLE are accumulating, little is known about the global effects of the pandemic in the medium/long-term, also in light of emerging topics, such as the ongoing vaccination campaigns. To address this issue, we performed a web-based survey in a multicentre cohort of patients with SLE referring to three tertiary care hospitals in the Milan metropolitan area.",

Patients were instructed to avoid multiple registrations. Face and content validity of the questionnaire were assessed by direct interview of five randomly selected patients and by consensus among three expert rheumatologists (LB, EPB, MG) and a specialist in Infectious diseases, respectively. The questionnaire encompassed general demographics and clinical features, exposure to subjects with definite COVID-19 and occurrence of COVID-19 in patients. Numerical rating scales (NRS) ranging from zero (no compliance) to ten (strict compliance) were included to assess patients' and patients' family members' attitudes towards behavioural measures across the two pandemic waves. As data from the first pandemic wave have already been reported, we focused some additional questions, including prevalence of potential COVID-19 symptoms, hospitalisations and cases of COVID-19 among patients' family members/cohabitants, on the second observation period only. Data were also acquired about patients' attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination and about their perception of the impact of the pandemic on SLE course and management. The questionnaire was built in compliance with the European Guidelines for anonymisation [33] and after confirmation by the Ethics Committee and Data Protection Officer of IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy that no further approval was required for this study.",

Most patients were women (301/334, 90%), older than 40 years of age (209/334, 63%) with disease duration exceeding 10 years (205/334, 61%). Joint and skin involvement along with fatigue were the most frequent SLE features, while hypertension and allergy represented the most frequent comorbidities (Table 1) . Demographics and general clinical features were consistent with those of a representative random sample of patients from the same cohort and with data from the previous survey [21] , except for slightly different frequencies of joint involvement and constitutional symptoms (Supplementary Table 1 ). Patient self-reported global health status on a 0-10 NRS (with 10 representing the optimal status) was 7 (6-8) at time of taking the survey. The majority of patients reported being on hydroxychloroquine (235/334, 70%); 211/334 (63%) were on one or more immunosuppressants; 233/334 were on prednisone and 128 of them (55%) were taking less than 5 mg/ day prednisone equivalents. Ninety-seven patients (29%) reported treatment escalation at least once during the course of 2020. Sixty patients (62%) required increased prednisone dose, 49 (51%) new or potentiated immunosuppressants, 23 (7%) addition of belimumab. Conversely, 114 patients (34%) reported that during 2020 their disease was enough controlled to allow tapering of prednisone (78/114, 68%) and/or immunosuppressants (40/114, 35%); in three cases belimumab could also be withdrawn (Table 1) . Two-hundred-twenty-eight patients (68%) reported having missed one or more scheduled appointments due to healthcare service disruption secondary to the pandemic. For 179/ 329 responders (54%) the pandemic had no significant impact on the course of their disease; 56 (17%) reported a worsening impact; 12 (4%) felt that the pandemic had somehow been beneficial for their disease; 82 (25%) were uncertain about how the pandemic had possibly affected the course of SLE.",

            "text": "At a cohort level, we observed a slightly higher number of totCOVID and especially of cCOVID cases in the second half of the year, which included the second pandemic wave. During this second time interval, a higher number of cases was recorded throughout the Country, in parallel with a lower number of checks for the effective application of public health measures. Consistently, relatively looser compliance to behavioural measures was reported by patients and their families along with higher rates of exposure to confirmed COVID-19 cases in the second observation period. Beside infections, the pandemic also affected the routine clinical management of SLE. More than two thirds of patients reported at least one cancelled appointment due to the contagion. Despite this, only 17% of patients felt that the pandemic had a detrimental impact on their disease. Indeed, the reported annual rate of patients needing treatment escalation at least once was 29%, which is stable compared to the pre-pandemic setting [40] . The all-cause annual hospitalisation rate in this study was 9.6/100 person-years, which is also consistent with our preliminary observations during the first pandemic wave [21] and previous evidence in the literature from non-pandemic settings [41] . Constant engagement of patients in a multi-centre clinical and research network dedicated to patients with SLE might have contributed to mitigate the detrimental effect of the pandemic [10] , besides other potential structural advantages such as relatively easy access to health care, thanks to a public national health system [42] . Efficient individual and population containment measures (with adequate monitoring), such as social distancing, timely lockdowns and extensive vaccination campaigns [43] might further act in synergy [44] and be more relevant than clinical variables such as disease extent and comorbidities in modulating the risk of COVID-19 and its complications in patients with SLE [45] [46] [47] . Consistently and in line with previous observations [21, 48] , patients with SLE tended to be more adherent than their family members/cohabitants to the adoption of behavioural measures. Furthermore, although family members/cohabitants constituted a fundamental source of infection, 68% of patients with COVID-19positive family members/cohabitants did not develop COVID-19, possibly suggesting that correct awareness of potential risky behaviours positively affects the contagion risk. Data from this study also show that most patients with SLE are favourable to engage in public efforts including vaccination campaigns [49, 50] and suggests that cases of vaccine hesitancy might possibly be overcome with adequate counselling. For a comprehensive interpretation of our results, multiple limitations should be considered. The use of a patient-centred anonymous web-based questionnaire, excluded severely ill or deceased subjects, prevented a full validation of patient-reported information with patients' clinical records and introduced patient's subjectivity as a potential bias to the collection of data from patients' relatives. Furthermore, data from the general population were generated with different methods, warranting caution in comparing them to those of our dataset. On the other hand, our research strategy enjoys the strengths of web-based surveys [3, 21, 51, 52] , such as minimising potential biases in the interpretation of patient-reported data and promoting patient engagement in research. In addition, our study is not affected by reporting biases due to the potential selection of most severe cases or by delay in case identification Fig. 1 . Population context. In this figure, the number of cases of confirmed (cCOVID, dark blue) and presumed (pCOVID, pale blue) COVID-19 are depicted in their temporal relation with general population variables, including a) trends of COVID-19 cases in Italy (light blue line); b) trends of security checks to people (dark green line) and businesses (light green line) upon the application of the laws prescribing limitations to gatherings and movements; and c) type and validity of such limitations (table). For each task subject to regulation, a colour-code is applied to distinguish among high-(red), intermediate-(orange) or low-risk (yellow) areas in Italy (the whole Country was homogeneously considered high-risk for almost all the first observation period). Higher-risk colours overlap lower-risk colours where the strictness of a given rule is the same into different risk areas. In addition, rule strictness is graded from 0 (complete freedom) to 2 (complete ban) to generate sparkline graphs for each task. Containment policies were significantly looser in the second observation period.

Consistently, similar to the general population, older age and contact with COVID-19 cases within the family setting were major risk factors for infection in our study, although a significant proportion of patients did not develop COVID-19 despite infected subjects in their family. Treatment escalation, especially with corticosteroids, constitutes an additional factor associating with COVID-19 in patients with SLE. Maintenance of strict public health policies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread in the population, along with evidence-based, patient-tailored approaches for safe and effective vaccination, might be particularly important to overcome the potential threats posed by the pandemic to the health status of patients with SLE.",
