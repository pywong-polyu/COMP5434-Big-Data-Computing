The intensity of each wave is described by a power-law dependence. The parameters of dependence are determined by real statistical data at the initial stage of the disease spread. The results of the model simulation were verified using statistical data for the Republic of Belarus. Based on the developed model, a forecast calculation was made at the end of May, 2020. The accuracy of forecasting the total number of cases for a period of 3 months in the proposed approach was about 3%.",

In fact, such cases are not amenable to counting and for analysis in real epidemic situation. We will only use information about reported cases, which are usually associated with more severe manifestations of the disease.

We assume that the spread of the disease begins in the largest city with the highest population density and then, with a certain delay, the disease comes in an agglomeration with a lower density.
