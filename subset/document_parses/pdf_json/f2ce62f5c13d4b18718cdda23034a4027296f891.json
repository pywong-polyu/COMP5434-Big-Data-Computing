In addition, a large part of these patients is treated by antiretroviral drugs, i.e. ritonavir (RTV), which act as potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P4503A enzymes. For this reason, the co-administration of RTV and corticosteroids may enhance the exposure to the latter ones, metabolized through the CYP450 CYP3A pathway, and can prolong their half-life, causing longer-lasting suppression of HPA axis [1].
