            "text": ", caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with fatal pulmonary fibrosis. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can be developed to induce RNA interference against SARS-CoV-2, and their susceptible target sites can be inferred by Argonaute crosslinking immunoprecipitation sequencing (AGO CLIP). Here, by reanalysing AGO CLIP data in RNA viruses, we delineated putative AGO binding in the conserved non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) region encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) in SARS-CoV-2. We utilised the inferred AGO binding to optimise the local RNA folding parameter to calculate target accessibility and predict all potent siRNA target sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, avoiding sequence variants. siRNAs loaded onto AGO also repressed seed (positions 2-8)-matched transcripts by acting as microRNAs (miRNAs). To utilise this, we further screened 13 potential siRNAs whose seed sequences were matched to known antifibrotic miRNAs and confirmed their miRNA-like activity. A miR-27-mimicking siRNA designed to target the nsp12 region (27/RdRP) was validated to silence a synthesised nsp12 RNA mimic in lung cell lines and function as an antifibrotic miR-27 in regulating target transcriptomes related to TGF-\u03b2 signalling. siRNA sequences with an antifibrotic miRNA-like activity that could synergistically treat COVID-19 are available online (http:// clip. korea. ac. kr/ covid 19).",

The conservation rates were visualised with the positions in SARS-CoV-2 gRNA (NC_045512; reference sequence in GenBank) using IGV. , and VEEV (NC_001449, positions 5703-7520; nsP4).

The exposure probability (P exp ) of the siRNA target sites was determined using the RNAplfold program (https:// www. tbi. univie. ac. at/ RNA/ RNApl fold.1. html) as previously described 31 . The partition function for all local structures within the 80 nucleotidelong window (W = 80, as previously defined as optimal) 31 was calculated to derive the accessibility (log 10 (P exp )) of a target site in a predefined length (u) within the specified maximal distance (L) between two base-pairing positions. To select the optimal folding parameters, the difference in exposure probability (\u0394P exp ) between two sets of AGO-bound and either AGO-unbound or total regions (defined in nsp12 of SARS-CoV-2 by the metaanalysis of AGO CLIP data) was examined to consider the length of the seed site (u = 6, 7, and 8) with different constraints (L = 20, 40, and 60), compared with the previously defined length (u = 16) for siRNA target accessibility 31 . P-values were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (two-sided) in R. To design siRNAs with seed sequences (6mers or more in positions 2-8) of antifibrotic miRNAs (miR-27, miR-193a-5p, miR-486, miR-151, and miR-455) 17 , target sites were selected in the siRNA-accessible regions (P exp > 0.1) of SARS-CoV-2 gRNA (NC_045512) based on calculations using the optimised parameters (u = 8 and L = 20). RNA synthesis. siRNA and miRNA were synthesised (Supplementary Table S1 ) using custom RNA synthesis services provided by Bioneer (Korea). The quality of the synthesised RNAs and their modifications were monitored, reported, and confirmed by the manufacturer. To serve as a negative control, non-targeting miRNA (NT) derived from the cel-miR-67 sequence (Caenorhabditis elegans-specific miRNA) was synthesised as an siRNA with two thymidine deoxynucleotide (dT) overhang. To avoid miRNA-like repression, the siRNA was further modified to contain abasic pivot (abasic deoxynucleotide, dSpacer (\u00d8), at position 6) in both strands as previously reported 19, 20 . Duplexes of the miRNA, miR-27a, and miR-193a-5p, were synthesised according to the human miRNA annotation in miRBase (http:// www. mirba se. org/), with consideration of the two-nucleotide overhang. For RNA-Seq analysis, the miR-27a sequence was synthesised according to the annotation in miRbase; however, its passenger strands contain 2\u02b9-O methylation at positions 1 and 2 (2\u02b9OMe) in the form of siRNA, preventing seed-mediated repression from the passenger strand. siRNAs designed to contain the miR-27a seed sequence were synthesised as indicated in Fig. 3d ; these siRNAs also contain 2\u02b9OMe in the passenger strands. Details of the siRNA and miRNA sequences are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Cell culture, transfection, and treatment. The human epithelial lung carcinoma cell line, A549 (Korean Cell Line Bank), was grown in RPMI-1640 (Hyclone). The human fibroblast lung cell line MRC-5 (Korean Cell Line Bank) was grown in MEM (Hyclone). HeLa cells (Korean Cell Line Bank) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Hyclone).

After the cDNA was constructed, the libraries were amplified using PCR with the lowest optimal cycle, which was determined by performing qPCR (Rotor-Gene Q; Qiagen) with the addition of SYBR Geen I (1:10,000; Invitrogen) to the Q5 Highfidelity 2 \u00d7 master mix (New England Biolabs). The quality of the amplified library was verified using Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical) and the size distribution and quantity were estimated. After cross-checking the concentration of libraries using the Qubit DNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), the prepared multiplexed libraries were pooled and sequenced as 75 single-end reads (SE75) using the MiniSeq system (Illumina). All sequence data were deposited in the SRA database (SRP270828). The de-multiplexed sequencing reads were aligned with the human genome (hg19) using STAR (star-out-SAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate-outSAMattrIHstart 0-outFilterType BySJout-outFilterMultimapNmax 20-outFilterIntronMotifs RemoveNoncanonicalUnannotated-outMultimapperOrder Random-alignSJover-hangMin 8-alignSJDBoverhangMin 1) with RefSeq gene annotations.

            "text": "To treat COVID-19, we designed potent siRNA sequences against SARS-CoV-2. To ensure the efficacy of RNA silencing, we decided to consider AGO target site accessibility in SARS-CoV-2 gRNA, which could be inferred from the AGO CLIP results of another RNA viral infection 29 due to sequence similarity (Fig. 1a) . In particular, focusing on the most conserved region of RNA viruses that encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) 34 , we selected AGO CLIP results from the relevant RNA viruses categorised as having sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2 by estimating the phylogenetic distance (Fig. 1a, lower panel) . Then, we compiled the selected AGO CLIP reads on the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP gene (nsp12; Fig. 1b,c) , where hepatovirus (HAV) and enterovirus B (CVB), which belong to the same Pisoniviricetes class as SARS-CoV-2, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were chosen for primary alignment (Fig. 1b, upper panel) , in addition to distantly related viruses of the family Togaviridae (Sindbis virus, SINV; Chikungunya virus, CHIKV; Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, VEEV; Fig. 1b, lower panel) . Since similar patterns of AGO-bound regions were observed throughout the related RNA viruses, we integrated their AGO CLIP reads into consensus AGO binding, which is potentially preserved in the conserved sequences, particularly coding for the critical RdRP gene, and finally enabled the imputation of AGO accessibility in the nsp12 region without performing biochemical CLIP experiments for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1c) . Except for this conserved nsp12 region, AGO binding in SARS-CoV-2 could not be derived from the AGO CLIP data of other RNA viruses 29 . Thus, we should rather predict AGO accessibility based on local RNA folding, where the calculation of probability in a single-strand site could be optimised by using the deduced AGO binding in nsp12 (Fig. 1d,e) . With this notion, we initially attempted to calculate the exposure probability (P exp ) of local RNA folding by sliding 80 nucleotide-long windows (W = 80) as previously described (Fig. 1e) 31 . Because base pairing to seed (positions 2-8) initiates AGO target interaction 13 , we first specified the length of an exposed site within the seed region (u = 6, 7, or 8) and compared it to another by using a predefined length (u = 16) for siRNA from the previous study 31 . We also employed different ranges of maximum local base pairing (L = 20, 40, and 60) to calculate the target accessibility (log 10 (P exp )). By comparing the predicted AGO-bound regions (top 5%) with AGO-unbound regions (no reproducible AGO CLIP read; Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. S1a ) in nsp12, which were inferred by reanalysing AGO CLIP data from the related RNA viruses (Fig. 1a-e) , we identified a set of optimal parameters, where the P exp of the entire seed site (u = 8) within the range of ~ 20 nucleotide-long siRNAs (L = 20) outperformed other constraints (Fig. 1g, Supplementary Fig. S1b-e) .",

Based on the defined AGO binding in nsp12 (Fig. 2a) , we further predicted the AGO accessibility of every position in the SARS-CoV-2 gRNA by calculating P exp with the optimised parameter (u = 8, L = 20; Fig. 2b ). RNA viruses are frequently mutated during viral replication and propagation; however, the regions that play critical roles are relatively conserved 4 . Thus, siRNA is required to target invariant regions of viral gRNA to guarantee its consistent effectiveness in the human spread. Accordingly, sequence conservation rates were considered through an analysis of multiple sequence alignments of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported in human infections (n = 5475; Fig. 2c ). Ultimately, this revealed several mutation hotspots that should be avoided in siRNA targeting.",

            "text": "Validation of siRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 with antifibrotic miRNA activity. Among the 13 designed siRNAs (Fig. 2e) , we initially validated 3 siRNAs with high AGO accessibility (P exp > 0.5) for their target repression and miRNA-like activity; a miR-151 mimicking siRNA that targets nsp3 (named \"151/nsp3\", P exp = 0.55; Fig. 2f) , and miR-193a-5p mimicking siRNAs that target nsp3 (193/nsp3, P exp = 0.65; Fig. 2g Fig. 2h ). For 151/nsp3, a luciferase reporter with miR-151 seed sites was used to verify its miRNA-like activity (IC 50 = 5.59 nM, Fig. 2f, lower panel) . To examine a fibrosis-related target gene for antifibrotic miRNA-like activity, we selected (i) Accessibility of the target sites (log 10 (P exp )) was also calculated for the AGO-bound (red box plot) vs. AGO-unbound regions (grey box plot); *P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test (two-sided). (j,k) Same CDF analyses (h) performed in (f) and box plot analyses (i) performed in (g) except that the AGO-bound regions were compared with the total regions in nsp12. 35 , of which the 3\u2032UTR contains seed sites of miR-193a-5p (positions 1-8; Fig. 2i, left panel) . Therefore, we investigated the miRNA-like activity of 193/nsp3 and 193/nsp5 by measuring the COL1A1 transcript level as a validated target of miR-193a-5p 36 , confirming that they can repress COL1A1 mRNA to a comparable extent that was silenced by transfecting miR-193a-5p into the human fibroblast lung cells, MRC-5 (Fig. 2i, right panel) . Altogether, we validated effective target repression mediated by several designed siRNA sequences that target SARS-CoV-2 as well as mimic antifibrotic miRNAs. Because the RdRP protein, encoded by nsp12, is essential for viral replication, it has often been a therapeutic target of antiviral drugs. Therefore, we focused on a siRNA that targets nsp12 with a miR-27 seed site (named \"27/RdRP\"; Fig. 2e) , which was notably located on the peak of the AGO-bound region and had no sequence variation (Fig. 2c-e) . Although only 27/RdRP was chosen to be AGO accessible in the nsp12 region (P exp > 0.1; Fig. 2b ), four additional siRNAs could be designed to have target sites that match the seed of the antifibrotic miRNAs (miR-27a, miR-486, miR-151, and miR-455; Fig. 3a ) regardless of AGO accessibility (Fig. 3b,c) . In addition to 27/RdRP (Fig. 3d) , the siRNA with the miR-486 seed (486/RdRP; Fig. 3e ) showed marginal AGO accessibility immediately below the threshold (P exp = 0.072; Fig. 3a ), which could be worthy of experimental testing for silencing activity. In the luciferase reporter assays with corresponding siRNA target sites, high efficiency of target repression was observed for both 27/RdRP (IC 50 = 0.34 nM in A549 cells, Fig. 3f ; IC 50 = 0.28 nM in HeLa cells, Supplementary Fig. S3a ) and 486/RdRP (IC 50 = 0.13 nM in A549 cells, Fig. 3g) . However, the target site of 486/RdRP was found to contain critical variations in SARS-CoV-2 sequences within its seed matched region (Fig. 3h) , which was reported to be detrimental to RNAi activity.",

In the CDF analyses (Fig. 4a) , the putative miR-27 target transcripts, which harbor the seed sites in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR), were significantly downregulated when 27/RdRP was transfected into human epithelial lung cell, A549 (P = 2.9 \u00d7 10 -24 , Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, relative to control transfection (non-targeting miRNA; \"NT\")). Among the putative miR-27 targets (miR-27 seed sites in 3\u2032UTRs) in differentially expressed genes (DEGs; P < 0.05, Cuffdiff), most were downregulated (log 2 fold change < 0) by 27/RdRP (n = 371 vs. 145; Fig. 4b ). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the miR-27 targets (downregulated DEGs with miR-27 seed sites in 3\u2032UTRs) of 27/RdRP were found to function in lung fibrosis, mediated by TGF-\u03b2 signalling pathways, in conjunction with apoptosis, differentiation, mitochondrial regulation, and proliferation (Fig. 4c) . Downregulation of miR-27 targets was also induced by miR-27a expression in A549 cells (Fig. 4d,e) and was found to be enriched in similar functional networks regulated by 27/RdRP (Fig. 4f) .",

Of note, although miR-27 targets were selected simply by checking seed sites in 3\u2032UTRs, which possibly contained false positive, significant propensity of target repression was observed in 27/RdRP transfection (Fig. 4a,b) as well as in miR-27a transfection Figure 2 .

The same luciferase assays were performed for on-target activity of the miR-193a-5p seed containing siRNAs that target nsp3 (193/nsp3; g) and nsp5 (193/nsp5; h). But for miRNA-like activity, a miR-193a-5p target transcript, COL1A1 (i, left panel) was used to measure the abundance depending on 193/nsp3, 193/nsp5, and miR-193a-5p expression in MRC-5 cells by performing qPCR (i, right panel); normalised by GAPDH mRNA and represented relatively to NT (non-targeting miRNA; negative control) transfection (relative mRNA level).

Additionally, predominant downregulation of putative miR-27 targets (seed sites in 3\u2032UTRs) in DEGs depending on 27/RdRP or miR-27a expression (Fig. 4b,e ) reflects primary effects as miR-27 targets, in contrast to upregulated DEGs which may reflect the secondary effect from target repression. The consensus secondary effect, that overlaps between 27/RdRP and miR-27a, could be examined in part as only looking at overlapping downregulation and their gene ontologies. These results demonstrated that siRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 could direct the miRNA-like off-target effects to the way that could potentially suppress pro-fibrotic pathways by ",

            "text": "known that fibrosis is critically regulated by the TGF-\u03b2 signalling pathway, featuring collagen accumulation in the extracellular matrix 35 . Since we found that 27/RdRP could globally suppress miR-27 target mRNAs that mainly function in TGF-\u03b2 signalling (Fig. 4c) , we examined the effect of TGF-\u03b2 treatment on fibroblasts in the presence of 27/RdRP expression (Fig. 5a) . As previously reported, TGF-\u03b2 treatment induced differentiation of lung fibroblast cells, MRC-5, but the differentiation was attenuated by transfecting 27/RdRP as well as by transfecting miR-27a (Fig. 5a) . Furthermore, by expressing 27/RdRP, COL1A1 transcript, which encodes the major component of type I collagen and harbours a miR-27a seed site in the 3\u2032UTR (positions 3-8; Fig. 2i , left panel), was significantly reduced as observed in miR-27a transfection (Fig. 5b) , demonstrating that 27/RdRP could prevent pulmonary fibrosis by functioning as an antifibrotic miR-27a. Finally, to validate 27/RdRP for its silencing activity against SARS-CoV-2, the same nsp12 transcript of SARS-CoV-2 was synthesised in vitro and ectopically introduced into A549 lung cells as a mimic of viral infection (Fig. 5c,d) . Although high efficiency of target repression was observed for 27/RdRP and 486/RdRP (Fig. 3f,g) , it could be simply because the luciferase reporters contained only 20nt-long target sites without any flanking sequences, which may differentially affect local RNA folding. Thus, we validated those sites in the context of SARS-CoV2 sequences again. By quantifying the transfected nsp12 transcript relative to the control transcript (codon-optimised nsp12 construct with no 27/RdRP site), 27/RdRP was validated to specifically and remarkably reduce the nsp12 transcript (Fig. 5c ). In addition, 27/RdRP showed significant repression of the RNA fragment containing the 27/RdRP target site with only \u00b1 43 nucleotides flanking regions, even though the activity was relatively measured by the abundance of cognate RNA fragments suppressed by 486/RdRP (Fig. 5d) . Although both 27/RdRP and 486/RdRP showed comparable repressive activity in the luciferase reporters that contained only the target site (20 nucleotides) without flanking sequences (Fig. 3f,g) , 486/RdRP showed negligible silencing activity relative to 27/RdRP in the context of neighbouring sequences, which can affect local RNA folding (entire transcript or with \u00b1 43 nucleotides from the target sites; Fig. 5c,d) . This discrepancy in 486/RdRP could be explained by the lack of AGO association inferred from CLIP data (Fig. 2) and lower exposure probability (P exp < 0.1; Fig. 3a ) of local RNA folding. Indeed, in the predicted RNA secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 (predicted by mfold program 32 ; Fig. 5e ), 27/RdRP seed site in the local base pairing is very unstable (1.4 kcal/mol, estimated by RNAduplex program 33 ) in contrast to stable secondary structure in 486/RdRP seed site (-1.4 kcal/ mol). Overall, we validated the robust activity of 27/RdRP in repressing SARS-CoV-2 and preventing lung fibrosis via its antifibrotic miR-27 activity. In addition, to facilitate the use of all putative siRNAs designed here for targeting SARS-CoV-2, we established a webserver (http:// clip. korea. ac. kr/ covid 19) that provides sequence information of siRNAs which contain seed sequences of not only antifibrotic miRNAs (n = 5) but also highconfident human miRNAs (n = 897) with search functionality (Fig. 5f ). Total 14,028 target sites (antifibrotic miRNAs, n = 75; high-confident human miRNAs, n = 13,953) were identified in SARS-CoV-2 gRNA, offering exposure probability (P exp ), and inferred AGO binding regions (Fig. 5g) . Morphology of human lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5 after treatment with 2.5 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2. Fibrotic differentiation of MRC-5 was examined after transfection of non-targeting control (NT), miR-27a, and 27/ RdRP; 100 times magnified bright-field microscope images are presented; 400 times, inner set. Of note, fibrotic differentiation with long and thin morphology was induced by TGF-\u03b2 treatment, but substantially attenuated by expressing 27/RdRP or miR-27a. (b) The relative level of COL1A1 mRNA after 27/RdRP or miR-27a was introduced into MRC-5 cells; the level was normalised to that of GAPDH mRNA and presented as relatively to NT (non-targeting miRNA; negative control) transfection. Of note, owing to the extremely low expression of COL1A1 mRNA in A549 cells ( Supplementary Fig. S3d) , qPCR experiments were only conducted in the MRC-5 cells. Although the change in morphology in (a) was marginal, repression of a collagen gene, COL1A1, was significant (b). (c) The abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 transcript, which was transfected into A549 cells together with the control nsp12 transcript (codon-optimised nsp12 transcript; \" + Control\"), was measured in the presence of 27/RdRP expression. The relative RNA level of the nsp12 transcript was measured by the abundance of the co-transfected control transcript. Of note, both the nsp12 and the control transcripts, generated from in vitro transcription, have the same length and capability to be translated into the nsp12 protein. However, the control transcript contains no target site of 27/RdRP due to the difference in RNA sequences. (d) Same experiments as performed in (c) except that the nsp12 RNA fragments were co-transfected with 27/RdRP or 486/RdRP target site to relatively measure the ratio of the target RNA (relative RNA level) in the presence of 27/RdRP or 486/RdRP. All P-values from the t-test, two-sided; *P < 0.05; relative to NT; n \u2265 3; repeated with biologically independent samples; graphs, mean; error bars, SD.

The minimum free energy of 27/RdRP and 486/RdRP seed region (positions 2-8) in the secondary structure was calculated using the RNAduplex program 33 (highlighted with a red box).

            "text": "To design potent siRNA sequences against SARS-CoV-2, we attempted to infer putative AGO-accessible regions in SARS-CoV-2 gRNA by initially reanalysing AGO CLIP data from other RNA viruses in the conserved nsp12 region encoding RdRP. To expand the analysis from the conserved region, we applied the local RNA folding method by optimising the parameters with the inferred AGO binding in nsp12, calculated exposure probability (P exp ), and designed potent siRNAs that targeted the predicted AGO-accessible regions in SARS-CoV-2. To treat COVID-19 by silencing SARS-CoV-2 as well as by inhibiting the progression to fatal lung fibrosis, we utilised miRNA-like off-target activity of siRNAs by adopting seed sequences from antifibrotic miRNAs. Avoiding sequence variants in SARS-CoV-2, we designed 13 antifibrotic miRNA-mimicking siRNAs that target SARS-CoV-2 and validated some of their silencing activity as dual players. Among them, 27/RdRP was functionally validated to target the nsp12 region of SARS-CoV-2, confirmed for its transcriptome-wide activity, similar to antifibrotic miR-27a, and experimentally proven to suppress TGF-\u03b2-induced lung fibrosis and a collagenproducing gene, COL1A1, in human lung cells. Our current work provides bioinformatics approaches to design robust and synergistic siRNA drugs that potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and attenuate fatal pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19, offered as a web resource (http:// clip. korea. ac. kr/ covid 19) . Although further experiments are needed for clinical application, we hope that the siRNA sequences delineated here will offer more options for the rapid development of siRNA drugs to treat and save patients with COVID-19.",

(f) Ranking of the inferred AGO-accessible sites in nsp12. A set of high confident AGO-bound regions (high AGO accessibility) was defined by selecting the top 5% of compiled AGO CLIP clusters depending on their heights (average read-count in the 19 nucleotides window; n = 144, orange shade). AGO-unbound regions were selected as the sites with no AGO CLIP reads across the selected RNA viruses (HCV, HAV, CVB, SINK, CHIKV, and VEEV) or where AGO CLIP reads were observed in only one RNA virus species (biological complexity = 1; n = 259). (g) The partition function for all local structures within the window (80 nucleotides) was calculated to derive the exposure probability (P exp ) with RNAplfold 31 .
