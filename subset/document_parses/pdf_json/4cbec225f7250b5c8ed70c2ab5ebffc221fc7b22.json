More generally, anxiety has been associated with increased emotional eating [8, 11, 12] , obesity, and other risk-to-health behaviors in adults [13, 14] .

Each GAD-7 item is scored as follows: 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than half of the days) 3 (nearly every day). The total GAD-7 score can thus range from 0 to 21, where a higher score indicates greater anxiety [27] . Cut-off scores for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety symptoms are 5, 10, and 15, respectively [28] .",

Associations between nominal variables were assessed using the chisquare test.

GAD-7 scores were significantly higher among women than men. Among women, anxiety scores did not differ by reproductive status. Anxiety also differed significantly by the language in which the survey was completed, such that those who completed the survey in Hebrew reported the lowest median scores. Anxiety scores did not differ by health status, smoking status, vegetarian/vegan diet, or usual place of employment. GAD-7 scores differed by current employment status and were highest among the currently unemployed. Respondents with 12 years of formal education had higher anxiety scores than others. Table 5 presents the multivariate logistic regression model of at least a mild anxiety (GAD-7 score of 5 or greater). The following variables were entered into the regression model: age, sex, the language in which the questionnaire was completed, current isolation score, duration of physical activity during the COVID-19 outbreak (minutes/week), education, change in diet pattern (worsening yes/no), weight gain (yes/no), smoking status (current smoker yes/no) and MedDiet score. The final model was arrived at using a backward, stepwise approach and did not include smoking status, education, weekly minutes of physical activity during the outbreak. Though age was not significantly associated with the outcome, it was retained in the model as a universal covariate. The model was significant and correctly classified 68.9% of study participants for at least mild anxiety. As can be seen, each 1-point increase in current isolation score increased odds of at least mild anxiety by 19%. Male sex reduced the odds of at least mild anxiety by almost 60%. Individuals who reported that their current diets were less healthy than their diets prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had an almost 60% increase in odds of at least mild anxiety, and those who reported weight gain had increased odds of the anxiety of more than 46%. Completing the survey in Hebrew vs. any other language reduced the odds of mild anxiety by almost 43%.",

Each item on the scale can receive is scored as follows: 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than half of the days) 3 (nearly every day); thus, the total score can receive a value from 0 to 21, where a higher score a direct comparison, the relatively high level of anxiety in our study may reflect that anxiety was measured during a nation-wide total lockdown. Findings from indepth interviews indicate that among those experiencing higher anxiety, the lockdown has been associated with more significant challenges such as lack of space in the home environment, shortage in access to supplies, lack of savings, and loss of income [36] . It has been shown that metabolic status (including obesity), age, and sex influence the clinical severity of COVID-19 [37] . Poor diet quality (which may foreshadow obesity) age and sex were associated with both diet quality and anxiety in the present study. A higher MedDiet score was also associated with less selfreported weight gain and an improved diet pattern during the pandemic. Increased MedDiet score was associated with reduced odds of moderate to severe anxiety, while a decline in diet quality during the outbreak compared to the pre-pandemic diet increased risk for this outcome, even after controlling for key explanatory variables. Our findings are in agreement with results from Mediterranean countries. In a recent study conducted in Greece and Spain, higher anxiety scores (as measured by the GAD-7) were associated with lower MedDiet scores [22] . In addition, adverse eating behaviors, such as restrained and emotional eating, were associated with higher symptoms of depression and anxiety. Findings from a recent international survey indicate that the COVID-19 related quarantine, was associated with overeating and consuming food of a poorer quality [8] , similar findings were reported in an Israeli survey in which concern about deterioration in their financial situation, poor health, and gender (women) predicted a significant increase in the amount of food intake [24] . Additionally, a study from Poland reported on either weight loss and weight gain among adults during lockdown [38] .",

            "text": "Israel has an efficient primary care healthcare system, providing a broad basket of services [39] , which can improve the identification of patients with anxiety at times of crisis. Since the mental health reform in July 2015, Israeli citizens and permanent residents are entitled to receive mental health care services through their chosen health fund, with the costs of care covered by the funds [40] . Mental health issues carry a stigma, which may lead to avoidance of help-seeking since primary care physicians participate in the referral process [41] . However, a previous study in a national representative sample of adult Israelis has shown gender differences in the use of mental health services, with women being more likely to seek mental health help regardless of socioeconomic or morbidity [42] . In the current study, female sex emerged as a significant risk factor for anxiety. Therefore, the first step could be anxiety screening through the primary healthcare system, which could make this a national priority during the pandemic. This would encourage the four Israeli health plans to approach this disease like any other and use standard disease management tools. Additionally, since we found that worsening of diet quality during the pandemic and weight gain doubled the odds for higher anxiety, we suggest that physicians will consider referring people with high anxiety or weight gain during the pandemic to dietitians. Furthermore, dietitians in healthcare should be informed on those associations and alert primary health care physicians in case of concern. Female sex (vs. male) was the indicator variables for sex; any college degree (bachelor's degree or higher = 1 (vs. any other response) and was the indicator variable for education; Spanish was the indicator variable for language (vs. any other language); reporting that the current diet was worse than the pre-pandemic diet = 1 (vs. no change or improvement in diet = 0) and was the indicator for change in diet Therefore, steps should be taken to improve casefinding of people with higher anxiety among primary physicians and those with adverse eating behaviors among dietitians. This requires the provision of appropriate diagnostic instruments, training of medical staff, feedback to physicians and nurses, and raising awareness among the relevant patient population and their caregivers.",
