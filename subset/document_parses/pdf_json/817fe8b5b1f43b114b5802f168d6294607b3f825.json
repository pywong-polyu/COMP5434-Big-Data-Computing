Among those with the greatest potential for such an event include influenza viruses and coronaviruses. In the last century alone, we have observed four major influenza A virus pandemics as well as the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type III interferons as well as a numerous chemokines. Taken together, these data suggest that the unique transcriptional signature of this virus may be responsible for the development of COVID-19.",

In an effort to better understand the molecular basis of the disease and identify putative markers for COVID-19, we compared the transcriptional response of SARS-CoV-2 to that of seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) and human orthopneumovirus (commonly known as human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)), two common recurring respiratory viruses. Comparing the transcriptional response in both primary human lung epithelium and transformed lung alveolar cells revealed that SARS-CoV-2 elicits a unique transcriptional response as compared to IAV and RSV. In a homogenous cell population, the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a significant lack of Type I and III interferon (IFN-I and IFN-III) expression as compared to IAV and RSV. Moreover, while a core number of cytokines that comprise the antiviral host defense are shared amongst all three viruses, an equal number are notably absent in response to SARS-CoV-2. Lastly, the only genes that appear to be unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection are secreted peptides implicated in diseases of the airways. This unique response to SARS-CoV-2 could also be recapitulated in vivo comparing influenza infection to COVID-19 in ferrets. Taken together, these data reveal that the interaction between virus and host as it relates to SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for its unusual high morbidity and mortality.",

These efforts not only highlighted the unique transcriptional signatures induced by the three respiratory infections, they also corroborated that the response in different cell systems with SARS-CoV-2 were comparable(Fig. 3c). To further delineate the unique antiviral signatures of each virus, we next examined the expression levels of specific genes implicated in the host antiviral response(Fig. 3d). These analyses again showed that despite sharing a similar transcriptional footprint to RSV, SARS-CoV-2 lacks the induction of IFN-I and IFN-III genes(Fig. 3d). However, this same analyses shows a common subset of well established interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) shared with RSV that are lacking in IAV, presumably due to the expression of the antiviral antagonist NS1 7 . While most of the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 was either shared or lacking in comparison to the response to IAV and RSV, two cytokines (EDN1 and TNFSF15) were uniquely upregulated(Fig. 3e). The unique induction of these two secreted factors was particularly noteworthy as they have been implicated as mediators of respiratory inflammation 6 .Lastly, to ascertain whether the mutated antiviral response to SARS-CoV-2 could be observed in vivo, we infected ferrets with either influenza A virus or SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4). At five days post infection, nasal washes were performed and the heterogeneous cells obtained from this procedure were again subjected to bulk RNA sequencing and aligned to either SARS-CoV-2 or A/California/04/2009(Fig. 4a).These data demonstrate complete coverage of the challenge virus suggesting that in both examples, the ferrets were shedding replication competent virus. Next, these same upper respiratory cell populations were compared to mock treated ferrets to ascertain the transcriptional response in vivo for comparison purposes. In agreement with our in vitro data, differential expression analyses of these respiratory infections demonstrated that the transcriptional footprint of IAV was significantly greater in magnitude that that observed for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4b-c). While the ferret genome annotation limits the direct comparisons between some orthologues, we do observe a diminished cytokine response when comparing SARS-CoV-2 to IAV.

Perhaps the slow amplification of the virus is then the underlying cause for the lung damage and an explanation for why the course of infection is so prolonged. In this regard, it is also of interest to point out that while replication is apparent in 6 month old ferrets (comparable in age to human teenagers), they do not show overt signs of disease and clear infection after approximately eight days. Taken together, the data presented here suggests that perhaps artificial means of boosting the antiviral response may be an effective option at treating COVID-19 so long as it does not further aggravate any pre-existing conditions.MATERIALS AND METHODSCellCulture Human adenocarcinomic alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cells (ATCC, CCL-185), Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC, CCL-34), African green monkey kidney epithelical Vero E6 cells (ATCC, CRL-1586) and African green monkey kidney epithelical BS-C-1 cells (ATCC, CCL-26) were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Corning). Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells (Lonza, CC-2540 Lot# 580580) were isolated from a 79-year-old Caucasian female and were maintained in bronchial epithelial growth media (Lonza, CC-3171) supplemented with BEGM SingleQuots as per the manufacturer's instructions (Lonza, CC-4175) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . Viruses Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus (NCBI:txid183764) and influenza A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1) virus was grown in MDCK cells at an MOI of 0.001 in DMEM supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA, MP Biomedicals), 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine and 1 \u00b5g/ml TPCK-trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Infectious titers of influenza A viruses were determined by plaque assay in MDCK cells. Recombinant GFP-expressing human respiratory syncytial virus, strain A2 (rgRSV[224]) was generously provided by Dr. M. Peeples (OSU) and was described previously 12 . rgRSV[224] was grown in BSC-1 cells in in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose and 4 mM L-glutamine. SARS-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was deposited by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH. SARS-CoV-2 was propagated in Vero E6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES. Infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by plaque assay in Vero E6 cells in Minimum Essential Media supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine, 0.2% BSA, 10 mM HEPES and 0.12% NaHCO 3 and 0.7% agar. All work involving live SARS-CoV-2 was performed in the CDC/USDA-approved BSL-3 facility of the Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in accordance with institutional biosafety requirements. RNA-Seq of viral infections Approximately 1 \u00d7 10 6 A549 cells were infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus (IAV), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or SARS-CoV-2. Infections with IAV were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 9 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.3% BSA, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM Lglutamine and 1 \u00b5g/ml TPCK-trypsin. Infections with RSV were performed at an MOI of 15 for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.3% BSA, 4.5 g/L D-glucose and 4 mM Lglutamine. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 were performed at an MOI of 0.2 for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES. Approximately 1 \u00d7 10 5 NHBE cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 2 for 24 h in bronchial epithelial growth media supplemented with BEGM SingleQuots. Total RNA from infected and mock infected cells was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions and treated with DNase I. RNA-seq libraries of polyadenylated RNA were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA-seq libraries for total ribosomal RNA-depleted RNA were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA libraries were sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Bioinformatic analyses: Raw reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the RNA-Seq Aligment App on Basespace (Illumina, CA), following differential expression analysis using DESeq2 13 . Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were characterized for each sample (p adjusted-value < 0.05) and were used as query to search for enriched biological processes (Gene ontology BP) and network analysis of protein interactions using STRING 14 . Heatmaps of gene expression levels were constructing using heatmap.2 from the gplot package in R (https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html). Sparse principal component analysis (sPCA) was performed on Log 2 (Fold Change) values using SPC from the PMA package in R 15 . Volcano plots were constructed using custom scripts in R. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on gene expression profiles from mock and SARS-CoV-2 treated cells comparing to a composite list of genes involved in Type-I IFN response (GO:0035457, GO:0035458, GO:0035455, GO:0035456, GO:0034340, and HALLMARK_INTERFERON_ALPHA_RESPONSE) 16 .
