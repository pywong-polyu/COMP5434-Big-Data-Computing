Yet, as capacity to understand and serve those needs accelerates, so too do expectations. Evidence-based practice, without delay, is expected throughout the development and delivery of medicine, healthcare, and information, and potential sources of evidence are legion. To keep pace and go beyond, to innovate, requires efficiencies. Not the disguised cutbacks of political language, but the collaborative constructive efficiencies of shared learning, forming new evidence bases for further progress. Here, we describe the first year of a medical transformation process at a global mid-sized pharmaceutical company. Beginning with a broad review designed to leverage collective intelligence and focus on meaningful outcomes for patients, this process examined and reshaped the structure, culture, and tools of the medical organization and its interactions within and outside the company. We report the findings of the diagnostic phase, outline the solutions implemented to date, and anticipate the next steps in this dynamic evolving journey.",

With confident yet forward looking leadership and collaborative practice, a digitally empowered medical organization will direct and translate internal and external resources to serve the needs and expectations of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs), within the pragmatic realities of healthcare systems. Achieving meaningfully improved health outcomes for patients will be at the core. Having evolved from a support function within historically more consumer-based organizations, through a bridge, to a strategic pillar, from reactive to proactive, transforming in response to external pressures and propelled by unprecedented global change and therapeutic advances, medical functions will nimbly deploy novel yet validated approaches to co-create better healthcare that is centered on the patient and rooted in evidence. In so doing, they will ensure their deep medical expertise can be impactful in a noisy world. Pharmaceutical companies must remain relevant amidst healthcare-facing innovations from digital giants. So, how? Not in isolation. A clear consensus also highlights the importance of developing deep medical capabilities, especially people, generating and leveraging novel insights, and communicating effectively with all relevant stakeholders. The very pace of evolution in Medical Affairs has contributed to challenges in articulating its value, threatening to hamper cross-functional progression [14] . The impact and value of strong medical organizations anywhere should be felt everywhere, to the ultimate benefit of patients and society, if we collaborate at a next level. To that end, we describe a process of medical transformation at a global mid-sized biopharmaceutical company, outlining the initial impetus and steps taken to date, and examining progress toward that near-future vision.",

Prior to Q2/2020, Medical Affairs supported internal decision making, but a cultural shift was needed to position the medical organization as a strategic driver of innovation and value alongside research and development, commercial, and market-access functions [1, 2] . This positioning, which reflects the emerging industry-wide vision of medical affairs as we introduced above, was fundamental to achieve our evolving vision-of medical leadership for patients being at the center of everything we do. Leading in therapeutic area (TA) strategy allows the voice of data to be more effectively leveraged, not only in translating for and between multiple stakeholders but also in ensuring an evidence basis for resource and development decisions, to deliver value and insights for patients, HCPs, and healthcare systems. In March 2020, a newly appointed Chief Medical Officer joined the Executive Leadership Team, enabling medical to \"lead from the C-suite\", and a new and empowered Medical Transformation Lead was appointed to further boost medical leadership and ensure deep worldwide implementation. This elevation of medical, essential in reinforcing and executing on its strategic pillar status, was nevertheless a structural tweak. The true cultural shift aimed to leverage collective intelligence throughout the transformative process, and embed this approach within the solutions identified.",

Executive Leadership Team members called for stronger medical partnership in business development, while external interviewees noted that excellent scientific expertise and exchange at a local and global level was hampered by staff turnover and partial under-resourcing. In parallel, an internal survey distributed to 974 staff-global leadership team, key partners in other functions, and all medical-generated 725 responses (a 74% return rate) (Fig. 2) . Capabilities in Medical Affairs were perceived as being at or above the industry standard (score of 3.0) in only eight of 18 dimensions assessed. Average perceptions of medical capabilities were higher among medical affairs staff (3.1; n = 378) than non-medical affairs staff (2.7; n = 347); 12 of the 18 dimensions scored slightly above average among the former. Overall, 'traditional' areas of expertise, including compliance, publications, and medical information and education rated above standard, contrasting with crucial data-centered capabilities including performance tracking, real-world evidence (RWE), and digital and analytics (Fig. 2) . The Medical Science Liaison (MSL) and training dimensions scored above or at standard but were acknowledged as being of critical importance for the future impact of the medical organization on patient care. Similarly, it was a priority to strengthen the existing and well-regarded Patient Affairs function. During this phase, the strategic direction of medical transformation was set according to overarching aims and fully embraced by Ipsen's CEO and Executive Leadership Team, to: measurably improve patients' lives along the patient journey, as well as HCP experiences; demonstrate medical leadership; advance medical care in long-term collaborations; be at the leading edge of (data and technology enabled) innovation in specialty care; and attract, develop, and retain leading talent.",

Individual workstreams included Executive Leadership Team-nominated partner owners from other relevant functions and geographies. Priorities, set with multi-year horizons, included specific nearterm goals within 3-month and 6-month timelines. Changes enacted alongside the rollout of the transformation roadmap included seeking to fill immediate capability gaps: medical professionals with experience in business development, digital professionals with medical experience, and training and knowledge transfer leads. Other re-structuring involved mirroring in the medical organization the structure of TAs as established in the research and development organization, and the international structure of the commercial organization. Within Global Medical Affairs TAs, capabilities were strengthened for external innovation and business development. Medical Excellence, expanded with new training and knowledge transfer roles per TA, was joined within Global Medical Affairs Capabilities by a novel Data, Insights & Strategy function led by an experienced RWE specialist, incorporating the existing Biometry team. Global Medical Affairs Regional was boosted with new regional heads to drive global and local alignment. Patient safety was fully integrated in the A detailed transformation roadmap was rolled out via a dedicated global townhall in September 2020, followed by supportive regional townhalls and cross-functional regional implementation team kick-off meetings to ensure full worldwide implementation. Each workstream included specific goals, activities, and best-practice definitions (Fig. 3) , with progress to be monitored via key performance indicators (KPIs). Important in the new culture was that KPIs assessed meaningful metrics [15] ; the impact as well as the magnitude of an activity. For example, within the stakeholder engagement workstream, operational KPIs, such as the rollout of a new tool for collecting insights and the percentage of users accessing it, were accompanied by performance KPIs such as the proportions of countries sharing and applying insights, and stakeholder feedback on the usefulness of gathered insights. Into early 2021, localization of the roadmap was driven through executive-sponsored medical health checks with country managers and medical directors to identify capability and resource gaps.",

New recruitment and fast-track promotion programs have been instigated to encourage attraction and retention of the best talent. Medical-Science Liaison and patient centricity teams have been expanded. Training has been updated to create the Medical Excellence Academy, to systematically train medical staff on core and role-specific capabilities. Integral to this plan has been the hiring of new Knowledge Transfer Leads per TA, to ensure a deep understanding of products, TA, and other critical medical information for all relevant staff. These roles proved challenging to fill, as few corollaries exist, but are rapidly making an impact. As new core training modules come online, the team is working with colleagues in TAs, publications, communications, and medical information to pilot effective ways of providing real-time updates, such as priority data at congresses, new manuscripts, and collective insights. Periodic assessment will measure skill development against defined pillars, and delivery of content in terms of scientific excellence, clarity, and objectivity. This structure will be important to equip staff, and also to ensure staff feel equipped, to provide value in their interactions.

Another aspect is identifying who to engage with, when, and how to do so most effectively. A key milestone in the medical transformation was achieved in August 2021, with the rollout of the Thought Leader Identification and Mapping tool, a data-driven application to help find, validate, and select thought leaders based on evidence. The tool increases the ease, visibility, and transparency of profile building, and supports planning for local and global activities with HCPs.",

Traditional sources such as advisory boards, MSL interactions with HCPs, publications, and congresses are themselves becoming more technologically varied, and are supplemented by new sources created by novel technologies. Making use of these myriad opportunities will require medical staff trained to recognize actionable insights, and systems that can recognize patterns. In June 2021, a new medical insight system went live. Users can input insights as free text or in response to approved surveys, record the source, associate them with predefined tags or with medical objectives, and submit them for review. Reviewers check for plausibility, quality, potential safety events, and compliance of information. A dashboard offers instant analytics and custom reports. Assessing input and addressing feedback from users are integral to the active ongoing development of the system.",

As a first step, integrated evidence plans are being created for priority products by the end of 2021, bringing together data-generation planning across medical, health-economic outcomes research, market access, development, safety, regulatory, and commercial at a global and local level. Externally, RWE is already being used to support label expansions and approvals [19] , while pharmaceutical companies and regulators are rapidly adapting to the place of RWE in drug development pathways [20, 21] . Guidelines for reporting randomized controlled trials using routinely collected data including from registries, electronic health records, and administrative databases were published in 2021. 22 While these technologybased solutions are alluring, a full appreciation of the nature of the data sources, their accuracy, completeness, and relevance are needed to allow insights and RWE to be reliably and transparently used to help bring therapeutic solutions to patients.",

Investment has shifted substantially from marketing to medical, with a refocused operating model and correctly sized country medical organizations. High-value studies and programs-those most likely to make an impact for patients-have been prioritized, with support provided to rationally end underperforming studies. This step change in ambition, ensuring that all data generation activities are aligned with cross-functional plans and patient needs, aims to provide genuine and differentiated data to support better care. Involving a change in the culture of ongoing support, oversight, and performance management in relation to all forms of data generation, it has been necessary at times to shift from an activity-driven to an outcome-driven mindset, with a focus on tracking and execution across all aspects of medical and clinical operations. Ongoing efforts aim to establish a deep quality mindset and structure, develop a detailed understanding of patient flow and journey, positively influence healthcare systems to improve the standard of care, and improve knowledge transfer from headquarters to countries. Countries also offer the opportunity to pilot new approaches. For example, an innovative virtual launch event platform, hosting regional advisory boards, postlaunch events, and a homepage for medical professionals was deployed in Germany.",

Fully implementing new integrated data plans including RWE, streamlined global local translation of materials and practices, and ensuring that all new tools are implemented is a longer process. Following through on execution and metrics and ensuring that cross-functional efforts translate into improved outcomes for patients require an ongoing culture of focus, collaboration, agility, and transparency. And of course, innovation. The value of breaking silos is that everyone can learn from each other. Colleagues in research and development have been investigating synthetic trials, and medical is now exploring this area too. Machine learning has provided novel ways of understanding patient journeys and predicting patient outcomes. At the time of writing, leveraging true artificial intelligence in medical affairs remains a future prospect, but the pace of change suggests the future will be here soon, and we should be ready.",

Continuous leadership development is essential to ensure medical's full engagement with all stakeholders and an appropriate flow of information, and effective knowledge transfer is essential to get data to the frontline.
