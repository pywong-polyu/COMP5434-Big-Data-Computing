The purpose of the present study was to explore the potential mental health impact of this forced quarantine and widespread shutdown among small business owners and the self-employed. A semi-structured interview was employed among 14 participants from three different cities in China. Grounded Theory was employed to analyze the data using Nvivo11 plus. Based on a qualitative analysis, 9 categories of responses emerged to describe the experience and actions of participants towards the quarantine: enjoyment of life, emotional disturbance, hope, comparisons to others, social support, patriotism, making changes, and obedience. Further analysis suggested that the mental state of participants was either positive or negative depending on enjoyment of life, loss, emotional disturbance, and hope, and that these were impacted by intervening conditions (national measures, social support, patriotism), personal strategies (exercising, studying, comparisons to others), and personal consequences (making change, obedience). Rather than observing a linear pattern of negative outcomes, mental state was found to be variable in that positive outcomes were experienced earlier in the quarantine (making connections with family), negative states were encountered midway through the quarantine (fear of financial loss, anxiety), and more positive mental states (hope) emerged towards the end of the quarantine depending on intervening conditions, personal strategies, and consequences. It can be concluded that the nature of the impact of mandatory quarantine in China among small business owners and the self-employed is complex and depends on a variety of personal and situational factors.",

            "text": "In December 2019 an unknown pneumonia-like viral illness (later named COVID-19 and linked to the Novel Coronavirus) appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (World Health Organization, January 20, 2020). Since strong evidence suggested that the Novel Coronavirus was highly contagious through interpersonal contact (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020), the city of Wuhan was locked down on January 23rd, 2020. One thing that made this virus so problematic was that, despite its high degree of infectiousness, many did not show obvious symptoms. As a result, it was spread rapidly by asymptomatic individuals (Dimaschko et al., 2021) . As a new virus, there was no available evidence at that time to direct policy or procedure, so it appeared that the best course of action was to physically isolate people in order to curb the spread of infection. Swift and decisive action was required at that time given that an estimated 5 million citizens of Wuhan had just previously departed the city to visit their hometowns throughout China to celebrate the Chinese New Year . Therefore, it was deemed necessary to take such draconian actions to halt the rapid expansion and spread of this virus.",

            "text": "Due to the fact that so many had departed Wuhan and Hubei province (the epicenter of the virus and disease) during the holiday season, reports of infection from around China began to emerge. As a result, authorities from all provinces and administrative divisions of China launched the highestlevel response to this health emergency through a massive lockdown of the country involving tens of millions of people, which is believed to be the largest quarantine in human history at that time (Gunia, 2020; Huang, 2020; Zhang, 2020) . Some of the specific lockdown measures that were taken included shutting down public transportation systems, restricting travel, and closing supermarkets, stores, malls, fairs and any place where crowds of people could congregate (Langton, 2020) . People were ordered to stay at home and were only allowed to go out to shop for basic supplies once or twice a week with permission. Those who were sick were advised to stay home and leave only to visit a doctor. This measure prevented many who had travelled to visit family during the Chinese New Year (which is considered the most important festival in China) from returning to their own homes. Also, since this was a break period in the education system prior to the start of a new semester, education authorities made the decision to suspend upcoming in-school classes and activities. As an alternative, virtual courses were given for students at all levels of education to ensure they were maintaining their educational training but were also protected from the Novel Coronavirus (Huaxia, 2020) . These shutdown actions also meant that nearly all places of business, including restaurants, grocery stores, department stores, barber shops, clothing stores, pharmacies, and open markets, were ordered to close. The exceptions were a few stores that provided basic requirements, which were allowed to open for a few hours a day to serve the need for food, medicine, and other life necessities.",

As such, current evidence does suggest that these drastic measures of imposing travel bans and closing schools/businesses successfully reduced the virus' reproduction and transmission (PTI, 2020) .

            "text": "However, there are also demonstrable concerns over the negative consequences of these actions. For example, a noteworthy longitudinal study found high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress outcomes in the early months of the Coronavirus in China (Wang et al., 2020b; Wang et al., 2020c) which had not significantly declined after four months. Similarly, the prolonged isolation from lockdown measures is believed to exaggerate psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness -especially for those who may have preexisting vulnerability (Usher et al., 2020) . One potential explanation for this is Strain Theory which posits that competing or conflicting pressures in life create psychological tension, which can build and eventually manifest as negative psychological outcomes (Zhang, 2005) . In particular, coping strain (conflict from the inability to deal with life challenges or difficulties) and aspiration strain (competition between an individual's aspirations or goals and the realities of a given situation) have been found to increase psychological distress (Ren et al., 2018) and depression (Zhang et al., 2016) . In this context, the inability to cope with these sudden and dramatic health and safety issues and the resulting forced lockdown, in addition to difficulties in achieving the desired goal of working and providing for their families may have increased levels of strain and ultimately incited psychological issues.",

A recent report by noted that the widespread shutdown in China may have the greatest economic impact on small business owners and the self-employed. This may be because this group have a larger personal investment in their financial situation, tend to have less \"cash-on-hand\" to meet business expenses, are less able to absorb inventory loss, and may not receive aid/assistance as readily as larger businesses during the lockdown. Therefore, the present manuscript is focused on the potential psychological impact of the long-term home-quarantine in China on small business owners and the self-employed.",

However, the final sample included only 14 participants because one business owner went on a business trip and cancelled the interview in Huantai City. The remaining participants all provided informed consent ahead of the interview. All participants were interviewed individually by the respective three authors in China who had made the initial contact. During the interview, participants were asked to recall and describe their experiences and how they felt during the isolation period while their business was shut down. All interviews lasted between 30 and 72 min, and were audiotaped for subsequent verbatim transcription. The interviews took place from May 1-15, 2020.

It provided a time to connect with family, build relationships and strengthen bonds which was cherished by many. In contrast, this was also a time of financial strain where many experienced lost income, expiration of goods, and forfeiture of incoming/future orders in combination with high personal expenditures, such as costly rent and existing personal/business loans, which contributed to psychological disturbances such as stress, anxiety, and fear. However, the feeling of hope for the future provided a buffer from these issues for many, as they looked expectantly towards better times in the future.",

As previously noted, there was some inconsistency in mental states as a result of the home-quarantine, with some showing more positive and some showing more negative outcomes. Further, for many these states did appear to fluctuatesometimes gradually over time and sometimes more abruptly. Nonetheless, the specific path depended on three main factors including inner strength, a common obedient attitude, and social support. More specifically, inner strength was demonstrated by the thoughts, actions, and orientation towards change that manifest itself in an optimistic attitude towards life at home, a resilience when confronting these difficulties, personal efforts to make positive change, and a hope for the future. In terms of support, with the exception of Fu who mentioned the purchase of N95 masks from the local government, nobody else mentioned national support as a direct positive impact during the time of quarantine. However, several did received insurance subsides from the government that made them feel better after quarantine, and the specific measures taken by the government to control COVID-19 did appear to make most feel more secure. What was evident, though, was that the principal support which contributed to more positive mental states was support from family members. Finally, there was a fairly common thread of obedience that seemed to improve mental states. This was manifest as a general attitude that this is a common and shared quality among Chinese people that contributes to a feeling of resilience, and endurance in adjusting to challenges and struggles in life.",

With respect to the first hypothesis, as expected it appears that the long-term home-quarantine in China did have a psychological impact on this sample, but the nature of this impact was not entirely in line with the second hypothesis in that there appeared to be a tendency towards a more positive mental state among many at early and latter stages of the quarantine. This is another relatively unique contribution to the limited existing research in that there has been little focus on potential positive personal outcomes of the forced lockdown situation due to COVID-19. On the surface this appears to contradict other studies that have noted numerous negative consequences related to COVID-19, including stress, depression, irritability, insomnia, fear, confusion, anger, frustration, boredom, and stigma associated with quarantine, some of which were found to persist even after the quarantine was lifted (Brooks et al., 2020) . It should be noted, though, that the participants in this study did suffer adverse outcomes but those appeared to be most evident in the middle of the quarantine period when the lockdown was extended, but these outcomes did not necessarily persist as many participants seemed to show a return to a positive mental state. In the end, this demonstrates that the impact of the lockdown is complex and does not necessarily lead to a linear sequence of negative consequences, which is an important implication for research in this area.",

For our participants who are generally very busy in their daily business routines, the news of the lockdown provided a much-needed break and a chance to reconnect with family which brought on a strong positive mental state. This would be in line with the well-known Chinese philosophy of \"Shun Shi Er Wei\" (\"let nature take its course\") in that small business owners and the self-employed looked to take advantage of the adverse circumstances as they happened. Therefore, participants tended to enjoy life with loved ones because the quarantine gave them this unique opportunity.",

            "text": "The second phase emerged as the quarantine progressed and significant concerns materialized among many small business owners and the self-employed due to uncertainty about their business and their future. As the shutdown progressed there were many unexpected and unanticipated outcomes that surfaced. For example, many products that had been prepared for the New Year would go unsold or could expire, rents and loans still needed to be paid despite a loss of income, and the health-related dangers of COVID-19 continued to rise. This led to many adverse consequences including anxiety, stress, arousal, and fear. This was in addition to the rising concerns over health risks associated with COVID-19. However, participants showed resilience as they utilized various mechanisms to cope. These included seeking social support (mainly from family members), taking confidence in the national measures to control COVID-19, and making comparison to other people and contexts. Social support can buffer stress, and anxiety, through the sharing of information, by providing an opportunity to discuss feelings and experiences, and by increasing the feeling of being cared for. This outcome is in line with previous research on Strain Theory, where social support has been shown to buffer the impact of strain on subsequent psychological distress (Liu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018) . In a similar way, a confidence that measures were being taken to control COVID-19 could improve the longer-term outlook and give individuals a sense that there is future hope. According to Wang et al. (2020b) , the psychological impact of risks associated with the pandemic can be dramatically reduced when people feel that they are receiving current and accurate information about COVID-19. Likewise, confidence in doctors can also represent protective factors for negative psychological outcomes due to COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020c) . In turn, this can subsequently increase adherence to personal protective factors, such as wearing masks, engaging in hand hygiene, and distancing which can moderate psychological consequences such as stress, anxiety, and depression (Rahman et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020a) . Further, comparisons with others can buffer negative emotional states by giving a sense of relative advantage; for example, the idea that there are many in Wuhan who were much more adversely affected, that many businesses were hit harder, that some in different regions or different eras did not have the same level of medical or technological advances, and that some were even trapped far from their homes and families during this crisis. Festinger (1954) suggested that people have a strong tendency to evaluate themselves in comparison to others. In this case, through downward comparisons (Kesici & Erdo\u011fan, 2010) , participants may feel better knowing that comparatively they are better off than many others. As a result, this process might buffer against the negative psychological consequences during the lockdown.",

This was seen as a belief in the strength of China as a nation and its ability to eventually control the spread of the virus. They noted that the government had great resolve and compassion for the people. Many were thankful that the government paid for treatment of infected individuals and noted how authoritative the government was in ordering such a drastic measure to address the issues of COVID-19. This is consistent with other research that noted lower levels of anxiety and depression among those who felt that early government interventions were crucial in minimizing the spread of infection and eventual death rates . This may impart a sense that the government and the nation in general are concerned about individual well-being. In interviews with COVID patients, Hao et al. (2020) found more positive affect and attitudes among those who perceived that the country, government, and medical profession cared about them. In the present study, there was a great expression of pride in being Chineseto the point where some even attempted to volunteer to assist those impacted in Wuhan. In fact, one participant even served as a front-line worker as a party member. This patriotic expression is likely due to the fact that this patriotic attitude runs consistently through the education system from kindergarten through university. Further, this is maintained after formal schooling through Communist Party activities, the media, new technologies and mass entertainment (Chai et al., 2020; Guo, 2019) . Acting on this patriotism (specifically to do things for the betterment of China and the Chinese population) has become the norm. Love for the country runs deep in China, which may have led to increased positive psychological states such as faith, optimism, confidence, assurance, grit, and security. These may have supplanted many of the negative emotions that could have potentially emerged. For example, one might fear what could happen to their business, but the patriotic notion that China is strong, they will survive these challenges, and will support its people, could potentially transition into a feeling of confidence and hope for the future.",

Participants in this study were resolute in their obedience to the quarantine, even to the point of shutting down their businesses despite immense personal costs. This was not a mere act of compliance though, as there was an expressed sentiment of wanting to stay accountable in helping to reduce the personal and social threat, and to reduce the potential spread of the virus as happened in other countries in a similar context (Digiovanni et al., 2004; Toronto SUN, 2020) . And while this could still lead to a negative mental state (particularly in the mid stages of the quarantine), participants were nonetheless able to translate this to a more positive state by making the best of the situation through connecting with family, staying in shape and exercising, or studying.

In this respect, these participants did not have to deal with the illness or the threat of illness to the same degree as those in areas like Wuhan. Similarly, the lockdown would not have lasted as long, so comparatively the threat to their livelihood would not have been as severe. As a result, the mental states of those in areas more dramatically impacted by this threat may show a unique pattern, particularly in terms of negative thoughts and feelings. The current outcomes, nonetheless, should still apply to the large proportion of small and self-employed business owners in China. Future research could potentially look to draw comparisons of participants in varying regions, including those with greater and lesser infection rates or lockdown durations, to understand potential similarities and differences in mental states and coping strategies.",

Similarly, it emphasizes the importance of providing a high degree of support at all levels of a person's life space including family, community, organizations, the medical industry, and government. These should not only impact positive mental state, but also interactively with personal protective activities such as distancing, use of masks, and sanitizing practices (Rahman et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020a) , which should lead to more widespread physical and psychological health improvements, and ultimately \"hope\" for the future.",

One effective means of accomplishing this could be through the use of telephone or virtual based therapy approaches. Just as Antonopoulou et al. (2021) found that the academic landscape has been changing in the face of COVID-19, where digital skills in addition to good communication are crucial for good leadership, the same could be argued in many ways for the mental health field. In this respect, there is growing necessity and demand for the development of digitally based therapeutic approaches. For example, there is growing evidence that digitally based Cognitive Behavior Therapy can be a low-cost and effective means of treatment, in particular for COVID-19 patients Ho et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Zhang & Ho, 2020) . As such, the development and promotion of this type of therapy could exponentially improve mental well-being during harsh conditions of lockdown when travel may be tightly restricted and threat of spread of infection is great.",

As expected, there were noteworthy negative consequences to the forced lockdowneconomic and psychological issues that the scientific community should continue to investigate for the health and safety of everyone. But the present findings also highlight the human capacity to cope in seemingly terrible conditions in that, somewhat unexpectedly, positive mental states emerged at various points from these negative circumstances. Specifically, mental states were found to fluctuate across the duration of the quarantine, which varied from relaxation at the beginning to fear and anxiousness in the middle, mixed with resolution to change and hope for the future towards the end. An important factor that impacted the initial positive mental state were a welcomed opportunity to relax and spend time with family to reconnect. During the middle stage, stress, fear, and anxiety over lost business and revenue led to a rise of negative mental states. However, patriotism, obedience, social support, inner strength, and hope for the future led to a return of a positive psychological state towards the conclusion of the quarantine. In this respect, the scientific community should continue to pursue evaluations of the factors that buffer or mitigate negative mental states, such as social support, confidence in medical information, a sense of belonging, and future hope.
