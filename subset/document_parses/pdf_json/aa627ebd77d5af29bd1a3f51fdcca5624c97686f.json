Due to rapid aggravation of symptoms, timely intervention is paramount; however, current therapies are limited in their capacity to address CRS. Here, we find that the intravenous injection of highly purified detonation-synthesized nanodiamonds (DND) can act as a therapeutic agent for treating CRS by adsorbing inflammatory cytokines. Highly purified DNDs successfully inactivated various key cytokines in plasma from CRS patients with pneumonia, septic shock, and coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic . The intravenous injection of the DND samples in a mouse sepsis model by cecal ligation and puncture significantly improved survival rates and prevented tissue damage by reducing the circulating inflammatory cytokines. The results of this study suggest that the clinical application of highly purified DND can provide survival benefits for CRS patients by adsorbing inflammatory cytokines.",

Then, a vicious cycle of more inflammatory mediators and more recruited inflammatory cells can aggravate inflammation at the site of infection as well as systemic circulation (Schroder et al., 2006) . In a worst-case scenario, it can cause a systemic inflammatory overreaction known as fatal cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which results in septic shock and multiple organ failure (Chousterman et al., 2017; Shimabukuro-Vornhagen et al., 2018) . The recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic presents an example of a disease that comes with a high risk of CRS (Ma et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . Therefore, timely intervention to reducing systemic circulating inflammatory cytokines is critical for managing CRS.",

Blood filtration therapy is one of the most widely used clinical practices (Ma et al., 2020) . However, a complicated facility for blood filtration is required, although it is common and relatively straightforward. The use of corticosteroids, a class of steroid hormones, is effective for the treatment of CRS from viral infections, but it can inhibit the immune system, which in turn increases the viral load and aggravates symptoms (Auyeung et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006) . As a novel therapeutic approach, the use of antagonists for specific cytokines such as antagonists for receptors of Anakinra IL-1\u03b2 and Tocilizumab IL-6 is effective in improving the survival rate of severe sepsis patients (Shakoory et al., 2016; Tanaka et al., 2016) . However, these antibodies are limited to a single cytokine species which limits the ability to inhibit inflammation caused by multiple cytokines in CRS.",

Furthermore, in our preliminary studies, the highly-purified detonationsynthesized nanodiamond (DND) showed maximal binding affinity to interleukin-8 (IL-8) inflammatory cytokine in vitro (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Based on this finding, we investigated DND as a cytokine adsorber aiming for rapid suppression of CRS in a sepsis mouse model and for adsorbing inflammatory cytokines in the plasma samples of CRS patients suffering pneumonia, septic shock, and COVID-19.",

To evaluate the comparative cytokine adsorption efficacy among seven DND samples synthesized from our previous study (Lee et al., 2020a) , we used A549 cells because of their high baseline production of inflammatory cytokine (e.g., 100 pg/ ml in an untreated 24 h culture). The cytokine adsorption efficacy test is not for evaluating cytokine production by DNDs but for evaluating the comparative cytokine adsorption efficacy. Each DND sample was treated to A549 cells (The European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Porton Down, United Kingdom) at 50, 100, and 200 \u03bcg/ml and measured the levels of IL-8 in the supernatant at 24 h after incubation. Carbon black (Printex 90; Evonik Degussa GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) and Co 3 O 4 (Nanostructured and Amorphous Materials, Houston, TX, United States) were used as reference particles. The result of this experiment showed that the level of IL-8 was complete depletion by the most purified DND sample only and it was irrespective of serum coating, which suggests that the highly purified DND possesses unique properties for adsorbing inflammatory cytokines without cytotoxicity (Supplementary Figures S1, S2) . In this regard, the most purified DND sample among seven DND samples was further evaluated as a cytokine adsorber in CRS. Since the CD and Co 3 O 4 showed limited capability in the absorption of cytokines in vitro, these materials were not tested in the human-sample-based studies.",

The hydrodynamic size of the DND was 173.5 \u00b1 1.8 nm in DW and 280.3 \u00b1 7.0 nm in PBS, which suggests small agglomerates are formed. Although there are various methods in preventing aggregation of nanoparticles such as surface coating (Javed et al., 2020; Shrestha et al., 2020) , such methods may block the effective binding sites in the DND particle. Thus, we maintained the pristine state of DND nanoparticles to maximize the protein absorption efficiency. Furthermore, even in the aggregated case, the hydrodynamic size of DND in PBS is still less than 300 nm, there must be no limitations in the systemic circulation. The zeta potentials of the DND sample in DW and PBS were \u221228.1 \u00b1 0.2 mV and \u221231.8 \u00b1 ",

            "text": "Because the highly purified DND has complete adsorption of high levels of IL-8 normally released by A549 cells without cytotoxic effect (Supplementary Figures S1, S2) , we hypothesized that DND could be a useful substance for clearing inflammatory mediators in the blood of CRS conditions such as COVID-19, sepsis, and pneumonia. To evaluate the protective effect of DND for CRS as a cytokine sponge, DND was incubated with plasma from COVID-19 patients for 2 h and the levels of cytokines were analyzed by cytokine array. Various cytokines including interleukins, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were increased in the plasma of COVID-19 patients compared to the normal group (Supplementary Figure S3) . As expected, proinflammatory cytokines (CRP, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3), G-CSF, macrophage colonystimulating factor (M-CSF), MMP, and ICAM-1 were decreased in DND incubated plasma (Figure 2A, left panel) . However, IL-10, IL-22, IL-23, angiopoietin, CC chemokine ligand (CCL), chemokine (CXC motif) ligand (CXCL), and growth factors ( Figure 2A , right panel) were not altered. Next, as it was speculated that cytokine adsorption was associated with decreased cytokine concentrations in plasma samples, we also measured the kinetics of cytokine binding to DND in vitro. The time-course adsorption kinetics of representative inflammatory cytokines are shown in Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S4 . As a result, the levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, INF-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 showed time-dependent adsorption kinetics and reached a plateau at 60 min. Next, we evaluated the efficacy of DND for adsorbing cytokines in plasma of patients with septic shock. The inflammatory mediators in plasma of patients with septic shock were significantly increased compared to the healthy control ( Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S5) . The incubation of DND with plasma samples of septic shock patients showed a marked reduction of inflammatory mediators such as CRP, IFN-\u03b3, ILs, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), TNF-\u03b1, CXCLs, and MMPs (Gray bar of Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S5) , while CCLs and growth factors did not bound (Right panel of Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S6) . In kinetics analysis, DND started to adsorb in 15 min, and clear timedependent increased adsorption was observed for IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 ( Figure 3B ). Although DND binds to certain cytokines such as ILs, it is considered that DND may bind to excessive inflammatory mediators in the patients' blood. In the next step, we analyzed the adsorption efficacy of DND with the inflammatory mediators in plasma samples of patients with pneumonia. The adsorption pattern in plasma of pneumonia patients was slightly different compared to those of septic shock or COVID-19 ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S7) .

As shown from the pneumonia samples ( Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S8) , representative proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 were adsorbed to the DND irrespective of the disease type.

The survival of CLP mice was improved by 20 and 40% upon administration of 100 and 200 \u03bcg/ml of the DND, respectively ( Figure 5B) . The histological analysis of lung tissue showed that the administration of 200 \u03bcg/ml of DND significantly suppressed blood vessel disruption (as noted by reduced blood leakage) and pulmonary inflammation ( Figure 5C ). Consistent with these observations, serum levels of enzymatic markers of tissue damage including AST, ALT, BUN, and creatine were significantly suppressed after DND administration ( Figure 5D) . Additionally, the levels of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly reduced by DND treatment ( Figure 5E ). It is noted that the survival rate of CLP mice was increased two-fold in 200 \u03bcg/ml of the DND than 100 \u03bcg/ml of DND, suggesting its dose-dependent therapeutic effects. However, the interaction between DND nanoparticles and in vivo cells needs to be investigated in the future to confirm the safety of DND nanoparticles for the clinical trials.",

            "text": "In this study, we have demonstrated that DND is a potent pancytokine adsorber. It is well known that nanoparticles effectively bind proteins to form protein coronae with some specificity exist due to their unique physicochemical properties such as size, surface charge, and hydrophobicity (Breznica et al., 2020) . As the size of nanoparticles decreases, the protein binding affinity increases because smaller particles have a higher surface area and a higher surface reactivity compared to their larger counterparts (Cedervall et al., 2007) . Thus, the effective protein binding affinity of DND shown in this study could be due to the high surface area of 5 nm-sized DND. The positive surface charge of nanomaterials tends to have a high protein binding affinity, so the surface charge might not be the key to high affinity for the protein-binding as DND used in this study are negatively charged (Gessner et al., 2003; Treuel et al., 2014) . However, the electrostatically charging property of the DND can lead to efficient cytokine adsorption (Lee et al., 2011) . Lastly, the hydrophobic nature of DND samples may be a key mechanism to explain high affinity protein binding because protein binding affinity increases with the hydrophobicity of nanoparticles (Carrstensen et al., 1992; Kolate et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2020) .",

For example, graphene nanoplatelets showed a promising ability to adsorb inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 (Seredych et al., 2018) . Mesoporous carbon materials showed effective removal of IL-8 from human plasma (Pavlenko et al., 2017) . Carbide-derived mesoporous carbon displayed adsorption of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 from human plasma (Yushin et al., 2006; Yachamaneni et al., 2010) . Graphene-based filtration systems also removed cytokines from plasma by adsorbing IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 (Seredych et al., 2018) . Because these studies only tested for the limited cytokines in vitro using readily prepared plasma, the possibility for in vivo application remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate several favorable features for DND as a CRS suppressor. DNDs began to act immediately after a simple intravenous injection and the experimental data from the CLP mouse model confirmed not only its effectiveness in enhancing rate but also the in vivo safety of the DND.",

In such cases, the cytokine levels will increase the initial state after the irritation of cytokine production by cells unless the DND absorb cytokines. However, in this experiment, the DND indeed reduced the cytokine level in a time-dependent manner, suggesting the absorption of unbound cytokines in plasma. Furthermore, the saturation of binding after 60 min indicates the sufficient biding of cytokines in a given DND mass. This suggests that the highly purified DND could potentially be a novel therapeutic sorbent for treating CRS. To the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of carbon nanomaterials for in vivo application as a therapeutic agent for CRS.",

Current strategies for CRS treatment include 1) filtration of blood (Frimmel et al., 2014; Greil et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2019) ; 2) corticosteroids (Lee et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2019) ; and 3) antagonists for inflammatory cytokines (Giavridis et al., 2018; Norelli et al., 2018; Sterner et al., 2019) . Although these efforts show some benefits in treating CRS, there are several disadvantages such as limited time of action, immune compatibility, and stability (Honore and Matson, 2002; Matson et al., 2004; Sch\u00e4dler et al., 2013; Schadler et al., 2017; van der Poll et al., 2017) . Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are required to treat CRS. In this regard, nanodiamonds are one of the most biocompatible materials because of their inert sp 3 structure, which makes them well suited to biomedical applications (Mochalin et al., 2011) . Among nanodiamonds, as the sp 3 /sp 2 carbon ratio increases, the less the potential for intrinsic ROS generation was seen (Lee et al., 2020a) . Thus, our study demonstrates the feasibility of a highly purified DND as a potent pan-cytokine adsorber, which can Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 862495 8 prevent CRS. Furthermore, previous studies also showed the safety of nanodiamond as confirmed by the unchanged levels of TNF-\u03b1 (Tsai et al., 2016) and biocompatibility such as excretion into the urinary tract (Zhu et al., 2012) in the nanodiamond-injected mice. These results collectively indicate the in vivo safety of nanodiamond.",
