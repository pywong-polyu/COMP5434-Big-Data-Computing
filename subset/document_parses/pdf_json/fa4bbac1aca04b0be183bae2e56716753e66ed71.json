Largest correlations between parameters are observed between \u03b7 and \u03be, see Fig. part b) . are considerable correlations between these two parametes detected, but they seem to be mild, and from the available data we can obtain good information also about the most likely values of these parameters. Finally, for the parameter combination of L(\u03c6, \u03be) we observe again a more restricted area of possible parameter sets, though also here some correlations are visible. In conclusion, it seems that the available data sets give quite some information about the possible parameter combinations to describe the system under investigation.

The elevated areas of both graphs show a similar parameter region, confirming that the original approach a) already gives good informations about the two-parameter likelihood, and refinements in b) given a smooth likelihood surface, since larger ensembles are now better accessible.for small hospitalization rate \u03b7 and small detection rate of mild/asymptomatic infections \u03be as well as for large \u03b7 and large \u03be. However, the severity rate \u03b7 is well restricted between 0.2 and 0.7 and a clear maximum visible around the best value from the individual likelihood plot,Fig. 3 e)in the main text. The boundary value of \u03be = 1 has a non-vanishing probability to explain the data, but numerically the value of L there is much smaller than the values in the middle of the parameter intervals of \u03b7 and \u03be. Hence, even with higher numerical resolution, on the expense of many more stochastic runs of the model, it is not expected to have high values of L(\u03b7, \u03be) still at locations close to the bundaries of the possible parameter values.
