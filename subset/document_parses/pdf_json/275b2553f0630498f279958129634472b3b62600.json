To this end, we longitudinally profiled blood inflammation markers, antibodies, and 101 plasma proteins of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who did or did not require ICU admission. While essentially all patients displayed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and virus-neutralization capacity within 12-15 days, a rapid, mostly transient upregulation of selective inflammatory markers including IL-6, CXCL10, CXCL11, IFN\u03b3, IL-10, and monocyte-attracting CCL2, CCL7 and CCL8, was particularly evident in ICU patients. In addition, there was consistent and sustained upregulation of apoptosis-associated proteins CASP8, TNFSF14, HGF, and TGFB1, with HGF discriminating between ICU and non-ICU cohorts. Thus, COVID-19 is associated with a selective inflammatory milieu within which the apoptotic pathway is a cardinal feature with potential to aid risk-based patient stratification.",

We used the LIPS method 24 to analyze antibody responses to S1, S2 (two subunits of spike protein), RBD, and N protein, which we previously showed to correlate well with the ELISA method as reported earlier 23 . All ICU and non-ICU patients developed IgG antibodies to S1, S2, N and RBD proteins during their hospitalization (Fig. 1A-D) . The seroconversion of the COVID-19 patients occurred 12 to 15 days after symptom onset, with an average of 13 days from the start of the disease (medians 15, 13, 12 and 13 days for S1, S2, RBD IgG and N, respectively; Fig. 1E ), although overall there was considerable variation in seroconversion kinetics, ranging from 5 to 25 days. Anti-RBD antibodies tended www.nature.com/scientificreports/ to appear earlier than other antibodies, although without significant difference. We found no significant difference in seroconversion times between non-ICU and ICU cohorts but noted several early antibody responders among non-ICU patients, but none among the ICU patients (Fig. 1F ). Following seroconversion, the antibody levels to the four proteins analyzed peaked at around 18-22 days. Although individual antibody levels varied considerably, the non-ICU patients tended to reach peak levels earlier, whereas the ICU patients peaked later but at higher levels, an observation that needs to be viewed in the context of the greater time period over which plasma from the ICU cohort could be sampled (Fig. 1G) . We found high anti-RBD levels among the patients, suggesting strong virus-neutralizing immune responses; we therefore tested 15 ICU plasma samples for their capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus and correlated the titration results to LIPS values measuring antibodies to S1, S2, RBD and N proteins. Thirteen of those ICU patients developed a neutralization titer of 1:640, 4 of whom had titers of > 1280. Microneutralization titers correlated well with IgG RBD (\u03c1 = 0.7) and S1 (\u03c1 = 0.73) (Fig. 1H) , as reported earlier 19 , and increased over time in 9 of 11 (82%) patients analyzed (Fig. 1I ).",

IFN\u03b3, which is an activator of CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL9, and other interferon-stimulated genes, was also elevated in the early stages of disease and declined over time, but the analysis of IFN\u03b3 was complicated by considerable inter-individual variation among healthy controls (Fig. 2E ,K). Nonetheless, while hospital admission levels of the cited cytokines and chemokines were highly variable, there was a constancy to their decline in both patient cohorts, particularly for IFN\u03b3, CCL7, IL-6 and CXCL10 (Fig. 2K ). However, the PCA plot with the 10 markers measured at the early stage of the disease did not segregate ICU, non-ICU and the mild disease cohort groups (Fig. 2L ). Of note, this group of cytokines and chemokines collectively composes a set of well-established inflammation markers associated with activated myeloid and T cells, that may be highly germane to reports of myeloid and T cell dysregulation in COVID-19.",

As anticipated, the clustering analysis confirmed a strong correlation between early-stage inflammatory markers, forming a discrete profile of IL-6, IL-10, CXCL10, CXCL11, IFN\u03b3, CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, IL-18, IL-18R1 and PD-L1. We also observed a cluster containing HGF, TNFSF14, S100A12, OSM and TGFA. In contrast, CASP8 clustered separately, together with EIF4EBP1, SIRT2 and STAMBP and with TGFB1 and IL-7. Strikingly, TNFSF11 (TRANCE) and CXCL5 showed a strong negative correlation with most of the early-stage inflammatory markers indicating an opposite trend of these markers in COVID-19 pathogenesis. The correlations were disease-associated as they were different in healthy controls. Moreover, the samples collected at the beginning of hospitalization manifested a substantially greater degree of systemic inflammation, exemplified by the strong correlation between CXCL10, CXCL11, IFN\u03b3 and PD-L1 when compared to samples collected during the disease course or immediately prior to discharge (Fig. 4B-M, Supplementary Table 2 ). This suggests the potential of admission levels of certain analytes to be prognostic of subsequent disease course, as has been recently proposed 4, 5 . Such risk-based patient stratification might be further improved by assessments of markers with strong disease-associated correlations, e.g. between HGF and TNFSF14, and between IL-6 with CASP8 and HGF (Fig. 4H,J,M) . Indeed, some of the strong correlations reflect associations between related family members mediating immune-stromal crosstalk such as that between IL-6 and LIF (Fig. 4E) , and that between IL-6 and OSM.",

CASP8 is released to the extracellular medium after the apoptotic stimulation of myeloid and T cells. TNFSF14 is primarily produced by activated T cells and myeloid cells, is increased in plasma from patients with acute ischemic atherosclerotic stroke 30 , and is involved in the progression of chronic heart failure 31 . TNFSF14 was recently reported to be upregulated in COVID-19 patients together with OSM and S100A12 6 , which both showed higher levels in our analysis. HGF, whose upregulation was specific for ICU group, has anti-apoptotic effects, and its levels are elevated in chronic inflammatory diseases. HGF frequently counteracts TGFB1, another cytokine involved in apoptosis, and expressed at elevated levels in COVID-19 patients 32 . Our finding is consistent with other recent studies showing the association of HGF with COVID-19 severity 6, 33 . It might therefore be considered that the apoptotic events that drive increased HGF levels, underpin T cell apoptosis as a fundamental trait that contributes to SARS-CoV-2-specific immune pathology; hence, the association of HGF with disease severity and ICU requirement.",

Their differential role in COVID-19 pathogenesis remains to be studied, however it is conceivable that the early stage markers are related to initial strong inflammatory response to overwhelming viral infection and are driven by monocyte-macrophage activation whereas the sustained pattern of several apoptosis-related markers is related to T-cell apoptosis and hyperinflammation-induced tissue destruction 12, 25 . The cluster analysis of the patients based on 19 selected markers showed clear separation of severe cases including 3 ARDS-diagnosed cases and one patient who died, who all had higher levels of IL-6, HGF and CCL7 during the disease compared to other ICU patients.

Plasma samples were obtained from 40 COVID-19 patients (Table 1) hospitalized at the Tartu University Hospital, Estonia. Fifteen patients were treated in ICU and 25 in ordinary COVID-19 ward. Most of the ICU patients required mechanical ventilation within the first 10 days after the onset of symptoms with a median duration of the intensive care unit (ICU) stay of 10 days (range 1-54 days). Moderate COVID-19 patients were hospitalized for a median duration of 11 days (range 1-44 days). The diagnoses for all patients were confirmed by PCR analysis for SARS-CoV-2 virus. During their hospitalization in April-May 2020, some patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine but not with remdesivir, dexamethasone or IL-6 inhibitors. The patients nevertheless, had several comorbidities and were given corresponding treatments. The samples from a group of 6 patients with mild disease were collected from the individuals who came to emergency medical unit, were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but sent home for quarantine and not admitted to the hospital. We studied altogether 119 healthy controls (age range 23-87 years) without recent infection or COVID-19 symptoms (fever or cough) for last month. Blood samples of two groups of patients (mostly over 60 years of age) without COVID-19 disease were collected from Internal Medicine unit and CRP under 5 mg/L: one group of 18 individuals was studied for clinical blood analysis and another group of 18 controls for the expression of multiple plasma proteins. In addition, 70 control individuals, including healthy blood donors, were studied for antibody reactivities.",

The assay uses two oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies that bind to protein targets. Upon binding to the protein epitope, the paired oligonucleotide sequences are amplified through a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) reaction. Data is then generated using normalized protein expression (NPX) values on a log2 scale whereby a higher NPX correlates with higher protein expression.

The levels of antibodies are expressed as fold changes based on LIPS measurements (LU): antibody FC = LU sample / mean (LU of 5 healthy control samples). Olink's protein levels are represented as normalized protein expression (NPX) units, which are inherently in Log2 scale then Log2 was also taken from Legendplex values to keep the similar range. Statistical significance was determined using two-sample Wilcoxon test (also known as Mann-Whitney test). The significance symbols on boxplots are: * = adj. P \u2264 0.05, ** = adj. P \u2264 0.01, *** = adj. P \u2264 0.001 and **** = adj. P \u2264 0.0001. Bonferroni correction was used for all statistical and correlation tests. In addition, because OLINK contains many highly correlated proteins, the number of independent components from PCA that explained 99% of variance was obtained and subsequently used for adjusting p-values. Correlation analysis was done using Spearman's rank correlation except for Figs. 1J and 4B-M were Pearson correlation was used. Local regression was used to express relationship between variables on all figures except in Figs. 1J and 4B-M were linear regression was used instead. Cluster analysis based on Euclidean distance and subsequent visualizations as heatmaps were done using R package pheatmap 34 .",
