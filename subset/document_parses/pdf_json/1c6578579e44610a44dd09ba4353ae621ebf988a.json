For this purpose, public sentiment on social media and digital ecosystems in Spain is analyzed. We identified affective tones towards media and citizens published on social media focusing on six basic emotions: anger, fear, joy, sadness, disgust and uncertainty. The main contribution of this work is the evidence of contagious sentiments and, consequently, the possibility of using this new dimension of social media as a form of a \"collective therapy\". This paper contributes to understanding the impact of confinement measures in a pandemic from the point of view of emotional health. This analysis provides a set of practical implications that can guide conceptual and empirical work in health crisis management with an alternative approach, especially useful for decision-making processes facing emergency responses and health crises, even in an unprecedented global health crisis such as the traumatic events caused by the COVID-19 disease.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 global pandemic in March 2020. Although this kind of respiratory disease had already caused both widespread death and cases of infections in Wuhan (China) since 2019, the health crisis did not show its true dimensions in Europe up until February and March 2020. From then on, the race to combat the virus escalated worldwide. Spain was one of the countries most affected by COVID-19, establishing a nationwide state of alarm on March 14, 2020. Consequently, the social distancing, self-isolation and quarantine measures in Spain were radical and without precedent; such as the strict stay-at-home instruction for most of the citizens lasting almost two months, and ending with a progressive de-confinement process starting in the first week of May 2020.",

Moreover, the continuous black line represents the first hierarchical level, and the dashed dotted lines represent the second hierarchical level. official press tends to exhibit a more neutral emotion; therefore, the communications around these topics focus around discussion of facts and less intense emotional opinions. The linear smooth kernel regression of the emotional response time series using the Epanechnikov quadratic kernel is shown in Figure 2 . The horizontal axis represents the number of days that passed from the start of the study (9 March 2020) and the vertical axis represents the strength of the emotion, normalized from 0 to 1; where 0 is the lowest emotional intensity and 1 is the highest emotional intensity. Moreover, the continuous black line represents the first hierarchical level, and the dashed dotted lines represent the second hierarchical level. The ratio of communications in isolation increased coinciding with the declaration of the state of alarm in Spain, this increment is slightly faster than that of general communications about the COVID-19 disease.",

Secondly, those concerning lockdown, including self-isolation, confinement, home, family and going out. Thirdly, there are topics that show society's concerns due to the uncertainty of the situation and its consequences, such as money, work, hunger, help and world. Lastly, there were other topics that could not be classified within the first three groups, such as gratitude, donations, personal protection equipment and solidarity. Moreover, it should be noted that, when considering daily usage of Twitter hashtags during the pandemic, some of the most widely used during the study period were #yomequedoencasa (I am staying at home) and #quedatencasa (stay at home) with the intention of urging people to stay at home. The effect of these kinds of conversations in social media can also be appreciated in Figure 3 , as the frequency of words such as \"cuarentena\" (quarantine) and \"casa\" (home) are very high.

Previous literature has addressed this issue by focusing on economic and financial crisis impacts [6] and how media content studies have been applied in health crisis management, which have been observed more from the communication point of view and more specifically through a public relations lens [1, 4] . Although some authors have already pointed out that feelings expressed in online conversations can be contagious both in a positive [9, 15] and a negative way [11] [12] [13] , this work covers the gap by analyzing the public's sentiments in digital ecosystems as a health issue. The emotional reactions detected were in line with the general sentiment captured by the analysis of Thelwall et al. [8] and Neubaum and Kr\u00e4mer [10] . The commentaries featured in online conversations highlight the societal impact and health implications of the pandemic as well as their implications in the global health crisis. Additionally, it coincides with Thelwall et al. [8] that sentiment detection in social media is challenging and can provide an interesting insight into facing the crisis, especially for those institutions with competences in this field. In any event, there are a few literature works focused on monitoring sentiments in social media [9, [11] [12] [13] 15] but not many through a health lens [5, 7] while taking into account the usefulness of analysis in health crisis management by considering all the responsible actors.",

Furthermore, the driver of these emotions evolved and shifted during the stages of the confinement. The results of this study provide a snapshot of the emotional response of the Spanish population during the COVID-19 isolation. Likewise, a repository of emotional content of an unprecedented outbreak is provided. Furthermore, it reveals that social media can be a form of \"social therapy\" and a suitable approach for health crisis communication. This research responds to the lack of research at the intersection of emotional responses during crisis situations and, particularly to those related to public health and social media. Moreover, the findings of this study provide valuable insights based on the repository of emotional content of a traumatic event such as the COVID-19. The findings of this research are useful for encouraging health institutions to improve the management of social media and digital ecosystems during a health crisis; and to polish decision-making processes facing emergency responses.",
