            "text": "Preclinical mouse models that recapitulate some characteristics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will facilitate focused study of pathogenesis and virus-host responses. Human agniotensinconverting enzyme 2 (hACE2) serves as an entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to infect people via binding to envelope spike proteins. Herein we report development and characterization of a rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model. C57BL/6J (B6) mice expressing hACE2 in the lung were transduced by oropharyngeal delivery of the recombinant human adenovirus type 5 that expresses hACE2 (Ad5-hACE2). Mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at Day 4 after transduction and developed interstitial pneumonia associated with perivascular inflammation, accompanied by significantly higher viral load in lungs at Days 3, 6, and 12 after infection compared with Ad5-empty control group. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pneumocytes in alveolar septa. Transcriptomic analysis of lungs demonstrated that the infected Ad5-hACE mice had a significant increase in IFN-dependent chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, and genes associated with effector T-cell populations including Cd3 g, Cd8a, and Gzmb. Pathway analysis showed that several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were enriched in the data set, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the chemokine signaling pathway, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the measles pathway, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. This response is correlative to clinical response in lungs of patients with COVID-19. These results demonstrate that expression of hACE2 via adenovirus delivery system sensitized the mouse to SARS-CoV-2 infection and resulted in the development of a mild COVID-19 phenotype, highlighting the immune and inflammatory host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model is useful for preclinical and pathogenesis studies of COVID-19.",

Our current understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and host interaction with SARS-CoV-2 in humans remains limited and is based primarily upon clinical observations and a few autopsy findings (1). A better understanding of the pathogenesis and host-virus interaction will inform on the development of tractable treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19 (1) . Development of animal models that recapitulate characteristics of human COVID-19 facilitates preclinical studies for medical product development and our overall understanding of disease pathogenesis.

            "text": "A recent study demonstrates that ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas dogs have low susceptibility, and livestock (e.g., pigs, chickens, and ducks) possess essentially no susceptibility (6) . SARS-CoV-2 only replicates in the nasal turbinate, soft palate, and tonsils of ferrets, unlike SARS-CoV (the virus that caused pandemic SARS), which replicates in both the upper and lower respiratory tract of ferrets (6) . Syrian hamsters, in contrast, develop a mild to moderate clinical syndrome and mild lung pathology when experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 (7) . Several laboratories across the world have recently demonstrated a highly reproducible COVID-19 model in the rhesus macaque (Mucaca mulatta), with evidence of virus replication and shedding in the mucosa accompanied by mild to moderate clinical signs of disease (5) . A recent study using SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection protects against reinfection (8) , suggesting that immunologic approaches for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be possible (8) . Although these animal models do not fully recapitulate the severe form of COVID-19, many of the preclinical disease models are being used for assessment and evaluation studies of vaccine and therapeutic candidates and to elucidate basic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regardless, small animal models are needed in light of the paucity of NHPs and limited space in biocontainment facilities to perform studies on NHPs in large numbers for COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. There is a pressing need to develop an appropriate mouse model because of the potential for high-throughput studies, as well as the accessibility of a large number of molecularly engineered mouse models and the ease of further genetic manipulation (1). Wild-type outbred mouse strains are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection (9) . Although human agniotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) serves as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 via binding to its envelope spike (S) proteins, the murine equivalent ACE2 does not provide similar viral entry (2, 10-13). SARS-CoV-2's S protein has a greater affinity to bind to ACE2 than SARS-CoV's S protein (14) (15) (16) (17) . Transgenic expression of hACE2 in mice sensitizes the mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to development of a mild COVID-19 phenotype including interstitial pneumonia and elevated cytokines (9, 18) . This model is applicable for preclinical and pathogenicity studies of COVID-19. However, to examine the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying COVID-19, hACE2 must be introduced to various molecularly engineered mouse strains for specific scientific interests. This would be most commonly accomplished via the timeconsuming process of breeding multiple generations. Rapidly deployable COVID-19 models would facilitate large-scale in vivo screening of preclinical vaccine and therapeutic candidates. Accordingly, we used an adenovirus gene delivery system to express SARS-CoV-2's receptor, hACE2, in the lung (Ad5-hACE2). Lung expression of hACE2 sensitizes the Ad5-hACE2 mouse to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These mice develop moderate to severe interstitial, perivascular inflammation, with evidence of SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumocytes in alveolar septa and a host immune response characteristic of COVID-19. Collectively, this work constitutes the development of a rapidly deployable murine COVID-19 model by viral vector delivery of hACE2 to the lung in an otherwise nonsusceptible mouse strain.",

We infected mice at 4 days pt with SARS-CoV-2 (intranasal delivery of 2 3 10 5 TCID 50 per mouse) ( Figure 1A ). Infected Ad5-hACE2 mice had several log-fold higher SARS-CoV-2 loads in the lungs than Ad5-empty mice at 3, 6, and 12 days post infection (dpi) ( Figures 1C and E1 in the data supplement). In the infected Ad5-hACE2 mice, the viral load in the lung reached the highest level at 3 dpi and gradually declined from 3 to 12 dpi to a level that was still significantly higher than infected Ad5-empty mice ( Figure 1C ). We did not detect any significant difference in viral loads in the livers and intestines of infected Ad5-hACE2 and Ad5-empty mice. Furthermore, using immunohistochemistry, we detected SARS-CoV-2 virus in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected Ad5-hACE2 but not Ad5-empty mice at 3 dpi (Figure 2A) . Similarly, infectious virus was isolated from lungs of three of four Ad5-hACE2 but not Ad5-empty mice killed at 3 dpi assessed by plaque assay (titer ranging from 0 to 1,332 PFU/ml in the Ad5-hACE2 mice) ( Figure 2B ) whereas the sgmRNA encoding the viral E protein was likewise amplified from lungs of three of four Ad5-hACE2 (ranging from 0 to 3.7 log viral RNA copies/100 ng of total RNA) but not Ad5-empty mice with the level of sgmRNA associated strongly with the PFU titer ( Figure 2C ). We also detected sgmRNA from lungs of three of four and one of four Ad5-hACE2 but not Ad5-empty mice at 6 and 12 dpi, respectively ( Figure 2C ). Unexpectedly, live virus was not detected in lung from one Ad5-hACE2 mouse at 3 dpi and sgmRNA was not detected in lungs from one Ad5-hACE2 mouse at 3 and 6 dpi. These data could be due to inherent variability associated with detecting live virus or viral RNA in a solid tissue sample, suboptimal storage of the samples, or another reason. Nonetheless, these results indicate that lung expression of hACE2 sensitizes the mouse to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infected Ad5-hACE2 mice developed more severe lesions in lungs than infected Ad5-empty mice at 3, 6, and 12 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, namely, interstitial and perivascular inflammation associated with infiltration of large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages ( Figures 3A,  3B , and 3C). Lesion development began at 3 dpi, reached peak level at 6 dpi, and partially resolved at 12 dpi ( Figure 3D ). We found no histological changes in other organs including liver, kidney, intestine, heart, and brain in Ad5-hACE2 and Ad5empty mice ( Figure E2 ). There were no significant differences in body weight, blood cell counts, or serum chemical measurements between the two groups ( Figures E3 and E4 ). Of note, the Ad5-hACE2 mice infected with three different doses of SARS-CoV-2 (5 3 10 4 , 1 3 10 5 , or 2 3 10 5 , TCID 50 ) also developed mild or moderate interstitial and perivascular inflammation in the lungs ( Figure E5 ). (Figures 4 and E6) . We found a large number of hACE2-positive cells in the lung of SARS-CoV-2-infected Ad5-hACE2 mice at 3 dpi ( Figure 4A, left panel) . Interestingly, among the total SARS-CoV-2-positive regions (i.e., a group of positive cells), 75% exhibited colocalization with hACE2-positive cells ( Figure 4A ). The fact that the overlap was not 100% could be attributed to the downregulation of hACE2 to undetectable levels owing to the internalization of SARS-CoV-2 with its receptor hACE2 during infection (1), a notion that warrants further investigation. We also detected T cells and macrophages in the lung of the Ad5-hACE2 but not Ad5-empty mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 3 dpi, resulting in moderate to severe interstitial and perivascular inflammation. However, no staining of T cells or macrophages with SARS-CoV-2 was noted ( Figure E6 ). Interestingly, we found SARS-CoV-2-positive pneumocytes in alveolar septa with Pan-CK 1 ( Figure 4B ). Among the total SARS-CoV-2-positive regions, we detected z25% that were positive and colocalized with Pan-CK-positive cells ( Figure 4B, left) . Extensive spike RNA was detected by RNAscope in the interstitial areas of infected Ad5-hACE2 at 3 dpi but not Ad5empty mice at 3 and 6 dpi ( Figure 5A ). Specific RNA probes for spike RNA and mouse Hopx (homeobox only protein x) were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pneumocytes (22, 23) ( Figure 5B ). Consistently, we also found that there were SARS-CoV-2-S RNA and Hopx RNA double-positive cells and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive cells in the infected Ad5-hACE2 mice at 3 dpi ( Figure 5B ). Taken together, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can infect pneumocytes, which may contribute to the development of the interstitial and perivascular inflammation seen in SARS-CoV-2-infected Ad5-hACE2 mice. This finding is consistent with the current view that the majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are pneumocytes (1, 20) . However, given that only 25% of the SARS-CoV-2-infected regions were composed of pneumocytes, our data also indicate that other cell types may be susceptible to infection.",

            "text": "These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 in the Ad5-empty mice did not infect pneumocytes or cause interstitial pneumonia owing to lack of the hACE2 receptor in Ad5-empty mice for viral replication, which further supports the role of hACE2 in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection in transduced mice. Two recently published reports demonstrated that hACE2-transduced mice in two different mouse strains, including B6 and BALB/c generated by similar approaches, were productively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and this resulted in high viral titers in the lung, corresponding pathology, and weight loss (27, 28) . Furthermore, using this approach, they demonstrated that 1) type I IFN, T cells, and STAT1 signaling are critical for viral clearance and disease resolution in these mice (28) and 2) passive transfer of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody reduced viral burden in the lung and mitigated COVID-19 phenotypes in the infected mice (27) . Our results reported here further confirm this approach to generate a rapidly deployable COVID-19 model. Of note, we did not observe the same clinical changes (weight loss) in our transduced mice. This may be attributed to the different Ad5-hACE2 titer resulting in different hACE2 levels in the transduced mice, different SARS-CoV-2 viral titer, the different strains of mice, or different environmental conditions in the animal facility causing a difference in microbiome (known to differ between animal houses) important in dictating resistance to COVID19. This difference notwithstanding, our results further confirm recently reported findings that lung expression of hACE2 sensitizes mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lung histological changes in these rapidly deployable COVID-19 models seen by us and others (27, 28) are comparable with recently published observations in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2 transgenic mice (9, 18) . Transgenic expression of hACE2 in mice also sensitizes them to SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to a mild COVID-19 phenotype, interstitial pneumonia, and elevated cytokines (9, 18) . We further characterized the phenotype of the cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the lung, an aspect of infection that has not been investigated previously in any animal models (6, 8, 9, 18, 27) . Our costaining and RNAscope results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infects pneumocytes, which contributes to the development of interstitial pneumonia seen in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected Ad5-hACE2 mice. The finding of SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumocytes directly supports the current view that SARS-CoV-2 mainly targets and infects pneumocytes (1, 20, 21) . In addition, our model developed not only moderate to severe interstitial but also perivascular inflammation in alveolar septa. This distinctive vascular injury in the lung has been noted but not characterized in a SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2 transgenic line (18) . This finding is consistent with a recent clinical observation (29) showing that the histologic pattern of patients that died from severe COVID-19 included diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T-cell infiltration in the peripheral lung (29) . The affected lung also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes (29) .",

Supportively, a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic analysis of viral antigen-reactive CD4 1 T cells from 32 patients with COVID-19 showed increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper cells and cytotoxic T-helper cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with severe disease compared with those with mild disease (31) .

Previous clinical studies indicate that from the onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, the level of T lymphocytes gradually increased during the disease course in nonsevere patients and was always significantly higher than patients with severe illness (26) . The time of recovery of T-lymphocyte count was approximately consistent with the clinical course (26) . This indicates that the robust adaptive immune response stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to disease recovery or progression, which warrants further investigation.",

            "text": "A great strength of using the adenovirus delivery system for expressing hACE2 in mice is the immediate capability of conducting pathogenesis and preclinical studies in any given genetic background and molecularly engineered mouse strains. Specifically, this rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model recapitulates numerous important characteristics of COVID-19 disease to inform preclinical studies (37) . Indeed, passive transfer of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody has been documented to reduce viral burden in the lung and mitigate inflammation and weight loss using a similar model (27) . Ad5-hACE2transduced mice also enabled rapid assessments of a vaccine candidate, of human convalescent plasma, and of antiviral therapies (poly I:C and remdesivir) (9) . Our results showed that after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Ad5-hACE2 mice developed histological changes and immune infiltration associated with the viral load in the lung within 6 dpi. This disease course is comparable with previously published mouse COVID-19 models (6, 8, 9, 27) . Based on these reproducible results, we suggest that this rapidly deployable model can serve as an in vivo screening tool for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Therefore, this model can be used to measure the viral load and subgenomic RNA via RT-PCR, analyze the virus in the lung with immunochemistry, and monitor histological changes and immune cell infiltration in the lung for determining the efficacy of the candidate vaccines and therapeutics. This rapidly deployable COVID-19 model should be useful for studying SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology. However, owing to their local and temporally limited expression of hACE2, it is conceivable that while considering and designing experiments to explore the impact of SARS-2 infection on other organs such as heart, brain, and kidney, the Ad5-hACE2 mice would be less favorable than transgenic hACE2 mice (9) . Clearly, there is an urgent need for such a small rodent model for highthroughput studies testing therapeutic interventions and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lung. n",
