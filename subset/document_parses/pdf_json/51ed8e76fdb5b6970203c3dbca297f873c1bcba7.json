In December of 2019, the first cases of COVID-19 were seen in the Wuhan province of China, and by January of 2020, COVID-19 had spread throughout the world, including the United States [1] . Shortly thereafter, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and a national emergency in the United States [1] . The pandemic was associated with a multitude of negative outcomes in terms of physical and mental health [2, 3] . With respect to mental health, lower psychological well-being, and higher anxiety and depression, were reported when compared to pre-pandemic levels [4] . With a costly death toll, public health guidance was central to slow the spread of the coronavirus.",

            "text": "Given the widespread psychosocial and health impacts of COVID-19, it is important to identify modifiable transdiagnostic processes; that is, processes that are applicable across diagnoses that can be targeted in future intervention and prevention research. In the United States, China, and Germany, researchers found that high levels of psychological distress were associated with COVID-19, and have emphasized the importance of understanding the psychological processes underlying distress [7, 8] . A transdiagnostic process that centers on a person's response to distress-psychological flexibility-has demonstrated associations with distress, as well as other adverse psychological outcomes [9] . Psychological flexibility consists of three components: behavioral awareness, openness to experiences, and engagement [9] . Openness to experiences describes a willingness to have uncomfortable internal experiences when related to personal values; behavioral awareness describes intentionally paying attention to internal experiences, context, and behavior; and engagement describes making choices that align with personally chosen values [9] . In a study that focused on psychological flexibility in the context of COVID-19, researchers found that participants that scored lower on components of psychological flexibility, including openness to experiences and behavioral awareness, were also found to experience higher general distress [10] . During the nationwide lockdown in Italy, researchers examined the impact of psychological flexibility on health anxiety and found that psychological flexibility mitigated the detrimental effects of the lockdown on mental health [11] . Although psychological flexibility has been investigated in the context of mental health during the pandemic, it has not been examined as a predictor of public health behaviors that impact global communities. This is particularly important given the implications for the most vulnerable in these communities. Understanding psychological flexibility, along with psychological distress, may provide important insights related to adherence with public health guidelines aimed to slow the spread of COVID-19.",

Given established concerns with inattentive and non-human responders, authors took several measures to ensure human participants and to screen for attentive responding. Completion by participants in suspicious geolocations was prevented by CloudResearch. Participants enrolled through Amazon's Mechanical Turk, where they were required to have completed at least 100 HITs and to have at least a 95% approval rating in order to establish a record of reliable completion. Participants who met eligibility criteria selected the study from a list of available HITs and were provided with a link to the survey through CloudResearch, which was hosted through Qualtrics, a secure survey platform. The first page of the survey was a consent letter notifying participants that if they clicked forward, they were indicating their consent to participate. Written informed consent was waived, and approval was received by the University IRB. Participants completed a series of assessments on Qualtrics in May of 2020 for the baseline assessment (n = 485). This was followed by two surveys in June and July 2020. Voluntary participation was emphasized at each time point with a consent summary. The outcome variables in the present analyses were collected in July 2020 (n = 265), and predictors were collected in June 2020 (n = 360); 95 participants dropped out between time points. Within the survey, attention check items were included to screen for automatic or inattentive responding. Participants that answered attention checks incorrectly were not included in the analyses. A Google reCAPTCHA item was the first question following consent, and if incomplete, the survey would not proceed.",

Given that mask-wearing was recommended in public places 100% of the time by the CDC and WHO, mask-wearing was operationalized as whether a person reported wearing a face mask 100% of the time in public places, and responses were coded categorically. Close contacts were assessed with a question reading \"In the last week, how many people have you come in close contact with (within 6 feet)? This includes relatives, neighbors, delivery workers, shoppers, or strangers.\" For the current analyses, data were recoded categorically to represent 10 or fewer contacts in the past 7 days, as compared to 11 or more contacts. The reason for this split between 10 or fewer contacts and 11 or more contacts was due to the CDC guidelines established in 2020 that advised limiting gatherings to 10 or fewer individuals [5] .",

These guidelines included wearing a face (mouth and nose) covering when in public, physical distancing (keeping a distance of at least six feet from others while in public), and avoiding public gatherings (i.e., not going to non-essential events/areas that could contribute to the spread of COVID-19). However, adherence to these guidelines varied [6] , and the available literature to account for the variability is limited. In Poland, researchers examined the role of personality traits and individual differences as related to perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and compliance with the guidelines set in Poland [16] , finding that perception of the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic played a larger role in variability in compliance than personality traits. This may relate to the result indicating that lower openness to experiences related to lower likelihood of mask-wearing, such that one behavioral indication of low openness to experiences is rule-following behavior or compliance with socially desirable behaviors [9] . The aversive emotions that one may experience when not complying with socially normative and, at times, legally mandated behavior may present a substantial deterrent to non-adherence. This same behavior (mask-wearing) could also serve a values-based function, however, if one connected this behavior to a personal value (e.g., health, community).",

Lower levels of empathy were also identified in a Brazilian study with compliance as an outcome [17] . In a sample of individuals from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, empathy related to increased motivation to wear face masks and adhere to physical distancing, and compliance increased when empathy was induced experimentally for those most vulnerable to the most serious consequences of COVID-19 [18] . Empathy can change in accordance with developmental changes and is therapeutically modifiable [19] . Both empathy and perspective-taking are important factors that impact one's behavioral awareness [20, 21] . The identification of both therapeutically modifiable and transdiagnostic processes is critical in the development of targeted interventions that increase the likelihood of adherence to public health behaviors amidst COVID-19. As such, there is opportunity for these constructs to work together under the umbrella of psychological flexibility. For example, a person might become aware of the impact of their behavior on personal and community health, and if either is held as a personal value, they may alter their behavior accordingly, even in the presence of difficult emotions, thoughts, or sensations. Furthermore, while remaining in the present moment and attending to changes in context, they may choose to change behavior as the circumstances change, such as wearing a mask in a hospital but not when outdoors. The findings herein emphasize that behavioral awareness is a particularly important component of psychological flexibility across the adherence variables examined in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Other studies have further investigated psychological flexibility as it relates to the pandemic in different outcomes, as well as the potentially protective effects of psychological flexibility on mental health during the pandemic [26] [27] [28] [29] .

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a transdiagnostic psychotherapy that targets psychological flexibility as the key outcome through interventions focused on acceptance, mindfulness, and behavioral change [9] . As a transdiagnostic intervention, ACT applies across multiple syndromes and is designed for the human condition, not one disorder [9] . ACT targets behavioral awareness, which encourages participation in the present moment, regardless of potential mind-wandering [9] . Behavioral awareness and psychological flexibility more broadly are modifiable processes, and psychological flexibility mediates treatment-related outcomes [9] . In this way, individuals are able to learn how to more effectively respond to difficult situations, making them not only more equipped to handle future challenges, but to lessen the impact of these situations or events [9] .",

In a study focusing on the effectiveness of ACT in promoting physical activity, researchers found that study participants in the ACT group significantly increased their physical activity level in comparison to the education-only group [30] . Furthermore, after a telephone-based weight-loss program, the group that received ACT lost more weight when compared to controls [31] . One study focusing on the effect of ACT on diabetes self-management found that, compared to education alone, the group randomized to the ACT condition had overall improved outcomes related to diabetes self-management [32] . Overall, in a review of randomized controlled trials that focused on the effect of ACT on long-term lifestyle and behavioral changes, it was found that the results of the studies suggested that ACT helped to maintain long-term lifestyle and behavioral changes that included weight management, substance and addiction-related issues, and diet and physical activity [33] .",

News stories in the United States detailed protests of masks, and the issue became highly polarized. As such, the messaging around public health guidance may be particularly impactful, but individual differences in response styles may be a target for future interventions. ACT has promoted adherence in several other populations, and thus, may be an appropriate intervention as related to future public health behaviors. The present study indicates that behavioral awareness may be of particular importance in the context of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The findings should be considered along with several limitations. This study relied on self-report measures, which introduce social desirability biases that are relevant to adherence behaviors. However, adherence to public health guidelines could not be measured behaviorally or by collateral report during a time when limiting close contacts was encouraged or mandated. To increase likelihood of valid responses, surveys were entirely anonymous. Furthermore, the majority of the participants reported having a full-time job at the time of survey completion, which could lead participants to have other, external factors in mind, such as maintaining their job when responding to questions regarding mask usage and number of close contacts within the past week. Study participants who completed all of the assessments (as compared to those who did not complete all assessments) were more highly educated and more likely to be non-Hispanic, and our results may only generalize to a sample similar to this one. Additionally, study participants were recruited via MTurk. Data integrity concerns regarding MTurk have been previously stated due to the fact that non-human responders have been found to participate intermittently [34] . However, attention checks and Google reCAPTCHA were utilized in the present study in an effort to ensure valid, human responses. Furthermore, MTurk was utilized due to the ability to reach a more diverse sample, as researchers have found that MTurk samples are both more demographically diverse in comparison to typical internet samples, as well as American college samples [35, 36] . Additionally, there were external variables that were not controlled for, such as cultural beliefs that might vary by culture and community. Future research should examine cross-cultural adherence to public health guidelines, particularly in the context of a global pandemic. Furthermore, one of the key questions in this study focused on mask-wearing in public spaces, but as the study questions were answered via self-report, what an individual deemed as \"public\" could have been subjective and interpreted differently by participants. Additionally, income and relationship status were measured at the July 2020 timepoint, so these variables could not be included in the attrition analyses. Finally, there was participant attrition between time points, as 95 participants were lost been the June and July 2020 assessments; however, the study remained sufficiently powered for analyses.",

Two prominent and widespread behavioral changes in the United States included mask-wearing and limiting close contacts, which were directives issued by public health authorities early in the pandemic to slow community spread. Despite strong scientific evidence for each, adherence was variable, and the cost in human lives and health was high. The present study identified behavioral awareness as a key process that predicted greater odds of mask-wearing adherence and limiting close contacts. As a component of psychological flexibility, behavioral awareness represents the ability to stay in the moment and intentionally choose how to respond to changing contexts. This is a modifiable, transdiagnostic skill that can be improved through use of ACT and other mindfulness interventions. As such, behavioral awareness represents a possible target for future interventions to improve adherence behaviors, particularly those that impact not only one's own health, but the health of the global community.",
