            "text": "Hence, an interesting problem is whether the stochastic differential utilities can be developed to stochastic control problems with delay. The answer is positive, although most problems remain practically intractable due to the complex infinite-dimensional state-space framework. Here we name but a few existing results. For example, Larssen [15] obtained the dynamic programming principle in the systems of stochastic control with delay. In the stochastic delayed systems, Larssen-Risebro [16] studied a class of optimal consumption problems and presented the financial application of this kind of dynamic programming principle. Arriojas-Hu-Mohammed-Pap [1] got a delayed Black-Scholes formula. Fuhrman-Masiero-Tessitore [11] studied a forward-backward system with delay, its application to optimal stochastic control and regularity of associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB, for short) equations. Chen-Wu [4] was concerned with one kind of delayed stochastic recursive optimal control problem, proved the dynamic programming principle, and demonstrated that the value function is a viscosity solution of the corresponding HJB equation. Shi-Xu-Zhang [26] studied a general kind of stochastic differential delayed equations, obtained the stochastic maximal principle, and show the application to stochastic portfolio optimization model with delay and bounded memory. Tang-Zhang [27] obtained the dynamic programming principle in a pathdependent case and studied the associated path-dependent Bellman equations. Li-Wang-Wu [18] focused on a class of linear-quadratic optimal control for time-delay stochastic recursive utility. It should be pointed out that all the above-mentioned works concerning delayed systems are based on the condition of Lipschitz generator. While in many SDU models the generator is non-Lipschitz with respect to the utility and consumption, see (1.5) below for an important example.",

Lemma 4.6 displays that the value functions u n defined in (4.5) are uniformly convergent to the value function u defined in (3.1) in a compact subset of their domain. Based on the uniform convergence of g n , Y t,\u03b3,n;v , and u n to g, Y t,\u03b3;v , and u, respectively, it comes without a surprise in Lemma 4.7 that the Hamiltonians H n defined in (4.6) are convergent to H defined in (4.2) as well. To end the preparation, we prove the stability property of viscosity solutions in Lemma 4.8 in order to obtain the connection between the value function u defined in (3.1) and the viscosity solution of HJB equation (4.1) .

However, when the generator g also depends on z, the second one of solution pair, the result is still open, and we hope to solve it in near future.
