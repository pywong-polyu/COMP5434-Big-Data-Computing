Moreover, this condition disproportionately affects ethnic minorities and individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds, with Hispanic individuals experiencing both higher incidence of type 2 diabetes and poorer glycemic control than their white counterparts. 2 Diabetes is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the United States, 3 further highlighting the need for improved diabetes management, particularly among individuals from ethnic minorities or low socioeconomic status.",

            "text": "Project Dulce was launched in 1997 as a collaboration between San Diego State University, community clinics, and the county's public health department to deliver diabetes care and education to under-resourced and underserved populations throughout Southern California ( Figure 1 ). The project relied on a team-based approach with a nurse-led clinical team and nonprofessional peers trained to deliver culturally tailored classes in diabetes education. The peer education program was American Diabetes Association certified, included 8 2-hour sessions with a curriculum suitable for broad literacy levels, and was adapted for different ethnic groups and cultures. Project Dulce recruited 153 participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes over 2 years, 72% of whom identified as Hispanic. The cohort also included African American, Vietnamese American, and Filipino American individuals. The study group was 69% female with an average age of 51 years. Approximately two-thirds of participants had an annual income less than $10,000, and one-half had an eighth-grade education or less. The results of this program on diabetes care were impressive, demonstrating a 30% reduction in serum levels of HbA1c, 7% decrease in LDLcholesterol levels, subjective improvement in diabetes knowledge, positive treatment satisfaction, and a shift toward a stronger internal locus of control when compared to a control group receiving usual care. 4 Though in-person, culturally tailored diabetes selfmanagement education could empower patients and provide improved outcomes, requiring physical study visits was a barrier to accessibility. 7 Digital solutions can help circumvent these issues. To promote use among older and lowincome individuals and remain cognizant of the \"digital divide,\" the Dulce Digital project was developed to use a low-cost short messaging service (SMS) program that did not require a smart phone to provide educational and motivational text messages, medication reminders, and blood glucose monitoring reminders. 5 The messages were offered in either English or Spanish, with the majority choosing Spanish-language texts. The project also included a blood glucose monitoring protocol, which requested patients track their blood glucose values via texts to the study team, with markedly elevated values, low values, or no values prompting a call from research coordinators, who would encourage a follow-up with the individual's primary care physician. Like the parent Project Dulce project, most Dulce Digital participants identified as Hispanic or Mexican, had less than a ninth-grade education, and had a combined monthly household income of less than $2,000. After 6 months, Dulce Digital achieved a statistically significant 1% reduction in serum HbA1c compared with the usual care group. 5 Notably, there was a general trend toward a greater reduction in HbA1c levels among participants who had higher levels of engagement with the program. Participants reported high satisfaction with the program, demonstrating that a simple and low-cost SMS-based diabetes management program is effective in improving glycemic control in patients with diabetes compared to usual care. However, post-study surveys suggested that participants would have preferred more tailored messaging for purposes of enhancing individualized content that better addressed their own needs and progress. 5 A subsequent study, Dulce Digital-Me, is underway and will evaluate an adaptive approach to personalize text exchanges with patients based on wirelessly transmitted glucose values, pill box use, and ecological momentary assessments of physical activity, diet, and stress. 8, 9 A recent extension of these projects was born of the dire need for addressing the major healthcare barriers that have arisen owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Dulce Digital-COVID Aware (DD-CA) trial was launched amid the pandemic with the aim of reducing these barriers in diverse, underserved Hispanic communities, improving glucose control, and lowering transmission of COVID-19 after hospital discharge. Critically, DD-CA integrated COVID educational messaging into the glucose management text messaging to offer information about testing, exposure, and resources to a community disproportionately affected by the pandemic. 10 The primary outcome will look at the rate of readmission over the subsequent 30 days and secondary outcomes will assess the rate of readmission over 180 days as well as changes in level of HbA1c. This ongoing effort further demonstrates the wide range of opportunities to apply digital health tools to address gaps in chronic care of patients with diabetes and address acute public health issues among highly vulnerable populations.",
