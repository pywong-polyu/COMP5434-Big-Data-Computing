            "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 is especially severe in aged patients, defined as 65 years or older, for reasons that are currently unknown. To investigate the underlying basis for this vulnerability, we performed multimodal data analyses on immunity, inflammation, and COVID-19 incidence and severity as a function of age. Our analysis leveraged age-specific COVID-19 mortality and laboratory testing from a large COVID-19 registry, along with epidemiological data of ~3.4 million individuals, large-scale deep immune cell profiling data, and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from aged COVID-19 patients across diverse populations. To begin, we confirmed a significantly increased rate of severe outcomes in aged COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we identified increased inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and neutrophillymphocyte ratio), viral entry factors in secretory cells, and TGFb-mediated immuneepithelial cell interactions, as well as reduction in both na\u00efve CD8 T cells and expression of interferon antiviral defense genes (i.e., IFITM3 and TRIM22), along with strong TGFbeta mediated immune-epithelial cell interactions (i.e., secretory -T regulatory cells), in aged severe COVID-19 patients. Taken together, our findings point to immunoinflammatory factors that could be targeted therapeutically to reduce morbidity and mortality in aged COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), has been diagnosed in more than 170 million people globally, with 3.5 million deaths since December 2019 (data on May 31, 2021) . Although a serious risk at any age, SARS-CoV-2 infection is particularly debilitating and deadly for aged patients, defined in this study as 65 years and older 1,2,3,4,5 . The molecular basis of this aging-related vulnerability is an important area of investigation as it is currently poorly understood. Impaired and dysregulated host immunity, including both innate and adaptive immunity, have been hypothesized as age-based factors in COVID-19 disease severity 4, 6 . Compared to younger individuals with COVID-19, aged individuals show disrupted antigen-specific adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, such as reduced coordination of CD4-CD8 T cell responses 7 . In addition, aged individuals typically produce a less robust type I interferon (IFN) response to flu virus infections 8 , indicating compromised cellular antiviral defense in innate immunity. Indeed, 13% of aged patients with life-threatening COVID-19 display inborn errors in autoantibodies against type I IFN immunity 9 . In addition, aberrant immunosenescence and inflammation also play crucial roles in age-medicated COVID-19 morbidity and mortality 10 . For example, senescent cells become hyper-inflammatory in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and senolytics reduce COVID-19-mortality in aged mice 11 . Based on these findings, we sought to systematically identify whether there are specific immunoinflammatory determinants that promote age-associated COVID-19 severity.",

Analysis of U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) epidemiological data from March to December, 2020 (Supplementary Tables 1-3 ) revealed that 80.5% of fatal-cases occurred in aged patients. Strikingly, this rate was 4.1 times higher than in 18-64 years old (19.5%), and 1,653 times higher than in 0-17 years old (0.05%, Fig. 1a) . Fatality prevalence was influenced by sex in both older and younger groups (Fig. 1b) . Notably, the relative fatality prevalence trend across these same three age groups from 2010-2020 with influenza virus was similar, (Fig. 1a) ,",

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection 26 (UMAP) revealed 5 distinct CD8 sub-clusters (Fig. 3a, b) , including na\u00efve CD8, T central memory (Tcm), Tem, CD8-proliferation, and CD8 T effector. Comparing to severe young COVID-19 patients, up-regulated genes (q < 0.05, log fold change > 0.1) in CD8 na\u00efve T cells from aged patients formed a network module (the largest connected component) in the human protein-protein interactome (Fig. 3c) . This agespecific network module was significantly enriched in several pathways, including apoptosis (q = 0.013), human T cell leukemia virus 1 infection (q = 0.013), and TNF signaling (q = 0.014, Fig. 3c ). In particular, the apoptosis gene cathepsin D 27 (CTSD) was highly expressed in na\u00efve CD8 T cells from aged severe COVID-19 patients (q < 2.0 x 10 -16 ). Down-regulated genes, such as interferon-stimulated genes IFITM3 and TRIM22, in CD8 na\u00efve T cells from aged COVID-19 patients were enriched in type I & II IFN signaling pathways (Fig. 3c) . In addition, the transcription factor STAT1, an important downstream factor in type I & II IFN signaling pathways 28 , was downregulated in CD8 na\u00efve T cells in aged COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3c) . Notably, the SARS-CoV-1 NSP1 protein impedes type I & II IFN signaling 29 by attenuating STAT1 phosphorylation 30 . Thus, IFN deficiencies in CD8 na\u00efve T cells may contribute to increased severity of COVID-19 disease in aged patients.",

In aged patients with critical COVID-19, expression of BSG was increased in secretory, rMa and CTL cells, and elevated expression of FURIN was found in Treg and CTL cells.

Based on our aging criteria, the final subpopulation included 32 aged patients (mild/moderate, n = 20; critical/severe, n = 12) and 40 younger patients (mild/moderate, n = 27; critical/severe, n = 13). Second, a single cell dataset from nasal tissues 36 Bulk RNA-sequencing dataset in nasal tissue 31 . The dataset was publically available from NCBI GEO database (GSE152075). Based on original meta-information, we extracted COVID-19 positive sample data with high or low viral load, deleting samples in which sex and age information were missing. 147 bulk RNA-seq samples were used in this study, including 61 aged patients (high viral load n = 27, low viral load n =34) and 86 younger patients (high viral load n = 46, low viral load n =40).",
