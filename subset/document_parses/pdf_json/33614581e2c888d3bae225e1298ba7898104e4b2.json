Finally, we seek to examine whether either factor (DC-SIGN as a receptor and KSHV-gH as a glycoprotein) dictates the susceptibility of any specific B cell subsets to KSHV infection. Our results demonstrate that both DC-SIGN and gH are dispensable for infection of tonsil-derived B lymphocytes and suppression of these factors does not substantially alter KSHV tropism in B lymphocytes. Interestingly, by working with these two factors in combination, we are able to establish that KSHV has two mechanisms for entry into the centrocyte subset: one dependent on gH and the other dependent on DC-SIGN. Taken together, our results reveal that mechanisms of KSHV entry into B lymphocytes are complex, multi-factoral and subset-specific.",

Surprisingly, these results revealed increased KSHV infection at 3 dpi in most samples (Figure 2a) . In order to account for the variable susceptibility of tonsil samples to KSHV infection in our model [5] , we analyzed these data as a change in GFP using controls with no antibody treatment as a normalization factor. In this analysis we can clearly see that the majority of tonsils included in this analysis show increased infection in response to DC-SIGN neutralization, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.02) at the 5 \u00b5g/mL dose (Figure 2b ). In order to determine whether the increase in GFP+ B cells with DC-SIGN neutralization was due to increased frequency or targeting of a specific B cell subtype, we performed subset analysis on these samples. Analysis of overall subset frequencies (infected and uninfected) in these cultures at 3 dpi revealed that most subsets did not change with DC-SIGN neutralization in either the Mock or KSHV-infected conditions ( Figure S2 ). However, we did observe a statistically significant increase in the CD138+ plasma cell population at the 5 \u00b5g/mL dose only in the KSHV-infected conditions (Figure 2c ). This observation is particularly interesting given our recent publication showing that plasma cells are highly targeted by KSHV early in infection [5] .",

In order to examine this, we plotted the change in frequency of GFP within B cell subsets against overall change in GFP frequency at the 5\u00b5g/mL neutralizing antibody dose and calculated correlation coefficients via the Pearson method (Figure 2e) . Although power analysis indicates that these correlations are not strong enough to be statistically significant with this sample number, we observe that samples with increased GFP also displayed increased proportions of infected plasma, MZ-like and memory B cell subsets. These observations indicate that these particular subsets do not depend upon DC-SIGN for KSHV entry. We hypothesized that DC-SIGN neutralization was increasing overall infection by increasing targeting of B cell subsets that undergo lytic replication, thereby acting as a point of expansion for the virus. To test this hypothesis, we performed RT-PCR analysis for LANA (a latent gene) and K8.1 (a lytic gene) on eight unique tonsil specimens with and without DC-SIGN neutralization at 5 \u00b5g/mL. These results show that there is no difference in lytic gene expression between untreated cultures and cultures treated withDC-SIGN neutralizing antibodies (Figure 2f ).

            "text": "We recently showed that a mutant KSHV virus lacking gH, is globally defective for entry into adherent cell lines including epithelial, endothelial and fibroblast cell lines but was still able to infect the MC116 lymphoma cell line [6] . These results suggest that gH may be dispensable for entry into B cells. In order to test this hypothesis in our primary tonsil lymphocyte system, we utilized the same mutant virus that was constructed for this previous study (KSHV-\u2206gH). We performed infections with 7 unique tonsil lymphocyte samples using KSHV-WT, KSHV-\u2206gH and Mock infection as described above, and assessed the distribution of KSHV infection at 3 dpi using flow cytometry. It should be noted that because KSHV-\u2206gH cannot infect fibroblasts we cannot use our normal system for functional titration of the virus stock to normalize infection. Thus, for these experiments we performed titration of the KSHV-WT stock as usual on fibroblasts to determine the optimal infectious dose, and then used genome quantitation of both KSHV-WT and KSHV-\u2206gH virus stocks in order to calculate an equivalent genome dose for KSHV-\u2206gH. These results reveal that KSHV-\u2206gH infects tonsil-derived B cells at levels comparable to those seen with KSHV-WT. Interestingly, four of seven tonsil samples showed higher levels of GFP+ B lymphocytes in KSHV-\u2206gH compared to WT (Figure 3a) . We wanted to determine whether the difference in infection efficiency with KSHV-WT vs. KSHV-\u2206gH was related to the levels of B cell subsets in the tonsil samples at the time of infection. To do this analysis, we calculated the difference between the percent of GFP+ B cells with each virus on a per-sample basis (KSHV-\u2206gH minus KSHV-WT) and compared this value to the sample-specific baseline frequency of each B cell subset. These data reveal that KSHV-\u2206gH infectivity is highly correlated with baseline levels of double negative B cells (an atypical memory B cell subtype), but that KSHV-\u2206gH had lower infectivity in samples with high levels of transitional B cells (Figure 3b) . These results may suggest that KSHV infection of transitional B cells relies more heavily upon gH-dependent entry mechanisms compared to entry into double negative B cells. When we examined the distribution of GFP within B cell subsets at 3 dpi for these experiments, we found that there was no significant difference in B cell targeting between KSHV-WT and KSHV-\u2206gH (Figure 3c ). Finally, we wanted to determine whether the distribution of B cell subsets within the infected (GFP+) fraction was different between KSHV-WT and KSHV-\u2206gH. This analysis showed that there was also no significant difference between KSHV-WT and KSHV-\u2206gH infection (Figure 3d) . Thus, neither the amount of infection within any B cell subset nor the proportion of B cell subsets within the infected fraction differed between KSHV-WT and KSHV-\u2206gH. Taken together, these results indicate that KSHV-\u2206gH (a virus which is globally defective in non-B cell types) can infect primary B cells, and displays similar infectivity and B cell subset tropism when compared to KSHV-WT. We would conclude from these data that overall susceptibility of individual tonsil specimens to infection with KSHV-\u2206gH is dependent upon the B cell composition of the specimen, suggesting that gH does play a role in entry into B lymphocytes. However, gH is not strictly required for KSHV entry into any B cell subset, suggesting that this glycoprotein does not play a pivotal role in KSHV infection of B lymphocytes in human tonsil. ",

            "text": "In order to examine whether KSHV-\u2206gH interacts with DC-SIGN to enter into B lymphocytes and to validate our earlier DC-SIGN neutralization data ( Figure 2 ) via another method, we performed experiments with 6 unique tonsil specimens where we isolated total B lymphocytes and performed a second step where we separated DC-SIGN+ and DC-SIGN-B cells. Because DC-SIGN+ cells represent a minor population in tonsil B cells (Figure 1a ) we did not have sufficient cell numbers to infect the populations separately. Therefore, we adopted a strategy where we either infected DC-SIGN-depleted populations or reconstituted the depleted population with DC-SIGN+ B cells prior to infection. Analysis of KSHV infection in these cultures revealed that KSHV-WT infection is uniformly higher in DC-SIGN reconstituted cultures compared to DC-SIGN depleted cultures. This trend was similar in KSHV-\u2206gH infected cultures with the exception of one tonsil sample in which infection was increased in reconstituted culture for KSHV-WT and decreased in the same condition with KSHV-\u2206gH ( Figure 4a ). Next, we examined the distribution of GFP within B cell subsets for DC-SIGN depleted vs. reconstituted cultures in order to determine whether DC-SIGN is required for entry into any particular B cell subset. Consistent with our neutralization data, depletion of DC-SIGN did not abolish infection of any B cell subsets with KSHV-WT. Consistent with our previous analysis ( Figure 3 ) there was no statistically significant difference in infection comparing WT to \u2206gH for either depleted or reconstituted fractions. For KSHV-WT, although infection of most subsets tended to be higher in the reconstituted fractions, there was no significant difference between DC-SIGN depleted and reconstituted cultures for any subset with KSHV-WT. Results were similar for KSHV-\u2206gH with the exception of centrocytes (the CD77 negative sub-population of germinal center B cells) where infection was absent in the DC-SIGN depleted culture vs. the DC-SIGN reconstituted culture (p = 0.03) (Figure 4b) . These results support our previous conclusions that DC-SIGN plays a minor role as a receptor for KSHV entry into tonsil-derived B cells, and that the KSHV glycoprotein gH is not required for entry into any B cell subsets. However, our data reveal that in the absence of both the DC-SIGN receptor and the gH glycoprotein, KSHV cannot infect centrocytes. This implies that KSHV has only two entry mechanisms for centrocytes: (1) a gH-dependent mechanism that uses a receptor other than DC-SIGN, and (2) a gH-independent mechanism that uses DC-SIGN as the receptor. In KSHV-WT, both entry mechanisms are functional and no difference is seen when DC-SIGN is depleted because the gH-dependent entry mechanism is intact. When gH is absent but DC-SIGN is present (KSHV-\u2206gH reconstituted) entry into centrocytes is mediated by the interaction of another KSHV-gp and DC-SIGN. When gH is absent and DC-SIGN is absent, KSHV has no entry mechanism for centrocytes ( Figure 4c) .",

One reason for this discrepancy may be methodological. We avoid using Ficoll-Hypaque and similar agents for lymphocyte purification and we utilize negative selection strategies for B cell isolation in order to avoid aberrant activation of cells in our system. Importantly, we utilized multi-color flow cytometry for our analysis method which allows us to see KSHV infection using the constitutively expressed GFP reporter present in the BAC16 genome (which we have previously shown is a reliable marker for KSHV tropism [5] ) alongside surface antigen markers for B cell subsets.

These results differ from those reported in Rappocciolo et al., where use of the same anti-DC-SIGN neutralizing antibody clone but at much higher concentrations (20 \u00b5g/mL) effectively blocked KSHV infection of activated peripheral B-cells [8] . Aside from the differing mAb concentrations, our culture model recapitulates the total tonsil lymphocyte environment after infection. Thus, we might hypothesize this mAb enhancement effect may be mediated by activation of DC-SIGN signaling altering other attachment factors or via altered interactions involving non-B cells in the culture model. Our analysis of the distribution of KSHV infection within B-cell subsets did not reveal any change in KSHV targeting of B-cells with DC-SIGN neutralization, and RT-PCR results show no increase in lytic replication in culture where the neutralizing antibody was used. Thus, our data provide no evidence that the increase in overall infection with DC-SIGN neutralization is a result of altered KSHV targeting or spread. We did observe an increase in total plasma cell numbers in DC-SIGN neutralized, KSHV-infected lymphocyte cultures. Our previous work has shown that our lymphocyte culture system does not favor the survival of plasma cells, but KSHV infection increases overall plasma cell numbers at 3 dpi [5] . Recently, activation of DC-SIGN signaling via antibody binding was shown to promote survival of B lymphoma cells [18] . Thus, the combination of DC-SIGN neutralization and KSHV infection may synergistically promote the survival of plasma cells in our culture system, and we speculate that the presence of plasma cells promotes KSHV infection via unknown mechanisms that are possibly related to the cytokine milieu. Overall, our results collectively show that DC-SIGN is not required for KSHV entry into any B-cell subset.",

We recently showed that gH is essential for KSHV entry into epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts but is not required for entry into the MC116 B-cell lymphoma cell line [6] . Our current study extends these findings and shows that gH is also not required for entry into primary tonsil lymphocytes. Interestingly, our results revealed tonsil donorspecific differences in the infectivity of KSHV-\u2206gH compared to KSHV-WT, and that these differences are correlated to the frequencies of transitional and double negative B cells in the original tonsil sample. These results provide a critical insight indicating that vaccination strategies concentrated on KSHV-gH may leave the immune system vulnerable to infection. However, our DC-SIGN depletion experiments show that there is a gHdependent mechanism for KSHV entry into centrocytes. Thus, although gH is not strictly required for entry into any B cell type, gH-dependent entry mechanisms do exist for tonsilderived B cells. Taken together, our results indicate that KSHV entry in B lymphocytes is complex, multi-factoral and that subset-dependent entry mechanisms exist but, in all cases, KSHV has multiple entry points to exploit on any given B cell subset.",

In particular, for the neutralization experiment we chose to utilize a neutralizing antibody that may not be optimal for the inhibition of DC-SIGN and KSHV glycoprotein interactions. The anti-DC-SIGN antibody we utilized is optimized to neutralize the interaction of DC-SIGN with ICAM-3/CD50. It should be noted that the DC-SIGN receptor is a tetramer protein com-posed of four individual domains: the C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), the neck-repeat region, the transmembrane domain, and the N terminal cytoplasmic tail. Due to DC-SIGN's role in the process of viral infection and its structural complexity, many groups believe that blocking the sugar binding site, ICAM-3 epitope in the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) will overall inhibit DC-SIGN and not allow the virus to enter. This assumption is believed to be true because the ICAM-3 epitope is located in the center of the carbohydrate recognition domain where most molecular processes are mediated in the DC-SIGN receptor [19] . Importantly, the biochemistry of any interactions between DC-SIGN and KSHV glycoproteins has not been established. The fact that our results show increased infection with DC-SIGN neutralization could imply that the neutralizing antibody may be binding to a different epitope on DC-SIGN and that the antibody is not neutralizing the actual interaction of the viral glycoproteins to DC-SIGN. More research is needed to decipher the real interactions between DC-SIGN and KSHV glycoproteins to be able to fully neutralize those specific interactions. Moreover, our results with DC-SIGN neutralization highlight the need to better establish the role of DC-SIGN signaling in our tonsil lymphocyte cultures and its impact on KSHV infection.",

In addition, future studies are needed to determine the specific cellular receptors that KSHV uses to enter each susceptible B cell subset and how these receptors change based on inflammatory and metabolic factors that may influence the spread of KSHV within a human host. Previous studies have shown that cellular receptors for KSHV can be modulated by metabolic factors such as high glucose associated with diabetes [20] . Moreover, KSHV replication has been shown to modify metabolic parameters such as lipogenesis [21] , creating a positive feedback loop between viral spread, persistence and pathogenesis. Understanding the fundamental virology of KSHV entry in the lymphocyte compartment will be essential to rationally designing treatment strategies that limit KSHV spread and pathogenesis within a human host. Moreover, the rational design of vaccines to prevent the person-to-person spread of KSHV, and thereby limit the public health impact of KSHV-associated malignancies, will depend upon our understanding of how KSHV invades the immunological compartment.

KSHV Infection Does Not Alter DC-SIGN Expression on B Cells and Expression of DC-SIGN on KSHV-Infected Cells Is Highly VariableTo determine whether our culture system and/or KSHV infection alters the distribution of DC-SIGN within B cell subsets, we performed KSHV infection and analysis at 3 dpi for 10 tonsil lymphocyte preparations quantitating DC-SIGN+ B cells and the distribution of B cell subsets within the DC-SIGN+ population for both Mock and KSHV-infected cultures. These results reveal that there was no statistically significant change in overall DC-SIGN expression on B lymphocytes in Mock vs. KSHV-infected cultures(Figure 1c, left panel). Moreover, we found that although significant numbers of DC-SIGN+ B cells were present in KSHV-infected cultures, few of these DC-SIGN+ cells were KSHV infected (as shown by the expression of the GFP reporter that is constitutively expressed from the recombinant KSHV genome), indicating that infection is not particularly enriched in the DC-SIGN+ fraction(Figure 1c, right panel). However, since overall KSHV infection is low in these cultures (~1% of B cells) we analyzed the data to examine the frequency of DC-SIGN expression on KSHV-infected (GFP+) cells, specifically(Figure 1d). These data show that the presence of DC-SIGN in KSHV-infected lymphocytes is highly variable. Finally, we analyzed the B cell subset distribution for DC-SIGN+ B cells in Mock and KSHV-infected conditions and found no significant influence of infection on DC-SIGN distribution(Figure 1e). Taken together, these data show minimal impact of KSHV infection on DC-SIGN expression and distribution, and indicate that expression of DC-SIGN within infected cells varies substantially based on donor. Thus, these results do not strongly support or entirely refute the hypothesis that DC-SIGN is used as an attachment receptor for KSHV infection in B lymphocytes.",
