The alarming reports of ophthalmologists contracting the deadly illness from infected patients especially the 34-year-old Wuhan ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang, made ophthalmologists wary and nervous of spread of COVID through contact with their patients, either through close proximity with patients during the typical ophthalmic consultation or via diagnostic tests and surgical procedures through aerosolization and fomites [6] .",

Travel and exposure history was registered in the National Health Insurance system so that hospitals could trace and triage high-risk patients. Even though a surgical mask is not fool-proof in filtering out the virus completely, the protective effect doubled when everyone wore masks. Physicians had been asked to wear masks when checking the patients since SARS in 2003 and are now asked to wear a mask all the time inside the hospital. To facilitate the quarantine process, the hospitals developed an Integrated Hospital Quarantine System (IHQS). This was integrated with the NHI PharmaCloud System, which allowed thorough checks on the travel and medical history of preregistered patients for all outpatient clinic visits, day This article is part of a topical collection on Perspectives on COVID-19 surgery, scheduled examinations, or hospital admissions in advance [8] .",

The fact is, telemedicine has been proposed and discussed for several decades before the COVID pandemic, but the current situation where many countries have imposed lockdowns and restrictions to travel to clinics and hospitals has greatly accelerated its use and implementation [10] . This is especially important for patients at higher risk of contracting the virus, such as elderly patients, and those who are immunocompromised such as diabetic patients. On the other hand, ophthalmologists and eye care staff often need to be in close proximity to patients, whether at the slit lamp, during air puff tonometry, or performing fundus photography or an OCT. Hence, teleophthalmology is a logical and effective solution to reducing face-to-face encounters during this period of social distancing and self-isolation [11] .",

But for safe and effective forward triage to happen, the following elements are required: clinical history, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and imaging (e.g., anterior and posterior segment photographs, OCT, and visual fields). Triage protocols may be optimized by automated decision trees such as Big Picture Medical, a cloud-based telemedicine platform linking optometrists in the community to ophthalmologists at Moorfields Eye Hospital. [12] Video eye consults suit some subspecialties more than others. Examples would be oculoplastics, strabismus, and screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and diabetic retinopathy [13] [14] [15] . Live slit lamp examination can now be streamed from a primary care facility to a tertiary level hospital for more complex cases [16] . Patients may still be required to come in for specific tests such as orthoptic assessment, biometry, perimetry, and ultrasonography, but these visits may significantly reduce time in contact with staff and other patients [17] .",
