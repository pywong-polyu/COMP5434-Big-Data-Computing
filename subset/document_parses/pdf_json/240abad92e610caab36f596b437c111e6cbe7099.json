For the health services providers, it became a challenge to make rapid forward planning to evaluate the transmission rate of SARS-Cov-2 without ready access to diagnostic techniques and future planning based on the sustainability of healthcare systems to cope with the outbreak (3) . Pragmatic understanding of the novel pathogen SARS-Cov-2 revealed an essential genetic sequencing similarity to the previously known pathogen, SARS (4) . A mean incubation period of 5.2 days of SARS-Cov-2 has been reported to cause the onset of symptoms and a mean 12.5 days for hospitalization from day of infection (5, 6) . Fauci et al. emphasized the time interval during the incubation of SARS-Cov-2 to hold crucial information on pathogenesis and asserted the need to understand it to design an effective containment policy (7) . Current understanding of Covid-19 pathogenesis focuses on the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2(ACE2) based SARS-Cov-2 cell entry that infects lung epithelial cells and synergistic entry through endosome proteases cell prime entry that infects the host cell (8) . Novel coronavirus also infects T-lymphocytes (9) . Recent retrospective studies revealed that elders are more prone to Covid-19 and were more likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation with a high mortality among Covid-19 infected patients, and robust research revealed the clinical presentation of Covid-19. Currently, Covid-19 is detectable with Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), which detects presence of genetic fragments of SARS-Cov-2 within secretions from nasal and pharyngeal epithelial mucus membrane. Employed techniques of RT-PCR and immunoglobulin presence detection methods have their own limitations of detection within a specific time period. Prior to detection through RT-PCR, no method is available to assess Covid-19 infection during incubation and after the onset of symptoms. Consequently, a high transmission rate has been reported and needs to be reduced for effective containment (7) . In this study, we evaluated the current knowledge of Covid-19 pathogenesis and its manifestation to formulate an easy method to detect and assess the Covid-19 course of infection and to counter outbreaks by reducing transmission rates through early sensing and adopting appropriate measures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 323, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 474, "end": 477, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 643, "end": 646, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 647, "end": 649, "text": "6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 855, "end": 858, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1120, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1171, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2057, "end": 2060, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Comparatively similar clinical features were previously reported to be caused by influenza.

Contrary Young et al. did not show any laboratory findings in one study(32).Zhang  et al. prescribed fever, cough, and lymphopenia in all cases and thrombopenia in 66.33% of confirmed cases of Covid-19. He also showed reduced levels in AST and ALT aminotransferases (30). Bangalore et al. reported fever 72%, cough 83%, and lymphopenia in all 18 laboratory confirmed Covid-19 cases (31). Song et al. explained the presence of fever 39.2%, cough 17.85%, and hyperemic mucus membrane 21.42% in 28 patients diagnosed with Covid-19 (32) and Chow et al. reported fever 72% and cough 87.5% in 48 confirmed cases (33). Shi et al. observed fever in 80.3%, cough 34.6%, and hyperemic mucus membrane 2.9% in 416 confirmed cases of Covid-19 (34). Wu et al. reported fever 26.3% and lymphopenia in 38 Covid-19 cases (35). Fen et al. primarily described the epidemiological aspects of Covid-19, and asserted that Covid-19 has a mild course of disease and the mortality rate is 2.3%. According to Fen et al. many mildly infected and some severe cases survived the Covid-19 infection. Symptoms vary from the mild to the severe, the latter of which would demand assisted ventilation. 1.2% of asymptomatic patients were confirmed by laboratory investigation. Many suspects were quarantined from their signs and symptoms (36). Detail features are described in Table 1. of Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 FormulaEarly detection for Covid-19 in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases showed its ability to isolate Covid-19 cases at an early stage. The calculation chart is provided with double calculation methods to enhance the sensitivity of the outcome. The formula provides an easy approach to screen the suspects and carriers of Covid-19 earlier than previously being diagnosed. The Hashmi-Asif covid-19 formula expedites the ability of health care providers in developing countries lacking appropriate health facilities to diagnose Covid-19. The Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 formula based on the most common early presentations of the Covid-19 and on changing response in signs and symptoms and blood biomarkers has made evaluating Covid-19 easier. By using the formula, Covid-19 can be diagnosed \u223c72-96 h earlier than it currently can. It will provide ample time to adopt interventions for Covid-19 and to reduce the mortality rate by early management. The chart can be helpful to restrict transmission rates of SARS-Cov-2 \u22641, consequently decreasing infection spread in contacts. The Hashmi-Asif covid-19 formula expedites the ability of health care providers in developing countries lacking appropriate facilities to diagnose Covid-19. The Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 formula works via calculation of scores of the most common early presentations of Covid-19. Separate calculations of scoring for signs and symptoms and blood biomarkers made it appropriate for Covid-19 detection and evaluation. The chart also provides a tool to assess whether the status of Covid-19 is either progressing or reducing toward a healthy situation.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "TABLE 1 | Collected data on common signs and symptoms of Covid-19.
