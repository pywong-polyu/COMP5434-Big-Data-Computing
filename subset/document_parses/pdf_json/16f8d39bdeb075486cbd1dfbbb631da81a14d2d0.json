            "text": "Purpose: To assess clinician satisfaction with structured (SR) and conventional (CR) radiological reports for chest CT exams in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, objectively comparing both reporting strategies. Method: We retrospectively included 68 CTs (61 patients) with COVID-19. CRs were collected from the digital database while corresponding SRs were written by an expert radiologist, including a sign checklist, severity score index and final impressions. New CRs were prepared for a random subset (n = 10) of cases, to allow comparisons in reporting time and word count. CRs were analyzed to record severity score and final impressions inclusion. A random subset of 40 paired CRs and SRs was evaluated by two clinicians to assess, using a Likert scale, readability, comprehensiveness, comprehensibility, conciseness, clinical impact, and overall quality. Results: Overall, 19/68 (28 %) and 9/68 (13 %) of CRs included final impressions and severity score, respectively. SR writing required significantly (p < 0.001) less time (mean = 308 s; SD \u00b1 60 s) compared to CRs (mean = 458 s; SD \u00b1 72 s). On the other hand, word count was not significantly different (p = 0.059, median = 100 and 106, range = 106-139 and 88-131 for SRs and CRs, respectively). Both clinicians expressed significantly (all p < 0.01) higher scores for SRs compared to CRs in all categories. Conclusions: Our study supports the use of chest CT SRs in COVID-19 patients to improve referring physician satisfaction, optimizing reporting time and provide a greater amount and quality of information within the report.",

As of December 2020, more than 68.000.000 of people infected and approximately 1.500.000 deaths related to COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a highly specific test and the established gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Several radiological scientific societies have published guidelines on the diagnostic work-up of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, proposing the use of imaging according to clinical findings [4, 5] . Although routine use of chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) for screening is still debated [6] [7] [8] [9] , this imaging modality plays a key role in management and follow-up of COVID-19 patients [10] .",

Thus, the need of a uniform and standardized reporting scheme and language to describe CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia has been widely accepted [15, 16] . In particular, structured reports (SRs) use a template with standardized headings targeted to provide a complete evaluation of all key features that are relevant to the disease.",

Moreover, this lack of face-to-face contacts has dramatically worsened due to the current pandemic [21] . Consequently, overall quality of radiologic reports, especially in terms of clarity and completeness of contents, is crucial to guarantee optimal patient care. Several studies have proposed the adoption of structured reporting of HRCT and radiographs in patients with suspected or known COVID-19 pneumonia [15, [22] [23] [24] . Indeed, due to its standardized and schematic nature, embracing structured reporting could prove particularly advantageous in the setting of novel disease with high volume clinical demand.

Overall, it is interesting to note that SRs were never assigned a score of 1 in any of the examined characteristics by the two infectious disease specialists. On the contrary, CRs scoring was more heterogeneous, with the minimum satisfaction being occasionally reported in all domains. This highlights the higher degree of variability that characterizes CRs in general [25] . Focusing on each individual characteristic, the significantly higher satisfaction with SRs readability indicates that a free text can be harder to read compared to a schematic report based on a checklist. The comprehensiveness of about one third to half of CRs was deemed unsatisfactory according the referring physicians in this study. This confirms that CRs are prone to the omission of relevant imaging findings, an issue that appears to be significantly mitigated by the adoption of a structured template. The perceived clinical utility of SRs was rated significantly higher compared to CRs. We hypothesize that this difference could be mainly related to the higher inclusion rate of final impressions and severity index scores in SRs. While this information could aid referring physicians in their decision making, they could be easily included in CRs too and do not represent a direct advantage of the reporting strategy. Nevertheless, a standardized template ensures that these important details are consistently provided, especially with a departmental adoption of SRs.",

Accordingly, it appears that CRs could have an excessive word count compared to the amount of information provided to the clinician. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SRs take significantly less time to be written compared to CRs despite the similar length. This observation is likely owed to the SRs checklist, which allows radiologists to choose from a limited set of predefined options rather than having to elaborate detailed sentences for each scan. Our results stand with various previous papers stating benefits of SRs over narrative reports [13, 17, [26] [27] [28] . Sabel et al. [13] showed that SRs of CT pulmonary angiography in the setting of acute pulmonary embolism received significantly higher ratings for clarity and content than the conventional ones. Schwartz et al. [17] obtained similar results when evaluating satisfaction of surgical and medical oncologists as well as radiologists towards SRs and CRs of various CT exams. In particular, SRs received higher ratings concerning content and clarity compared to CRs, while the two reporting strategies did not significantly differ in modifying patients' clinical status. Moreover, rectal MRI structured reporting in patients with primary rectal cancer was proved to facilitate surgical planning and lead to greater satisfaction level of referring surgeons compared to CRs [28] . Objective evaluations for the presence of key features of the two reporting strategies have also been previously performed in different settings [26, 27] . Franconeri et al. showed that SRs missed only 1.2 \u00b1 1.5 out of 19 key features, whereas in narrative reports 7.3 \u00b1 2.5 key features were missing for planning of fibroid treatment [27] . Similarly, MRI structured reporting strategy in patients with perianal fistulizing disease was proved to miss fewer key features than the narrative one [26] .",

            "text": "This study suffers from some limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, CRs were taken from clinical practice and therefore, differently from SRs, they were generated by multiple radiologists, which could have further increased the heterogeneity we found in CRs. Moreover, SRs were produced in a research setting, without the pressure and possible inconveniences that can occur in clinical practice. However, it is fair to assume that the structured reporting strategy would maintain its advantages when translated to the clinical practice, as also observed in other fields [26, 29] . Another limitation to address could be represented by the relatively low number of reports included, although previous publications on SRs used similar sample sizes [14, 27, 28] . The SR template employed in this work was tailored for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia at the time of CT scan, and therefore the potential value of chest CT structured reporting in patients with unconfirmed COVID-19 diagnosis was not directly explored. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect similar results with a modified SR template specifically designed for COVID-19 suspicion. Finally, we did not explore the effect of a real-life implementation of SRs and we were not able to perform a direct correlation of SRs impact on patient outcome, which is a common limitation of preliminary SRs studies [30] .",
