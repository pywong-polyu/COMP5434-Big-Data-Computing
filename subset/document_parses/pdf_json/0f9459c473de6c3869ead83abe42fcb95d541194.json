Additional clinical features include sleep disordered breathing, restrictive lung disease, polycythemia, hypoxemia, and an increased serum bicarbonate concentration (\u226527 mEq/L). Anesthesia providers should be familiar with OHS because it is often undiagnosed, it is associated with a higher mortality rate than obstructive sleep apnea, and it is projected to increase in prevalence along with the obesity epidemic. In this case, a 33-year-old obese woman with presumed OHS developed respiratory acidosis during induction of labor. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment was initiated, but the patient continued to have hypercapnia. A cesarean delivery was recommended. e patient had baseline orthopnea due to her body habitus; thus, despite adequate labor analgesia, a cesarean delivery was completed with general endotracheal anesthesia. We believe this patient had OHS despite a serum bicarbonate <27 mEq/L, a partial pressure of oxygen >70 mm Hg, and a hemoglobin <16 g/dL, which would typically rule out OHS. Pregnant women experience a decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration due to progesterone-mediated hyperventilation, an increase in arterial oxygenation from increased minute ventilation and higher cardiac output, and a decrease in hemoglobin due to the physiologic anemia of pregnancy. us, OHS may be defined differently in pregnant than in non-pregnant patients.",

Additional clinical features include restrictive lung disease and polycythemia (hemoglobin >16 g/dL) [1] . Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is present in 90% of individuals with OHS [2] . Serum bicarbonate has been used to screen for OHS, with a level <27 mEq/L decreasing the probability of the disease [3, 4] . e prevalence of OHS has been estimated to be between 0.15 and 0.4% of the world's adult population [5, 6] . e prevalence of OHS is expected to increase along with the obesity epidemic [7, 8] . Patients with OHS are high healthcare utilizers and they generate higher physician fees [9] . OHS is associated with a higher mortality rate than OSA [10] and obesity without hypoventilation [11] ; thus, it is critical that anesthesia providers learn how to diagnose OHS [12] . However, OHS may be defined differently in pregnant than in non-pregnant patients.",

After surgery, the patient was transported intubated to the intensive care unit (ICU). e patient was afebrile, but remained mechanically ventilated due to preeclampsia-related acute on chronic kidney injury (creatinine 2.82 mg/dL and potassium 6.7 mmol/L). Hyperkalemia was successfully treated with a 20 mg/hour intravenous furosemide infusion, renal function improved without hemodialysis, and the patient was extubated on postdelivery day 2. One day after extubation, the patient's serum bicarbonate was 29 mmol/L (Figure 1 ). e remainder of the patient's hospitalization was unremarkable. On the day of discharge, the patient's home sleep study was finalized revealing an apnea hypopnea index of 46.8 events/hour, an obstructive apnea index of 18.2 events/hour, a 90% mean oxygen saturation, and a 68% oxygen saturation nadir. e patient was discharged home with an auto-CPAP machine set to a range of 5-15 cm H 2 O.",

We found only one case report describing OHS during pregnancy, in which a parturient with obesity-related hypoventilation and hypercarbia had cardiac arrest after developing severe hypokalemia due to hyperemesis gravidarum [17] . By contrast, increased attention is being paid to the diagnosis and treatment of OSA during pregnancy. OSA is common in pregnant women, the incidence increases with higher gestational age [18] and BMI [19] , and it is associated with preeclampsia and gestational diabetes [18, 19] . While the two diseases share clinical manifestations and pathogenesis, it is important to distinguish between them by assessing for awake hypercapnia (P a CO 2 >45 mm Hg) because patients with OHS have poorer prognoses and higher mortality rates than patients with OSA [9, 20] . In this case, a patient with presumed OHS developed acute respiratory acidosis as a result of multiple physiologic challenges during induction of labor, including increased carbon dioxide production, a blunted respiratory response to hypercarbia, and respiratory muscle fatigue. CPAP therapy was initiated, but the patient continued to have hypercapnia. It was determined that cesarean delivery may help the patient regain acid-base homeostasis. e patient had baseline orthopnea due to her body habitus; thus, despite adequate labor analgesia, a cesarean delivery was completed with general endotracheal anesthesia.",

In the short term, positive pressure ventilation (PPV) can reduce chest discomfort and upper airway obstruction for patients in the supine position [21] . Longterm PPV has been shown to normalize P a CO 2 , improve oxygenation, reduce daytime sleepiness, improve functional status, improve pulmonary mechanics, stimulate central respiratory response to hypercarbia, and reduce mortality [22] [23] [24] [25] . erefore, a formal diagnosis of OHS earlier in pregnancy, conditioning to PPV, and use of PPV during induction of labor may have prevented the need for mechanical ventilation. e established differential diagnosis for acute respiratory acidosis during labor includes asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypermagnesemia, and pulmonary embolism. In the present case, these diagnoses were deemed less likely than respiratory acidosis related to OHS: asthma (no wheezing and no response to albuterol), pneumonia (no fever and clear chest radiograph), pulmonary edema (clear chest radiograph), hypermagnesemia (lack of hyporeflexia and a peak magnesium concentration of 4.9 mg/dL, whereas levels >15 mg/dL are typically associated with respiratory arrest), and pulmonary embolism (no chest pain, hemoptysis, or cough). e preponderance of evidence supports a diagnosis of OHS, and that it led to the patient's acute respiratory acidosis. e patient possessed many of the criteria used to diagnose OHS: high BMI (58.6 kg/m 2 ), restrictive lung disease, diaphragm elevation on chest radiograph, severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index 46.8 events/hour), and daytime awake hypercapnia (P a CO 2 >45 mm Hg) [1] . Although P a CO 2 >45 mm Hg is not impressive outside of pregnancy, during pregnancy it is consistent with significant respiratory acidosis, as normal term pregnancy P a CO 2 is 30 mm Hg [8] .",

In this case, the patient's serum bicarbonate was \u226527 mEq/L before becoming pregnant and after delivery; however, her serum bicarbonate was 20-23 mEq/L during her induction of labor ( Figure 1 ). Serum bicarbonate decreases during pregnancy due to metabolic compensation for progesterone-mediated respiratory alkalosis [8] . Serum bicarbonate may further decrease during labor when pain causes hyperventilation. erefore, the 27 mEq/L threshold for serum bicarbonate may have lower sensitivity in pregnant women. Consequently, we suggest a measurement of P a CO 2 from an ABG in pregnant women, in whom suspicion for OHS is high. e patient was not hypoxemic during the majority of her peripartum course (Table 1) . P a O 2 increases 10 mmHg during pregnancy due to increased minute ventilation, lower P a CO 2 (which increases P a O 2 as calculated by the alveolar gas equation), and a smaller drop in venous oxygen concentration due to increased cardiac output [8] . Hence, physiologic changes associated with pregnancy decrease the likelihood that parturients will be hypoxic, which would increase the number of false negatives and decrease the sensitivity of P a O 2 <70 mm Hg for diagnosing OHS.",
