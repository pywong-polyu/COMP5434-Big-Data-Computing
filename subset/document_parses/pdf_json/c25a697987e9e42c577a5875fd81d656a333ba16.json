Uncertainty about the length and scope of the pandemic may also lead to fear and worries (10) . The pandemic was followed by an economic downturn, including job loss and economic uncertainty, known to have adverse effects on children's mental health (11, 12) . Transitions to homeschooling during the pandemic negatively influenced many children's learning outcomes which may spill over to their wellbeing (13) . Furthermore, as mental health problems are more prevalent among children of lower socioeconomic origins, social distancing measures may exacerbate already marked social inequalities in child health (14) .

            "text": "Shortly after the onset of the pandemic, there were international reports of a possible worsening of mental health among children and adolescents (17) . However, most of these studies were based on convenience sampling, relied on cross-sectional estimates on measures of mental health, and focused on mental health problems during quarantine (18) . Even before the pandemic, rates of mental health problems had been increasing (19, 20) , urging caution in attributing any increase to the pandemic and its associated restrictions. Existing evidence from larger studies comparing measures of mental health collected before the pandemic with data collected during the pandemic is mixed (10, 21, 22) . Two studies of short-term consequences (up to summer 2020) show no substantial changes in mental health (21, 23) . Two studies follow children to fall 2020, an Icelandic study report deterioration in children's mental health while a Norwegian study suggests no substantial changes (24, 25) . Beyond differences in the observation period, the mixed findings may reflect differences in questionnaire scales, age profiles, sample selections and settings. Moreover, previous studies have relied on self-or parent-reported symptoms of mental health problems with less knowledge about healthcare use for mental health problems. The latter is important, as changes in healthcare utilization, particularly specialist healthcare, for mental health problems may indicate a more severe change in children and adolescents' mental health status than can be captured through symptom questionnaires. Finally, the pandemic and its associated restrictions may have had both acute and longer-term impacts on mental healthcare utilization, which may have differed as the pandemic evolved. For example, reduced capacity or fear of contagion may have reduced utilization, while an increased focus on mental health may have lowered the threshold for seeking professional help. In the acute phase, mental healthcare may have been reduced, for instance, due to lockdown or fear of contamination of the virus. This may in turn lead to a longer-term increase in mental healthcare utilization, as a potential result of previously unmet need for mental healthcare utilization, an increase in mental health problems or a reduced threshold for help-seeking.",

However, the increase seen in consultations could be due to greater media coveage and awareness of mental health problems. This could lead parents or physicians to rate children to have more symptoms now compared to pre-pandemic years. Increased family time during the pandemic (16) could make parents more responsive to their children's symptoms. If fears of contracting COVID-19 or overburdening the healthcare system increased the threshold for seeking help, the worsening of mental health would be larger than the increase in consultations suggest.
