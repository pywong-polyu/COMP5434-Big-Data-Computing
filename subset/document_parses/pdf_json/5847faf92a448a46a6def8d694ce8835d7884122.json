The present study aimed to provide the prevalence of individuals at risk for EDs psychopathology in a representative population of adolescents aged 14-19 and to characterize this population regarding interpersonal and psychological factors. Methods The percentage of participants at risk for EDs in a representative high school population was assessed through the SCOFF screening questionnaire (cut-off score: 3) in the total sample (N: 6551) and in gender-based subgroups for different body mass index (BMI) categories. Odds ratios for being at risk of ED (SCOFF \u2265 3) were esteemed in a multivariable analysis including self-reported parental education, quality of family and peer relationships, bullying victimization, age at first sexual intercourse, and psychological distress. Results A SCOFF score \u2265 3 was found in 31.0% of participants (boys: 19.4%; girls: 44.6%), with a greater prevalence among higher BMI categories. Bad family relationships, being bullied, having the first sexual intercourse before the age of 14, and experiencing high distress were associated with this risk condition. Among girls, bad peer relationships were associated with a low-risk SCOFF score. Conclusion A remarkable percentage of adolescents reported significant body image or eating concerns. Screening programs are deeply needed, and particular attention should be devoted to interpersonal factors, such as the quality of family relationships and interactions with peers, which represent potential indicators of this vulnerability.

However, a precise estimate of the prevalence of subthreshold and clinical conditions in this high-risk age interval is still under-addressed in European countries [2] , and data from previous Italian studies may benefit from an update [3] [4] [5] [6] . In fact, early detection of ED psychopathology is fundamental for a timely treatment and a reduction of chronicity [7] . For this reason, an accurate characterization of at-risk conditions-including different environmental, interpersonal, and psychological factors clustering with them-may contribute to a more precise estimation of the number of subclinical conditions or untreated subjects with EDs [2, 8] .",

More in details, the latter were found to influence weight-related behavior [20] , and bullying victimization was associated with weight and body image concerns among adolescents [21] . In fact, premorbid social difficulties in EDs include submissiveness and proneness to dysfunctional social comparison [22] . Moreover, experiencing family and peer teasing in early adolescence is associated with the development of dysfunctional weight control tied to body image dissatisfaction [17] . To conclude, the quality of early sexual experiences has already been reported to be interconnected with EDs psychopathology [23, 24] , early sexual activity being associated with bulimic-type pathology in middle adolescence [25] . Considering that ED patients are known to show abnormal emotional reactivity associated with body dissatisfaction in presence of social stressors [26] , an early assessment of the abovementioned relational factors may enrich the epidemiological data available, coherently with the interpersonal model of EDs.",

These data confirmed that a remarkable percentage of individuals in this age range present significant body image and weight concerns, as seen in similar studies which, however, outlined a lower proportion of at-risk individuals [34] [35] [36] . It is possible to hypothesize that this alarming prevalence may be due to an improved awareness in the general population and to a reduced stigma in reporting ED symptoms, but it may also express a real increase in the occurrence of clinical and subthreshold ED symptoms [1, 8] . From this perspective, the rising incidence of EDs in adults may represent the tip of an Table 4 Characterization of relational and behavioral variables in individuals with and without a SCOFF score \u2265 3, divided by gender Adjusted odds ratios for having a SCOFF score \u2265 3 are presented (multivariable model) AOR adjusted odds ratio, CI confidence interval *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Percentages refer to the single answer for each gender (total number varies due to missing data) Bold is used to highlight statistically significant results iceberg with a greater number of vulnerable adolescents who are not detected-and, therefore, potentially not treated. It is noteworthy that-even though the present study confirmed a greater prevalence of ED symptoms among women-a remarkable percentage of boys expressed food-and bodycentered concerns. This result is of particular interest and it cannot be neglected, given the fact that established genderspecific patterns, such as muscularity-oriented disordered eating [37] , are not directly addressed by the SCOFF questionnaire. Moreover, this finding indirectly contributes to confirm that the gender gap in ED symptoms may be less pronounced in the general population as compared to clinical samples [38] .",

Indeed, the present study confirmed that a perceived low quality of family relationships may be associated with altered eating and body weight attitudes [15] [16] [17] . Conversely, despite a different distribution among groups, worse peer relationships did not qualify as a risk factor for high SCOFF scores in the multivariable model, and bad relationships even proved to be protective for girls. The present finding is in contrast with a large body of evidence associating interpersonal difficulties-including peer relationshipswith the onset [22] and the worsening [45] of ED symptoms. On the one hand, the self-reported categorical assessment of these dimensions does not allow a detailed comprehension of phenomena underlying the present findings. On the other hand, however, the data observed may be explained by the fact that this parameter can be strongly influenced by active choices of peer involvement (e.g., selection or avoidance), and it may, therefore, underlie coping strategies that cannot be applied in the domestic environment. The same holds true for victims of abusive behaviors from peers: indeed, bullying victimization was significantly associated with high SCOFF scores, confirming that weight and body image concerns cluster with this widespread dysfunctional interaction [20, 21] . Furthermore, the outlined association between EDs risk and a lower age at first sexual intercourse can be explained in the light of the interplay between early puberty and sexual risk-taking [23] , which have been implicated in the onset of EDs psychopathology, often on the background of childhood traumatic experiences [24] .",

In this sense, it is noteworthy that dietary restraint tied to high levels of psychological distress expresses a condition of risk for developing an ED [47] , confirming the opportunity of a clinical evaluation for a part of subjects who undergo some form of dieting, and that preadolescent overweight and anxious distress recently proved to be associated with the development of ED symptoms in adolescence and young adulthood [48] .",

In this sense, the fact that some participants did not fill the SCOFF questionnaire may be an expression of selective non-response, even if no difference in this subsample was observed regarding randomization criteria. Second, the Italian version of the SCOFF questionnaire has low specificity (87.5%), and it may overestimate the number of individuals who deserve a clinical evaluation [30] . Third, the crosssectional and observational study design does not allow to draw conclusions on the causative effect of the variables presented. To conclude, the broad categories used for the assessed variables may have produced a reduced variance, and a relative approximation of the investigated phenomena, as discussed for the evaluation of peer relationships.
