The main advantage of the HDI is its understanding and adoption on a global scale. However, its applicability is limited for health studies since its longevity dimension presents mathematical redundancy in regression models.

In other words, as SES improves, prevalence diminishes correspondingly. This gradient is reliable and consistent in the relationship found with cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, arthritis, chronic respiratory tuberculosis, and adverse birth outcomes, as well as violent and accidental deaths [2] .

Thus, understanding which characteristics of the socioeconomic environment most explain health conditions is a pressing issue. Such understanding can contribute to the implementation of intersectoral public policies that would be more efficient to improve the health of the population and to reduce inequalities. As individual measures of socioeconomic indicators are rarely available in medical records [6] , it is common to use a single geographical variable that summarizes living conditions (e.g., income, education, per capita Gross Domestic Product). Although this approach helps to understand how an aspect of the socioeconomic context is related to health, the interpretation of the findings is limited, as the socioeconomic context is multidimensional, involving aspects such as employment, income, education, housing, segregation, mobility, among others [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 126, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 302, "end": 305, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 628, "end": 631, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 889, "end": 892, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 893, "end": 896, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 897, "end": 900, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1310, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1767, "end": 1770, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Furthermore, by including more than one socioeconomic variable in a regression modelthe most used statistical analysis in ecological design studies-we can violate the underlying assumptions of this analysis due to the effects of collinearity [8] .

Education can reflect non-economic features as general and health-related knowledge, the capacity of problem-solving, prestige, influence, social network and access to technological innovation [15] that can bring advantages to the individual's health [9] . Poverty refers to absolute poverty, directly linked to the minimum capacity of survival and access to material resources. Wealth, on its turn, is different from income, since it is a proxy for all long-life economic resources [9] . Our definition of material deprivation and access to public services bases on Townsend's concept of material deprivation [16] that refers to disadvantages concerning other people in the same society to which one belongs. We intend to measure how much material resources and conveniences that are part of modern life (such as adequate housing, car ownership, refrigerator, computer, among others) a person has, also evaluating their access to services, including sanitation, electricity, and internet. Mobility can affect a person's health in many ways. One of them concerns the time spent commuting from home to work, which can cause stress on many levels and compromise the time available for study or leisure. In addition, longer commuting time may expose people to higher doses of air pollution in large cities [17] . Finally, residential segregation is a broad concept that refers to housing separated from different population groups in different parts of a city [18] . Segregation affects health by intensifying psychosocial effects involving insecurity, anxiety, social isolation, socially dangerous environments, bullying, and depression [14, 19, 20] . In our analysis, we considered two aspects of segregation: education and income, including levels of income stratified by ethnic groups, which better describe socioeconomic differences in Brazil. We used the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) to measure residential segregation [14] . Consider the income segregation as an example: the formula uses the number of people who earns more than the 80% percentile, minus the number who earns less than the 20% percentile, divided by the total number of people who have income. The ICE varies from -1 (most deprived) to 1 (most privileged). A negative ICE means that the area presents more people in the condition of deprivation than in the higher extreme; and a positive value, the opposite. A value of zero indicates that the area is not dominated by extreme concentrations of either of the two groups. The calculations of the other segregation types follow the same formula.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 407, "end": 410, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 639, "end": 642, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 766, "end": 770, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1459, "end": 1463, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1613, "end": 1617, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1795, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1799, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1803, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2098, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Socioeconomic variables and dimensions of context"}, {"text": "The data used to generate the index comes from the 2010 Census, made available by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), organized by Federative Unit (FU), including questionnaires about \"People\" (information at the individual level, e.g., income, level of education, time spent commuting to work, etc.) and their \"Households\" (e.g., the existence of material goods, access to resources, etc.).

We used the geographic coordinates of the municipal headquarters in the analyzes for Brazil and the displaced coordinates of the sample areas for the intra-municipal analyzes of S\u00e3o Paulo. In this case, the displacement was made due to the heterogeneity of the population distribution in the peripheral sample areas, where there are dams and environmental protection sparsely populated areas. Due to the occurrence of spatial dependence on residues at both aggregation scales, we applied geographically weighted regression (GWR) models calculated in the ArcGIS 10.1 program (\"Adaptive\" Kernel analysis; Bandwidth Parameter method, with 53 neighbors on the national scale, and 30 in the intra-municipal). GWR is a regression that allows exploring spatial heterogeneity on data, which exists when the process being modeled varies across the study area. We evaluated the models via resulting AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) values, according to which lower values indicate a better fit of the model [29] . A spatial model with good fit should yield no spatial autocorrelation on its residues meaning that the most important variables explaining spatial variability were addressed. To verify spatial dependence on the residues, we calculated the Moran's I coefficients for the standardized residuals and their p values in the GeoDa program. Moran's I coefficient measures the likelihood that an apparent spatial pattern was produced merely by chance or if there is an effect of distance on the distribution of a variable. The coefficient ranges from -1 to 1 and is equal to zero when there is no effect of the distance. We used a \"Queen\" neighborhood matrix, a contiguity-based relation due to the presence of irregular polygons with varying shape and surface (municipalities and sample areas). First-order Queen contiguity defines a neighbor when they have at least a point in common on their border.

Models with the dimensions of poverty, deprivation, income, and segregation best explained the relative risk of avoidable mortality from 5 to 74 years in Brazil, without spatial dependence on their residues.

The mobility dimension was not a deterministic criterion to characterize socioeconomic differences on the national scale and did not contribute to Geo-SES-BR. Almost 44% of the spatial variability is explained by the model with the poverty dimension, which can be realized by the visual similarity among the observed and explained maps.

Residential segregation in Brazil-although conceptually very relevant-has been poorly evaluated in health studies [32] . Primarily on an intra-municipal Table 2 scale, residential segregation is reflected in many outcomes. Highlighting it can encourage affirmative social inclusion policies. If poverty best explains the relative risk of avoidable mortality from 5 to 74 years due to interventions at the Brazilian Health System in Brazil on the national scale, it means that the focus still should be on ensuring minimum income for a part of the population. Since we implemented GeoSES in a programming language, one can easily update it for each edition of the Demographic Census. It can also be adapted to the previous Census. Besides, other versions of GeoSES can be developed, allowing for their enhancement by including dimensions not covered in this first version. It is noteworthy, however, that there is a significant correlation of the new index with the HDI-M because the data set used to compose them is similar.

It brings an innovative and insightful perspective for understanding what is most relevant in the socioeconomic context of each Brazilian region. For example, the most significant dimension at the national level is poverty; for S\u00e3o Paulo state, it is the residential segregation of the educational context; for the state of Rio Grande do Norte, income is the most critical dimension. Taking the sample area as an example, when comparing the principal variable in the education dimension, in the municipality of S\u00e3o Paulo, the percentage of people with superior level is the variable for discrimination among areas while in the municipality of Salvador (Bahia) is the percentage of people in the low educational level.

For chronic diseases, on the other hand, lags of 20 years are expected to be more plausible [34] .
