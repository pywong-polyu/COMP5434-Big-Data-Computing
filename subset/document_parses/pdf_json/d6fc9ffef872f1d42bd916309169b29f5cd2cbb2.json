Among the new migrants the Latino collective predominate with more than half being women of childbearing age. There are no previous studies exploring breastfeeding experiences of migrants in a country where their mother tongue is spoken. This study aimed to explore Latina migrants' breastfeeding experiences in a Spanishspeaking country. Methods: A descriptive qualitative study was carried out in the main province in southern Andalusia between November 2019 and June 2020. The study used intentional sampling. The study participants were contacted by video calls and data were collected through a semi-structured in-depth interview (n = 19). The interviews were transcribed and analysed by thematic analysis.",

            "text": "Results: The nineteen participants were aged between 22 and 43 years old and came from six different countries in Latin America. The two main categories that emerged were breastfeeding facilitators and barriers, divided into ten interrelated sub-categories: working conditions; precarious socioeconomic conditions; lack of support (health professionals, family and society); physiological changes, pain and fatigue; ignorance and wrong beliefs; support networks (partner, health professionals and family); host country versus home country; religious practices/worship; appropriate attitude, knowledge and experience; and breastfeeding support groups. Most of the study participants stated that their breastfeeding experiences were influenced by barriers such as work and by facilitators such as peer support. Conclusions: More support from caregivers and more sensitivity to cultural diversity were demanded by the women and well-trained professionals are needed to enable breastfeeding for a longer time. This paper provides caregivers, such as nurses, more knowledge about the care demanded by migrant women to ensure a longer breastfeeding experience.",

According to the latest WHO report by country, there is 68.4% exclusive breastfeeding in Spain at 6 weeks postpartum which gradually decreases, reaching 24.7% at 6 months [2] .

Of the foreign population registered in Spain, 24.4% originate from Latin America, of whom 57.5% are women. The feminization of immigrants occurs at the national, regional (Andalusia), and provincial (Seville) levels. The dominant nationalities are Colombian, Venezuelan, Bolivian, Paraguayan, and Peruvian [3] . The Latin immigrant population is of childbearing age (between 20 and 39 years old) when they migrate to Spain [4] . Latina immigrants in Spain are more likely to breastfeed than Spanish women [5] [6] [7] [8] . Previous studies have identified barriers and facilitators unique to Latina women living in non-Spanish-speaking countries [9] . Currently, there are no studies exploring the experiences of Latina women immigrants in a Spanishspeaking country [10] . Although some barriers and facilitators to breastfeed successfully are known, migrant mothers continue to face difficulties, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] leading some researchers to suggest that culturally adapted health services are necessary to maintain breastfeeding rates among migrant mothers [10, 22] . The aim of this study is to explore Latina migrants' breastfeeding experience in a Spanish-speaking country.",

These are: 1) Familiarization with the data through readings and annotations made by both researchers; 2) Coding using a process that involved reading and rereading of the trascriptions to identify patterns and themes; 3) Preparation of a thematic mind map: codes were organized into a hierarchical structure for interpretation; 4) Defining and naming themes and subthemes; and 5) Preparation of the final report with an analysis of the selected fragments. The themes were grouped into linked dimensions to provide knowledge. A preliminary analysis was carried out by the first author. The second researcher examined and compared their analyses independently. The quotes presented in the results section were included for their representativeness and selected after their accuracy was verified.
