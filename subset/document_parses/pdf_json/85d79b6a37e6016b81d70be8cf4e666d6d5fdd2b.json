In addition, magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed lesions in the midbrain suggesting that central sympathetic activation may be involved as well (14) .

SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by attaching its spike protein to the ACE2 receptor, which is abundant in several different cell types and tissues, and the virus therefore can cause injury in several organs (16) . Structural injury to the lungs, kidneys, pancreas, and heart have been reported in Covid-19 acutely as well as months after the occurrence of first symptoms also in low-risk non -hospitalized patients (17, 18) . In addition, Covid-19 may damage the cardiovascular system by other mechanisms e.g. hyperinflammation, hypercoagulability with thrombosis and dysfunction of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (19, 20) . These factors may contribute to the observed and ",

A 24-h ambulatory ECG is recommended to detect arrhythmias, assess average heart rate, detect abnormal pulse reactions and link symptoms to heart rate abnormalities. Figure 2 displays two ECGs from patients who meet the criteria of Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome. The first ECG (Figure 2A) shows short runs of symptomatic sinus tachycardia (marked with orange arrows) and a typical excessive increase in heart rate in the morning when shifting from bedrest to upright body position (green arrow). These are 24-h ECG patterns raising suspicion of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. The second ECG shows an elevated average sinus rate of 93 bpm, which is consistent with inappropriate sinus tachycardia.",

            "text": "We and others have recently presented case reports describing patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome(4,7). This syndrome is characterized by sinus tachycardia and symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia can also be triggered by infections (and associated conditions) and shares some clinical features with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome(8). Importantly, apart from the evident tachycardia, both these conditions are characterized by other non-specific symptoms such as headache, fatigue, and cognitive impairment, resembling symptoms reported in Postacute Covid-19 syndrome.Moreover, Holter-ECG monitoring and measures of heart rate during different physiological challenges may not correlate to reported symptoms in Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome i.e. patients with and without abnormally elevated heart rate may share several symptoms and there is no typical symptom strongly linked to the presence or absence of tachycardia in Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome.Together, this suggests that tachycardia is a common feature in Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome and it may clinically present as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or inappropriate sinus tachycardia. We suggest that persistent symptomatic tachycardia may be a sub-syndrome or specific phenotype of Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome and propose to label it Post-Covid -19 tachycardia syndrome.",

The prevalence of Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome remains difficult to establish and varies by definition and methodology used.A recently published structural follow-up of Swedish health care workers with mild Covid-19 documented a Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome prevalence of 10% (5). The longest follow-up study to date of hospitalized patients reports that >60% suffer fatigue or muscle weakness at six months follow-up (3). Given the extremely high number of reported cases and the uncertain long-term prognosis, Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome is likely to become a major clinical problem for the foreseeing future. Unfortunately, Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome remains a poorly defined clinical syndrome. Typical symptoms include headache, fatigue, dyspnea and mental blurring, but a very extensive list of symptoms reflecting involvement of multiple organs have been reported. Moreover, the type of symptoms reported may differ vastly between individuals with Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome. In addition, symptoms are likely to be caused by several different mechanisms. All of this taken together suggests that Postacute Covid-19 syndrome should not be considered a single clinical syndrome but rather a uniting term characterized by different sub-syndromes and phenotypes (6). In our experience, approximately 25-50% of patients at a tertiary post covid multidisciplinary clinic report tachycardia and/or palpitations persisting 12 weeks or longer. Systematic investigations suggest that 9% of Post-acute Covid-19 syndrome patients report palpitations at six months (3).",
