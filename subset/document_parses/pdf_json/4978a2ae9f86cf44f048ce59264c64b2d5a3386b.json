            "text": "Inflammatory biomarkers may be associated with disease severity and increased mortality in COVID-19 patients but have not been studied in North American populations. We sought to determine whether a set of commonly ordered inflammatory biomarkers can predict 28-day mortality. We analyzed a multi-centered (four) COVID-19 registry cohort from March 4th to December 7th, 2020. This cohort included COVID-19-positive patients admitted to medical wards or intensive care units. Patients presenting to the emergency department for COVID-19 symptoms and then subsequently discharged were also included. We performed Cox-regression analysis to measure whether commonly used biomarkers were associated with an increased 28-day mortality. Of 336 COVID-19-positive patients, 267 required hospital admission, and 69 were seen in the emergency room and discharged. The median age was 63 years (IQR 80-50) and the female-to-male ratio was 49:51. Derivation of internally validated cut-offs suggested that C-reactive protein \u2265 78.4 mg/L, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio \u2265 6.1, lymphocyte-to-white blood cell ratio < 0.127, and a modified Glasgow prognostic score equal to 2 vs. 1 or 0 were associated with the highest increased risk of 28-day mortality. We provide early estimates of cut-off values for inflammatory biomarkers and indices measured at the time of admission that may be useful to clinicians for predicting 28-day mortality in North American COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-COV-2 infection. COVID-19 pathogenesis is associated with upregulation of inflammatory pathways and associated inflammatory biomarkers, which underlie the biological plausibility for their use clinically. For example, severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by excessive expression of pro-inflammatory mediators with a relative paucity of anti-inflammatory mediators [1] . Infection causes the respiratory epithelial cells to release interleukins (IL) such as IL-6 [2] . IL-6 upregulates hepatic C-reactive protein (CRP) production and other acute phase reactants such as ferritin. COVID-19-infected individuals may have higher serum IL-6 levels due to an abnormal population of CD14 + CD16 + inflammatory monocytes. In addition to these pro-inflammatory mediators, severe COVID-19 cases present with lymphopenia, particularly of CD4 + T-cells, which includes regulatory T-cells important in the modulation of pro-inflammatory immune responses [3] . Therefore, both CRP and lymphopenia have been consistently referenced biomarkers for disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Other inflammatory biomarkers share similar biological plausibility. Low serum albumin for example has been postulated to be associated with increased mortality risk in COVID-19 patients due to its antioxidant and anticoagulant properties [4] . For this reason, the modified Glasgow Prognostic score (mGPS) is an interesting choice for investigation, as it is a composite score of CRP and albumin. The hypothesis being that if each of these markers were associated with increased mortality in COVID-19, the composite correction for each may provide a better estimate of its association with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, ratios and composite scores of the complete blood count (CBC) such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) count have been hypothesized and studied in COVID-19. There is significant potential for these ratios, including previously understudied ones such as lymphocyte-to-white blood cell ratio, platelet-to-white blood cell ratio, and platelet-tolymphocyte ratio.",

Studies have examined the prognostic use of inflammatory biomarkers in prognosticating disease severity, 28-day mortality, and progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) [6] [7] [8] . A recent meta-analysis of 16 studies conducted in China, found consistent evidence of a positive association between inflammatory biomarkers and COVID-19 severity, however, noted the need for further research to clarify whether these results would be consistent across different countries and populations [5] . In addition, rigorously validated biomarker cutoffs, that could potentially be used by clinicians to risk stratify patients with COVID-19, have not been established.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, there have been no prior studies examining the association between blood and clinical biomarkers with clinical outcomes in COVID-19 in populations outside of China. A recent meta-analysis which included 16 Chinese studies found an association between several important blood biomarkers and their association with disease severity in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. [5] These included NLR, which was associated with increased odds of developing COVID-19 pneumonitis and worse disease severity [14, 15, 22, 23] . Similarly, CRP above values \u2265 41.8 mg/L, were shown to significantly correlate with worse disease severity, particularly on radiological CT chest findings. [8, 9] There is also an overall paucity of studies examining the predictors of in hospital mortality. Only CRP has been investigated for its association with COVID-19-related mortality and so far, the results have been mixed and inconclusive [18, 19] . To date, L/WBC ratio has not been examined in COVID-19, even though it has predictive implications in distinguishing between bacterial tonsillitis and glandular fever. [24] The biologic plausibility for CRP has been previously discussed. NLR may be associated with fundamental pathogenesis as well. Elevated neutrophils are associated with elevated secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, causing a general inflammatory responses syndrome that may lead to underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome when present systematically. The ratio of NLR encompasses both this general inflammatory state and the underlying disease severity represented by lymphopenia. Similarly, L/WBC may represent the inverse of NLR, whereas the lymphopenia represents underlying disease severity from depleted lymphocytes to the general WBC count, which is mostly made up of neutrophils. Largely, our results are consistent with biomarker studies in COVID-19 from China, but notably our data are from a North American cohort and focuses on 28-day mortality as the primary outcome. Our findings indicate that NLR is a useful biomarker for predicting elevated risk of mortality among patients with COVID-19 within the ward and ICU settings. In particular, at a cut off of greater than or equal to 6.1 and, there was an absolute increase in 28 day in hospital mortality of 19.9% (28.5% vs. 8.6%). This is an easily accessible biomarker available as a part of routine laboratory investigations ordered by clinicians, which can be used to risk stratify COVID-19 patients admitted to the ward or ICU. We also found CRP was a strong predictor, and admission to hospital and ICU. At our derived cutoff of 78.4 mg/L, CRP was associated with an absolute increase in mortality of 15.6% (24.5% vs 8.9%). However, unlike NLR, CRP may not be routinely performed in all admitting patients and, therefore, is likely not as easily accessible. Lastly, we are the first to investigate the role of L/WBC ratio as a biomarker in COVID-19 patients. L/WBC ratio had the largest effect with an absolute decrease in mortality of 17.2.4% (7.0% vs. 26.3%) with a cut off at 0.127. Like NLR, L/WBC is readily available as a part of the complete blood count. Of note, our reported optimal cut-off values are consistent with studies ",

The mGPS is validated for prognostication of relapse and increased mortality in different types of cancer [25] [26] [27] , and can also predict clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [28] While no studies to date have investigated its usefulness in COVID-19, we have demonstrated that mGPS is a potential tool for predicting risk of 28-day mortality. For a score of 2 vs. 1 or 0, we found an absolute increase of 26.3% (26.3% vs. 0.0%) mortality risk. This was the largest increase amongst our biomarkers but needs to be interpreted more cautiously given the high proportion of missing mGPS data. Also, while an mGPS score of 2 versus 1 or 0 conferred the greatest relative risk of death compared to cutoffs in other biomarkers in the unadjusted analysis, this did not hold in the adjusted analysis. The relationship between mGPS and COVID-19 needs to be studied further to validate its role in prognostication.",

Notably, our analysis did not support D-dimer's use for prognosticating mortality risk, however, it must note that we are limited in our recommendation due to the high degree of missing d-dimer data. However, our analysis did find that it was significant in predicting admission to hospital. Previous studies have been inconsistent in reporting the role of d-dimer, varying from reports to support its role in predicting disease severity, to its association with modestly increased mortality risk and even extreme high risk of mortality [8, 11, [17] [18] [19] . Other biomarkers studied include platelets and lymphocytes. These biomarkers have had very little literature written regarding associations with disease severity in COVID-19. However, our findings are mostly in keeping with these earlier findings. [8, 32] . Our analysis found varying associations between biomarkers and disease severity (admission to ICU or hospital) and 28-day mortality. The reason for why specific biomarkers may predict disease severity (admission to hospital or ICU) but not overall mortality or vice-versa may be explained by correlations between these biomarkers and clinician decision making.",

Our analysis of the previously studied biomarkers bolsters evidence for generalizability in North American populations and provides specific cut-off values for clinicians to utilize for predicting mortality. We believe that these preliminary North American studies provide clinicians an important piece of information that helps determine objective risk stratification. Interestingly, there is often a discrepancy of underlying pathophysiology that portends a worst outcome and the initial presentation of COVID-19 patients. Inflammatory biomarkers and useful cut offs can be used to help make objective risk stratification of patients. This can be useful in patients who come in initially well but have elevated inflammatory markers, which may prompt for more initial aggressive monitoring and treatment. Furthermore, this study is the first North American study that may serve as the basis for integration clinical prediction models validated for specific questions, including treatment decisions.",

The missingness of our data varied by biomarker and was associated with disease severity, namely biomarkers such as CRP or Ferritin were more likely to be ordered in patients in the ICU. Although we used multiple imputation to account for the missing data, there are known limitations to the method [33] . Furthermore, it is difficult to deal with potential superimposed infection that may confound whether the biomarkers truly represent COVID-19 infection or the unknown superimposed infection. We think that using admission blood at least reduces the risk of bias but avoids potential infection that often occurs in COVID-19 patients. However, it would be difficult to rule out this confounder if potential infections occurred prior to admission. Lastly, given that all the biomarkers tested exhibited significant correlation, multivariate models were not produced, as the models would experience high degrees of multicollinearity.",

The validation of these specific biomarkers may be useful in monitoring response to therapies, especially as more and more drug therapies are developed and tested. We derived novel cutoff values for these biomarkers which can be used at the time of admission to help predict mortality and inform clinicians' decision-making in North American populations. Because components of the complete blood count are readily available, we would recommend the routine use of these biomarkers in prognosticating disease courses.
