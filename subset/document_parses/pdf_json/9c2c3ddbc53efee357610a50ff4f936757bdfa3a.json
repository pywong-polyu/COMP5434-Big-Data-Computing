The fact that, soon afterwards, on May 15, 2020, the two million people Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the end of COVID-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper we investigate the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections. Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate \u03ba by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only improve the \u03ba-value by \u223c 15% as compared to the much bearable state of social and economical life wherein (justifiable) wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforced/followed.

In this vein, the time evolution of COVID-19 disease in the two million people Slovenia certainly deserves special consideration, as on 15 May 2020, concluding that this country has the best epidemic situation in Europe, Prime Minister Janez Jan\u0161ka declared the end of the COVID-19 epidemic within Slovenian borders. 10 Subsequent developments (only four new cases between 15 and 24 May, 11 cf.

As visible there, letting alone the strong fluctuations (possibly also due to the different methodology of reporting cases 11 ) in the initial stage, there is a transition from a high-\u03ba regime to a low-\u03ba regime. Definitely, the COVID-19 restrictive measures worked. Interestingly (or, perhaps better, significantly), the low-\u03ba regime appears to set in on 17-18 March (n = 275 \u2212 286), suggesting a population's prudent reaction even prior the official lockdown enforcement (20 March). This is even more important given the fact that, in view of the finite incubation time (\u223c 5 days), reported cases pertain to infections that occurred earlier. An overall linear trend is clearly visible in the low-\u03ba regime of Figure 2a.

We could not find any significant difference in N. With the value N = 1470 (to be compared with the cumulative number of cases 1468 on 24 May) in hands we have computed via equation (4) the time dependence of infection rate difference could thus be obtained (\u03ba L \u2243 0.122 day \u22121 versus \u03ba E \u2243 0.140 day \u22121 ), leading to the schematic representation depicted in Figure 2b.We used the piecewise linear approximation ofFigure 2bfor the time dependent infection rate \u03ba \u2192 \u03ba(t) to numerically integrate the differential equation(1). Results of this numerical (a) In the short initial phase of the epidemic, the number of infected individuals growths exponentially in time, which allows to estimate the initial value of the infection rate (\u03ba = 0.464 day \u22121 . The curve of the logarithmic derivative d ln n(t)/dt =\u1e45(t)/n(t) (blue line in panel b), which is merely obtained from epidemiological reports without any theoretical assumption, exhibits a linear trend that validates the description based on the logistic model. The carrying capacity N(= 1470) is obtained from the intersection with the x-axis. The curve of the time-dependent infection rate \u03ba = \u03ba(t) (blue line in panel c) deduced by means of equation(5)suggests a piecewise linear approximation. Noteworthy, the infection rate \u03ba E = 0.140 day \u22121 after lockdown easing is only slightly larger than the value \u03ba L = 0.122 day \u22121 estimated for strict lockdown.simulations for the total and daily number of cases are depicted by the green curves in Curves for cumulative (panel a) and daily (panel b) number of cases based on epidemiological reports and simulated as described in the main text. Notice that the first peak around t = 73 day \u22121 does not represent a spurious effect of fluctuations. It is a real effect reproduced by numerical simulation (green curve), which nicely demonstrates how restrictive measures enforced stopped the explosive (unrestricted) evolution depicted in red. The orange curves depict results that could have been achieved if, instead of severe lockdown, the much milder restrictions effective on 20 April were imposed starting 20 March. In addition, we also show there simulations of how the Slovenian COVID-19 epidemic would have evolved if: (a) no restriction measure had been enforced. The (red) curves indicate that the result could have been grim: 769 new infections in five days or 493 new cases in three days. Again, restriction measures were definitely necessary.(b) instead of severe lockdown, much more bearable restrictive measures as effective on20 April would have been imposed on 20 March. The rather modest differences between the orange and green curves suggest that, unless the healthcare system capacity is overwhelmed, (justified) face masks and social distancing rules can be comparably efficient in mitigating the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread with draconian lockdown while obviating paralyzing economic and social life.
