In this context, it has been also suggested that air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from coronavirus. For instance, analysis of the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV-1 outcomes in 2003 demonstrated that in heavily polluted regions the risk of dying from the disease was >80% higher compared with areas with relatively clean air [2] . Furthermore, a correlation -but not necessarily a causal link-between NO2 levels (a pollutant produced mostly by diesel vehicles) and COVID-19 cases has been recently reported [3] , while another study supports the hypothesis that the viral infectivity is higher in hinterland cities rather than coastal areas due to airflow conditions that prevent dispersal of air pollution [4] .",

So the prediction of Y is significantly improved by including X as a predictor. Let Y = daily deaths be the potential outcome in the population of a country exposed to X = pollution concentration.

First, our causal modeling is designed to handle pairs of variables, in which only linear relationships between predictor (pollution) and target variable (casualties) are considered, thus it may suffer from a typical limitation when a third variable is engaged. For instance, variation of meteorological factors (such as temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and prevailing winds) confines the vertical distribution of air contaminants, but also modulates human activities such as commuting choices and leisure occupation, and would subsequently impact the relationship between PM and the spread of infections. Consequently, the second issue is the potential of missing other important confounding factors (Supporting Information). A third limitation of this study is missing data. The estimate results obtained here are preliminary and must be treated with caution when analyzing, as in our case, short time series.",
