Drastic control measures, such as complete lockdown, are effective epidemic controls, yet in practice one hopes that a partial shutdown would suffice. It is an open problem to determine how much mobility can be allowed while controlling an outbreak. In this paper, we use statistical models to relate human mobility to the excess death in Ecuador while controlling for demographic factors. The mobility index provided by GRANDATA, based on mobile phone users, represents the change of number of out-of-home events with respect to a benchmark date (March 2nd, 2020) . The study confirms the global trend that more men are dying than expected compared to women, and that people under 30 show less deaths than expected, particularly individuals younger than 20 with a death rate reduction between 22 and 27%. The weekly median mobility time series shows a sharp decrease in human mobility immediately after a national lockdown was declared on March 17, 2020 and a progressive increase towards the pre-lockdown level within two months. Relating median mobility to excess deaths shows a lag in its effect: first, a decrease in mobility in the previous two to three weeks decreases excess death and, more novel, we found an increase of mobility variability four weeks prior increases the number of excess deaths.",

Ecuador, like many Latin American countries 1 , has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 242 thousand reported cases and 14,500 deaths by the end of January 2021. The first confirmed case of COVID-19, reported on February 29, 2020, was a woman in her '70s who returned from Spain two weeks prior 2 . On March 13, with 23 confirmed cases, that same woman became the first COVID-19 confirmed fatality 3 . By April, Ecuador emerged as an \"epicenter\" of the pandemic in Latin America, with reports of uncollected dead bodies remaining for days in the streets 4 . To control the outbreak, schools and universities in Ecuador were closed on March 13th 5, 6 , and on March 17th, Ecuador implemented a national lockdown 7 . Both of these measures decrease the spread of the disease by reducing contacts between infected and susceptible individuals. It is possible to measure the compliance to these orders by tracking human mobility derived from cell phone data. Such data has emerged as a useful tool to measure human mobility and its relationship to the spread of diseases 8, 9, 10 including SARS-COV-2 8, 11, 12 , malaria 13,14 cholera 15 , measles 16 , dengue 17, 18 , and Ebola 19, 20 .",

Due to limited testing, the reported daily counts of COVID-19 incidence and death underestimate the true magnitude of the outbreak.

From a health care and societal perspective, quantifying the excess death associated to an epidemic is informative [21] [22] [23] and is the most reliable measure of current COVID-19 data available 24 .

            "text": "In this paper, we empirically address the hypothesis that a reduction in mobility predicts a decrease in the future number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We relate the temporal dynamic of excess deaths within each of the 24 provinces in Ecuador (see Fig. 1 ) to human mobility characteristics derived from mobile phones data provided by GRANDATA through the United Nations Development Program. We show that the implementation of lockdown can dramatically reduce the risk of excess deaths especially for provinces that were experiencing www.nature.com/scientificreports/ surges of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (e.g. Guayas and Santa Elena). For other provinces, lockdown prevented and delayed the wave of excess deaths by several months (e.g. Pichincha). We demonstrate that both, the median mobility and the variability of mobility as measured by the Interquartile Range (IQR), are statistically significant explanatory variables for excess deaths; that is, that the effect of lockdowns are mediated, at least partially, through reduction in individual-level mobility. However, the mobility data lacks demographic covariates, limiting its predictive power given the importance of demographic characteristics in risk of both COVID-19 infection and death. Given the usefulness of mobility data to predict epidemic progression, we suggest that future collection of mobility data have demographic covariates to increase the predictive power of predictive models. This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides background information on Ecuador and the need to relate population mobility to excess deaths. Section 3 describes the mobility data and the death records used to estimate excess deaths. Section 4 describes the statistical methods whose results are shown in Sect. 5 and discussed in Sect. 6. We conclude in Sect. 7.",

As for demographics, we found similar patterns to those observed in other countries, for example we found that men had a death rate 183% of the expected value, while the rate in women was 153% of expected deaths; and even though we find that excess death increased with age, the group mostly affected is the [60, 69] age group with a death rate 233% of the expected value, while the age group with people older than 80 had a death rate 160% of the expected level.

Using the methodology from 27,28 , we calculate time series of weekly all cause Excess Death Factor (EDF), the ratio of observed over expected deaths, in each province stratified by age group and sex. Spatial-temporal analysis of these time series of the weekly reveals a wave of COVID that originated in Guayas and spread through the rest of Ecuador over a period of six months, from March 2020 to August 2020. This suggests that Ecuador suffered from a single outbreak with a complex spatiotemporal pattern rather than two distinct waves. Physiologically, the dynamics of excess deaths time series depends on the number of infected individuals in previous weeks. The latter depends on many factors, including human behavior related to the mixing between infected and susceptible individuals. We expect that behavior change during and after the strict lockdown will have a delayed impact on the dynamic of excess deaths. In this paper, we hypothesize that the magnitude of the epidemic (as measured by excess deaths) depends on characteristics of past population mobility distributions. Specifically, we relate weekly excess deaths to mobility characteristics derived from mobile phone data provided by GRANDATA through the United Nations Development Program to quantify compliance with mandatory lockdown orders in Ecuador, and changing mobility patterns after the strict lockdown is lifted.",

Further, the GRANDATA excludes people with limited activity, essentially excluding proportion of individuals staying home, including those telecommuting.

Ethics committee approval for the use of health patient information and death records was obtained from the Ethical Committee for Expedited Review of COVID-19 Research of the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health. The study has been approved by the Human Subjects Research Review Board, Los Alamos National Laboratory. The predictor variables included sex, age group and their interactions, province and week of the year as a factor. Using this fitted model, we predict the time series of weekly expected number of deaths from all causes in each province, disaggregated by age and sex. The fitting of this model was described in 27 . The excess death is the difference between the observed number of deaths in 2020 and the model predicted expected number of deaths; that is, the number of deaths above what would have been expected in 2020 were it a typical year. The Excess Death Factor (EDF) is the ratio of the observed over the expected number of deaths. The EDF implicitly normalizes each province by its population size, allowing them to be compared across provinces. An EDF of 2 means that there are twice as many deaths during the pandemic than in a normal year. The presumption is that these deaths are attributed to COVID-19, although there is uncertainty in that attribution. Indeed, it is possible that mortality from all causes is higher because the healthcare system is overwhelmed, or lower because the strict lockdown likely prevented some deaths (e.g., by reducing the number of vehicle accidents). However, the EDF gives a much clearer image of COVID-19 associated mortality than the confirmed COVID deaths.",

We made three key discoveries: (1) excess deaths spread across the country in a west-to-east gradient with the epicenter focusing on Guayas, (2) lockdowns lead to a large reduction in local, individual-level mobility, and (3) both the median and variability of mobility indices are reasonable predictor variables of excess deaths although the relationship between mobility and excess deaths is complicated. Based on these observations, it is conceivable that local lockdowns should be implemented in a more targeted manner: immediately for provinces that experience on-going COVID-19 outbreaks to prevent large magnitude of excess deaths; and delayed for provinces that are geographically far away from the epi-center of the outbreak. This approach could strike a more overall favorable balance between infection control and the social disruption caused by lockdowns.",

            "text": "The complex relationship between mobility and excess deaths is illustrated by the dynamics in Guayas, where the epidemic was already a significant cause of mortality when the national lockdown orders were issued; in this context, the effect of reduced average mobility might have a reduced effect as enough people are infected to www.nature.com/scientificreports/ sustain transmission even given reduced contact rates. However, in regions where the lockdown occurred before there was significant excess death, the slow increase in mobility corresponded to an increase in EDF. While exact causation is difficult in these studies, our study is consistent with the idea that NPIs are partially mediated though reduced mobility and that those effects are strongest when the endogenous transmission rates are low within a given region due to a limited number of infected persons. Mobility can serve as an indicator of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a community. However, its utility is limited by several factors. First, the relationship between mobility and excess deaths depends on the context of the epidemic and government response, as demonstrated by our analysis in this work. For example, we found that the mobility measure negatively correlates with EDF with a two-weeks lag for provinces (e.g. Guayas) experiencing the first excess deaths wave in April and May 2020. This negative correlation is because of implementation of lockdown while increasing deaths as a result of wide-spread SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, we found positive correlations between the two in provinces (e.g. Santo Domingo) that did not experience large outbreaks during the first wave of excess deaths. Presumably, this is because as lockdown is relaxed, increases in mobility led to increases in excess deaths. Second, we and others 11,12 often use a single or a couple of measures (median or variability) of mobility; however, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 may be impacted differently by different types of mobility. For example, it was suggested long-distance travel may help the dispersal of the pathogen 11, 43 In addition, mobility measures often summarize travels of different types, i.e. grocery shopping, travel to work, go to park etc. These different types may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 spread differently.",

The data reveal that the provinces were hit by the pandemic in a clear spatio-temporal pattern, with the peak EDF moving across Ecuador over time in a relatively short six-month period. A statistical analysis reveals that the relationship between human mobility and EDF show two archetypes, one pattern for the provinces whose peak EDF occurred during the strict lockdown, and another pattern for the provinces who reached the peak of their EDF after the conclusion of the strict lockdown.
