On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) a worldwide pandemic. 1 As of April 2021, WHO reported 138,688,383 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,978,935 deaths attributed to COVID-19 globally. 1 An immediate concern of U.S. military leaders was the threat to force health protection, operational readiness, and mission accomplishment from potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to military service members and their beneficiaries. Although military treatment facilities across the DoD quickly implemented the best available emerging evidence to respond to COVID-19, military bases located in Okinawa, Japan, faced unique challenges in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges included language barriers to facilitate contact-tracing mechanisms, monitoring personnel movement, monitoring health risks, monitoring well-being of III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) service members and dependents, and optimizing interoperability among military and civilian stakeholders (Camp Foster, Kadena Air Base, Camp Courtney, Okinawa Ministry of Health, Defense Health Agency, and CDC).",

After graduating from York College of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing, I was commissioned as a Navy Nurse Corps officer through the Nurse Candidate Program in December 2014. My first tour of duty was at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, first working on the high-risk obstetrics/gynecology and postpartum unit and later transferring to the emergency department and becoming a certified emergency nurse with further training in trauma, burns, sexual assault, and en route care. From 2018 to 2020, I was assigned to the III MEF Marines in Okinawa, Japan, as the emergency/trauma nurse. As an officer in charge of the Medical Skills Training Center, I was selected to work at the COVID-19 Operational Response Cell as a qualified fleet Marine force warfare officer, a key leadership position in the COVID-19 operation and a unique role for a Navy nurse.",

Service members received a follow-up telephone call for confirmation of COVID-19 test results. During the first several months of the pandemic, obtaining COVID-19 test results took three-to-seven days. At the beginning of the pandemic, the U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa did not have capabilities to evaluate COVID-19 tests, so the tests were mailed to Mainland Japan or South Korea for testing. Since the COVID-19 pandemic was a public health crisis, the Health Insurance Portability and Account Ability Act (HIPAA) was waived for reporting test results. This allowed for subordinate units of III MEF to have increased accountability of the health status for each of their service members and their families (both CONUS and OCONUS locations).",

The Okinawan patient information was taken directly from a local government-affiliated website, which tracked each positive COVID-19 case. 2 Additionally, a weekly report of current contact tracing was sent to the COVID-19 Operational Response Cell from the Okinawa Prefecture Government to gauge future positive cases based on employment, travel, etc., and proved to be a valuable resource for the daily health risk assessment. The potential risks to the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) personnel were evaluated daily, sent to the COVID-19 Operational Response Cell commanding officer, and then sent to the III MEF commanding officer.

This was recognized when a quality data review was conducted on the U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa's tracking system when access was granted. Initially, each of the three COVID response teams (18th Air Wing, Joint COVID-19 Response Cell (JCRC), and COVID Operational Response Cell) were collecting data and working asynchronously to develop a contingency plan. This made standard operating procedures, communication, and the delivery of care extremely challenging for the healthcare team, since each of these medical units did not have communication with the COVID-19 Operational Response Cell or each other initially.

It was established at the start of the pandemic to provide Okinawa with a central hub for all COVID-19-related information for all forces located on the island (finding/stopping spread source). Initially, the joint aspect of the JCRC was the care and treatment of all SOFA members on Okinawa, not necessarily because of having joint service participation in the JCRC. Although the U.S. Naval Hospital took the lead for the majority of contact tracing throughout the island, the JCRC provided support to the Naval Hospital by finding key information and communicating findings to commanders. 3 Concurrently, the COVID-19 Operational Response Cell had generated similar contacttracing teams being executed with a mixture of medical and non-medical members from III MEF. The success of both contract tracing teams has allowed for the quarantine and isolation of COVID-19 positive and exposed individuals to decrease and slow the spread of the virus throughout Okinawa and successfully isolated two clusters of COVID-19 cases on Okinawa (Fig. 4) .

A synthesis of leadership and planning among each stakeholder and frequent communication among those on the island would enhance the response of SOFA members in Okinawa. Transparency regarding discovered resources between response cells would result in increased knowledge and readiness among forces. 2) Leveraging personnel with required language skills for translating information and communicating with key Okinawan stakeholders. Effective communication ensures a coordinated response for personnel located on military installations. 3) Developing a plan to check in with service members during prolonged periods of isolation and decreased interaction. In Okinawa, where many already feel isolated because of geographic location, this is important. III MEF commanders ordered all nonessential personnel to telework/isolate at home in an attempt to preserve the forces. Most off-base establishments were declared off-limits, to include restaurants, gyms, and salons. If employees in the on-base dining facilities became symptomatic and were tested for COVID-19, the services closed for cleaning. Boxed meals or Meals Ready to Eat were provided to marines and sailors in their barracks until proper sanitation of the facility had occurred. Service members had very little human interaction during this period, especially enlisted marines and sailors in the barracks. This combination of factors created greater isolation for service members. Proactively anticipating a plan for this may contribute to reducing mental health concerns during future pandemics.",
