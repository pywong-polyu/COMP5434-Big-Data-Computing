The study revealed that some of the study participants' mobility decisions and future employment prospects were largely impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even those who had their internships abroad confirmed, uncertainties abound whether it will be done remotely or physically. Also, the switching from physical to online classes makes students-students and students-lectures interaction and relationship very challenging resulting in some cases, poor academic performance, loneliness, depression, and mental health problems. Besides, we discovered some positive endorsements towards the Danish government's handling of the pandemic. Finally, the study proposed for a complete opening of the higher educational institutions and libraries in Denmark for physical teaching and learning to occur, with adherence to the safety protocols.",

            "text": "The globalization of the world has accelerated the quest for students to cross over national and regional borders to acquire new and sophisticated knowledge, broaden their horizons, and pursue other objectives. Globally, an enormous 1.5 billion international and tourist travelers are on the move (Khanna, 2021) . Within the cleavages of the European Union (EU), a total of 17.5 and 17.9 million movements were reported in 2018 and 2019 respectively (Fries-Tersch et al., 2021) . Research demonstrates that between 1963 and 2017 the number of students in foreign countries had increased by 9 folds, and that the demand for cross-border education would increase to 7.2 million by 2025 (Institute of International Education, 2018) . Nonetheless, the great impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has shaped the mobility decisions and patterns of students in both the Global North and South (Choudaha, 2021) . The travel restrictions prompted a significant number of airplanes been grounded resulting to more than 70% reduction in air traffic (Gammeltoft-Hansen et al., 2020) . More so, some global travel restrictions -necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic -are still in place. However, about 180 countries or areas have adopted 755 exceptions paving ways for mobility despite the travel restrictions, and 16 countries, or areas issued 21 new exceptions while 11 countries, or territories removed 15 exceptions (IOM, 2021) . Therefore, we argued that the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions could have impacted on international and domestic (Danish) students in Denmark. These inter alia included the mobility decisions of some students seeking to obtain internship -degree/credit mobility abroad.",

To begin with, Abdulai and Roosalu (2020) considered the recognition of the degrees obtained in European universities, low tuition fee charges, and employment prospects as the push and pull factors determining the mobility decisions of many sub-Saharan Africans studying in Estonian universities. Choudaha (2021) also analyzes how external events (such as the terrorist attacks of 2001 in the USA, the global financial recession in 2008, Brexit, and as well as the American presidential elections of 2016) have induced the choices and favorites of global students' mobility decisions.",

The term became popular in the 1990s due to the role of ideas in the formation and transformation of institutions (Hall, 1993; Hay, 2001) . Discursive clout emanates from the capacity of sentient agents with good ideas to use discourse effectually in terms of constructing a discursive coalition for reform against deep-rooted interests in the coordinative policy sphere or to inform and orient the public in the communicative sphere (Schmidt, 2009) . We argued that, to curtail further spread of the COVID-19 virus, restrictions/protocols were coordinated, and communicated to the public. These restrictions have impacted the mobility decisions of international and domestic students and affected teaching and learning in Demark and other countries in the world.",

Indeed, contemporary mobility should be understood from the social logics with a comparison of a \"view from above\" and a \"view from the ground\" (B\u00fcscher et al., 2011) . Globalization, which is inseparable from critical mobility, should be conceptualized as a series of adapting and co-evolving global systems each characterized by unpredictability, irreversibility, and co-evolution (Urry, 2005; Cresswell, 2010) . Cresswell (2010) argues for a more finely developed politics of mobility that takes into serious consideration of both levels of mobility and immobility in terms of motive force, speed, rhythm, route, experience, and friction as the cardinal points to the understanding of mobilities. Similarly, movements of all forms including international students' mobility should be given more credence by researchers, policy makers, and political actors (Urry, 2011) .",

With the pandemic, the precarious conditions of internationals searching for student jobs are expected to exacerbate, as many places as possible of work are either closed or not working to full capacity. In support of this, it has been projected that the COVID-19 pandemic may have a serious impact on the careers of immediate university graduates in terms of facing the challenges of the global recession and the possible lack of jobs therein (Sahu, 2020) . The combined effect of the pandemic is some level of anxiety among the university community. This anxiety may lead to some negative effects on the learning and psychological health of students as well as uncertainty about future employment prospects.",

The physical interaction with other students and the possibility of carrying on a discussion did impact his learning outcome. On the contrary, Zoom meetings' \"breakout rooms\" did cause a tremendous impact on his learning as most other classmates turned off their webcams and muted their microphones during the \"breakout rooms\" discussion. Additionally, the virtual teaching and learning impacted the study participant's mobility decision greatly. For instance, TB moving from home to attend lectures physically implies that the different qualities physical and online learning environments offer had influenced TB's mobility decision within Denmark as seen in his lived experience. Moreover, the participant considered attending physical class as the best window for him to understand the lectures delivered, yet, at the time of the interview, that option was not on the table for the participant. There was a total lockdown; thus, teaching and learning and any other activity from the university had to migrate from physical to virtual learning platforms. This was a challenging situation to the participant, and almost every other student at the time. This is because there was no opportunity to attend normal lectures, and no option either to attend social gathering within the university and the host society. A study shows that more than 6 out of 10 students have experienced a decrease in learning and activity, while many also missed the social activities associated with taking an education as participant TB recounted (Ministry of Education and Research, 2021). Besides the shift to online classes, the missed social interaction with other classmates has impacted TB negatively, as his ideal ambition was to do project work with others, which could not be materialized (TB, domestic student). On the other hand, the sudden shift to emergency remote teaching did not impact the quality of learning for participant LL as he indicated:",

Mind you, without the COVID-19 pandemic, all lectures at the university would have been conducted physically. Considering this, students would have no option than to come for lectures at the university. Clearly, LL's mobility decision had been impacted by the switch to online lectures at Aalborg University due to the COVID-19 safety protocols. To corroborate this, the comfort of working from home and the reduced noise from people around him have caused an increase in learning and concentration during class. Similarly, the positive flexibility and comfort of learning from online classes did also have a positive impact on participant NH, as she stated: \u2026this semester lectures are online of course it is not the best solution to have it online for some, but I actually think it worked out really well and then to see all the positive things about online teaching and I am really positive about it (NH, domestic student).",

Due to the drastic change to emergency remote teaching, teachers could not communicate properly to the students about the assignment in the course. The lack of physical teaching and learning with the associated benefits of face-to-face interactions, gaining contextual knowledge, intercultural competence, among others could as well be linked to critical mobility perspectives and communicative discourse underpinnings. The mobility turns amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, that is restrictions on teaching and learning to safe life and the economy leads to the missed opportunities that come with the normal teaching and learning.

Accordingly, international students are chiefly impacted by the shutdown since they lacked a social network in Copenhagen; they characteristically have a social network that comprises mostly international students. During the lockdown, this unstable network became even more defenseless leading to some foreign students at the Copenhagen University battling with isolation, loneliness, and anxiety during lockdown in Denmark (Oxlund et al., 2020) .

Thus, international students migrate to the host universities and communities with their cultural variablespractices, behaviors, beliefs, values, world views, among others. Socialization among international students, domestic students, and the host country nationals could create an avenue for intercultural interaction, learning, and meaning making. However, with the COVID-19 restrictions, the integration/socialization of internationals in Denmark was affected and as well as their mobility decisions. From the forgone discussions, the desire to move and integrate into the Danish culture is high among the participants. However, the institutional restrictions -lockdown and social distancing -imposed are making mobility and integration a mirage, nearly impossible, to say the least. The above perspectives could be linked well with critical mobility theory due to the uncertainty regarding moving forward even if one craves the need to progress in terms of mobility and socialization (Heidegger, 2002) . Thus, systems and institutions could be both facilitating and intervening factors in various forms of global mobilities (Sheller & Urry, 2016; Cresswell, 2014) . In this regard, certain places of socialization could have been opened to facilitate the integration of international students with strict adherence with the COVID-19 pandemic protocols.",

To corroborate this, a study revealed that since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated measures and restriction, students, and the general society by far have not been able to have a normal life -physically meeting family and friends, attending cultural events and festivals, among others. To be measured, it has been explained that the cultural and creative sectors (CCS) of every economy particularly Europe have been hit hard by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic (Voldere et al., 2021) .

Imperatively, the actions taken to save human life and to save the Danish health system from being overstretched have in the same vein put untold strain on the mobility decision and general lifestyle of the Danish students and the academic community -the facilitation actions from the state becomes the conundrum for Danish students and the public generally (S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m et al., 2013; Schmidt, 2008) .
