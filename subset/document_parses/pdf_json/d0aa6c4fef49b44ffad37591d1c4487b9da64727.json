In both cohorts, development of ARDS was independently associated with higher hospital and ICU mortality, accrual of fewer VFDs, and prolonged hospital and ICU LOS. While it may not be surprising that severe ARDS portends a worse prognosis than moderate or mild disease, the varied ability to detect statistically significant mortality differences based on severity of ARDS is, to our knowledge, a novel finding. Most recently, Fuchs et al. showed no detectable difference in 28-day mortality among ventilated patients with or without ARDS, but did find that severe ARDS served as a risk factor for 2-year mortality [17] . Our significant results for in-hospital mortality compared to the results of Fuchs et al. may relate to differences in overall severity of illness and our focus on a predominantly medical ICU population with sepsis. Our findings are directly relevant to the growing interest in prognostic enrichment for improving critical care trial design. Prognostic enrichment is defined as preferentially targeting enrollment of patients with the highest rates of disease-attributable (and, hopefully, modifiable) outcomes-in this case, mortality. With increasing recognition that current definitions of sepsis and ARDS do not identify patients with uniform and distinct disease processes, and that this heterogeneity may be confounding clinical trials, prognostic enrichment may offer one reasonable approach [30] . While targeting patients with more severe ARDS has had some success [6, 31] , this study provides the first empiric evidence to support such a strategy. Our findings suggest that prognostic enrichment focusing on patients with severe ARDS, either as defined by the Berlin definition of P/F < 100, or perhaps by P/F < 120, as suggested by our data-driven comparison of mortality risk, may identify individuals most likely to die from factors related specifically to ARDS, and therefore may provide a population in which we are better able to identify beneficial treatments. This finding is consistent with a prior autopsy study which reported that patients with severe ARDS were more likely to experience refractory hypoxemia prior to death and have diffuse alveolar damage than patients with mild or moderate disease who were more likely to die of refractory shock [32] . We also estimated AF ARDS and population AF ARDS and found similar results in both cohorts. Attributable fraction of mortality is the proportion of deaths that can be statistically attributed to an underlying cause, in this case, ARDS [28] . Population attributable fraction of mortality is the proportion of deaths within a cohort of patients, all of whom are at risk of the underlying cause in question: In this case, the proportion of deaths due to ARDS among all patients with sepsis. The AF ARDS was 27% in EARLI and 37% in VALID. The population AF ARDS was 16% in EARLI and 18% in VALID. It is helpful to put these results in the context of other studies estimating attributable mortality of important critical care diseases. The attributable fraction of mortality from sepsis was recently estimated at 15% [33] . The population attributable fraction of mortality from ICU-acquired infections and ICU delirium has been estimated at 11% and 7%, respectively [29, 34] . While ARDS may confer mortality fractions notably higher than these other important ICU conditions, any absolute changes in mortality by fully treating or preventing ARDS would still be relatively low. As recently illustrated by Shankar-Hari et al., these data have major implications for considering the size of clinical trials necessary to detect such changes [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 756, "end": 760, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1565, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1639, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1640, "end": 1643, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2433, "end": 2437, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2675, "end": 2679, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3253, "end": 3257, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3403, "end": 3407, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3408, "end": 3411, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3776, "end": 3780, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This study has several strengths. First, it includes two large and diverse prospective cohorts of critically ill patients from distinct centers. The similarity of the association between ARDS and in-hospital mortality in these very different populations strengthens the validity of our findings and suggests generalizability. Second, we found relatively consistent results within each cohort when adjusting for up to three distinct severity of illness metrics. Third, in developing adjusted models, we searched methodically for possible confounders and did not find other contributory variables. Fourth, all patients were meticulously phenotyped for both sepsis and ARDS. Finally, in contrast to most studies assessing ARDS and attributable mortality, this study expands the populations This study has limitations. First, there were some discrepancies in specific data collected in each cohort. Most notably, we did not have information on code status or admission from a nursing home in the VALID population. However, incorporation of these variables did not significantly affect any of the EARLI models. In addition, we were unable to generate APACHE III scores from the VALID data. To better align the cohorts, we chose to utilize APACHE II for our primary analyses. While we adjusted for multiple confounders, the possibility of residual confounding remains. Specifically, we did not control for measures of other acute organ failures beyond what is captured in APACHE and SAPS scores. As depicted in our DAG, we hypothesize that other acute organ failures may lie on the indirect causal path between ARDS and death, and so were not included in our models. However, if the association between ARDS and mortality is driven predominantly by other organ failures (such as renal or hepatic) that develop later in a patient's ICU stay, or those variables are instead predominantly confounders, our analysis may not precisely capture that relationship. This caveat is important because some prior studies have identified increased mortality in ARDS with other organ failures or comorbidities [35, 36] . Our study does not explain the cause of the observed higher mortality in patients with severe ARDS, but future studies focusing on severe ARDS should explore this question. Because we began enrollment and data collection for both cohorts before the advent of Sepsis 3, our coding for sepsis reflects the prior definition. However, as we enrolled critically ill Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for in-hospital mortality stratified by severity of ARDS. In addition to severity of illness variables listed in the table, adjusted models for EARLI include age, limitation on code status at admission, and being admitted from a nursing home. Adjusted models for VALID include age patients, it is unlikely that our patients would not fulfill the more recent criteria for sepsis [37] .
