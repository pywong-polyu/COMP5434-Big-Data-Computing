This makes the media a critical source of crisis exposure. People hope that knowledge will provide security and help orient themselves in new and unfamiliar situations [2] . In such cases, the media provides an irreplaceable opportunity to inform the public immediately, while at the same time it can become an extremely powerful source of stress, that leads to a significant deterioration in the overall public mental health [3] . Paradoxically, efforts to communicate critical information regarding risks and safety during COVID-19 pandemic, may have a negative impact on the well-being, resulting from the repeated media exposure to the outbreak [4] .",

Yet in an uncertain critical situation, when a lack of clarity becomes universal, stressogenic information might even have a stronger effect on the well-being [3, 7] . In 2020, the top six COVID-19-related terms searched in Google were \"coronavirus\", \"corona\", \"COVID\", \"virus\", \"corona virus\", and \"COVID-19\"; at the same time there was a wide spread of false news and conspiracies [8] . Some social media circulated faulty messages, which caused psychological distress both directly and indirectly [9] . World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the public of an \"infodemic\"-overabundance of excess information [10] . Information overflow may induce panic in affected populations and may create a vicious circle by further exacerbating the stress [11] . The response to outbreaks such as COVID-19 is largely influenced by anxiety over health [12] . Research has shown that information on the number of deaths increases public awareness of the level of threat and reinforces feelings of anxiety [4, 13] . Conflicting messages, inaccurate and delayed information may even enhance the harm [14] . It should also be borne in mind that when people are scared or upset, they find it more difficult to understand the information they receive; and when they receive it, they rely on negative information more than positive one [15] .",

It has been emphasized that risk communication messages should be simple, problem-solving and in line with cultural values and background [17] . The speed and accuracy of the first message are of great importance. The first message is best absorbed by readers and is the one that attracts the most attention. All the following information tends to be compared against the first message [18] . Immediate information reduces the sense of uncertainty and greatly helps to understand what happened. This \"sense of the event\" may prevent one from engaging in harm-inducing activities [18] . Therefore, it is very important to base risk communication strategies on risk perception, societal and cultural factors, and risk attitudes in affected populations [19, 20] .",

Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) and pharmacy specialists are the ones who encounter unprecedented mental distress. The current pandemic of COVID-19 has been reported to be associated with anxiety, stress and depressive symptoms for HCWs [22] . Healthcare workers' mental health risk and resilience factors have been addressed in recent studies, and clear communication was identified as one of the significant protective factors [23] . Timely information and feedback may act as a buffer against the mental stress of healthcare workers [21] . On the contrary, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication has been pointed out as an important source of anxiety [24] . However, there is a lack of more detailed data on psychological aspects of media communication and subjective effects on the well-being of frontline workers. Thus, it is an issue of great importance to address the needs of those at the core of the COVID-19 pandemic [25] . There is an urgent need for evidence in the field of mental health of healthcare and pharmacy workers, to formulate response-enhancing recommendations [3, 26] .",

The questionnaire consisted of 130 statements about study participants' well-being and experienced changes in physical and psychological well-being, fears, anxiety, stress coping and psychosomatic symptoms. It was not previously used in any study, but was constructed specifically based on the recent research about COVID-19 issues. The questionnaire was tested in a small-scale pilot study.

The code category General Undifferentiated Negative Effect (241) consisted of short general responses about subjective effects of media communication to healthcare workers and pharmacy specialists; this included such answers as \"negative\", \"negatively\", \"poor\", and \"bad.\" One of the most saturated categories was Increased Anxiety and Tension (204). It was revealed that in response to information in the media, participants felt stressed and anxious, and also described general tension in their bodies. Specialists also named the reactions of fear, intimidation and panic (146) associated with the media exposure. Participants were frightened by intimidating messages in the media and reactions in society. Irritability and anger (65), a sense of insecurity and loss of control (33) , and gloominess and fatigue (22) were also mentioned in association with subjective media effect.",

Compulsive Browsing (7) was defined as a personal over-involvement in the media, and frustration with browsing for information about the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants described that they could not stop searching for the information. This process was very engaging and almost addictive. Even though this was how they hoped to feel safer, such compulsive browsing considerably increased their anxiety and panic. Another strategy chosen by the participants was Keeping the Distance (46) from overexposure in the media. Some people revealed that they needed to take a break from the media to distance themselves from emotional information, and that this information was tiring and stressful. In Table 4 , each category is illustrated with a quote. \"There was the only talk of a virus as if nothing more happened in the world. It is a pity that there was no positive information. I really believe that there were a lot of interesting things going on at the time which weren't presented to the public.\" (S23)",

Our study shows several factors of media communication affecting healthcare workers well-being in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We observed that seeking COVID-19-related information in the media many times a day was associated with increased fear of becoming infected with COVID-19, feeling unable to control the risk of this infection, fear of infecting relatives with COVID-19 and feeling that other people would avoid interacting with them because of their job. In addition, a less frequent searching for COVID-19-related information (once or twice a day) was associated with a significantly increased risk of fear of becoming infected with COVID-19, and fear of infecting relatives. Fear of death related to COVID-19 was not statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 related information seeking. Furthermore, our results show that casual pandemic-related browsing was not associated with any type of COVID-19-related fears. These findings remained significant after adjustment for gender, age and occupation. This is in accordance with another recent study where daily media use has been found to be a significant predictor of stress and depressive symptoms [11, 13] . A study in China found that healthcare workers who had been excessively exposed to COVID-19-related information showed a higher incidence of depression, anxiety and insomnia [28] . Mass media coverage of a pandemic can potentially lead to mass hysteria and fear [29] . This has been observed over the 2005 avian flu outbreak. One of the studies indicated that more intense television exposure has been associated with increased fear of the avian flu [30] . Thus, this may explain why the higher flow of information on COVID-19 from various sources predicted greater COVID-19-related fears in our study participants.",

Similar findings have been reported by a group of researchers in Taiwan in their cross-sectional survey of more than 2000 participants [31] . It is noticed, that there is a tendency for women to search for health-related information online more often [32] . The authors stated that this might reflect their self-esteem and informational support needs. According to the researchers, an online search for men is usually determined solely by informational intentions [32] . Overall, it has been suggested that females are generally more concerned about health-related information than males [31] . Interestingly, COVID-19 related information-seeking behavior was more characteristic of healthcare workers and the related administrative sector. This can be explained by an effort to reshape the adaptation to turbulence and improve the problem-solving skills of administrative personnel [33] .",
