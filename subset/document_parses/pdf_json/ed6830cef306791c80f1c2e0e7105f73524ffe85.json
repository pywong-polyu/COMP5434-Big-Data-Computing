The aim of this study was to compare the mucosal and luminal content microbiota of the cecum and colon of healthy and diarrheic horses. We concluded that microbial dysbiosis (changes in the normal microbiota composition) occurs in horses with colitis at different levels of the intestinal tract and microbiota composition is different between the mucosa and luminal content of diarrheic horses. Changes in species associated with dysbiosis could be used in the future for disease diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of equine colitis.",

Horses with acute diarrhea are commonly referred to equine hospitals because they require intensive treatment [1, 3, 4] . Some infectious agents known to cause diarrhea include Salmonella enterica, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Lawsonia intracellularis (weanlings), Neorickettsia risticii (Potomac horse fever), coronavirus and small strongyles [1, 3] . Diarrhea can also result from non-infectious causes, such as antibiotic associated diarrhea, sand impaction and toxicities (phenylbutazone or flunixin meglumine) [1, 3] . However, despite extensive microbiological and epidemiological investigative efforts to determine the cause of diarrhea in horses, a causal agent cannot be established in an astonishingly large proportion (>60%) of these cases [5] .",

These observations suggest that in some cases of gastro-intestinal disorders, including horses, dysbiosis could play a role in the development of disease. A few studies using NGS showed decreased diversity and significant changes in fecal microbiota composition of diarrheic horses [7, 10, 11] . Differences in microbial composition between cecal and large colon contents have also been reported in healthy horses [12, 13] . Similarly, a marked difference between mucosal and luminal microbiota of healthy humans and patients with gastrointestinal disorders had been observed [14, 15] . These differences are driven by the presence of a mucus layer, an oxygen tension gradient and a close interaction with the immune system [16] .",

Differences between mucosal and intestinal content microbiota have been previously reported in healthy horses [13] , suggesting that, like in other species, many factors can dictate which type of bacteria can attach to and colonize the mucosa. In general, data from human studies suggest that higher diversity is expected to be found in intestinal content, compared to mucosal samples [14, 30] . The present study found no differences in alpha and beta diversity between mucosal and luminal microbiota in the cecum and large colon of heathy horses. These findings were unexpected; however, it is possible that the small number of biological replicas prevented the detection of those differences.",

This explains why the relative abundance plots (Figure 3 ) are similar between the both niches, since it represents only the main taxa present in those communities (>1% abundance).

This enrichment was expected, as Proteobacteria have been commonly associated with dysbiosis and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in various species [34] [35] [36] [37] . Dysregulated innate immune responses can elicit the blooming of Proteobacteria, which promotes gut inflammation and further promotes inflammation or pathogen invasion [38, 39] . Additionally, increased fusobacteria in the microbiota of diarrheic horses been reported [12, 40] , and the role of these taxa deserves to be investigated in equine colitis cases. Interestingly, there was also an increased abundance of Lactobacillus within diarrheic horses, Animals 2020, 10, 1403 9 of 11 which is normally associated with health and is even used as a probiotic. Higher abundances of this genus in horses with colitis have been reported, although statistical significance was not achieved in that study [23] . Noteworthy, the descriptive nature of this study does not allow inference of causation and the association of E. coli and lactobacilli in cases of colitis does not necessarily mean those were causing diarrhea, but rather, may be a consequence of favorable conditions such as the depletion of other commensals, acidification of the environment and acute inflammation. This study reinforces previous findings that some bacteria normally associated with health, such as members of the Lachnospiraceae family and Fibrobacter spp. could be candidates considered for restoring the equine microbiota (probiotics).",

In addition, the treatment with antimicrobial drugs received by horses with colitis prior to sample collection likely induced changes in the microbiota [10] . Nevertheless, the major findings reporting differences in alpha diversity between mucosal and luminal content were found only within diarrheic horses, and therefore it should be included as a variable, because all horses were treated with those drugs. It is possible that antimicrobials could achieve higher concentrations closer to the mucosa, but this would likely result in decreased richness, rather than greater richness compared to intestinal content, as was observed in this study.
