Moreover, the study underscores the moderating role of -HRM practices\u2016 in strengthening the negative relationship between TFL and -burnout\u2016.

The high numbers of infections and deaths led people to experience many psychological problems including -stress\u2016, -anxiety\u2016, -depression\u2016, and fear. Many restrictions have been taken place during the -COVID-19\u2016 crisis, such as international and domestic travel bans, proving very disruptive to tourism and hospitality industries (e.g., Bajrami et al., 2021; Goh and Baum, 2021) . Based on United Nations World Tourism Organisation statistics (UNWTO, 2021) , from April 2020 up to May 2021 one billion fewer international tourist arrivals have been recorded, a loss of 1.3 trillion US$ in total export revenues from international tourism have been reported, whereas 100 to 120 million direct tourism jobs are found at risk. Thus, due to the limited number of bookings in a -lockdown-restricted economy\u2016, tourism businesses experienced unprecedented financial losses that forced most of them to shut down operations and lay off workers.",

Indeed, many hotels have adopted the -working-from-home\u2016 or -telecommuting\u2016 as an operational strategy in order to adapt in this reality and to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f sustain their performance. The -working-from-home\u2016 influences employees both positively (e.g., high level of job autonomy and emotional support), as well as negatively (e.g., highlevel of -work-home\u2016 interference; Chi et al., 2021) . Nevertheless, a great part of the workers in the hospitality industry have lost their jobs, whereas another part of them has been negatively affected in terms of mental health. In this vein, they feel anxiety and income instability since most of them are employed with -non-standard and contingent arrangements\u2016 that include -self-employment\u2016, -subcontracting\u2016, and -casual work\u2016 (Martins et al., 2020) .",

In parallel, this research framework examines the moderating role of -HRM practices\u2016 in the -TFL -burnout\u2016 relationship. The latter can be regarded as extremely crucial. Indeed, research in hospitality has mainly examined the contribution of -HRM practices\u2016 as antecedents of -employee behavior\u2016, whereas their moderating role has been largely neglected (Tuan, 2018, p. 136) . Hence, the present study makes an additional step and investigates the process through which -HRM practices\u2016 interact with TFL, -job stressors\u2016, and employees' burnout in order to shed additional light in the motivational process that stimulates positive -employee behaviors\u2016. To achieve the research objective, the -Job-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Demands Resources (JD-R)\u2016 (Demerouti et al., 2001) and the -Conservation of Resources (COR)\u2016 (Hobfoll, 2001) theories have been taken into consideration, by applying -Partial Least Squares (PLS)-Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)\u2016 on a dataset of 459 -frontline\u2016 hotel employees located across 13 hotels in Greece, during the -COVID-19\u2016 pandemic.",

Overall, two types of leadership have been distinguished, namely -transactional\u2016 and -transformational\u2016 (Burns, 1978) . -Transactional Leadership\u2016 involves an exchange relationship between leaders and followers, encompassing contingent reward and management-by-exception (Rafferty and Griffin, 2004) .

Indeed, Zhang et al. (2012) studied the effect of TFL on leadership effectiveness in a sample of 526 hospital employees-executives during the 5.12 earthquake that struck China on 12 May 2008. They found that TFL can assist organizations to improve organizational performance and enhance team cohesion during a crisis. Recently, the study of Ma and Yang (2020) illustrated the positive role of TFL on crisis management performance under different epidemic crisis perceptions. Nevertheless, despite the aforementioned positive outcomes, research examining the impact of TFL on -burnout\u2016 remains scant (Breevart et al., 2014) . Thus, in responding to these limitations, this study adopts TFL as it can be considered more appropriate to tackle with the issue of burnout in the hospitality industry during the -COVID-19 pandemic\u2016.",

Indeed, TFL enhances employee's ability to address smoothly all sorts of circumstances as transformational leaders support and empower employees. Thus, employees maintain the optimum level of mental health through inspirational motivation and retain their confidence (Diebig et al., 2017) , resulting to increased employee well-being (e.g., Arnold et al., 2007) .",

Hence, there is still no consensus on the actual positive and / or negative effect on burnout (see Nielsen and Daniels, 2012; Skakon et al., 2010) , a gap that the present study aims to overcome. Given that -burnout\u2016 most commonly takes place when -an organization exercises excessive demands and does not supply employees with the resources needed to meet these demands\u2016 (Asensio-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2019), COVID-19 crisis makes this phenomenon more prevalent in those organizations that involve interactions with people (Sun et al., 2017; Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m et al., 2021) , as is the case in the hospitality sector.

            "text": "Across the HRM and the Organizational Psychology literature, the role of stress in work has been widely discussed. In summary, -stress\u2016 is conceptualized as -an individual's reactions to work environment characteristics that appear threatening to him or her\u2016 (Gill et al., 2006, p. 471 ) and can be viewed as one of the most serious occupational hazards in the modern industrialized world that cause health diseases (Harms et al., 2017) . The main theories that have been used in explaining the impact of -stress\u2016 on employees' well-being concern mostly the -JD-R\u2016 and the -COR\u2016 ones, that were presented previously. Specifically, -job demands\u2016 lead to several negative outcomes that include -burnout\u2016 and -turnover\u2016 (Demerouti et al., 2001) . In order to mitigate these negative effects, employees need to equip themselves with the relevant -job resources\u2016 (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007) . At this point, it is crucial to refer to -personal resources\u2016. These resources can be highly beneficial in overcoming workplace stress and could include -self-efficacy\u2016; -self-esteem\u2016; and -optimism\u2016 (Xanthopoulou et al., 2007) . Indeed, these -personal resources\u2016 are extremely useful for those employees who come directly in contact with customers, such as salespeople (Peasley et al., 2020, p. 59 ) and customer-contact hotel employees. Nevertheless, despite the fact that -personal demands\u2016 can be regarded as -workplace / job demands\u2016, this theory has not been developed across the -JD-R\u2016 literature. Specifically, the job demands that studies usually investigate include -role J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f conflict\u2016; -role overload\u2016; -role ambiguity\u2016; -work pressure\u2016; -work family conflict\u2016, etc. (Heffernan and Dundon, 2016; Kilroy et al., 2016; Oppenauer and van de Voorde, 2018; van de Voorde et al., 2016) . However, research has not placed attention to -personal demands\u2016 which can have equally devastating consequences as -job demands\u2016. Indeed, the personal demands that an individual might face at home (i.e. family to work demands) will most likely influence his / her well-being, productivity and overall performance (Peasley et al., 2020, p. 60; see also Amstad et al., 2011) . Hence, this study responds to this limitation in the -JD-R\u2016 literature and follows the Peasley et al. (2020) study in integrating personal financial stress as a personal demand in the JD-R framework.",

As a result, employees feel supported by their organizations and motivated to develop their skills, leading to higher levels of -work engagement\u2016 (Kopperud et al., 2013) ; increased -productivity\u2016 (Bakker and Schaufeli, 2015) , and better -health\u2016 (Demerouti et al., 2001) . In a nutshell, transformational leaders articulate and develop a vision, which in turn provides employees with positive expectations and optimism about the future (e.g., Buil et al., 2019) . Towards this goal, the combination of TFL with HRM practices can be really helpful (Tuan, 2018, p. 136) . For instance, a -performance management\u2016 system based on -contingent compensation\u2016 creates value to employees since they feel that their attitudes are appreciated and recognized (Zacharatos et al., 2005) . In the present situation, such a compensation system could increase employees' income and thus reduce their personal financial stress. In addition, -employment security\u2016 can be critical in today's turbulent environment. Considering the present situation, this specific HRM practice and the offering of a stable employment not only benefits employees' productivity but also increases their loyalty to their organization (e.g. Macky and Boxall, 2007) thus reducing their fear of losing their job, causing additional stress. Similarly, -employee autonomy\u2016 increases employees' work engagement and attaches employees to their organization intellectually and emotionally (Zacharatos et al., 2005) . Although in the present study HRM practices are examined as a moderating variable, research underscores the vital role of managers towards effectively implementing such HRM practices (e.g., Katou et al., 2014) . In summary, it is expected that transformational leaders will be able to provide the necessary resources to employees in order to mitigate their fear of losing their jobs (and income) and to overcome their personal financial stress.",

Indeed, financial problems lead to conflicts between partners which can lead to several negative outcomes. For instance, increased levels of financial stress results in poor sleep quality (Hall et al., 2008) and reduced well-being (Agrigoroaei et al., 2017) . Considering Greece, the case is even worse. To begin with, the country has already suffered from an unprecedented debt crisis over the past years. Indeed, the -Memorandum of Understanding\u2016 resulted in extremely low wages, not to mention the inclusion of -flexible work schedules\u2016 where -part -time\u2016 employees have become the new standard (Kloutsiniotis and Mihail, 2020a, p. 566) . Added to that, and considering the COVID-19 crisis, it is evident that the pandemic has created a turbulent working environment especially in the hospitality industry, causing reduced hotel reservations and losses of jobs (Bajrami et al., 2021; Salem et al., 2021) . Hence, the personal financial stress that a family might face will almost certainly affect the workplace. Indeed, research has already linked financial stress with reduced productivity (e.g., Kim and Garman, 2004 ) and turnover (e.g., Kim et al., 2006) . Of significant importance to the present research, two studies have showed a high correlation between financial stress and burnout (Peasley et al., 2020; Porter et al., 2018) , causing ultimately reduced salesperson performance (Peasley et al., 2020) . Combined, it is expected that the demands of personal financial stress will not only have a positive effect on employees' burnout, but will also mediate the direct impact of TFL on burnout.",

In summary, the key role that transformational leadership could play focuses on reducing the so-called -power asymmetry\u2016 between supervisors and subordinates. Indeed, in the case that TFL is not present, supervisors' high expectations might lead employees to internalize their emotions due to fear (Bono et al., 2007) , and asymmetry of power (Nielsen et al., 2019, p. 138) , leading to increased anxiety and job stress (Grandey, 2003) . On the other hand, transformational leaders create an environment based on trust. Hence, by exhibiting a clear vision and by being supportive, these leaders are able to overcome any work pressures stemming from the need to achieve -short-term financial outcomes\u2016 and focus towards benefiting employees' well-being (Kelloway et al., 2012) . In other words, transformational leaders place particular emphasis in elevating their subordinates' self-interest, make them feel confident and reduce any perceptions of -power asymmetry\u2016 (Goertzen, 2012). Hence, employees are able to express their worries and any kind of frustration stemming from their job. All in all, TFL is characterized by -empathy\u2016; -compassion\u2016; -support\u2016; and -guidance\u2016. All these attributes influence employees' well-being, that provides -in turn -the necessary resources to employees so as to cope with any hurdles they face on their job (Kelloway et al., 2012) . As a result, TFL is able to limit employees' anxiety by creating a more predictable and pleasant working climate (Nielsen et al., 2019) . Therefore, the following hypothesis is expected:",

Overall, it has been argued that anxiety leads individuals to demonstrate negative thinking, which induces nervousness or reduced self-confidence (Vickers and Williams, 2007) in performing a job. Such behaviors can easily lead to job stress, and burnout. For instance, Vasilopoulos (2012) showed a strong and positive correlation between levels of anxiety and burnout, a finding supported by Ding et al. (2014) . This finding has also been supported by the early study of Turnipseed (1998) , who showed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that the interaction between the daily job demands that an individual experiences along with his / her personality creates high levels of anxiety that lead ultimately to burnout. Taking the COVID-19 pandemic along with the Greek hospitality context in consideration, it is expected that anxiety will increase hotel employees' burnout. In addition, anxiety is expected to play a mediating role in the TFLburnout relationship.",

During the COVID-19 crisis, -workplace loneliness\u2016 is one of the most significant factors that influences employees' mental health (Kniffin et al., 2021; Kotera et al., 2021) . Indeed, employees who experience loneliness in the workplace may feel incapable and unwelcome, and generate negative evaluations including low self-esteem and self-efficacy towards themselves (e.g., Peng et al., 2017) , thus reducing their well-being (Erdil and Ertosun, 2011) and performance (Lam and Lau, 2012) . Of significant importance, employees feeling lonely at work experience an impact on their attitudinal and behavioral outcomes (Heinrich and Gullone, 2006) . Hence, workplace loneliness has been considered as crucially important for further research (Anana and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Mishrab, 2019 p. 5), as there has been little investigation regarding the processes and outcomes that take place (Ozcelik and Barsade, 2018, p. 2343) .

            "text": "Moving a step further, research suggests that burnout can be an outcome of workplace loneliness (Ananda and Mishrab, 2019). Indeed, lonely employees are characterized by -low willingness towards social skills\u2016 (Lam and Lau, 2012) and have the tendency to translate any information they receive from the organization as something negative that constitutes a threat (Cacioppo and Hawkley, 2009) . As a result, employees feeling lonely at the workplace will most likely follow -avoidance coping strategies\u2016 (Roth and Cohen, 1986) . In this case, they will try to reduce the stressors they experience in their job activities by avoiding contact (Carver and Connor-Smith, 2010) . In detail, although TFL provides the necessary resources and support to employees in order to cope with the negative work outcomes they experience (Chang et al., 2012) , lonely employees tend to shift away from any meaningful relationships in their workplace (i.e. teammates and supervisors) thus leading to dissatisfaction, increased levels of stress and finally burnout (Ananda and Mishrab (2019 p. 2131, see also Soderstrom et al., 2000) . Additionally, Murphy and Kuphsik (1992) suggested that lonely employees might be more anxious about breaking their exchange relationship with their supervisor, which is mainly caused by insecurity and fear of rejection. This process leads to -mental fatigue\u2016 resulting ultimately to burnout (Chi and Liang, 2013) , a finding supported by the Ananda and Mishrab (2019) study. Taking the preceding discussion into consideration, the next hypotheses are proposed.",

For instance, HRM practices have the ability to moderate the -social exchange\u2016 relationship between employees and transformational leaders (Zhang and Chen, 2013) . Indeed, employees view HRM as a sign of -fairness\u2016, -recognition\u2016, and -empowerment\u2016, which is interpreted as the organization's commitment to their -well-being\u2016 (Gong et al., 2010) . As a result, employees reciprocate with enhanced -trust\u2016 towards their employers, leading to beneficial J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Babakus et al., 2017) . Considering that HRM practices and managers' leadership behavior are two essential ingredients of the so-called -talent management architecture\u2016, this study follows Tuan's (2018 p. 136 ) argument and suggests that both -HRM practices\u2016 and TFL should form a strong system towards forging a robust -social-exchange\u2016 relationship.",

Specifically, the findings show that TFL has the dynamic to reduce both stressors (i.e. -personal financial stress\u2016; -anxiety\u2016) and the psychological well-being indicator (i.e. -workplace loneliness\u2016). Furthermore, similar to the -health impairment process\u2016 of the -Job Demands-Resources (JD-R)\u2016 (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007) framework, all three -stressors\u2016 are positively related to burnout. Hence, the findings show that these stressful work conditions have indeed the potential to harm employees, causing -depletion of energy\u2016 and -burnout\u2016 (Schaufeli and Becker, 2004) . Combined, however, the findings highlight the usefulness of a successful leadership style and HRM in general in helping employees to overcome the negative effects that they might experience under these stressful conditions. Indeed, the main philosophy behind HRM lies on its ability to enhance employees' -Trust\u2016 towards their managers (e.g., Miao et al., 2014) , helping additionally towards creating a -Social Climate\u2016 (Walumbwa et al., 2018) . In turn, both -Trust\u2016 and -Social Climate\u2016 impact directly employees ' -Work Engagement\u2016 (e.g., Breevaart et al., 2015; Kloutsiniotis and Mihail, 2020b; Walumbwa et al., 2018) .

Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic causes a huge amount of anxiety to all employees, and most importantly to those who work in the hospitality industry. Put differently, employees are already anxious regarding the vitality of their jobs, whereas in many cases many of them already seek employment in other -safer\u2016 industries. Hence, the findings clearly show the detrimental effect that -anxiety\u2016 has on employees' burnout. As a result, management should be aware that a successful transformational leadership might be the remedy.",

Specifically, taking into consideration Figure 3 , it is evident that -HRM practices\u2016 have the tendency to reduce employees' burnout, a relationship which is enhanced when these HRM practices are increased. However, the most crucial finding is depicted in Figure 3 when HRM practices are not implemented (red line). In this unfortunate case, increasing leadership seem to increase burnout. This finding is of significant importance and seems to validate the -dark-side\u2016 of HRM. According to this negative approach, HRM might impact negatively -employee well-being\u2016. Indeed, excessive HRM might lead to -work intensification\u2016, and increase employees' -feelings of being exploited\u2016 (Kroon et al., 2009, p. 510) , thus reducing -health well-being\u2016 (Oppenauer and van de Voorde, 2018, p. 312) . Although recent research has started to investigate the -negative effects of HRM\u2016 (e.g., van de Voorde et al., 2016; Ogbonnaya and Messersmith, 2019) , this research is still in its infancy whereas others highlight the possible curvilinear relationships J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that might exist (Han et al., 2017) .

Towards that goal, they have to increase the level of top management knowledge about the actual value of the HRM practices and their potential of improving their firms' readiness to tackle employees' problems. Furthermore, by cultivating the TFL style, hotel managers will be in position to provide their employees with the necessary resources in order to cover their individual needs, and to make them acknowledge their purpose on their work as a higher mission, especially during crises. Finally, the proposed research framework could be used to examine the impact of TFL and HRM practices towards the diminishing of burnout in other sectors of the tourism industry, such as tourism intermediaries (agencies and tour operators), transportation, airlines, etc.",

Hence, the issues of -Common Method Variance (CMV)\u2016 and -reverse causality\u2016 might be present. Regarding CMV, the -Harman's single factor test\u2016 that was conducted did not show any evidence of CMV. The issue of -reverse causality\u2016, on the other hand, is even more complex. Specifically, the HRM literature suggests that -curvilinear relationships\u2016 might be present (e.g., Han et al., 2019) . For instance, in the present study, HRM practices seem to be really helpful towards reducing burnout. After a certain point, however, the excessive use of HRM practices might increase the levels of -stress\u2016 that employees experience (Ho and Kuvaas, 2019) leading to higher levels of burnout. In an effort to overcome these issues, longitudinal studies can be highly beneficial. To the best of our knowledge, longitudinal studies are scant across the HRM literature, not to mention studies that focus on the tourism industry which are -cross-sectional\u2016 in their majority. Hence, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ultimate goal of shedding additional insights into the HRMorganizational performance causal relationship (see Kloutsiniotis and Mihail, 2020c) .",
