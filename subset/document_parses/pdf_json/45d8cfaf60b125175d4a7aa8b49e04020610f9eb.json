One of the reasons for the decrease in hospital visits is that hospitals are postponing or canceling scheduled visits, especially for surgical procedures [1, 4] . Public fear of COVID-19 is also considered to be one of the reasons for the decrease [5, 6] . In Japan, the first wave of COVID-19 struck in March 2020 [7] . In response, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency on April 7 [8] . The Japan Surgical Society had already announced recommendations for surgery for COVID-19 patients or those suspected of having COVID-19 on April 1, and urged the postponement of elective surgical procedures [9] . One survey has reported 5.8%, 11.4%, 3.1% decreases in the incomes of Japanese hospitals in April, May, and June 2020, respectively, compared to their incomes in the same months of the previous year [10] .",

In addition, a compensation program was implemented on June 16 for securing beds for COVID-19 patients, providing 41,000 to 301,000 JPY per bed per day for moderate to severe COVID-19 patients and from 16,000 to 52,000 JPY per bed per day for mild patients [12] . However, the actual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of hospital visits and the amount of claimed hospital charges during the first wave of the pandemic has not been comprehensively examined. To fill this gap, this study aimed to clarify the impact of the first wave of the pandemic on case volumes and claimed hospital charges among Japanese acute care hospitals during the COVID-19 state of emergency.",

The DPC data consist of a number of data files, including Forms 1, 3, and 4, and files D, E, F, H, and K [15] . For this study, we used forms 1 and 3, and files D, E, and F. Form 1 contains discharge summaries that include characteristics of patients, such as, sex, age, height, and weight, as well as the patients' main diagnosis, the reason for admission, the most and second-most medicalresource-intensive diagnoses, up to 10 comorbidities, and 10 complications using the codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Form 3 contains hospital information, such as numbers of beds, and qualifications for special claims, such as emergency rooms and intensive care units. The D files contain information on claimed charges for both DPC/per-diem payments and fee-for-services amounts for services not covered by the per-diem payment. We extracted claimed hospital charges for each hospitalization from the D files. Files E and F contain information on all medical services, medications, and equipment for both inpatients and outpatients. These files also include the number of earned points according to the tariff of the National Health Insurance System, with one point corresponding to 10 JPY. Thus, we were able to calculate claimed charges for outpatients from the E and F files.",

These payments were tripled on May 26 [20] . In our data, there were only 11 such claims for these doubled payments in six hospitals. This indicates that the increase in payments for severe COVID-19 patients did not compensate for the decrease in income of hospitals with COVID-19 patients. Our regression analyses showed that the LOS of COVID-19 patients, including suspected patients, was associated with an additional decrease in claimed hospital charges. Other hospital-level variables were not selected in the stepwise process. One of the reasons for this might be that the mean of claimed charges during the previous 21-month period was such a strong predictor that other hospital-level variables were not particularly effective for predicting claimed charges in April and May 2020.",

This implies hospitals that treated COVID-19 patients were negatively incentivized. The current raise for payments was focused on severe COVID-19 patients, although the proportion of severe cases was not very high in Japan. Moreover, our results showed that the elective cases decreased more in April and May 2020 and returned slower in June than urgent cases. This suggested that the current compensation program that focused on severe COVID-19 patients was not sufficiently effective for the Japanese situation. Thus, more effective financial rescue policies are urgently needed for acute care hospitals. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act Provider Relief Fund [21] , which includes general distribution in proportion with gross revenue of each healthcare provider, could be one of such examples. The financial rescue policy should include compensations for overall decreases in hospital incomes as well as for COVID-19 patients.",

Although the reason is unclear, \"a climate of fear\" was suggested as one of the reasons [5] . It could change the patterns of hospital visits permanently. Under universal health coverage and \"free access\" with a weak gatekeeping function in Japan, people with mild diseases used to visit acute care hospitals [22] . Policymakers should prepare for the change of paradigm in the health care system. Focus more on prevention and management, not treatment, would make a more resilient health care system.",

After the declaration of the state of emergency, the numbers and claimed charges dramatically decreased in both inpatient and outpatients of acute care hospitals in Japan. Moreover, there were additional decreases in claimed charges in proportion to the number of COVID-19 patients. The raised payments, which are only for the severe COVID-19 patients, did not compensate for the decrease in revenue. Eventually, hospitals and staff were negatively incentivized, which may lead to future damage to the health care system. In addition to the reform of the reimbursement system, a financial rescue policy is urgently needed for acute care hospitals. ",

These charges decreased in April through June 2020, with May's decrease of 100 million JPY per hospital being especially prominent. In percentage terms, hospital charges for April, May, and June 2020 decreased by 7%, 14%, and 5%, respectively, compared to the same months in 2019. S3 Fig separates the year-over-year comparisons for inpatients and outpatients. The trends appear to be quite similar. Interestingly, S3 Fig shows an approximately 10 percentage point difference between the decrease in the number of cases and the decrease in hospital charges, with the percentage decrease in hospital charges being the smaller of the two. S4 Fig shows comparisons of the number of cases and the claimed hospitalization charges categorized by scheduled and urgent admissions. The decreases from March 2020 did not differ substantially between elective and urgent admissions. However, for admissions involving surgery, the decreases in hospital charges and the number of admissions for elective surgery was considerable, whereas the decrease in urgent admissions for surgery was less than 10% compared to the previous year (S5 Fig). S6 Fig shows year-over-year comparisons of the number of cases and hospital charges according to the number of hospital beds. The patterns of these decreases did not differ among hospitals with different numbers of beds. S7 and S8 Figs show year-over-year comparisons of the number of cases and hospital charges according to the patients' ages. The percentage decreases were more prominent in patients aged 0-17 years. S9 Fig shows comparisons of the number of cases and hospital charges for inpatients in hospitals with and without COVID-19 patients in 2020.",
