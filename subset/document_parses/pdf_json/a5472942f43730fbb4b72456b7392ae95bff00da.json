            "text": "This work reports RF and analog performance analysis of an amorphous Indium Tin Zinc Oxide thin film transistor. The various parameters affecting the performance of a-ITZO TFT like drain current, drain conductance, output resistance, transconductance, transconductance generation factor, early voltage, intrinsic gain, capacitances, cut off frequency, maximum frequency of oscillation, transconductance frequency product, gain frequency product, gain bandwidth product and gain transconductance frequency product have been closely examined. The device is further analyzed to investigate the impact of variation in physical parameters viz. dielectric material, dielectric thickness ( ) and temperature (T) on the RF/Analog performance. Use of high-k dielectric material in the simulated structure has resulted in low subthreshold slope (SS) of 0.62 V/decade, On voltage ( ) of -0.29 V, / ratio of~ 10 9 , intrinsic gain (A v ) of 104.5 dB and gain frequency product (GFP) of 1.86 GHz. The best results for dielectric thickness variation are obtained for D t of 150 nm with SS of 0.22 V/decade, of -0.26 V, / of~ 10 10 , A v of 175.69 dB and GFP of 2.39 GHz. In order to investigate device thermal reliability and stability, temperature analysis has also been done. To demonstrate the circuit level implementation of the simulated structure, a resistive load inverter circuit is simulated and analyzed for different variations (high-k, and T) . It has also been concluded that TFT with high-k material or thinner dielectric at T=300 K provides best performance. This analysis confirms the potential of a-ITZO TFTs to realize high performance analog/RF circuits.",

            "text": "The major outlook of display industry is to produce large area and high-resolution displays. Therefore, there is an immediate need to improve the performance of TFTs. TFT is a special type of transistor which has a supporting substrate over which a layer of dielectric, semiconductor and contacts are deposited [5] . The material used as channel layer are A-Si, Poly Si, Semiconducting Metal Oxides (SMO's) etc. Use of A-Si and Poly-Si for large and high-resolution display is now becoming unacceptable because of its low mobility, high processing temperature and inferior electrical properties [6] . Considering these limitations, semiconductor oxide materials like ZnO [7] , SnO 2 [8] , GaZnO [9] , IGZO [10] etc. are seen as a replacement to A-Si and Poly-Si. Among all semiconductor oxide materials, ZnO has drawn a significant attention of researchers because of its large band gap, low cost, good transparency, appreciable mobility, abundance in nature and high excitation energy [11] . However, Chung et al. [12] reported that ZnO has many grain boundaries which limit its use in large and high-resolution displays. This obstacle was resolved by doping ZnO with metals like In [13] , Al [14] , Tin [15] , Mg [16] etc. to make amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) with no grain boundaries. As reported by Lee et al. [17] , IGZO as AOS in channel layer of TFT provides high electric mobility as well as high optical transmittance. Nomura et al. [18] reported first IGZO TFT at room temperature and suggested that IGZO can be used as a potential material for future electronic devices. Yabuta et al. [19] grown IGZO as channel material for TFT with mobility ( fe ) of the order of 10 and I on /I off ratio of the order of 10 8 . However, this high mobility and stability is still not sufficient for next generation displays which require fe of the order of 20. Wang et al. [20] proposed a-ITZO as an alternative of IGZO with high fe (~ 44) and good stability. Zhong et al. [21] reported that ITZO is a potential TFT channel material as it offers high mobility of 19 cm 2 V \u22121 s \u22121 , and subthreshold swing of 0.6 V. Based upon the past literature, it can be concluded that a-ITZO has all potential properties that makes it a potential material for TFTs.",

            "text": "To investigate the applicability of a-ITZO as channel layer in TFTs, a simulation study using ATLAS tool [22] from Silvaco TCAD have been reported in this work. To demonstrate the use of a-ITZO TFT in Analog/RF application, different RF/Analog parameters have been studied. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of investigations have not been reported in literature for TFTs. Furthermore, it has also been seen that high density analog and RF application are facing challenges in the attainment of higher device performance like low power and high frequency of operation. Different methods like scaling the geometric dimensions, material changes and temperature variability [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] can effectively make the TFTs to work at low voltages with decreased subthreshold swing. To achieve current device requirements, scaling the dimension of TFT is seen as a potential method by many researchers. Scaling also scales the dielectric thickness. Kumar et al. [28] reported that downscaling has improved electrical parameters like I on /I off , fe , SS but at the cost of increasing tunneling gate leakage current. To cop up with this, Vyas et al. [29] suggested that high-k dielectric material like Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 etc. can improve the electrical performance of TFTs. High-k material is physically thick without being electrically thicker, leading to the same effect of scaling SiO 2 without increasing the leakage current. Many TFT applications like active-matrix liquidcrystal display (AMLCD) , active-matrix organic lightemitting diode (AMOLED) , bio medical devices etc. also require temperature analysis as it tells the working temperature range of the device. Considering all the above aspects, a 2D simulation of a-ITZO TFT along with its RF and analog analysis is thoroughly done by varying different physical parameters. It is seen that a-ITZO material based TFT is a promising option for future RF and analog devices.",

Section 3 deals with the simulation result, analysis and discussion about impact of different dielectric material, dielectric material thickness ( D t ) and temperature (T) on DC, Analog and RF parameters. The application of a-ITZO TFT as resistive load inverter is discussed in Section 4. Figure 1 shows Bottom Gate Top Contact (BGTC) TFT. Device material parameter used for simulation are tabulated in Table 1 [22, [30] [31] [32] . Here, Molybdenum (Mo) is chosen as contact material because of its low work function (4.3-4.9 eV) , low contact resistance (5.6-85.5 \u2126-cm) , high strength, high melting point and low reactivity to ambient condition like moisture, oxygen etc. [33] . The TCAD simulation have been done using ATLAS simulator on 2D grid. Newton method is employed to do the calculations. For carrier transport, drift diffusion and energy balance models have been considered. Fermi Dirac model are used for carrier distribution. The TFT uses disordered semiconductors which has defect states that can trap the charges. So, the models that define defect density are also included. To accurately model this, a continuous distribution of the sub-gap DOS (G(E) ) given by Eq. 1, is extended from the valence band edge ( E V ) to conduction band edge ( E c ) which include four bands i.e. two tail bands and two deep energy bands and are modeled by Gaussian distribution.",

The variation in V EA is 29% when dielectric material is changed from SiO 2 to HfO 2 for a-ITZO TFT. This higher value of V EA has a good sign as it tells that the simulated TFT has better control on channel length modulation and DIBL. The left axis of Fig. 3(c) shows the variation of intrinsic gain ( A V ) with V DS . It is defined as the ratio of transconductance ( g m ) by drain conductance ( g d ) . An increase of nearly 55% in A V is observed for HfO 2 based a-ITZO TFT as compared to SiO 2 material based TFT. The reason for this improvement is that HfO 2 will provide high capacitance per unit area with large physical thickness and also provide better immunity to SCE's, that will increase the current and hence it will improve the transistor analog performance parameters g m , A V . A combined plot of TGF and g m is drawn as a function of V GS in Fig. 3(d) . The left axis of the figure shows that greater value of transconductance (~ 10 \u22125 S) is attained for a-ITZO TFT with HfO 2 as dielectric. The increment in g m with high-k material is because of increase in drain to source current of device. Effective use of current to achieve desired value of transconductance is determined by TGF. TGF is a major performance parameter for analog applications which indicates TFT's capability to amplify a signal for a certain I DS . The value of TGF also increases with high-k dielectric material. This trend follows as that of maximum g m /I DS is for a-ITZO TFT with HfO 2 dielectric followed by Al 2 O 3 , Si 3 N 4 and SiO 2 for V GS < 2 V. It is also observed that with increasing V GS , TGF value starts to decrease for all configurations.",

The C GS and C GD values for different dielectric material TFT is plotted in Fig. 4(a) .

As depicted from the Fig. 4(b) , there is a slight variation in f T with changing dielectric material from low to high-k.

GTFP allows the circuit designers to identify the best region of operation by trading off gain, transconductance and speed. As seen from the inset of Fig. 4(c) , GTFP value increases by nearly 55% when using HfO 2 as dielectric with a-ITZO TFT than by using SiO 2 because of higher value of f T and g m for the former. Figure 4 (d) represent the variation of TFP and GFP w.r.t V GS for different dielectric materials. TFP defines the tradeoff between power and bandwidth. As seen from the curve that high TFP value is achieved for a-ITZO TFT with highk dielectric at V GS < 4 V and after that it is decreased as V GS is increased.

Changing the low-k material to high-k implies low power, low leakage and highperformance electronic devices. In this section, impact of D t scaling is seen on different Analog/RF parameters. Thickness of the dielectric material is inversely proportional to capacitance. As the thickness of dielectric material reduces, it increases the capacitance which in turn induces more number of charge carriers at the same output voltage and increases the drain current. g m will also improve by variation of gate capacitance, which results in reduction of extrinsic delays in digital circuits. Figures 5 and 6 shows the calculation of different Analog/RF parameters of a-ITZO TFT with HfO 2 as dielectric material. The device is simulated and compared for different dielectric thickness ( D t ) = 150 nm, 250 nm, 300 nm and 350 nm. Figure 5 (a) represent the calculation of I DS in linear and log scale w.r.t V GS at V DS = 5 V. The peak value of I DS is 1.1 mA, 824 \u00b5A, 661 \u00b5A, 552 \u00b5A for D t of 150 nm, 200 nm, 250 nm and 300 nm respectively. The increment in is due to the increase of capacitive coupling between gate and channel with low dielectric thickness. The different parameters like V t , V on , SS, I on , I off were extracted from the linear and log transfer curves and tabulated in Table 4 . The I off state current for all the dielectric thickness is found in the range of 10 \u221213 to 10 \u221214 . This value is above the requirement of ITRS for low power application.",

In many applications like AMOLED, medical display circuits, Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor (AOS) material plays an important role. The stability and reliability of particular circuit depend on their operating temperature like most of the medical circuits need to work in the range of 300-400 K. For these applications, temperature stability of AOS TFT must be analyzed. Figures 7 and 8 is obtained here to see the impact of temperature changes on the different analog/RF parameters of a-ITZO TFT. Figure 7 (a) shows the variation of I DS with V GS at V DS = 5 V. It is seen that drain current ( I DS ) in linear scale experience an increase of nearly 85% when temperature changes from 450 K to 300 K. This trend is attributed to (a) electron and hole trapping at the interface between the material, (b) oxygen vacancies and (c) donor like defect creation in ITZO channel [39] . Out of these three, electron and hole trapping at interface will lead to degradation of drain current. Huo et al. [40] also showed the same trend in drain current and they verified their result by UPS experimental analysis which tells electron structure information. Higher UPS attributes that more electrons are trapped and less free electron availability leading to decreased electrical performance with increased temperature. The different parameters used to analyze the TFT performance are extracted from linear and log curves of transfer characteristics (Fig. 7(a) ) and tabulated in Table 5 . The best result is observed for T = 300 K with V on = -0.29 V, I on / I off = 4.77 \u00d7 10 9 . The I off value is in 10 \u221213 -10 \u221214 range for all the temperature variation.",

From Table 5 , it is seen that reduction in SS with decreasing temperature will lead to reduced N t and so reason of increased I DS at decreased temperature. The left side of the Fig. 7(b) shows the variation of drain conductance ( g D ) w.r.t V DS . It is also decreasing by nearly 2.2% wih the increasing temperature. Inset of Fig. 7(c) shows the variation of output resistance ( R O ) with V DS . R O at T = 450 K is nearly 1.8 times that of T = 300 K. V EA and A V as seen from Fig. 7 (c) shows a very little or no impact with temperature variation. From close examination we can say that analog performance is better for T = 300 K. Figure 7 (d) shows the variation of TGF and g m with V GS . Both TGF and g m show decremented nature as we increase the temperature. The apex value of g m at V GS = 4 V are 4.64\u22c510 \u22125 S, 3.67\u22c510 \u22125 S, 3.00\u22c510 \u22125 S, 2.52\u22c510 \u22125 S for T= 300 K, 350 K, 400 K, 450 K respectively. TGF decreases nearly 35% when temperature is changed from 300 to 450 K. The decremented nature is ascribed to decreased mobility with increase in temperature. Figure 8 (a-d) show the variation of different RF parameter with different temperature ranges. The C GS & C GD values as seen from the Fig. 8 (a) have shown same nature for all the temperature variations. It is also seen that C GS is greater than that of C GD , which can be attributed to uneven distribution of charge on application of drain source bias [42] . The highest value of C GS & C GD is 280 fF and 266 fF respectively, which is very less and beneficial for circuit designing.",

As seen in inset of Fig. 9(a) , a-ITZO TFT is connected with 1 M\u2126 load resistor ( R L ) to examine clear On/Off levels in Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) curve. a-ITZO TFT can be considered as variable register depending on the V GS values. After verifying successful resistive operation, the transistor parameter (dielectric value (high k) , thickness and temperature) have been varied to observe the respective variations seen in Fig. 9 (a) , (b) and (c) . As deduced from the Fig. 9(a, b and c) , the V OUT of VTC is consistent with the transfer characteristics shown in Figs. 3(a) , 5(a) and 7(a) . It is seen that there is an improvement in VTC by changing the dielectric material to high k (SiO 2 to HfO 2 ) or by decreasing the thickness of dielectric (300 nm to 150 nm) . This change is attributed to increase in mobility and decrease in subthreshold swing value when changing dielectric material to high k or decreasing thickness. With temperature the VTC curve shows a constant behavior. The transient response of a-ITZO based inverter is also plotted in Fig. 9 (d, e and f) with same parameters variation as in VTC. A ramp input of peak 10 V with 20 \u00b5s rise/ fall time is applied to the a-ITZO TFT inverter circuit, here also similar improvement trend is observed as in VTC. This investigation confirms the utility of simulated TFT structure for the designing of next generation logic circuits.",

The impact of dielectric material, dielectric thickness ( D t ) and temperature (T) on the DC, Analog and RF parameters of a-ITZO TFT have been studied in detail. The investigations suggest that high k materials have potential impact on all Analog and RF parameters. HfO 2 as dielectric provides best results in comparison to its low K dielectric siblings. Impact of D t on all analog and RF parameters have also been reported. Reduction of D t provides best results and this variation has same impact as that of using high k dielectric material. It is also seen that scaling the device dimension leads to increased leakage current. Although, all the variation shows I off value in range of 10 \u221213 to 10 \u221214 which in turn provide high I on / I off . In last, the stability and reliability of a-ITZO TFT by varying temperature is investigated and it is seen that at T = 300 K, the device provides best results. This is considered as one of the FOM's of the simulated structure as most of equipment's/ devices work on ambient temperature. It is concluded that using high k material which has band gap close to SiO 2 or thinner dielectric at T = 300 K gives the optimum results. Also, successful implementation of a-ITZO TFT as resistive load inverter indicates that the simulated TFT structure can provide further directions for researchers to design complex analog and RF logic circuits.
