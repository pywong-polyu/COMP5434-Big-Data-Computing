Emerging evidence shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has similarly had a negative impact on mental health (Violant-Holz et al., 2020; Sol\u00e9 et al., 2021) . Measures to control the pandemic, have had consequences for mental health related to social isolation (Marroqu\u00edn et al., 2020; Smith and Lim, 2020) and lifestyle changes (Flanagan et al., 2021) . A systematic review analyzed the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health; it found that the general population had decreased psychological well-being and higher anxiety and depression scores compared to life before COVID-19. The population with pre-existing psychiatric disorders reported a worsening of psychiatric symptoms independent of the COVID-19 contagion (Vindegaard and Benros, 2020) . The current COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, leading to an increased burden on patients with schizophrenia and related disorders (Kozloff et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020) , which may affect the well-being of these patients (Burrai et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is plausible that this impact on mental health translates to lower levels of psychological recovery in people with pre-existing mental disorders such as schizophrenia.",

They have higher risks of infection and COVID-19 complications than those without a mental disorder, both due to cognitive deficits and comorbid conditions including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension (Shinn and Viron, 2020; Yao et al., 2020) . Psychiatric patients are more likely to show moderate to severe worry about their physical health due to concerns that they may have unknowingly contracted the virus. They are also less likely to use effective coping strategies to manage stress (Chua et al., 2004; Phillips et al., 2009; Colizzi et al., 2020; Sol\u00e9 et al., 2021) . In addition, there are other factors affecting the mental health of patients with psychiatric disorders, such as delays in the delivery of psychotropic medications, lack of access to primary care or outpatient clinics, increased financial hardship, longer lengths of stay at home, and more impoverished living conditions due to shortages of basic supplies (Hao et al., 2020) .",

While schizophrenia is recognized as a public health problem in Chile, there are no recent studies on its prevalence. The latest reports have stated that prevalence of schizophrenia was between 1.4 and 4.6 persons per thousand, with an incidence of 12 new cases per hundred thousand each year, and schizophrenia and other psychoses were responsible for 1.87% of the total years of life lost due to premature death and disability in Chile (MINSAL, 2009 ). Chile's outdated epidemiology of schizophrenia reveals a critical and complex invisibilization, considering that there are no official figures available which situate the panorama of schizophrenia within the current health crisis. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,615,771 people have been infected in Chile and the cumulative incidence rate is 9,931.1, but the current incidence rate is 60.1 (MINSAL, 2021).",

A group of researchers using self-reported data evaluated the psychological impact of fears and concerns in the general Ibero-American population, noting pervasive fear in participants during periods of isolation, particularly health-related fear (contamination, illness, and death due to coronavirus), fear related to work and loss of income, and fear of social isolation (Sand\u00edn et al., 2020) .",

However, understanding the degree of family functioning, particularly its concordance and correlates between patient and primary caregiver perceptions, can serve as a platform for achieving comprehensive patient care (Hsiao et al., 2020) . A recent study emphasizes that perceptions of the patient-caregiver relationship play a fundamental role in the health-related quality of life of patients with schizophrenia and their caregivers (Hsiao et al., 2021) . Previous studies in northern Chile have already established that the burden and restraint of altered behavior correlate with worsened patient-caregiver relationships (Caqueo-Ur\u00edzar et al., 2016) , and that the quality of relationships with relatives and caregivers has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life (Caqueo-Ur\u00edzar et al., 2017) . The degree of agreement in perception of patient suicidality, number of previous hospitalizations, and quality of care is often similar between patients and their primary caregiver, with patient-caregiver dyadic analysis being a good predictor of family functioning (Hsiao et al., 2020) . Currently, there are no available studies which analyze perceptions in patient-caregiver relationships about the impact on their daily lives during the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, it would be relevant to compare the degree of patient-caregiver agreement with a view of developing better psychosocial interventions (Caqueo-Ur\u00edzar et al., 2016; Hsiao et al., 2020 Hsiao et al., , 2021 .",

In contrast, their caregivers have reported high levels of stress and burden during the pandemic (Eckardt, 2020) . The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major source of stress (Zucca et al., 2021) and has resulted in a negative impact on the mental health of caregivers, especially considering that most caregivers do not seek out any mental health support as those resources typically target people living with a disorder (Gallagher and Wetherell, 2020; Alexopoulos et al., 2021) . Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the quality of life for caregivers of people with schizophrenia was already low (Boyer et al., 2012; Stanley et al., 2017) . During the pandemic, caregivers are concerned not only for their own health, but also for the continuity of care and well-being of their family member with schizophrenia (Yasuma et al., 2021) . While it is quite possible that there is a similar perception of the impact of COVID-19 among patients with schizophrenia and their caregivers, the disconnect associated with schizophrenia and the greater burden on the caregiver associated with avoiding COVID-19 infection would be expected to result in a greater perceived impact from caregivers.",

A study conducted in Chile showed that participants with schizophrenia had, at some point in their lives, experienced different forms of discrimination including job discrimination, lack of social support, acts of ridicule, disqualifying acts, and social isolation, among others (Herrera, 2018) . Likewise, the stigma associated with COVID-19 poses a serious threat to the lives of healthcare workers, patients, and survivors of the disease (Bagcchi, 2020) . Therefore, it is possible that patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and COVID-19 experience twice the stigmatization, which can negatively affect their psychological well-being and recovery.",

            "text": "Another reason to expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively impact the mental health of patients with schizophrenia is the loss of social support. Patients with schizophrenia usually have small, poorer quality social networks than the general population (Degnan et al., 2018) , so the pandemic could significantly impact patients with schizophrenia due to mandatory social confinement and distancing, which decreases access to social support that aids in treatment of the disorder (Corrigan and Phelan, 2004; Townley et al., 2013; Degnan et al., 2018) and ability to cope with stress (Montross et al., 2005; Volavka and Citrome, 2011) . Social distancing may also have a disproportionate impact on quality of life, substance use, symptoms of paranoia, and ability to maintain basic needs, given the heavy reliance of people with schizophrenia on income support and other community services that are more difficult to access, which could lead to further deterioration due to the pandemic (Hakulinen et al., 2020; Hamada and Fan, 2020; Kozloff et al., 2020) . In addition, duration of confinement, lack of coping strategies, financial problems, changes in sleeping and eating patterns, and disruption of daily routines are COVID-19 factors that may increase anxiety, stress, and depression in these patients (Salari et al., 2020) . Furthermore, restrictions on access to mental health services and hospitals have generated new complications, especially for patients receiving long-acting injectable antipsychotics, leading to an increased risk of relapse resulting from lower treatment adherence (Ifteni et al., 2020; Zhand and Joober, 2021) . In an Italian study of residential and outpatient individuals with schizophrenia, those in outpatient treatment were four times more likely to perceive greater pandemic-related stress than those living in sheltered housing, and were two to three times more at risk for significant symptoms of anxiety and depression (Burrai et al., 2020) .",

Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in a group of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and their caregivers (control group) in Arica, northern Chile. The hypotheses for this study were as follows: (1) self-reports about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic from patients and caregivers would be positively correlated, (2) caregivers would self-report a greater impact of the pandemic on their daily lives, and (3) patients infected with COVID-19 would experience lower levels of mental health improvement and higher levels of psychological distress. The findings may have implications for prevention and psychosocial intervention concerning patients with schizophrenia during the pandemic.",

This suggests that the psychosocial effects of the pandemic would similarly affect patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, and their caregivers. It is possible that the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, when affecting an individual within a group, will in turn affect the rest of the group members, especially those involved in care for pre-existing disorders such as schizophrenia (Yasuma et al., 2021) and dementia (Greenberg et al., 2020; Altieri and Santangelo, 2021) , or those raising children with cerebral palsy, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Dhiman et al., 2020) . Overall, the evidence suggests that, during scenarios such as the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased demand for professional support combined with reduced levels of informal support can lead to serious risks for both caregivers and patients. Although the perceptions of patients and caregivers were positively correlated, caregivers were significantly more affected than patients in the areas of income, concerns, and employment status, while no differences were observed in the areas of health and social life. It is possible that the pre-existing conditions of restricted personal freedom in people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia contributes to better adjustment to the impact of the pandemic in areas of daily life, compared to healthy people who are not accustomed to the limitations of freedom required by confinement (Burrai et al., 2020) . Additionally, caregivers may be in a position of greater burden because they assume responsibility for the patient in addition to other tasks such as household management or economic support; it is expected that they would be affected to a greater extent than patients, who generally do not work and whose income is dependent on state benefits or the support of other family members. These results are consistent with the second hypothesis of this study. These findings are similarly in line with previous studies that emphasize a close relationship between patients' and caregivers' views that shape family functioning (Caqueo-Ur\u00edzar et al., 2016; Hsiao et al., 2020 Hsiao et al., , 2021 . The relationship between patient and primary caregiver perspectives underscores the importance of family interventions to better address the psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In relation to the third hypothesis, the results showed that patients who had been infected with COVID-19 had higher levels of psychological distress and worse mental health recovery than those who had not been infected. This is similar to what was proposed by Fonseca et al. (2020) , who reported that people with schizophrenia are a vulnerable group in the face of an infectious disease outbreak, given their high comorbidity and immunodeficiency, limited access to community care, and the risk of medication interruption that increases the risk of relapse or worse clinical outcomes. COVID-19 treatment teams may also be unprepared to treat patients with severe mental disorders. Additionally, stigma related to schizophrenia may discourage patients from seeking help. They may experience discrimination when accessing care, resulting in them being underdiagnosed for comorbid physical illnesses, being less likely to receive definitive screening and interventions, and more likely to receive poorer quality care in general (Kozloff et al., 2020) . The fact that people with severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia have greater difficulty recognizing and communicating physical symptoms or health needs (Shinn and Viron, 2020) may also contribute to poorer recovery and increased psychological distress. Although differences were observed in the levels of well-being and recovery in patients infected with COVID-19, it should be noted that the number of patients infected was small, contrary to previous study findings where these patients tended to have higher rates of infection (Kozloff et al., 2020; Moreno et al., 2020) . The low infection rate can be explained by the low social contact the patients tend to have, which was increased by a prolonged quarantine of almost 1 year. It can also be explained by the fact that most of the patients were not married or did not have a partner, which may have reduced the chance of infection, as was found by Tzur Bitan et al. (2021) in Israel.",

Therefore, there are limitations in the generalizability of the results. Second, at the time of the study, there were no questionnaires that assessed COVID-19 pandemicrelated psychological variables, so a newly created measure assessed the impact of the pandemic on daily life. Therefore, the findings should be interpreted with caution as the measure established provides a simple and reduced view of the impact of the pandemic, in which it is clear that -despite the good levels of Cronbach's alpha -it is an insufficient measure and requires further development. Third, there are limitations associated with the characteristics of the sample. Patient diagnosis was based on a psychiatric evaluation and ICD-10 criteria. There was no confirmation of the diagnosis through other criteria (e.g., ruling out other diagnoses through a blood test, MRI, or CT scan), and the more recent ICD-11 was not used because there was no standardization of the ICD-11 in Chile. Moreover, caregivers are likely to have some characteristics that may not be found in the general population because of their role. Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to non-caregivers. However, an advantage of including caregivers in the study is that they tend to share environmental qualities with the patients, which makes them a relevant comparison group for the purpose of this study.",
