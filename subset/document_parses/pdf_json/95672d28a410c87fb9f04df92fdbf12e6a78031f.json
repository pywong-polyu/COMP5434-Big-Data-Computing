            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has become the most severe global health crisis. 1 As of June 2021, it has brought the cumulative numbers to .180 million reported cases and to .4 million deaths globally since the start of the epidemic. 2 This global pandemic has brought a great challenge to current global health systems and socioeconomic development. Unfortunately, there is still no proven effective antiviral therapy recommended for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. [3] [4] [5] Many therapies, including corticosteroid treatment, are still controversial. 6 Cytokine storm is considered to be one of the major causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple-organ failure. It plays an important role in the process of disease aggravation and even death. 7 Effectively suppressing the storm may be an effective way for the treatment of COVID-19. 8 Corticosteroids were widely used to treat severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology because of their excellent pharmacological effects on the suppression of exuberant and dysfunctional systematic inflammation. 9, 10 Corticosteroids were also widely used clinically to treat patients with COVID-19 since the early days of pandemic, despite a lack of clear evidence regarding their safety and efficacy. 11 At present, studies of corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 mainly focused on severe or critical cases in the intensive care unit or required mechanical ventilation and showed positive results. 12, 13 As for nonsevere cases, studies have shown that corticosteroids were used in 11% to 56% of nonsevere COVID-19 cases, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] but the role of corticosteroids remains controversial. Wu et al 19 reported that treatment with corticosteroid was not significantly associated with increased in-hospital mortality in noncritically severe cases. Another 2 studies reported that corticosteroid therapy was associated with poor lung injury recovery and worse clinical outcomes in nonsevere patients with COVID-19. 17, 18 The relatively small sample size and retrospective design limited the interpretation of these results. The UK-based Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy study, a large-scale and well-designed randomized clinical trial, showed that no benefit of dexamethasone use was observed among those patients who did not require respiratory support. 13 In addition, none of these studies explored the relationship between corticosteroid dose and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. The therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions of corticosteroids are strongly correlated with the dose, and it is not clear whether there is a safe low dose. 4, 20, 21 Hence, it is necessary to clarify the effect of corticosteroids on outcomes in patients with nonsevere patients with COVID-19.",

We evaluated the association between SCU and disease progression and mortality rate using 2 approaches. First, the mixed-effect Cox regressions model with site as a random effect was conducted to examine the impact of systemic corticosteroids and dose groups on the clinical outcomes. Multivariable analyses were all adjusted for age, sex, clinical symptoms (cough, fever, and anhelation), comorbidities (hypertension, malignancy, diabetes, COPD, and coronary heart disease), treatments (antiviral drugs, NSAID, and antibiotic drugs), and laboratory data on admission (white blood cell count, albumin, and C-reaction protein). Second, in mixed-effect Cox regressions model, SCU was accounted as a time-varying exposure to mitigate immoral time bias. In time-varying analysis, data were reconstructed according to the time of SCU. The time from admission to time of SCU was classified as unexposed. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. The cumulative probability of progression to severe type COVID-19 was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the influence of systemic corticosteroids and dose groups on length of stay.

This may be due to the fact that NSAID could suppress hyperinflammatory responses and increase the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, promoting the progression of the disease. 35, 36 Although some studies have suggested that low-dose corticosteroid therapy appeared to have a beneficial role in managing patients with COVID-19, the results have been controversial. 37, 38 It is now widely believed that low-dose corticosteroids effectively reduced the risk of mortality, respiratory failure, and delayed viral clearance of patients with severe COVID-19. 13, 39, 40 In a study evaluating the effects of low dose of corticosteroids, it was found that, in patients with severe COVID-19, the use of corticosteroids was associated with less likelihood of mortality and care escalation and significantly shorter hospitalizations. 14 Nevertheless, the researches evaluating the efficacy of low-dose corticosteroids in nonsevere patients with COVID-19 remain relatively insufficient, and the results are controversial. In a prospective cohort study of nonsevere patients with COVID-19, early, low-dose, and shortterm corticosteroid therapy was associated with progression to severe disease, a longer virus clearance time, and a longer hospital stay. 17 A randomized clinical trial study by Tang et al 41 also found that the patients with nonsevere COVID-19 may not obtain any clinical benefits from low-dose methylprednisolone treatment, which even prolonged the virus clearance. On the contrary, some studies showed that low-dose corticosteroid therapy is associated with better clinical outcomes in nonsevere patients with COVID-19. In a retrospective cohort study with nonsevere COVID-19, the overall mortality, C-reactive protein value, and length of stay in the corticosteroids group were significantly lower than the noncorticosteroid group. 42 Another study demonstrated that lowdose corticosteroids could benefit patients with mild COVID-19 without affecting the final clearance of viral nucleic acid. 43 Moreover, in some studies, low-dose corticosteroid therapy showed no effect on in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation, and viral clearance in patients with nonsevere COVID-19. [44] [45] [46] Thus, clinicians should carefully consider the risk versus benefit ratio and optimal dose of corticosteroid use for nonsevere patients with COVID-19.",

Our study also confirmed that increased corticosteroid dose was significantly associated with elevated probability of developing severe type and increasing length of stay in patients with nonsevere COVID-19. Zhou et al 4 reported that .240 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent dose or an excessive cumulative dose was considered to be able to generate some side effects, including hyperglycemia, psychosis, secondary infection, and avascular necrosis. One study found that every 10mg increase in dose was associated with an additional 4% mortality risk in critically ill patients with COVID-19. 49 What's more, the average duration of corticosteroid treatment reported in our study was 8 days, which was much higher than the recommended duration of corticosteroid use (3w5 days) by the guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 Patients. 23 Thus, the abovementioned mechanisms may contribute to explaining why corticosteroids therapy could increase the risk of poor outcomes in nonsevere patients with COVID-19.",
