            "text": "Objectives: Assess the predictive accuracy of the WHO COVID-19 severity classification on COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The secondary aim was to compare its predictive power with a new prediction model, named COVID-19 EPI-SCORE, based on a Bayesian network analysis. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a population of 295 COVID-19 RT-PCR positive patients hospitalized at Epicura Hospital Center, Belgium, admitted between March 1st and April 30th, 2020. Results: Our cohort's median age was 73 (62-83) years, and the female proportion was 43%. All patients were classified following WHO severity classification at admission. In total, 125 (42.4%) were classified as Moderate, 69 (23.4%) as Severe, and 101 (34.2%) as Critical. Death proportions through these three classes were 11.2%, 33.3%, and 67.3%, respectively, and the proportions of critically ill patients (dead or needed Invasive Mechanical Ventilation) were 11.2%, 34.8%, and 83.2%, respectively. A Bayesian network analysis was used to create a model to analyze predictive accuracy of the WHO severity classification and to create the EPI-SCORE. The six variables that have been automatically selected by our machine learning algorithm were the WHO severity classification, acute kidney injury, age, Lactate Dehydrogenase Levels (LDH), lymphocytes and activated prothrombin time (aPTT). Receiver Operation Characteristic (ROC) curve indexes hereby obtained were 83.8% and 91% for the models based on WHO classification only and our EPI-SCORE, respectively. Conclusions: Our study shows that the WHO severity classification is reliable in predicting a severe outcome among COVID-19 patients. The addition to this classification of a few clinical and laboratory variables as per our COVID-19 EPI-SCORE has demonstrated to significantly increase its accuracy.",

Ten variables were used in this score, giving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of their Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis of 0.88. Ji et al. developed the CALL (C = comorbidity, A = age, L = lymphocyte count, L = lactate dehydrogenase) score on data of 208 Chinese patients to predict disease progression. Their model used four variables and returned an AUC of 0.91 on their development cohort [7] . An American group proposed another score using 641 patients to predict either intensive care admission or mortality. Their score yielded an AUC of 0.74 for predicting ICU admission, and 0.82 for predicting mortality [8] . The well-known CURB-65 (C = Confusion, U = blood Urea nitrogen, R = Respiratory rate, 65 = age 65 or older) score and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) have also been used on 681 laboratory-confirmed Turkish patients to predict mortality of COVID-19 related pneumonia with an AUC of 0.88 and 0.91, respectively [9] .

During the hereabove mentioned time course, all admitted patients were RT-PCR COVID19 confirmed cases and obtained definite outcomes-i.e., dead or discharged alive. Our cohort's median age was 73 (62-83) years, and the female proportion was 43%. All patients were classified following WHO severity classification at admission (Appendixs A and B); 125 (42.4%) were Moderate, 69 (23.4%) were Severe, and 101 (34.2%) were Critical. Mild patients were not hospitalized; thus, this class was not represented in our study. Death proportions through these three WHO severity classes were 11.2%, 33.3%, and 67.3% (Appendix B1), respectively. The proportions of critically ill patients, defined by either dead or underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), were 11.2%, 34.8%, and 83.2%, respectively (Appendix B2). Death or Critical Illness (death or IMV) were the only variables with statistically significant differences between the three WHO severity groups after Bonferroni's correction. Other variables showed overall group differences, but inter-group analysis demonstrated only partial differences. Hence, dyspnea and cough were more prevalent in Severe or Critical patients than Moderate patients (Appendix B3,4). Severe or Critical patients also presented lower pulsed oxygen measures compared to Moderate patients (Appendix B9). C-reactive protein (CRP) was also higher in Severe and Critical patients than in Moderate patients (Appendix B11). Critical patients did have higher body temperature, lower partial oxygen pressure and lower lymphocyte count (Appendix B7, B10, B12). They experienced more AKI, had a higher Lactate Dehydrogenase level (LDH), Creatinine Phosphokinase level (CPK), and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) enzyme titer and lower albumin (Appendix B6, B13, B13-16).

A general limitation common to most scores developed for COVID-19 infection is that they require a blood sample and imaging and therefore could be used only in patients already admitted in the hospital. The model has been designed to create a score in hospitalized patients. Obviously, having been structured and built upon a population of patients with a median age of 73-years-old, it applies to a population with these characteristics. To understand if it is applicable to a different subset of patients (i.e., younger patients), it should be used prospectively in a different trial and this is our goal for future research efforts.",

Multicenter studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary data. The EPI-SCORE is intended to implement the current WHO Severity SCORE in the acute setting. Thanks to its high predictive accuracy, we believe it can be used first of all by those clinicians who stand in the front line, helping them to make appropriate decisions during admissions of patients to COVID-19 dedicated wards. Assigning each patient to a very specific category of risk as easily by adopting the EPI-SCORE can also help physicians in hospital wards to guide the therapies (if available) and to tailor the healthcare allied personnel commitment, hopefully reducing the continuous and harmful waste of resources.
