The paper begins with a discussion of President Trump's racist rhetoric towards Blacks but notes that a history of racism is woven into the US presidency. We employ critical race theory as a theoretical framework to demonstrate why institutional racism has always been pervasive in the American presidency. Using a case study analysis, the authors conduct a comparative study of the history of racism of American presidents with the presidency of former president Donald J. Trump.",

As president, Donald Trump displayed a callous hostility towards Black people, in his rhetoric and his public policies. However, Trump's animosity towards African Americans is rooted in the vestiges of racial sentiment long held towards Blacks since the founding of this country. According to Ian Haney Lopez, a UC-Berkeley scholar, \"Trump's words can't be disconnected from this country's long history of racist stereotypes and discrimination\" (Rascoe, 2018) . Neither Trump's rhetoric nor negative sentiments towards racial minorities were new to the presidency. As president, Trump considered himself a nationalist, which many saw as a code word for being a white nationalist, meaning that the USA was founded on the premise of white supremacy and that Whites should do what they can to maintain that status quo.",

After a careful examination of the socio-political and economic structures that have been developed by White people for the intention of claiming superiority and usurping dominance over Black people, she developed a seminal work, the \"Theory of Color-Confrontation.\" Her theory states that \"the white or color-deficient Europeans responded psychologically with a profound sense of numerical inadequacy and color inferiority upon their confrontations with the massive majority of the world's people all of whom possessed varying degrees of color producing capacity\" (Cress-Wellsing, 1974, p. 34) . Because of this insecurity, what ensued, on the part of Europeans, were sordid and sociopathic oppressive ways of interacting with those who were not White. Africans were enslaved and forcibly brought to America for the express intention of building and supporting the US economy. Since its inception, racism has been embedded in the American culture. Race is a distinct concept from racism but the two are related. A key element of racism is it is based on perceptions -both real and imagined differences among groups of people. Furthermore, those differences assign values that benefit one group at the expense of other groups (Bell, 2008) . And power is distributed based on those real and perceived differences, creating structural inequity that benefits the perceived superior group and disadvantages the subordinate groups (Bobo, 2017) . In this paper, the authors contend that racism is entrenched in all spheres of American society, is a historical aspect of the US presidency, and that it has been and is systematically manifested in various ways through executive policies and practices. Because of the outlandish, inordinate number of racist remarks that were directed at African Americans by former President Trump during his four years in office, one could easily believe that his contempt for Black people is not representative of past presidents. The authors will show that this is not the case by making comparisons between his racist acts and those of other presidents, beginning with George Washington.",

Since Donald Trump first announced he was running for president of the USA in 2015, it was clear he would use racism as the centerpiece of his campaign to win the White House in 2016. In fact, while President Barack Obama was still in office, Trump began publicly questioning whether Obama was born in the USA and had a legitimate claim on being President of the USA because he was not a natural born citizen, which is required by Article II of the U.S. Constitution. This was essentially a modern version of an American precept that Black people are not worthy of being citizens of this country. Since being elected President in 2016, Donald Trump's racism has been on full display to this country and the world.",

CRT grew out of critical legal theory, but its ideas have had an influence on scholarly writings on race and ethnicity in other disciplines such as political science, education, ethnic studies, and feminist studies. \"Law and politics are inextricably linked and CRT calls for a multidisciplinary approach to understanding the role of race in society\" (Graham, 2007, p. 213) . Derek Bell, one of the founders of CRT, advanced the interest convergence theory that racial progress in the area of civil rights is tied to white self-interest. In other words, civil rights progress for Blacks only occurs when the interests of Whites would be either advanced or not harmed (Bell, 2008) .",

However, it becomes critical to recognize the systemic damage of many of these policies in areas such as criminal justice, civil rights, education, housing, the environment, and many others, though color-blind on their face, tend to disproportionately affect communities of color. Political scientist Barbara Luck Graham notes that Critical race theory offers a harsh critique of traditional liberal principles while at the same time rejecting conservative visions of equality. Critical race theorists seek to uncover how appeals to color blindness, merit, neutrality and equality of opportunity actually hinder racial progress and contribute to the continual oppression of people of color (Graham, 2007, pp. 212-213) .",

            "text": "Political Scientist Wilbur Rich argues the grand narrative of America is its unwavering commitment to freedom and equality (Rich, 2007, p. 232) . However, to be faithful to these ideals, presidents must take on the issues of race forthrightly. Additionally, Rich asserts race relations still play only an \"ancillary role in the discourse about the nature of the American presidency\" (Rich, 2007, p. 232) . As a result, he argues scholars treat civil rights as a footnote or simply do not discuss the issue at all-preferring to talk about foreign policy and defense of the nation from \"real and imagined\" enemies. History has taught us that presidents play a large role in reinforcing social boundaries. For example, Rich notes that some presidents \"have reassured whites that racial boundaries will remain intact, while others have promised whites that they have little to fear from conceding privileges or that racial progress will not take place at their expense\" (Rich, 2007, p. 233) . Furthermore, Rich observes much of the scholarly discourse on the presidency addresses black civil rights grievances as an infringement on presidential time. Rich examines a variety of typologies on presidential leadership. He offers a typology of Presidents' racial acknowledgment gestures (RAGs) and situational improvement policies (SIPs) (Rich, 2007, p. 246) . According to Rich, all Presidents, regardless of political ideology and party, have used RAGs. Rich defines RAGs as \"... mainly symbolic, individual-specific, or event-specific, that do not result in any substantive change in the position of Blacks as a group\" (p. 232). On the other hand, SIPs are \"major policy shifts that result in substantial race hierarchical changes, and they apportion status, power, and resources to Blacks as a group\" (Rich, 2007, p. 232) . As an example, Rich says that President Theodore Roosevelt's 1901 dinner meeting with the Black educator Booker T. Washington at the White House, though considered an important breakthrough in racial etiquette, amounted to little more than a symbolic gesture or RAG in race relations. Rich argues the office of the presidency plays a critical role in the political progress of African Americans. Rich sees most US presidents as remaining neutral on racial conflicts or what President Richard Nixon's aide, Daniel Patrick Moynihan referred to as \"benign neglect\" (Rich, 2007, p. 233) . As an example, Rich points to Franklin D. Roosevelt's refusal to support anti-lynching legislation. Furthermore, this gave solace to Whites committing those crimes. Lastly, Rich sees most presidents as having mixed records on civil rights for African Americans and only President Johnson's commitment to passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as rising above a symbolic gesture and becoming situational improvement polices (p. 247).",

(2021) , also acknowledge there are several typologies, and theories in the literature on presidential leadership (p. 274). They argue few studies have examined presidential accountability as it relates to race relations. They construct a typology of the racial attitudes and policy perspectives of American presidents from George Washington to Donald Trump. They divide the presidency into seven periods: Revolutionary (1789-1829), Antebellum (1830-1860), Reconstruction (1863-1877), Post-Reconstruction (1880 -1930 ), Civil Rights (1930 -1970 ), and Post-Civil-Rights (1970 . They identify each president along the following continuum: (1) White Supremacist, (2) Racist, (3) Racially Neutral, (4) Racially Ambivalent, and (5) Anti-racist (pp. 275-278). They base the attitudes and racial policies of the presidency on information obtained by various biographical sources including the entire University Press of Kansas American Presidency series and other works by presidential historians (p. 278). After examining all the presidents (save President Joe Biden) they conclude that most of them have not been very sympathetic to the plight of African Americans and their quest for universal freedom and that most were either hostile, neutral or ambivalent in their approach towards African American freedom. It is noteworthy that the authors classify all the antiracist presidents except for Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Benjamin Harrison, as having served in office since the middle of the twentieth century, primarily since the 1960s (p. 274). They conclude most American presidents have been unresponsive to Black Americans' quest for universal freedom.",

So, Riley, in essence suggests that presidential behavior is intended to \"... ward off or moderate significant social change as a threat to the perceived status of the polity's prevailing interest\" (p. 10). Moreover, notes Riley, there is a duality to this role. Nation-keeping presidents may find, in some instances, that profound change is a prerequisite for preservation. According to Riley, \"Most conventional portraits of the presidency... all but ignore that first dimension and tend to underscore the conditionality of the second\" (p. 10).",

Presidential views and attitudes on all political issues are largely based on the incumbent president's conception of the presidency. Because of this, some presidents may see their office as an instrument for change while others see their role much more narrowly. They contrast the view that many held of President Kennedy and President Johnson in the civil rights struggle to that of President Eisenhower, who for the most part, limited his role to the execution and implementation of the existing laws (p. 307). While acknowledging that the president has enormous influence in setting the nation's agenda, they posit that \"... African Americans tend to focus on the person or the office in their quest for social justice. However, to be successful, Blacks need to get the president to support their causes\" (p. 307). The common thread running through all of these studies is that they highlight the specific behavior of what motivates US Presidents and their executive politics and policy on race.",

Furthermore, the Constitution, as a legal document, sanctioned slavery. As the principal founding father, Washington owned slaves on his Mount Vernon plantation in Virginia and when he became the first president and moved to Philadelphia, then the seat of the nation's capital, he took slaves with him. Upon his death in 1799, he had not freed any of his slaves, but he did stipulate in his will that his slaves be freed. Thomas Jefferson, the nation's third president, felt that if slaves were ever freed, they should be deported based on his belief that Blacks and Whites could not live peacefully together. Jefferson, the main author of the Declaration of Independence, which espoused the principles \"all men are created equal and born with unalienable rights,\" never meant for those lofty precepts to apply to African Americans. Ironically, Jefferson (though considering Blacks as inferior human beings) had a long-term sexual relationship with Sally Hemings, a slave with whom he fathered six children.",

Ironically, Jackson is known for the expansion of democracy and extending the right to vote to the common White male. However, not everyone was included in the new Jacksonian Democracy. Jackson was born into poverty and rose to wealth, largely because he personally embraced the institution of slavery. He owned slaves which he used to build his fortune. When he became president, he brought enslaved Americans to the White House to work for him. Walton, Smith, and Wallace sum up this period best when they state none of the early presidents favored universal freedom for Blacks. Additionally, none of the nine presidents during the antebellum era (1830-1860), took any action in response to African Americans' demands for freedom being made by the abolitionist movement (Walton et al., 2021) .",

Many scholars, however, effectively highlight the Hayes-Tilden Compromise of 1877 as the beginning of the death knell for Reconstruction. Republican Rutherford B. Hayes assumed the presidency after a controversial election against Samuel Tilden that was decided ultimately by a committee of 15 from the US Senate, the US House of Representatives, and the US Supreme Court. As a result, Hayes withdrew federal troops that were stationed in the South, and the South began to deny to Blacks the social and political rights they had only recently begun to enjoy. Historian John Hope Franklin writes that \"not even the Supreme Court postponed the overthrow of Radical Reconstruction.\" In 1896, in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, Plessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme Court upheld the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" which legally created a racial caste system in America and effectively reduced Black Americans to second-class citizens in all areas of American life. Political scientist Russell Riley would note that presidents from the era of Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881) to Herbert Hoover (1929) (1930) (1931) (1932) (1933) , did very little to advance the cause of civil rights. He argues, to the contrary, \"... these presidents used their offices to moderate or to stifle active movement toward racial equality\" (Riley, 1999, p. 125) .",

In setting himself apart from his opponent, Clinton would go on the Arsenio Hall Show and play the saxophone in front of a live audience. A seminal moment during the campaign was when Clinton chastised Black rapper Sister Souljah for her violent rap lyrics. It was a way for Clinton to distance himself from African Americans and appeal to white moderates who considered him too sympathetic to Black interests (Bell, 2008) . Once again, a white presidential candidate used dog whistles to appeal to White voters. After becoming the 42nd president by defeating George H. W. Bush in 1992, Clinton followed up on a campaign pledge to get tough on crime as president in 1994 by signing the largest anti-crime bill in history into law mandating life imprisonment without parole after three violent or drug trafficking convictions and $30 billion for state and local prison grants and expansion of state and local police forces (Alexander, 2010) .",

It was not until the second half of the twentieth century with the advent of the modern presidency that there were meaningful efforts on the part of some presidents to address the concerns of African Americans in this country with concrete policy solutions. Derek Bell, one of the founders of CRT, advanced the interest convergence theory that in America racial progress in the area of civil rights is tied to white self-interest. Black progress in the area of civil rights is contingent on the advancement of White interests (see above). As an example of this, President Abraham Lincoln, \"the Great Emancipator\" in a letter to newspaper editor Horace Greeley stated, \"If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that...\" (Bell, 2008) . The Emancipation Proclamation was issued by Lincoln in 1863 primarily to win the war. Franklin Roosevelt, who had a tremendous opportunity to enact public policies favorable to Blacks in this country, failed to do so because of political reasons: he felt support for civil rights would jeopardize his coalition of voters which included a large bloc of southern white voters. However, Roosevelt's successor, Harry Truman was a staunch supporter of civil rights for African Americans. Furthermore, Truman saw the passage of civil rights legislation for Blacks as a cold war imperative. Many communist nations had reminded the USA of our treatment of African Americans whenever we attempted to extol the virtues of democracy around the world. Even during the civil rights era of the 1960s, only President Lyndon Johnson was courageous enough to support meaningful legislation to improve the lives of African Americans throughout the nation. For the most part, US presidents and their executive politics and policies to benefit African Americans have been ambivalent from the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt to the present, largely motivated by whether it would cost them the political support of white voters, and if they deemed it would, they would refrain from supporting or implementing those policies.",

The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution (Civil War Amendments) were designed to bestow full citizenship rights on the newly free African Americans (see above). However, by 1870, shortly after the passage of these amendments, the US Supreme Court began issuing a series of opinions that weakened federal protections by stating they did not apply to the actions of individuals (Kurlowski, 2019) . As a result, southern states begin passing laws to disenfranchise Black voters. Some of the more notable of these laws included registration requirements, grandfather clauses, literacy tests, white primaries, racial gerrymandering, and poll taxes. Over time, all of these laws were declared unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court culminating in the passage of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965, which was designed to end the vote-denial and vote-dilution techniques that kept Blacks from voting. The VRA provided a vehicle for challenging current discriminatory laws, but also for preventing future discriminatory laws (Kurlowski, 2019) . And the VRA had an immediate impact on Black voter registration in the South. The gap between Black and White registration rates declined substantially after passage of the VRA. For example, prior to the VRA becoming law in 1965, Black voter registration levels throughout the South were less than 50% (Table 1) .",

Bush signed the legislation into law. The VRA was originally passed by Congress and signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 (see above). It affirmed the right to vote throughout the country and suspended literacy tests on a nationwide basis. It included special rules for states and localities (\"covered jurisdictions,\" mainly in the South) with a history of racial discrimination, disallowing any election law changes in these places until they were approved by the (2013), the US Supreme Court struck down the formula for determining which states and localities were subject to these restrictions. Since the Shelby decision, numerous states throughout the nation have implemented discriminatory voting practices (some under previously \"covered\" jurisdictions). These new practices include strict government-issued photo ID requirements, consolidation of polling places making it less convenient for minority voters, purging minority voters from voting lists under the pretext of voting list maintenance, the shortening or ending the days of early voting hours, and eliminating some same-day registration during the early voting period (Berman, 2015) . Ironically, the essence of democracy -the right to vote -remains largely contested in this nation.",

Felony disfranchisement laws around the country disproportionately affect African Americans and many of these laws are relics of the racist laws during slavery and Jim Crow in America. According to the Brennan Center (a non-partisan law and public policy institute), only three states have a state constitution that permanently disenfranchises citizens with past felony convictions but allow the governor to restore that right. Voting rights laws for convicted felons vary from state to state. If non-violent felons have paid their debt to society, they should have their full citizenship rights restored. Research shows that incarceration for African Americans has been used as a form of voter disfranchisement (Uggen et al., 2006) .",

Trump began his campaign for the presidency, espousing a racist conspiracy theory that President Obama was not eligible to be president because he was born in Kenya. President Trump continued the tradition followed by most of the US presidents who preceded him with the implementation of policies and programs that continue to advantage Whites at the expense of Blacks and other minorities. The demographics in the country are changing, and the nation is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. Blacks are no longer the largest minority group in the country at 12.9% of the population -Hispanics are the largest ethnic group at 16.7% of the population. Asians are the fastest growing minority group at 5.6% of the population. By the middle of the twenty-first century, demographers estimate this nation will be a majority minority country. Blacks will have the chance to substantially increase their political power by building coalitions with like-minded voters of all races and ethnicities so that the two major political parties can no longer ignore them. Furthermore, their political activism is reminiscent of the young Black protesters of the Civil Rights era. However, to exercise real political power these young activists will need to utilize their right to vote as well. A new coalition of Americans that are multiracial and multiethnic, and multigenerational chanting Black Lives Matter has seized the moment by taking to the streets with a new message of justice and equality and a renewed sense of hope for us all.",
