Test every suspected case.\" 1 In March 2020, medical facilities and public health departments began implementing off-site COVID-19 testing centers across the United States. Off-site COVID-19 testing centers (OSCTC) reduce the risk of exposure to patients and medical staff within medical facilities and minimize the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), which has been reported in short supply across the country. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Between March 20th and April 15th, 2020, the Network for Regional Healthcare Improvement (NRHI) in partnership with Qualidigm, a regional member and collaborative healthcare consulting company, conducted a rapid assessment of the then-current conditions of off-site COVID-19 testing centers (OSCTC) across the United States. The team engaged national and regional partners with the goal to share challenges and considerations so others may be better prepared to deploy similar solutions for rapid testing. This study acknowledges that the findings and considerations are based on early and evolving US-based experiences that were impacted by the availability of tests and testing material, personnel, and personal protective equipment (PPE).",

Respondents reported that they utilized the PPE they had on hand to the best of their abilities, and that availability and climate ultimately dictated how they used their PPE. Some OSCTCs have a dedicated \"watcher\" staff member, who is charged with monitoring all staff members that interact with patients or samples to identify potential contamination and the need to replace PPE. In addition, requiring patients to schedule appointments ensures OSCTCs can plan appropriately for staffing needs, and reduce the time staff interact with patients. OSCTCs often consist of professionals from varying disciplines working together for the first time. Teamwork in healthcare uses collaboration and communication to work towards a common goal. Morning or daily huddles with OSCTC staff was one of the strategies to maintain a working team. \"Every morning the team huddles, talks about number of patients that we're going to be seeing today, runs through the workflow and any changes in the workflow being clear on what the role of each of the members of the team is. We also have a debrief at the end of the clinic just to see what went well what didn't go well, what do we need to change and having a rapid process improvement every day has been very helpful.\"",
