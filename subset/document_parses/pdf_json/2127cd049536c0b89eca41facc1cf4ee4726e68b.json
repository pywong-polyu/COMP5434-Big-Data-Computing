However, there is a paucity of literature on the impact of text messaging on inpatient care. In this study, the use of text messaging in hospitalized patients is evaluated by assessing patient compliance to a post-operative bariatric protocol. Methods This was a randomized controlled trial that studied compliance to a post-operative bariatric protocol in patients who underwent bariatric surgery at a tertiary, academic medical center between February and May 2021. Patients were randomized to either the control group, in which they received standard post-operative education alone or the Tulane Sending Texts, Advancing Results (STAR) intervention arm, in which participants received the same post-operative education along with two text message reminders to drink water, use their incentive spirometers, and ambulate (per post-operative instructions) on post-operative day (POD) # 0 and POD # 1. The primary outcome was compliance with the protocol, defined as the number of 1-oz cups of water consumed, incentive spirometry usage, and ambulation frequency and distance. Secondary outcomes include length of stay and complications. Results A total of 35 patients were enrolled in the study (17 control, 18 STAR intervention). There was no significant difference in age, BMI, or type of surgery performed between the two groups. Clear liquid consumption was significantly higher in the STAR intervention group with an average of 27.7 \u00b1 3.5 cups as compared to 18.2 \u00b1 8.9 in the control group (p < 0.001). Similarly, statistically significant increases in incentive spirometry usage (p < 0.01) and ambulation distance and frequency (p < 0.02) were observed in the STAR intervention group. Conclusions While patients are in the hospital, text messaging can improve compliance to post-operative protocols. Perioperative text messaging can enhance patient education and communication.",

The Tulane STAR group (intervention arm) received the same education combined with text message reminders. The primary outcome was the difference in amount of clear liquids consumed, frequency of incentive spirometry usage, and frequency/distance of ambulation compared between the intervention and control groups. The amount of liquid consumed was measured by counting the number of 1-oz cups as a surrogate for the exact volume, with the idea that each of them were filled equally as educated. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay and post-operative complications. Complications were defined as the inability to tolerate oral intake, ileus, venous thromboembolism, postoperative infection, emergency department (ED) visit within 30 days of discharge, or readmission within 30 days.",

Text messaging is gaining momentum as a tool in healthcare and is being used in the outpatient setting to remind patients of appointments, to engage in activities that promote wellness, and to prompt patients to follow discharge instructions. Text messaging patients during inpatient stays is a logical next step in educating patients and encouraging them to participate in their care. There is already evidence that physical activity can be improved through the use of text message reminders sent to patients [7] . In a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis, Smith et al. report that text message reminders are associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of steps taken per day [7] . This review is critical because physical inactivity is a major risk factor for multiple diseases seen in the bariatric population, including various cardiovascular processes such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and has been shown to improve mental health in some populations [8, 9] . Other current uses of text messaging involve increasing awareness around healthy topics and screening for various physical and mental diseases such as HIV and depression to increase early detection and begin intervention sooner [10, 11] . There is also evidence that text message reminders can be used for pre-operative optimization for improved outcomes [12] . A number of programs involved in the post-discharge setting have been developed including postpartum care, post-operative care, and treatment of chronic heart failure and hypertension [13] [14] [15] [16] . These programs also support the notion that text messaging with patients can serve to educate, remind about key components of care, and provide positive feedback. Given COVID-19 and the recent pandemic, new efforts must be focused on optimizing and efficiently communicating while patients are in the hospital. While face-to-face communication is ideal, every interaction increases exposure and theoretically, transmission risk of viruses or other infections. Past successes with text messaging as a tool to modify patient behavior, in combination with the challenges posted by COVID-19, caused us to beg the question whether text messaging can be applied to the inpatient setting and improve implementation of postoperative protocols.",

These text message reminders were effective in encouraging patients to consume a greater amount of clear liquids on POD #0, use their incentive spirometer, and ambulate. We observed a greater consumption of around 9.5 cups between the education and text message and education arms. Likewise, incentive spirometry usage significantly trended towards greater frequency per hour among patients who received text message reminders. Lastly, patients receiving text message reminders were more likely to ambulate more frequently and greater distances.",

As discussed above, perhaps in combination with pre-operative optimization, and post-operative follow-up, text messaging in the hospital can complete the timeline of a patient's care. This could theoretically result in improved outcomes and financial benefits for both the patient and hospital system. This study has limitations with the first being its sample size. As this study is a pilot to test a hypothesis, it was kept small. Additionally, as patients are frequently discharged on post-operative day #1, the full effects of the text messages on hospital length of stay are limited. We also did not fully study patient-related outcomes in this study, such as satisfaction or pain medication usage to name a few, as we first hoped to prove text messaging was an effective way to implement a protocol. Patients were understandably not blinded during this study which could have also biased results. This study was also conducted at one hospital system and only offered to patients able to read English text messages which limits its generalizability. However, over fifty percent of our patient population is non-Caucasian. Lastly, the text messaging system we utilized was not automated and required a deliberate effort to send the messages, but this was a purposeful decision. As this was a small study, we did not require the high-volume services that an automated system uses. Furthermore, many of the automated texting programs are fee based and we did not believe a paid service was necessary in a pilot study.",
