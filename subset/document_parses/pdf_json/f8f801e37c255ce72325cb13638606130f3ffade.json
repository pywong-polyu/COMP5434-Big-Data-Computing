Its infection depends on the binding of spike protein to the host cell receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1). Hydroxychloroquine has been applied as one of the COVID-19 treatment strategies. Here we aimed to evaluate hydroxychloroquine treatment on SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression in human primary pterygium and conjunctival cells and its potential influences. Expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and NRP1 proteins were found in the epithelial layer of both primary pterygium and conjunctiva tissues as well as in their isolated fibroblasts. High concentration of hydroxychloroquine treatment significantly reduced the viability of both primary pterygium and conjunctival cells. ACE2 protein expression was significantly decreased in both pterygium and conjunctival cells after hydroxychloroquine treatment. Hydroxychloroquine also reduced NRP1 protein expression in conjunctival cells. In contrast, TMPRSS2 protein expression showed slightly increased in conjunctival cells. Notably, ROS production and SOD2 expression was significantly elevated in both pterygium and conjunctival cells after hydroxychloroquine treatment. In summary, this study revealed the reduction of ACE2 and NRP1 expression by hydroxychloroquine in human primary pterygium and conjunctival fibroblasts; yet with the increase in TMPRSS2 expression and oxidative stress and decrease in cell viability. Implementation of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment should be carefully considered with its potential side effects and in combination with TMPRSS2 inhibitor.",

The staining without addition of primary antibody was served as negative control. Rat lung tissue sections and human lung epithelial carcinoma A549 cells (catalogue number: CCL-185, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were served as positive control. The stained tissue sections were imaged using a confocal microscope (TCS SP5 II, Leica). Co-immunostaining analysis was performed with the cell identity markers to confirm the cell types expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2 and NRP1 proteins. For each tissue sample, 5 sections were imaged.",

To elucidate the acute toxic effect of hydroxychloroquine on human primary pterygium and conjunctival cells, we first analyzed their cell viability after hydroxychloroquine treatment. The CCK8 assay demonstrated that, upon 25-500 \u03bcM hydroxychloroquine treatment, the survival of pterygium cells was significantly and dose-dependently reduced by 64.16%-98.99% as compared to the vehicle (0.1% DMSO)-treated cells (p < 0.001; Fig. 3A ). Treatment of 1 (93.50 \u00b1 13.64%, p = 0.583) and 10 \u03bcM hydroxychloroquine (90.37 \u00b1 17.34%, p = 0.435) did not significantly influence the survival of pterygium cells as compared to the vehicle control group (100.87 \u00b1 12.97%). Similarly, the survival of conjunctival cells was significantly and dose-dependently decreased by 71.64%-98.50% as compared to the vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.001; Fig. 3B ). Conjunctival cells treated with 1 (90.21 \u00b1 17.17%, p = 0.515) and 10 \u03bcM hydroxychloroquine (93.53 \u00b1 19.83%, p = 0.758) showed no statistically significant differences as compared to the vehicle control group (96.50 \u00b1 13.75%). Our results suggest that exposure of \u226525 \u03bcM hydroxychloroquine would reduce both primary pterygium and conjunctival cell viability.

Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 invade the host cells primarily via binding to the host receptor ACE2 (Wu et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020) , which is expressed in multiple human cell types and organ systems and plays a critical role in blood pressure regulation (Sun et al., 2021) . In addition, TMPRSS2 was reported to be responsible for S protein priming, which is also necessary for ACE2 entry (Bestle et al., 2020) . TMPRSS2 inhibitor could block SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Recently, NRP1 was identified to be another host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is abundantly expressed in the respiratory and olfactory (Daly et al., 2020) . The fragment of S protein could directly interact with NRP1. Co-expressing with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, NRP1 could promote the infection and spreading of SARS-CoV-2 (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020) . Understanding the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2 and NRP1 should be able to predict the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in human system.",

On the contrary, strong or weak expression of ACE2 was observed in the epithelium layer of conjunctiva (Mencucci et al., 2021) . In this study, weak ACE2 protein expression signal in the stroma of conjunctiva as well as the stroma and epithelium of primary pterygium tissues (Fig. 1) . Moreover, the ACE2 signal was co-localized with vimentin, the marker of fibroblasts, in the isolated primary pterygium and conjunctival cells (Fig. 2) , further confirming the observation of ACE2 expression in the stromal layer of primary pterygium and conjunctival tissues. Besides, our previous study also reported that lack of mRNA expression of TMPRSS2 genes in human primary conjunctival cells in RT-PCR analysis, but weak expression in SYBR green PCR analysis (Ma et al., 2020) . Instead, this study demonstrated strong expression of TMPRSS2 protein in human conjunctival tissues and cells (Fig. 1) . The inconsistent results among our previous gene expression analysis as well as different studies could be related to the ACE2 antibody applied and the conjunctival samples from the study subjects as well as genetic and epigenetic controls on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression regulation. However, considering the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the stromal expression of ACE2 and strong epithelial and weak stromal expression of TMPRSS2 in human conjunctival tissues (Fig. 1D ) further indicated that conjunctiva could less likely be susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, we, for the first time, identified NRP1 protein expression in human primary pterygium and conjunctival epithelial cells.",

One possible strategy raised to reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry by interfering its connection with the host receptors. Hydroxychloroquine possesses anti-myriad and immunomodulatory capacities, and it has been commonly used for malaria and autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (Lim et al., 2009; Martinez et al., 2020) . Moreover, hydroxychloroquine has been shown to interact with ACE2 terminal glycosylation in vitro, disrupting the connection between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 (Biot et al., 2006; Brufsky, 2020) . The patients with COVID-19, receiving combined treatment of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, showed significant reduction in viral carriage (Gautret et al., 2020) . Low dose of hydroxychloroquine has been reported effectively reducing the mortality rate of COVID-19 hospitalized patients as compared to those only with supportive care (Catteau et al., 2020 ). Yet, COVID-19 patients received 800 mg loading dose of hydroxychloroquine and 400 mg daily for 9 days did not show significant differences in viral clearance and symptom resolution as compared to the placebo group (Reis et al., 2021) . Besides, post-exposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine also did not limit the SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy persons (Mitja et al., 2021) . In this study, we further provided a possible mechanism for hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 that the expressions of ACE2 and NRP1 proteins were significantly downregulated in human conjunctival cells after hydroxychloroquine treatment but TMPRSS2 protein expression showed slightly increase (Fig. 4A-D) . As hydroxychloroquine could not block SARS-CoV-2 entry mediated by TMPRSS2 (Ou et al., 2021) , the net effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral infectivity still needs to be further evaluated in future studies. Combination of hydroxychloroquine with TMPRSS2 inhibitor could be considered to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection than hydroxychloroquine alone (Ou et al., 2021) .",
