The proportion of RA patients receiving corticosteroids persists across the life course, with suboptimal bone prophylactic therapy. . Long-term corticosteroid use has implications for RA comorbidities and infection susceptibility (including COVID -19) . recommended in early RA, when initiating or changing DMARDs, with tapered withdrawal of corticosteroids guided by response and risk factors [1, 3, 4] . Long-term DMARD therapy should limit inflammation and the symptoms that underpin continued corticosteroid and NSAID prescribing. The latter agents may mask uncontrolled disease activity and are associated with substantial long-term risks (including cardiovascular, bone and gastrointestinal disorders) even at low doses, particularly among the elderly population with comorbidities [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Guidelines recommend prophylaxis co-prescribing: proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) to mitigate against gastrointestinal adverse effects of NSAIDs; and boneprotective treatment when prescribing 7.5 mg of prednisolone daily for 3 months, to prevent osteoporotic fractures [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

            "text": "This study demonstrated little change in corticosteroid prescribing in RA patients in the UK by GPs, and no change in the year post-diagnosis despite modern treatment strategies. Although the decline in corticosteroid prescription was significant across the first 3 years post-diagnosis, prescribing remained substantial 3 years post-diagnosis (17.9%) and persisted for the duration of the study, particularly in older age groups. NSAID prescribing halved among RA patients, predominantly driven by changing practice for newly diagnosed patients, though remained substantial (34.3% at 3 years post-diagnosis). Additionally, the increased DMARD prescribing in the year post-diagnosis plateaued from 2009. Improvements in prophylaxis co-prescribing remain suboptimal. In elderly and comorbid populations treated with DMARD immune suppressants, persistent corticosteroid exposure with attendant immune suppression is particularly concerning and pertinent in the context of infectious diseases including COVID-19 and tuberculosis [26] . Our prevalence estimates of RA of 0.5-1%, higher among women and increasing with age, are consistent with older studies [25, 27] . Abishek et al. using CPRD data, reported lower incidence and prevalence (1990-2014) and declining incidence, which we did not find, especially in sensitivity analyses [25] . This may be due to differences in defining RA. In the UK, GPs receive payment for using specific RA codes to maintain a registry of RA patients and perform annual review and risk assessments [28] . Some of these codes were not used to define RA by Abishek et al. although they were in our study. This would make some patients, and particularly those diagnosed in rheumatology clinics and annually reviewed by GPs, less likely to be included in the previous study. Further, we included codes naming RA in specific joints and excluded patients without 1 year of 'up to standard' registration.",

However, we show that corticosteroid prescribing has persisted in the current treat-totarget era, even after the first year of diagnosis. While some therapy strategies continue corticosteroid prescribing beyond the 3-and 6-month definitions of longterm used here [33] , we found persistence even 15 years post-diagnosis. As observed in other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (e.g. polymyalgia rheumatica), corticosteroids may relieve symptoms (e.g. regional musculoskeletal complaints) not necessarily relating to activity of the index disease [34, 35] . This likely perpetuates corticosteroid prescribing despite guidelines and trial-based evidence of associated diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease risk in RA patients [9, 10, 12] . It may also mask symptoms of poor RA disease control. While the difficulties in corticosteroid tapering, including adrenal suppression, are well recognized, there are reported favourable outcomes from discontinuing corticosteroids after 34 weeks in early RA [36] . Intramuscular corticosteroids provide a fixed tapered dose and may be useful for short-term use [4] . Clinicians need to recognise the unmet need for pain control, which can contribute to disease activity scores, and assess whether joint pain is due to RA or other conditions [37] [38] [39] .",

Declining NSAID prescribing among RA patients and increasing GI prophylaxis (especially from 2005) reflects rising awareness of NSAID toxicity through the early 2000s and the withdrawal of rofecoxib [42] [43] [44] . However, the rate of increasing GI prophylaxis co-prescribing has slowed and reversed in 2017. Initial increases in bone prophylaxis reversed from 2008, with declining bisphosphonate co-prescribing while vitamin D-calcium co-prescribing plateaued around 50%. A similar trend in bisphosphonates was reported in Canada, USA and Australia following safety concerns [45] [46] [47] . With growing RA prevalence among the elderly who are most susceptible to multi-morbidity [48] , renewed efforts to increase bone and GI prophylaxis are crucial, and must target extant as well as incident RA cases.",

RA definitions were affected by coding practices, including payment introduced for GPs in the UK in 2013, for diagnostic coding of RA patients [28] , which correlates with a peak in incidence in this study, which we attempted to address with sensitivity analyses. It may have triggered incident coding of prevalent cases, where records had undifferentiated arthritis coded or free-text RA diagnostic references. The higher prevalence estimates post-2013 may therefore be more accurate. While data was utilized from a representative sample of UK GP practices, prescribing may differ between settings and countries. Importantly CPRD does not capture secondary care prescribing of conventional or biologic-DMARDs or intravenous bisphosphonates and denusomab so DMARDs and bone protectants were underestimated in this study. DMARD prescribing may have continued to rise through biologic availability in secondary care; however, these are typically second-line therapeutics and GP DMARD prescribing did not change across the life course, suggesting that the apparent plateau from 2009 requires investigation. Intramuscular, intravenous and intra-articular corticosteroids (which may also be given in secondary care) were not assessed, so the corticosteroid burden is also higher than we report and their use may have changed over time. Further, we did not examine all analgesics that may be used in RA management. Unascertainable prescription durations were set at 90 days, which may overestimate use given that the mode duration was 28 days. However, this affected <3% prescriptions, findings were consistent in subanalyses of 180 days prescribing, and this should not affect interpretation of change over time. These longterm prescribing definitions should also allow for unused prescriptions, given the mode prescription duration. We did not examine change in corticosteroid dosages, which would inform understanding of exposure and medication tapering; however, toxicity is increased for all doses [8] [9] [10] [11] and we showed prescribing for 15 years post-diagnosis, beyond the recommended duration for tapering. We could not distinguish where DMARDs were unsuitable or ineffective and long-term corticosteroids or NSAIDs formed part of an informed therapeutic approach, but such cases are uncommon [51] and DMARD prescribing was more common among RA patients with long-term corticosteroids.",

Long-term corticosteroid prescribing has clear implications for RA comorbidities and susceptibility to infection (of particular relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic). Rheumatologists need to understand the causes of persistent prescribing and develop alternative strategies of pain management. currently employed by IQVIA, a research contract organization.

Compared with age 18-29 years, prescribing increased significantly with age until 50-59 (e.g. 50-59: IRR 1.34, 95% CI: 1.28, 1.39) before decreasing with older age. There was no sex difference but long-term prescribing was greater among the least socioeconomic deprived patients (quintile 5 compared with 1: IRR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.06). In the non-RA cohort, 19.7% had long-term NSAID prescribing during follow-up, rising from 6.4% in 1998 to 8.4% in 2017.In the year post-diagnosis, 42.1% had long-term prescribing. This declined from 57.7% in 1998 to 27.1% in 2016, with sub-analyses showing similar patterns. The decline was significant between 2008 and 2016 (e.g. GP practice accounted for slight variability in prescribing in the year post-diagnosis (variance: 0.01, standard deviation: 0.11, Hausman P \u00bc 0.12). There was no sex or socioeconomic deprivation difference but a trend towards lower prescribing with increasing age.",

For corticosteroids the proportion declined from 22.2% (21.7-22.6%) to 16.9% (14.9-18.9%) and for NSAIDs from 41.2% (40.6-41.7%) to 28.4% (25.9-30.8%). Most of the decline occurred by year 3 [mean APC -10.20 (corticosteroids) and -8.66 (NSAIDs)]. Assessments of combination prescribing showed consistent patterns (Supplementary",
