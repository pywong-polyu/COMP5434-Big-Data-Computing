First, containment measures put in place in member states at diff erent times and with diff erent levels of severity determined the interruption of several economic activities that were considered non-essential. Second, diff erent occupations require varying degrees of physical proximity and social interaction to be carried out; this implies that they can be considered more or less teleworkable, and aff ected by diff erent levels of epidemiological risk of contagion. This paper shows the labour market impact of the pandemic on diff erent categories of workers in the EU. Occupations are distinguished by three main characteristics: whether they are critical or non-critical, their level of technical teleworkability and the level of social interaction required in the job. We show that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market has been heterogeneous across occupations and that all three dimensions are relevant to determine whether and to what extent the occupations were aff ected by the pandemic.",

This paper contributes to the literature by providing evidence on the real labour market impact of the pandemic on diff erent categories of workers in the EU. We develop a taxonomy to identify categories of workers who might have been more or less severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

We build indices on occupational groups defi ned at the International Standard Classifi cation of Occupations (ISCO) 3-digit level and analyse the employment evolution of occupations in these groups between 2019 and 2020 by using data from the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS).

Such provisions were often later relaxed to allow non-essential activities to re-open, under the condition that stringent health and safety requirements were met. From the last months of 2020, in a vast majority of countries, only a few selected sectors were offi cially shut down (e.g. museums, cinemas, gyms), or allowed to operate with strong limitations (e.g. restaurants and caf\u00e9s).",

This Communication defi nes a list of \"key workers\" that should be allowed to move across borders \"because they exercise critical occupations by performing activities related to essential services\", which they should be able to do \"without undue hindrance\". This categorisation (even though originally devised to allow cross-country mobility) provides a distinction between workers who were most likely allowed to continue working even under the strictest containment measures, and those who were not, unless working from home. 2 Our approach is similar to the one adopted by Fasani and Mazza (2020) and OECD (2020), which also resort to the Communication to defi ne key workers. This dichotomous variable capturing critical occupations represents the fi rst dimension of our taxonomy. 3 1 As an example, the initial identifi cation of essential activities in Italian decrees relied on classifi cations of sectors as detailed as at the 5-or even 6-digit level of NACE, i.e. the Statistical classifi cation of economic activities in the European Community. EU-LFS microdata only provide information on the economic sector of jobs at the NACE 1-digit level. 2 It should also be noted that since March 2020, the containment measures have been subject to several changes. As mentioned above, the initial strict lockdowns implemented in most of the countries were followed by a strong relaxation of these measures; and with the second wave of the pandemic, only a few selected sectors were offi cially shut down or allowed to operate with strong limitations, therefore abandoning the initial distinction of essential vs non-essential jobs.

The apparent advantage of cross-country comparison is therefore likely undermined by the lower precision in the analysis of the individual occupations, since the most detailed level available is already an aggregation of several occupations, possibly very diverse in nature.

In detail, we build on the defi nitions adopted by Sostero et al. (2020) , where an occupation is technically teleworkable if its value of the technical teleworkability index is higher than 0.4, and the level of social interaction required in the job is low/high depending on whether the social interaction index is lower/higher than 0.5. Based on these thresholds, we transform the two continuous indices into binary variables. The two variables are then interacted to create four categories, consisting of occupations that are: (i) non-teleworkable and requiring high social interaction (health professionals; health associate professionals; care, service and sales workers); (ii) non-teleworkable, but requiring low social interaction (such as skilled agricultural, forestry and fi shery workers; craft and related trade workers; plant and machine operators and assemblers; most elementary occupations); (iii) teleworkable with high social interaction (e.g. managers; teaching professionals; business, administration, legal, social and cultural professionals and associated professionals); and (iv) teleworkable with low social interaction (such as clerical support workers and ICT professionals).
