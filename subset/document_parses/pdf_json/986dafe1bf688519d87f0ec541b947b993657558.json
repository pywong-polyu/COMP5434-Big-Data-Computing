Both AIT injections and DA testing 329 resumed at a comparable, if not increased, pace with new patients. In contrast, environmental and food 330 ST completion rates dropped compared to pre-COVID. No significant demographic differences were 331 found other than higher MyChart portal activation among patients who completed ST. MyChart is an 332 important means of after-visit communication and may have helped decrease loss-to-follow-up after the 333 video visit. Additional areas of study include how MyChart use (receipt of after visit summary, online scheduling, types of messages) may have affected ST completion rates, and further eliciting patients' 335 reasons for not completing ordered ST (concerns about COVID-19 safety or barriers to access unrelated completion rates of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures services, which may have been affected by 341 patients deferring care until after the pandemic. We surveyed a small number of A/I providers about their 342 perception regarding the new TM model. Future studies are needed to investigate clinical outcomes for 343 specific diagnoses, cost implications, and patient satisfaction.344 345 In summary, our findings highlight both benefits and challenges associated with utilizing TM for A/I care 346 delivery. Implementation of AAAAI guidance allowed continued delivery of A/I care services with zero 347 patient, staff, and provider COVID-19 infections resulting from in-clinic exposure. Benefits included ease 348 of access for patients with digital literacy, and easier preparation and allocation of clinic resources when 349 all procedures are provided on a scheduled, rather than on-demand, basis. Further study is needed on 350 interventions to decrease barriers to TM acceptance and feasibility in non-White, non-English-speaking 351 populations. Our initial findings also suggest that MyChart activation is associated with increased ST 352 completion in a TM-based model, and further study of interventions involving electronic communication 353 may address a primary challenge of TM implementation in A/I. With continued refinement, the expansion 354 of TM and changing regulations may facilitate A/I care delivery even after the COVID-19 pandemic. 355 356 Acknowledgements: The authors thank Cameron Ashbaugh, Andrew Gross, and Lorriana Leard for 357 their leadership and involvement in the clinic's telemedicine transition. 2.
