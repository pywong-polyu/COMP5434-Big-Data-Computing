Elective treatments and imaging have been largely cancelled across the world to allow better allocation of resources towards COVID-19 patients. However, the impact of such delays for cardiac patients could prove drastic. Although the number of hospital patients presenting with coronary symptoms during the outbreak have decreased internationally, it is now imperative that safety protocols be upheld and life preserving surgeries be provided where appropriate. In this review, we discuss how COVID-19 has affected primary cardiac intervention globally, how services have been adapted to taking precautionary measures, and how morbidity rates can be reduced by introducing scoring systems and telemedicine.

This was to allow for more resources focused on combating COV-ID-19 and to reduce nosocomial infections. It has been proposed that the drop in cardiology procedures may also be the result of patients' fear of entering hospitals where they may be in greater proximity to COVID-19 patients (2) . Overall, the cause of this decrease is multifactorial and the healthcare impact of COVID-19 lies far beyond the patients infected with the virus itself. With such focus on infected patient, cardiovascular services will need to adapt to uphold precautionary measures and continue efficient provision of care. A risk stratification scoring system could be implemented to help identify patients who need earlier intervention.",

            "text": "As the situation is rapidly evolving globally, it may be difficult to provide practice recommendations for cardiology services. Several recommendations have been proposed; outpatients who are asymptomatic and stable will have their treatment deferred, while unstable patients with conditions such as ascending aortic dissections, ACS and symptomatic aortic stenosis, who cannot be discharged safely should be cared for following usual guidelines as far as possible (11) . Postponing rather than cancelling elective procedures is generally recommended to sustain healthcare services and to reduce patient exposure to the high volume of COVID-19 patients in hospitals. However, there is a need to be wary of significant increase in morbidity in lengthy postponements of a few months (12) . Indeed, the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS) provided guidelines stating that with the national PPCI programme, this service should be maintained the standard care for STEMI and implemented as efficiently as possible (13) . Ultimately, a decision has to be made based on hospital staff capacity, ICU beds available, ventilators, ECMO machines and blood products. Another challenge is the shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE) and it has been suggested that masks can be sterilised and reused (14) . Surgical staff have to wear extra bulky protective gear which may pose as a challenge to some, interfering with the level of care as a result. Early discharge of patients should also be considered, together with monitoring of their conditions post treatment via telemetry (11) .",

Presentations of COVID-19 are variable and infected patients may be unaware of their disease and may not alert medical staff about non-specific symptoms they are experiencing. In addition to donning PPE, it is also proposed that hospital staff split into smaller work groups (16) . If quarantine is needed, only the individual group will have to stop work and there is no need for the whole unit to close. Handling of airway and oesophagus pose a high risk of aerosolization of virus particles increasing the risk of inhalation of COVID-19. As such, N95 masks are recommended especially when attending to patients undergoing urgent cardiac surgery (17, 18) .",

In particular vulnerable groups such as diabetic, elderly and chronic patients as well as those with previous cardiac surgeries and renal failure may face additional complications that will need to be addressed. In light of this, it becomes increasingly important to strategize a risk stratification system in order to identify patients that may be in need of urgent intervention after delay. A paper published in the United States proposed a scoring system for elective surgeries, after a blanket cancellation order was submitted by the American College of Surgeons (ACS). It was suggested that cardiovascular procedures have an urgency of 2 weeks (19) . Adapting and implementing such a system to elective cardiac surgeries could assist in determining the urgency of cases and ensuring patient safety.",
