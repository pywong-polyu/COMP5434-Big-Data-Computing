            "text": "Even as many countries struggle to care for critically ill COVID-19 patients, a new challenge has emerged: Post-Intensive Care Syndrome after coronavirus infection, or as we name it, PICS-COV. 1 Patients who receive intensive care are known to be at high risk for physical, psychological and cognitive impairments, a constellation known as PICS. A subset of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently required several weeks of such intensive care; furthermore, traditional PICS preventive measures, such as reduction of environmental stressors, early mobility or writing an ICU diary, are virtually impossible due to infection control precautions, prone positioning and deprivation of social contact. 2 Consequently, COVID-19 patients potentially have a substantial need for physical, psychological and cognitive rehabilitation after discharge from the ICU and the hospital. 3 In the present viewpoint, we discuss how Virtual Reality (VR) can provide rehabilitation to post-COVID-19 patients. We summarise the needs for rehabilitation of patients who suffered from COVID-19, particularly those after ICU admission, the potential of VR rehabilitation and the expected challenges to implement home-based VR rehabilitation.",

Nonetheless, the resources needed to successfully implement these healthcare interventions are inadequate because healthcare systems faced a shortage of high-quality PICS treatment even before the COVID-19 crisis emerged. 7 Traditional PICS treatments also do not account for the additional emotional and societal side-effects of this particular crisis, such as social distancing, limitation of family members' visits and consultations by primary caregivers when patients are discharged. VR provides healthcare practitioners with the means to administer fast, temporary and tailormade rehabilitation services at a distance, and offers a solution to address the impending surge of demand for PICS-COV therapy.",

            "text": "In addition to physical rehabilitation, we should anticipate a need for psychological support to reduce depression, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety in COVID-19 patients. An intensive care admission is a fearsome experience, especially when a patient is supported by mechanical ventilation as is common in COVID-19. Depression occurs in approximately 30% of recovering patients, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 10-50% of patients and anxiety in 70% of PICS patients. 2 Psychological therapy targeting these indications can be offered through VR. There are many applications designed to target stress reduction, depression, anxiety and even PTSD. Applications, for example, can provide mindfulness by employing guided meditation in natural settings which might decrease experience of pain and stress. 15 With regard to depression, there exist several promising applications which provide gamified cognitive behavioural therapies, psychoeducation, behavioural activation and cognitive restructuring. 16 In addition, VR has demonstrated success in the application of exposure therapy-a modality in which participants are virtually confronted with their fears to decrease anxiety or PTSD. 17 18 High physical and psychological stressors during ICU admissions routinely result in cognitive disabilities such as memory loss, inability to concentrate, and may confer higher risks of dementia. Without intervention, such impairments can last for years after discharge. 19 Cognitive interventions, including memory exercises and exercises for building optimism, may reduce these symptoms. 20 These can easily be provided through VR, and allow for exercises to be completed at individualised pacing. 21 ADVANTAGES OF VIRTUAL REALITY FOR PICS-COV REHABILITATION VR rehabilitation as part of telemedicine solutions has several advantages compared to traditional rehabilitation. First, considering our society's continuing need for social distancing, therapy can be given at a distance. Second, VR allows therapists to treat patients simultaneously. While therapists must monitor sessions at a distance in some cases, live support is generally not required, increasing patients' autonomy and reducing the workload of therapists. Other telemedicine solutions, such as video calls and therapy by videos or games on a flat-screen, offer (some) similar advantages. What makes VR particularly different is that it provides its users with a 3D immersive environment. The immersion makes therapy more fun and reduces distraction from the external environment. Both might increase therapy adherence and engagement. Besides, VR may serve to distract patients from experienced fatigue and anxiety which would otherwise hinder their ability to move. 22 In addition, VR offers extensive tools compared to other telemedicine services that allow therapists through the use of a dashboard and tracking software to constantly monitor treatment adherence and patients' performance.",

The challenge for VR developers and therapists will be to rapidly select and in some cases (re)design applications that are safe and effective in use for PICS-COV rehabilitation at home, based on patientreported experiences that thus far are still scarce and dispersed. Another barrier to implementation is the safety of using VR HMDs at home.

Healthcare practitioners could involve virtual care platforms to lend or lease VR headsets to patients for use at home, as purchasing a headset is ideally not the responsibility of a patient and is at the long run not a sustainable business model. Ideally, costs would be covered by general health insurance, making VR equally available for anyone. First steps have been made recently when insurance companies decided to reimburse rehabilitation for COVID-19 patients, which can include VR treatment. Virtual care platforms could consequently facilitate the need for education to teach patients to use VR headsets. Education sessions could be provided remotely to patients personalised to their level of experience with computer technologies. If needed, these sessions could be supported face-to-face by a skilled family member. On-demand support should be constantly available for answering questions and solving technological artefacts. When virtual care platforms fulfil criteria of privacy and security, physiotherapists can safely monitor progress of patients and adjust and communicate treatment plans accordingly.",
