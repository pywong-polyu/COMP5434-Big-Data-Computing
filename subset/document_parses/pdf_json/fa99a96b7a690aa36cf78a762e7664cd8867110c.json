Thus, improving diagnosis and treatment of viral infections is highly relevant in medical research. To conduct efficient research, valid disease models closely mimicking the pathology in humans are indispensable. So far, three approaches have been used to study viral infections: Via samples from humans (1), from animal models (2), and from human cell lines that were infected with virus particles in vitro (3) 2-5 . The opportunity of obtaining samples from humans is often limited, as tissue samples can only be collected from patients as biopsies or from the deceased. Therefore, a model system using human tissue, which is more easily accessible, is highly desirable and would solve that problem. With the development of (induced) pluripotent stem cells that virtually can proliferate indefinitely and potentially can differentiate into any kind of tissue, a high number of organ-specific cells can be obtained. However, to date, in vitro experiments were done by using infectious virus particles that require an appropriately equipped laboratory (often biosafety level 2 or higher) and that are potentially harmful for the experimenters and limit the possibility of standard laboratories allowed to conduct drug screening. To counter this limitation and enable research for normally equipped biosafety level 1 laboratories, we developed a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line that can express viral genes, but does not create infectious virus particles. As a model system for RNA viruses, we used the well-studied Coxsackie-virus B3 (CVB3) of the RNA-enteroviruses as infecting reagent. CVB3 was shown to cause myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, insulitis, diarrhea and insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes 6 . We stably transfected hiPSCs with a construct of the CVB3 virus genome that carries two mutations in the part of open",

The CVB3-genome, including the two mutations henceforth called CVB3\u0394VP0, prevents competent viral capsid formation, rendering the system non-infectious and thus makes its downgrade from biosafety level 2 to 1 possible 7 . This approach represents a huge advantage for experimenters and allows most labs highly controlled work on RNA-viruses. In addition, the construct has a doxycycline-dependent Tet-on promoter and a fluorescent Venus reporter, which enable the duration and degree of viral infection to be controlled and monitored by adjusting the time of application and the concentration of doxycycline administration (Fig. 1b) . For local and selective viral induction in some selected cells to mimic natural infection patterns, we aimed using caged-doxycycline. Cambridge et al. have principally demonstrated that localized gene expression using caged-doxycycline was possible, however in a very simple cell system 8 . Locally controlled de-caging leads to confined regions in which the virus is expressed. This procedure can be used to mimic typical infection patterns, which are usually observed in e.g. enteroviral myocarditis of humans and mice 9 .",

            "text": "The generation of a CVB3DVP0-expressing hiPS-cell line. For the generation of a fully controllable, CVB3-expressing iPS-cell line, a triple-vector system was stably transfected into wildtype human iPS-cells named SFS.1. An overview of the functional triple-vector system for the generation of an inducible, CVB3\u0394VP0 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ expressing iPSC-line is shown in Fig. 1 . Further details of the cell-line generation are given in the online methods. The main vector in this transfection system, KAO717-pPB-hCMV1-IRES-Venus, is a well-established stem-cell Tet-On transfection vector [10] [11] [12] . The DNA of CVB3\u0394VP0 was cloned into KAO717-pPB-hCMV1-IRES-Venus by extracting CVB3\u2206VP0 from a synthetic CVB3\u2206VP0-PUC53 using the restriction enzyme EcoR1 and then reinserting it into KAO717-pPB-hCMV1-IRES-Venus within its EcoR1 cutting site. Expression is controlled by a CMV min promoter and the co-expression of the Venus marker is ensured by a linked IRES2-sequence. The newly generated construct was named KAO717-pPB-hCMV1-CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus (Fig. 1a) . The vector KA0637-pPgCAG-rtTAM2-IN encodes the necessary rTA-trans-activator to enable doxycycline-inducible CVB3\u0394VP0 expression. Furthermore, KA0637-pPgCAG-rtTAM2-IN encodes a G418 resistance allowing for positive selection after lipofection. In order to generate an effective cell-line it is important that KA0637-pPgCAG-rtTAM2-IN and KAO717-pPB-hCMV1-CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus are inserted together into the genome of an iPS-cell. The co-transfected vector PB200PA-1 encodes the PiggyBac transposase that is essential for the stable random insertion of KA0637-pPgCAG-rtTAM2-IN and KAO717-pPB-hCMV1-CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus into the iPScell genome. This vector requires only transient expression in the early phase after lipofection. In this study, lipofection was optimized for huge vector constructs allowing for transfer of even larger RNA-virus genomes like CVB3\u0394VP0 (Fig. 1c, d) . Positively transfected clones expressing CVB3\u0394VP0 were picked and purified to generate a homogenously CVB3\u0394VP0 expressing cell-line (Fig. 1e, f) . The clones #8 and #9 were picked for further investigation. Karyotyping of SFS.1-CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus#9 verified the male genotype of the generated cell line and the integrity of the cell\u00b4s chromosomes (Fig. 1g) . Karyotyping was performed using standard GTG banding procedures. A central factor for an effective viral model system is a tight control over viral gene expression. The amount of produced virus proteins is directly related to the virus load and allows to model different scenarios. In order to test our system for that applicability, different doxycycline concentrations were applied to SFS.1-CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus#9 cells for three days. An immune staining that made the viral capsid protein CVB3-VP1 visible showed that the fluorescence intensity increased as a linear function of the doxycycline concentrations between 0.25 and 2.0 \u00b5g/ml. This is a clear indication of a controllable dose-dependent CVB3\u0394VP0 expression.",

We chose to differentiate hiPSC into cardiomyocytes, since cardiac cells are a main target for RNA viruses like CVB3 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses in human patients leading to severe outcomes as cardiac death.

Differentiated cardiomyocytes are capable of expressing the transfected CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus construct after 5 days doxycycline treatment as live cell fluorescence imaging of Venus in differentiated cardiomyocytes clearly demonstrates (Fig. 2a) . Immunostaining visualizing typical cardiac markers cardiac troponin I (TNI), cardiac troponin T (TNT) and \u03b1-actinin, prove the cardiac phenotype of the differentiated cells (Fig. 2b) . Furthermore, analysis of large sarcomeric proteins with loose gel electrophoresis showed the presence of fetal titin N2BA and the sarcomeric signaling protein obscurin, demonstrating the exceptional good quality of the iPS-cell derived cardiac myocytes (Fig. 2c) . In order to test for possible effects of the expression of CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus on the human iPS-cell derived cardiomyocytes, the expression of the viral genes was induced with 2 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline for 5 days and for 21 days. As a readout for putative effects, the beating frequencies of the induced cells were compared to non-induced control cells. We found significant changes in the beating rates: Non-induced, four weeks maturated, cardiomyocytes showed a regular beating at a rate of approximately 35 \u00b1 1.56 (mean \u00b1 SEM) beats per minute at 25 \u00b0C. iPS-cell derived SFS.1-CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus#9 cardiomyocytes of the same age, which were treated with doxycycline for 5 days and 21 days showed significantly less contractions per minute. Cells induced for 5 days contracted 26 \u00b1 1.12 (mean \u00b1 SEM) times per minute, while cells induced for 21 days contracted 14 \u00b1 2.04 (mean \u00b1 SEM) times per minute on average (Fig. 2d) . Furthermore, beating of cells induced for 21 days becomes irregular and uncontrolled (Supplementary video 2). These observations thereby cannot be explained with induced apoptosis by doxycycline as the performed life/dead staining of SFS.1CVB3DVP0-IRES-Venus#9 and SFS.1wt indicates (supplementary Fig. 1c ). The expression of CVB3\u0394VP0 thus exerts adverse effects on cell physiology, as expected for a well-defined disease model. Together with the previously described dose-dependent induction, the produced CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus cell-line is functional and inherits great potential to study pathophysiological effects of CVB3 in a highly controlled, scalable human cell model system. Moreover, the expression of CVB3 can be controlled and fine-tuned, resulting in a population of cells, which are exposed to very similar pathophysiological conditions. This will enhance homogeneity/reduce variability and thus will yield clearer results. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ To further confirm the functionality of CVB3\u0394VP0 induction in the generated cell system, a physiological characterization of differentiated cardiomyocytes concerning mitochondrial ROS production and alterations in electrochemical signal generation was performed. Previous studies of CVB3 infections already demonstrated significant impact of CVB3 on ROS production and changes in signal transduction in cardiac cells 14, 15 . The expression of CVB3\u0394VP0 was induced in differentiated cardiomyocytes for 21 days. The cells were stained with MitoTrackerCMXRos and analyzed for enhanced ROS production, as indicated by elevated fluorescence intensities in fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence intensities in the cytosol and in mitochondria of 21 days induced cells and non-induced control cells were compared and statistically analyzed. (Fig. 3d,f) , whereas induced cells do not show any reaction to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation (Fig. 3e,f) . Equivalent QT-intervals stay continuously elongated in presence of isoprenaline indicating a desensitization of induced CVB3\u0394VP0 cardiomyocytes against \u03b2-adrenergic agonists. The controlled expression of CVB3\u0394VP0 does not only change the mitochondrial structure and electrochemical activity of cells, but also disrupts membrane integrity and leads to alterations in the cardiomyocyte phenotype. To image the three-dimensional structure of iPS-cell derived cardiomyocytes, 3-D holographic imaging (Nanolive) was performed visualizing cell structures.",

For this purpose, a new derivative of doxycycline, caged-doxycycline (c-Dox), was synthesized and applied to the cell system. Caged-doxycycline is inactive until UV-light breaks it down into active cyano-doxycycline and a non-toxic residue 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrosoacetophenone (Fig. 5a) . UV-irradiation and c-dox concentrations below 200 \u03bcg/ml thereby have no significant effect on cell survival (supplementary Fig. 1b) . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ SFS.1-CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus#9 cells were plated on 12 mm glass coverslips, inserted into newly designed and 3D printed wells with defined cavities on the bottom (Fig. 5b) . C-Dox was applied to the cells for a short incubation time, then washed away.

This approach creates the possibility to induce a very localized and controlled expression of the virus in cells from the SFS.1-CVB3VP0-IRES-Venus cell line in order to simulate the effects of CVB3 on local cell clusters (supplementary Fig. 3 ). With this tool in hand, it is now possible to observe changes in excitation spreading and contraction propagation if a signal passes CVB3 expressing cell clusters embedded in a non-induced control cell layer. As CVB3 is known to modulate cardiac ion-channels in membrane localization and function, the effects of CVB3-infected cell clusters in a non-infected monolayer are a valuable object for quantitative and qualitative analysis 16, 17 . Moreover, completely new experimental setups can be designed and the pathophysiology of RNA-virus infections can be studied in more detail than ever before, especially when it comes to high-speed life cell imaging or in the use of voltage-dependent dyes.",

The complete genetic information of a noninfectious, but replicative RNA-virus strain (CVB3\u0394VP0), linked to a Tet-On system for doxycycline dependent transcription, was stably transfected into the human iPS-cell line SFS.1. This setup provides the basis for noninfective and tightly controllable experiments with the RNA-virus CVB3. It is now possible to design experiments to determine the effects of different viral loads in various induction states under numerous aspects. As this RNA virus model system is human iPS-cell based, it is moreover possible to expand observations of RNA-virus effects to multiple other cell types in addition to cardiomyocytes. In the case of CVB3, the virus infects patient cells of the pancreas, the central nervous system and the respiratory tract. SFS.1-CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus represents a basis to study viral infections in the desired cell types via transductions 6, 18, 19 .",

This observation correlates with findings of previous studies in infected mouse tissues in which elevated ROS levels are observed as well 14, 15, 20 . CVB3\u0394VP0 expression also changed the electrical activity of the iPS-cell derived cardiomyocytes on the multi-electrode array. CVB3 induced cells showed an elongated QT-interval compared to the non-induced control cells. After supplementation of isoprenaline, non-induced cells reacted with a QT-shortening while induced cells showed no significant changes in the QT-interval. It might be, that the expression of CVB3\u0394VP0 leads to a desensitization of cardiac cells towards \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, either via proteolytic degradation of cAMP binding-sites of acceptor proteins or via continuously elevated cAMP-levels, which were found in infected mouse cardiomyocytes 15 . Continuously elevated cAMP-levels in mouse cardiomyocytes could explain the observed desensitization against \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, which is a cAMP-activating process.",

While non-induced cells showed a healthy phenotype with intact cell membrane and intracellular membrane structures, virus-induced cells appeared dysregulated in their membrane integrity. Intracellular membrane structures were degraded as well and many cells showed an increase of vacuolic structures. These observations are consistent with the results of previous studies, which postulated that the viroporin 2B of CVB3 is capable of disrupting membrane structures [21] [22] [23] . This disruption is accompanied by a degradation of mitochondria and the golgi apparatus and an increase in intracellular vesicles and vacuoles, as two independent imaging methods confirmed. Overall, the expression of CVB3\u0394VP0 seems functional and well controllable in the presented system and gives the user the ability to study the effects of CVB3 in a controlled and time-dependent environment without the risk of infection. Moreover, the use of UV-activated doxycycline additionally offers for the first time the possibility of localized virus expression with a confinement of several hundred \u00b5m. This will lead to even more complex and detailed experimental designs in the future in which the influence of modeled viral plaques and infected compartments of the heart and other tissues can be assessed. The here presented system provides a novel approach to apply gene editing, in a highly controlled, versatile expression system of a pathogen in human iPS generated cell lines.",

Patterns of CVB3 infections can mimic published or self-generated shapes and have to be inverted by a graphical software. This negative can be used to adapt the bottom of 3D-printed wells. Alternative patterns like stripes of variable breath may be used as well. SFS.1-CVB3\u0394VP0-IRES-Venus#9 were plated on glass cover slips and transferred in these 3D-printed wells. Cells were incubated with caged-doxycycline first and then UV-radiated from the bottom at specific locations.
