            "text": "Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, large volumes of biomedical information concerning this new disease have been published on social media. Some of this information can pose a real danger to people's health, particularly when false information is shared, for instance recommendations on how to treat diseases without professional medical advice. Therefore, automatic fact-checking resources and systems developed specifically for the medical domain are crucial. While existing fact-checking resources cover COVID-19-related information in news or quantify the amount of misinformation in tweets, there is no dataset providing fact-checked COVID-19-related Twitter posts with detailed annotations for biomedical entities, relations and relevant evidence. We contribute CoVERT, a fact-checked corpus of tweets with a focus on the domain of biomedicine and COVID-19-related (mis)information. The corpus consists of 300 tweets, each annotated with medical named entities and relations. We employ a novel crowdsourcing methodology to annotate all tweets with fact-checking labels and supporting evidence, which crowdworkers search for online. This methodology results in moderate inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, we use the retrieved evidence extracts as part of a fact-checking pipeline, finding that the real-world evidence is more useful than the knowledge indirectly available in pretrained language models.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has elicited a global response in the scientific community, leading to a burst of new information regarding the pathophysiology of the virus, new treatments for infected patients as well as vaccines in production (Chahrour et al., 2020) . At the same time, large volumes of information about COVID-19 have also been published on social media platforms (Yang et al., 2020; Kouzy et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020; Shahi et al., 2021) , which are known to reach large networks of individuals in short amounts of time (Kouzy et al., 2020) . This reach is paramount to curbing the spread of a virus like SARS-CoV-2. Although much of the information circulating online is potentially useful, some of it, in particular misinformation and disinformation, can also pose a great danger (Soltaninejad, 2020) . Incorrect health advice can not only put individuals at risk, false and misleading information may also be detrimental to efforts in controlling the pandemic. Therefore, the stream of information on social media sites requires critical thought and fact-checking. Manual fact-checking, however, is time-consuming and expensive. One way to perform the task automatically is to use machine learning to classify a claim to be true or false. An intermediate step to exploit potential evidence is to automatically decide for claimevidence pairs if the evidence supports or refutes the claim (or whether that information is insufficient to rule a verdict) (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014) . The growing need for fact-checking of COVID-19-related information has been met with releases of corpora of factchecked COVID-19 claims (Shahi and Nandini, 2020; Shahi et al., 2021) , and databases containing known facts concerning COVID-19 and related information There are two types of conspiracy associated with 5G-COVID-19. One version suggests that radiation from 5G lowers your immune system, which makes you more susceptible to the virus (Shultz, 2020). The idea that . . . Table 1 : Example instance from the CoVERT corpus, with NER and crowdsourced fact-checking annotations, including textual evidence and the source URL. (Reese et al., 2021; Domingo-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2020) . However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no resource that specifically addresses the truthfulness of biomedical information relating to COVID-19 circulating on Twitter. We fill this gap by creating a corpus of factchecked biomedical tweets, the Covid VERified Tweet (CoVERT) corpus 1 , to facilitate the fact-checking task in this domain. The dataset consists of 300 tweets containing real-world claims about COVID-19. We annotate the tweets with two types of information: First, we annotate each tweet with the medical entities Medical condition, Treatment, Symptom/Side-effect, Other and annotate how they relate to each other (cause of, causative agent of, not cause of ). Secondly, crowd-workers verify the medical claim within the tweet. To the best of our knowledge, employing crowdworkers to perform biomedical fact-checking on Twitter posts has not been done before, though crowdworkers have completed subtasks for veryfing COVID-19-related Reddit posts. Three annotators research a given claim and provide substantiating evidence from the web along with their verdict (SUPPORTS, REFUTES and NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION (NEI)). Table 1 shows an example instance from our dataset.",

These can be categorized as stylometric approaches (Schuster et al., 2020) . Based on the finding that language models capture relational information contained within the data they are trained on, Lee et al. (2020) include language models in the fact-checking pipeline itself. Tapping into the implicit knowledge aggregated over very large pretraining datasets, they use BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to create an evidence text by unmasking an entity in the original claim. This is passed to an entailment model that predicts whether the language model's evidence supports or refutes the claim. Both the stylometric and the language model-based approaches are limiting. The first group fails to recognize well-presented false information that do not share the surface level characteristics of false news. When using a language model to extract evidence, the models also likely propagate biases learned from the training data (Guo et al., 2022) . Additionally, such models are biased towards particular prompts which are used to query and extract the implicit knowledge from the model (Sung et al., 2021) .",

Other approaches extract the summaries of articles rather than their headlines as evidence for claims (Hanselowski et al., 2019; Alhindi et al., 2018) , filtering out sentences that are irrelevant in order to create more fine-grained substantiating evidence. Similarly, Wadden et al. (2021) make use of the evidence contained within the abstracts of research papers in order to fact-check scientific claims. Retrieving evidence allows systems to make informed decisions based on external sources which helps overcome the limitations claim-focused models face. In addition, evidence can also provide the end-user with an explanation for the fact-checking verdict (Kotonya and Toni, 2020).",

            "text": "Recently, the task of fact-checking has received much attention , resulting in an influx of published datasets. The Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) dataset is one of the largest available corpora, consisting of 185,445 claims generated from Wikipedia. Claims are manually annotated (labels: SUPPORTED, REFUTED, NOT ENOUGH INFO) and accompanied by an evidence sentence from the same original Wikipedia article. In the political domain, previously fact-checked claims from PolitiFact and Channel4 have been collected (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014; Wang, 2017) . The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the increasing need for fact-checking in the medical domain. The FakeCovid dataset (Shahi and Nandini, 2020) consists of 5,182 fact-checked news articles mentioning COVID-19, collected from various fact-checking websites. This dataset however lacks substantiating evi-dence for claims. Kouzy et al. (2020) collect 673 COVID-19 related tweets of which 24.8 % contained misinformation. COVID-Fact (Saakyan et al., 2021) and HealthVer (Sarrouti et al., 2021) both address the limitation of existing corpora consisting of synthetic or manually summarized claims. Both datasets provide user-generated Covid-19 related claims. COVID-Fact focuses on Reddit while HealthVer claims stem from excerpts that a search engine produces when queried with questions about Covid-19. While most resources rely on existing fact-checks or expert annotators to label claims, few have explored crowdsourcing to alleviate the data bottleneck. Saakyan et al. (2021) present crowdworkers with a claim and 5 automatically collected sentences, from which supporting evidence should be selected, thereby adjudicating a fact-checking verdict. Further reducing the work of a crowdworker, Hanselowski et al. (2019) task crowdworkers with refining previously fact-checked claims from Snopes by marking a specific snippet as evidence within a given source text.",

We adapt this system such that it can access external fact-checking evidence (i.e., evidence annotators extracted for CoVERT) and compare the verdict prediction performance. Before investigating this as our primary research objective, we perform two preliminary experiments. As the claims within the CoVERT data are Twitter-based instead of Wikipedia-based (FEVER dataset ), we first explore to which extend BERT and BioBERT contain domain-specific knowledge discussed in the CoVERT dataset. For this, we probe each model with the BioLAMA probe (Sung et al., 2021) . In addition, we want to understand how capable BERT is to \"generate\" evidence sentences as suggested by Lee et al. (2020) in our setting to be used in the fact-checking pipeline. We therefore analyze the predictions BERT makes when unmasking entities in the tweets from our dataset. We outline the methodology and results for both preliminary experiments and the fact-checking pipeline in the following section.",

(2020) suggest, we investigate to which extent information from the CoVERT dataset is contained within these two language models. We employ the BioLAMA probe suggested by Sung et al. (2021) which allows us to see whether a language model is able to correctly predict masked object entities in a constrained setting. BioLAMA originally probes BERT and BioBERT for their inherent relational knowledge using factual triples sourced from CTD, UMLS and Wikidata. Comparing probing results for CoVERT data to those attained using the original dataset of biomedical factual triples in Sung et al. (2021) gives insights into the domain of biomedical tweets and allows us to conclude which language model best captures the domain-specific knowledge within CoVERT. BioLAMA generates fill-in-the-blank cloze statements or 'prompts' like \"Hepatitis has symptoms such as [Y] .\", where [Y] is the masked object, unmasked as 'abdominal pain' by BioBERT. In our experiment, we use the manual approach for generating prompts as described in Sung et al. (2021) . We follow their evaluation methodology and use top-k accuracy as the evaluation metric. This is equal to 1 for an instance if any of the top-k object entities match an object in the gold annotated object list. If there are no matches, the score for this instance is 0. This binary setting allows to calculate accuracy as the number of correct predictions devided by all predictions.",

To do this, we re-implement the fact-checking pipeline by Lee et al. (2020) . Figure 3 shows a diagram of the pipeline. The input to the pipeline consists of a text, hypothesis pair, which is passed to the textual entailment (TE) model from AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2018) . We take the last layer of the pretrained entailment model (before the softmax) to obtain \"entailment features\", which are passed on to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for the final verification prediction. The MLP component is originally trained on the FEVER 2018 training set , and is referred to as MLP-FEVER in our experiments. For the hypothesis component of the input pair, we experiment with two types of inputs. First, we use the approach by Lee et al. (2020) and generate the hypothesis using the language model BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) , which unmasks an entity in the original text. Alternatively, we input the respective evidence snippet from the CoVERT dataset, effectively giving the pipeline access to external, real-world evidence. Refer to Table 4 for an example of such a text, hypothesis pair. To further test the effect of evidence extracts on the pipeline, we additionally fine-tune the MLP component with text and evidence pairs, which we call MLP-Evidence in our experiments, using a 80/10/10 traindevelop-test split of the CoVERT data. 10",

(2020) ) and our adaptation of this pipeline (MLP-Evidence) in which the MLP component is fine-tuned with evidence and text pairs from CoVERT, giving it access to external evidence. Each pipeline is evaluated on the FEVER 2018 test dataset consisting of 9999 instances, and on pairs of tweets and language model generated evidence (Tweet + LM) and tweets and CoVERT evidence (Tweet + Evidence). Provided with hypotheses generated using BERT, MLP-FEVER achieves the highest F 1 score of 0.60. The same pipeline achieves an 0.49 F 1 on the FEVER dataset. When using the evidence extracts as hypotheses, the performance drops to 0.46 F 1 . Fine-tuning the MLP component with evidence extracts (MLP-Evidence) the performance is slightly lower on FEVER data and the Tweet + LM pairs (difference of .03 F 1 , respectively), however, achieves substantially higher F 1 score of 0.69 on the CoVERT corpus.

P R F1 P R F1 P R F1 CoVERT evidence extracts, we conduct a qualitative error analysis into predictions made by the factchecking pipeline before and after fine-tuning. We observe that MLP-FEVER with BERT-generated evidence mistakenly labels 4 out of 6 instances as RE-FUTES that are actually SUPPORTS instances. Inspecting these cases, we find that the language model generated evidence text is likely to produce features indicating entailment, as can be seen in Ex. b, Table  10 in the Appendix. Similarly, in 3 out of 15 SUP-PORTS instances are mistakenly labelled REFUTES by MLP-FEVER, with example c in Table 10 showing that the evidence created by BERT is sufficiently dissimilar to result in contradiction entailment features in our pipeline, finally resulting in RERFUTES predictions. These instances show that BERT is creating evidence texts that are likely unuseful to the pipeline. The pipeline struggles to make use of evidence extracts when the MLP component is only trained on the FEVER dataset. We inspect 10 instances where MLP-FEVER incorrectly predicts NEI instead of SUPPORTS and find that the evidence extracts are much longer (and sometimes a long paragraph), thus including more information than hypotheses originally seen in FEVER. Examples of this can be seen in Table 11 , Ex. d and f. In both instances, the MLP-Evidence pipeline (finetuned with evidence from CoVERT) correctly predicts SUPPORTS, showing that the MLP component is able to interpret the input pairs correctly after fine-tuning. Although the overall F 1 score of the pipeline increases when fine-tuned with evidence extracts from CoVERT, the total number of SUPPORTS class predictions has increased from 33 to 55, with 15 false positives, and very seldomly predicting the NEI class. This may be an inherent limitation of the evidence extracts, as they by definition do not contain any evidence texts for the NEI class, meaning this class is never modelled during finetuning. Additionally, the distribution across classes in the fine-tuning set is unbalanced (422 evidence extracts for SUPPORTS vs. 128 for REFUTES).",

We outline how we leverage a crowd for fact-checking, finding moderate agreement among annotators and reliable annotations when aggregating verdict labels. Our extension of the verdict prediction pipeline (Lee et al., 2020) using evidence extracts from CoVERT indicates that the task can benefit from real-world evidence rather than only using 'evidence' generated from the implicit knowledge contained in language models. Apart from facilitating evidence-based fact-checking directly, the CoVERT corpus additionally allows querying structured databases for evidence retrieval and verdict prediction, as it offers annotated entities and relations, which can be linked to ontologies. Future work may consider if the pipeline benefits from more fine-grained evidence extracts. Evidence extracted at sentence level (Hanselowski et al., 2019) may contain information directly relevant to the claim, thereby facilitating richer entailment features.",
