For the last four decades, time-series data were used to employ short-run and long-run nexus between the selected variables by analyzing the autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL). The Granger causality test was analyzed to estimate the causality directions. The unit root test results indicate that all the selected variables are stationary at the level and first difference. The bound test confirmed that all variables are cointegrated at a 1% significance level. Long-run estimates suggest that an increase in energy consumption will increase the export of agricultural products. An increase in urbanization, transportation, and carbon emission resulted in a decrease in agricultural products export in Pakistan. In the short run, an increase in industrialization, transportation, and energy consumption leads to an increase in agricultural products export. Increasing urbanization and carbon emission decrease the agricultural products export of Pakistan. Based on our findings, we recommend sustainable agricultural production, renewable energy consumption, low carbon emission technologies, and a green portfolio for sustainable agricultural products export.",

According to the initial assessment damage to over 115 thousand hectares of crops including wheat, oilseed crops, cotton, gram, fruits, and vegetables, besides grazing field losses. Even some crop losses were also reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (GOP 2020), but still, agriculture is the largest sector and contributor to the national economy in terms of the livelihood of the mainstream population contingent directly or indirectly and labor participation with a 42.3% rate. This sector fetches the biggest workforce and helps to provide raw material to the utmost of the manufacturing sector. However, this sector can upsurge its share in the GDP due to its potential by the utilization of the latest agricultural technologies. This sector is capable to produce for domestic population use and surplus production for exports and will result to ensure food security and foreign exchange earnings. This improvement can help achieve poverty alleviation and may enrich the socioeconomic structure of a major portion of the population. The major challenges to the sector include pest attacks, urbanization, climate change, and water scarcity retained production far less than the potential (GOP 2020) . Growth in the agricultural sector is depending upon favorable weather conditions. There is a strong relationship between agriculture and climate, precipitation, temperature, and other aspects of weather that eventually influence economic performance, such as agricultural production, commodity prices, and, finally, economic growth ).",

Wheat is above all the other cereal crops due to its production, consumption, and demand in the local market while rice is one of the major agricultural products export and contributes approximately 25% of Basmati rice export in the world (Rehman et al. 2015) . Pakistani farmers are used to over applications of chemical fertilizer and pesticides which not only contributes to carbon footprints into climate but also decreases the crop production and contribution of agriculture to value-added (Koondhar et al. 2021b) . Agriculture and the non-agricultural industry both are the important pillars of the Pakistan economy. The non-agricultural industries also rely upon the agricultural industry because of the raw material to produce value-added products, but by the urbanization pressure, increasing non-agricultural industrialization causes carbon emission and creates challenges for the agricultural industry. First of all, increasing non-agricultural industrialization is converting arable land to non-arable land. Secondly, industrialization intakes the labor force in large quantities and results in a shortage of labor for agriculture. Third, non-agriculture industry demand for agricultural raw material affects cropping patterns in Pakistan (Quraishi et al. 1994) .",

This unrelenting influx of rural population into cities in Pakistan had to make urban sprawl (the rapid growth of the geographic range of cities and towns to accommodate their growing population). Due to no law regarding this issue in Pakistan, the agricultural lands are getting purchased for residential and commercial purposes (Peerzado et al. 2019) . As the industry is developing, transportation services are getting better, and energy consumption is increasing and ultimately resulting in environmental degradation and an increase in carbon emission. Besides, it is affecting agricultural production due to climatic changes such as a change in temperature, precipitation, and droughts. The increasing environmental pollution causes a reduction in soil fertility, increasing unseasonal weather conditions such as sudden rainfall, temperature fall, or rise that directly affects the quality and quantity of the agricultural products. It is obvious that if the quality is not good, it will not be acceptable in the international market or although the quality is enough good for international trade while the quantity is not enough it also brings challenges for agricultural products export.",

Secondly, we employed autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technology; the model is more effective and can provide reliable evidence even from a small sample (Pesaran et al. 2001) . Third, we expect that the study verdicts will not just heighten the literature but will also improve our understanding of the study variables linkages and ultimately help to direct the policymaking in terms of industrial transformation, urban planning, urban sprawl control, efficient energy usage, optimization of transportation structure, and mitigating carbon emission.",

The reason is the agricultural land conversion to residential and commercial purposes reduce overall agricultural production and ultimately affect agricultural GDP.

The empirical evidence suggests that carbon emission affects economic growth, agriculture, and industrial development in the long-run, while industrialization and urbanization have a bidirectional granger causality relationship. A study on Pakistan for the period of 1980-2016 using ARDL bound testing along with VECM shows that oil consumption by the agriculture and power sector has a significant and positive effect on economic growth, similarly natural gas consumption by households, fertilizers, and industry sector also has a significant relationship with economic growth. While, energy consumption from oil in the households and industry sectors has a negative relationship with economic growth, and natural gas consumption in the commercial sector has a negative linkage with economic growth (Rehman et al. 2020c ).

Another study also delivers a positive relationship between carbon emission and agricultural production in Pakistan using a generalized method of moments estimator (Qureshi et al. 2016) . (Khan et al. 2019) investigated the linkage between carbon emission, energy consumption, GDP, urbanization, and agricultural export trade of Pakistan over the period 1975-2017. Rehman et al.

The empirical evidence using the cointegration technique suggests that carbon emission could be the basic factor of a decrease in the Pakistan agricultural export trade. A study on China over the period of 1982-2014 using the ARDL bounds testing approach revealed that carbon emission has a significant effect on agricultural output in both long-run and short-run analyses, while among other determinants, the land area under cereal crops, fertilizer consumption, and energy consumption has a positive and significant association with agricultural output in both long-run and short-run analysis (Chandio et al. 2020 ).

From Fig. 2 , it is clear that agricultural products export were continuously increasing but since 2007 it returns to a diminishing trend, while urbanization and carbon emission are gradually increasing with decreasing in transportation and industrialization.

The autoregressive distributed lag bounding test method was introduced by Pesaran et al. (2001) to check the existence of cointegration, while also used to check the short and long-run equilibrium among the selected time-series data. The ARDL has an edge over a simple cointegration approach due to the flexible stationary properties of the variables and can analyze both at the level, first difference, and even mutually cointegrated (Pesaran and Shin 1998) . The ARDL method can deliver consistent and efficient evidence by a small sample (Haug 2002) . At the same time, it can estimate the coefficients of one variable on another in the short-and long run; it can also estimate the effect of the endogenous explanatory variable (Pesaran and Shin 1998; Pesaran et al. 2001) .",

According to the Pesaran critical value table, if the F-state value is below the lower bound, then the alternative hypothesis will be rejected and the null hypothesis will be accepted. The null hypothesis will be rejected when the F-state value surpasses the upper bound critical value, and if the F-state value is between the upper bound and lower bound, then there is bias in results. The results are expressed in Table 4 and indicate that the value of F-statistics is more than the upper bound critical value, and it is significant at 1% level, which provides evidence that there is cointegration between the agricultural production export, industrialization, urbanization, transportation, energy consumption, and carbon emission in Pakistan. In emerging market and developing economies, increasing in energy consumption and globalization financial development causes to increase in carbon emission (\u00d6zt\u00fcrk and Le 2020) .

These outcomes provide evidence of the existence of long-and short-run correlation among the study time-series variables. In the case of long-run association energy consumption related to agricultural products export is positive at a 1% significance level (coefficient 19.889), which reveals that a 1% increase in energy consumption may increase agricultural products export by 19.9%. Energy consumption has a positive effect because of the efficient crop cultivation and getting higher production needs to adopt modern agricultural technologies, and those technologies consume more energy (Ahmed and Zeshan 2014) . In Turkey, agricultural production decreased due to climate factors such as rainfall, CO2 emission, and high temperature (\u00d6zt\u00fcrk et al. 2020b) .

These results postulate that a 1% increase in urbanization, transportation, and carbon emission significantly decreases agricultural products export by 11.8%, 6.3%, and 13% respectively. This empirical evidence for carbon emission is the same as Khan et al. (2020b) . The results show that an increase in carbon emission brings climate change and results in the decline of Pakistan's agricultural products export, these results are contrary to the studies of Khan et al. (2019) , Ali et al. (2019) , and Khan and Tahir (2018) . While the evidence of transportation is different from Tabasam and Ismail (2019) , who found that improvement in the transportation infrastructure in Pakistan significantly and positively affects agricultural trade in Pakistan. However, our Automatic lag length selection based on SIC ***Acquired null hypothesis rejected at 1% level, **reject the null hypothesis at 5% significant level, results in author calculation by using Eviews 9 Authors analyzed by using Eviews 9 study does not claim to have a significant effect of industrialization on agricultural products export. In addition, the short-run estimations are also expressed in the middle portion of Table 5 . Industrialization, transportation, and energy consumption exert a positive and significant impact on agricultural products export at a 1% significance level. In the short-run, a 1% increase in industrialization, transportation, and energy consumption increases agricultural products export by 2.8%, 3.2%, and 6.3% respectively. Ahmed and Zeshan (2014) and Tabasam and Ismail (2019) concluded that energy consumption has a positive and significant short-run correlation with transportation. The carbon emission coefficient is negative and is significant at the 1% level, which means that a 1% increase in carbon emissions will decrease agricultural products export by 9% in the short run. This empirical evidence is previously proofed by Rehman et al. (2020a) , while urbanization is found to be negatively associated at a 5% level of significance. It shows that an increase of 1% in the urban population will decrease agricultural products export by 302.9% in the short-run. It is obvious because of the increase in urbanization resulting in decreasing agricultural arable land, an increase in population as well and subsequently increasing food security issues due to the rise in food demand and causing a negative effect on agricultural products exports (Hashmi 2011; Wu et al. 2018) . The interesting thing we can see is that in Table 5 , almost all the variables are significant at 1% level both in long-run and short-run nexus because at the first stage, we selected a total of nine variables; then, we remove three variable due to having non-significant results, and in this study, we just focused on highly significant variables. These six variables were selected based on variables importance projection. In addition, the error correction term (ECT-1) shows the speed of adjustment from short-to longrun and is significant at a 1% level with a negative coefficient sign that rejects the null hypothesis and accepted alternative hypothesis. The last part of Table 5 indicates the outcomes of some important statistical tests. According to the statistics, the model passes other major tests including normality, heteroskedasticity, R 2 , and Durbin-Watson (DW).",

The ADF and PP unitroot tests confirmed that all the variables are stationary at the level and first difference. In addition, the results of the ARDL bounding test shows that there are cointegration linkages among the study variables at a 1% significance level. The long-run estimates connote that a 1% increase in energy consumption causes increases in agricultural products export by 19.9%, while a 1% increase in urbanization, transportation, and carbon emission decreasing agricultural products export by 11.8%, 6.3%, and 13% respectively. In the short run, a 1% increase in industrialization, transportation, and energy consumption leads to an increase in agricultural products export by 2.8%, 3.2%, and 6.3% respectively. An increase in carbon emission by 1% decreases agricultural products export by 9%, and short-run agricultural products export decrease due to an increase in urban population. Furthermore, the Granger causality test estimation proofed the evidence of unidirectional causality running from between industrialization, transportation, energy consumption, towards the agricultural products export.

For increasing the export at the international level, the government of Pakistan should organize exhibitions and introduce the agricultural products of Pakistan for finding new international markets. Increasing agricultural products export not only will contribute to the economic development of Pakistan but also will provide the opportunity to many other nonagricultural countries to import Pakistani agricultural products in order to combat the food demand.
