Nineteen neonates were admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 31 to February 29, 2020. Their mothers were clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed with COVID-19. We prospectively collected and analyzed data of mothers and infants. There are 19 neonates included in the research. Among them, 10 mothers were confirmed COVID-19 by positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in throat swab, and 9 mothers were clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. Delivery occurred in an isolation room and neonates were immediately separated from the mothers and isolated for at least 14 days. No fetal distress was found. Gestational age of the neonates was 38.6 AE 1.5 weeks, and average birth weight was 3293 AE 425 g. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in throat swab, urine, and feces of all neonates were negative. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in breast milk and amniotic fluid was negative too. None of the neonates developed clinical, radiologic, hematologic, or biochemical evidence of COVID-19. No vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and no perinatal complications in the third trimester were found in our study. The delivery should occur in isolation and neonates should be separated from the infected mothers and care givers.",

It is unclear whether mother-to-infant vertical transmission is possible, and thus there is no sufficient evidence for the prevention and control of neonatal infections.

Briefly, a clinically diagnosed COVID-19 case was defined as a case of pneumonia that fulfilled all the following four criteriafever and/or respiratory symptom; radiographic evidence of typical viral pneumonia (bilateral ground-glass opacities); low or normal white-cell count or low lymphocyte count; and no improvement in symptoms after antimicrobial treatment for 3 days, ruling out common virus infection like influenza with or without an epidemiologic link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market or contact with other patients with similar symptoms. A laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as a case with respiratory specimens that tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 or a genetic sequence that matches SARS-CoV-2.",

Newborns do not have antibodies against other coronaviruses, so theoretically they maybe more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our research, none of the samples from different body part of the neonates, maternal amniotic fluid, and breast milk were detected for SARS-CoV-2 positive. None of the 19 neonates developed clinical, radiologic, hematologic, or biochemical evidence of COVID-19. This results are partially consistent with Chen et al.'s study, which showed 9 SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women do not seem to develop a more severe COVID-19 compared to nonpregnant patients, and the consequence of their neonates were relatively well [4] .",

The results showed that all the test samples were negative, so the results of this study did not support the intrauterine vertical transmission.

All the specialists decided the prenatal treatment and the best time for delivery and delivery mode. In this current research, the smallest gestational age was 35 weeks and no mothers received prenatal steroid and 6 mothers received antiviral drugs (200 mg/day oral umifenovir (Arbidol\u00ae, Pharmastandard, Moscow, Russia)) for 5 days prior to delivery.

Therefore, in this study, after the initial resuscitation, the newborn was immediately isolated from the mother and family members, transferred to the neonatal isolation ward (class III A) for further observation. Contact with the non-infected parent and family members was minimized and level II protective clothing for all medical staffs was required.
