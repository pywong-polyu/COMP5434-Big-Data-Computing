The method posits a class of standard epidemic models and explores uncertainty in empirical data to set up a family of possible outbreak trajectories that span the probability distribution of models parameters and initial conditions. A genetic algorithm is used to estimate likely trajectories consistent with the data and reconstruct the probability distribution of model parameters. In this way the ensemble of trajectories allows for temporal extrapolation to produce estimates of future cases and deaths, with quantified levels of uncertainty. We apply this methodology to an outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Angola during 2005 in order to estimate disease epidemiological parameters and assess the effects of interventions. Data for cases and deaths was compiled from World Health Organization as the epidemic unfolded. We describe the outbreak through a standard epidemic model used in the past for Ebola, a closely related viral pathogen. The application of our method allows us to make quantitative prognostics as the outbreak unfolds for the expected time to the end of the epidemic and final numbers of cases and fatalities, which were eventually confirmed.

This example posed many of the challenges that lead to the development of the present methodology. The pathogen is rare and its epidemiological parameters were largely unknown beyond the observation of the apparent incubation time and time from incidence of symptoms to death in a handful of cases. The mortality was also extremely high and took the lives of many of the medical care providers that intervened early in this remote African region. Because the disease affected disproportionally children under five the implementation of isolation control measures was also extremely difficult, and their results uncertain at the time according to reports by the World Health Organization and journalists on the ground. Nevertheless even with very scant information, model predictions were accurate from one case report to the next and detected successfully the over-counting of cases and deaths that characterized late stage reports. The current work uses data from WHO reports, freely available online or via email, together with basic epidemiological modeling to generate a characterization and outlook for the outbreak. As sparse as the data are, we hoped that our results would help quantify the progression of the disease and assess the efficacy of intervention efforts necessary to stop the epidemic.

There are two caveats in performing parameter estimates under these circumstances. First, the start of the epidemic in October 2004 introduces a constraint, 4-5 months (158-121 days taking the beginning and end of the month as bounds) before the first number of cases was announced. Estimating epidemic parameters under such distant constraint is delicate and tends to lead to high sensitivity in the parameter search. As such it is intrinsically more difficult to guarantee a fair sampling of all possible solutions consistent with the data, at some error level.
