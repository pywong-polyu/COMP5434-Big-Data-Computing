Therefore, it is crucial to synthesize and summarize the evidence from published studies on the safety and efficacy of experimental treatments of COVID-19. We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, GHL, OpenGrey, ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases through April 2020. We obtained 2699 studies from the initial literature search. Of them, we included 28 eligible studies that met our eligibility criteria. The sample size of the included studies is 2079 individuals. We extracted and pooled the available data and conducted a quality assessment for the eligible studies. From the 28 studies, only 13 studies provide strong evidence. Our results showed that Favipiravir and Hydroxycholoroquine shorten viral clearance and clinical recovery time and promote pneumonia absorption. On the other hand, Lopinavir-ritonavir either alone or combined with arbidol or interferons has no significant difference superior to the standard care. Corticosteroids, Convalescent plasma transfusion, and anticoagulant therapies provide a better prognosis. Remedsivir, Tocilizumab, Immunoglobulin, Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation showed effective treatment results, but further confirmatory studies are needed. In conclusion, Favipiravir and Remedsivir might be promising drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.",

The treatment group received HCQ sulphate (400 mg, once per day for five days) plus standard treatment while the control group received only the standard care which is bed rest, oxygen inhalation, antiviral drugs as alpha-interferon nebulization, oral lopinavir/ritonavir and antibiotics (if recommended). The drug was ceased for one patient that became a severe case. 86.7% of the treatment group and 93.3% had negative viral pharyngeal swabs on the seventh day. For radiological imaging, 33.3% of the treatment group and 46.7% in the control group improved on day three of enrolment. Following re-examination, the lesions were improved in all patients. The study concluded that a larger sample size study is needed to investigate the effects of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 and it is difficult to determine the effect of the treatment plan on the main endpoint of the virus conversion rate and the critical rate [17] .",

Of the 42 patients who met the inclusion criteria, six missed follow-up and 36 were enrolled in the study. Out of the 36, 16 were group controlled, and 20 were a group of HCQ-treated patients. Of 36 patients, 15 were male (41.7%), averaging 45.1 years of age. The proportion of asymptomatic patients was 16.7%, 61.1% of patients with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, and 22.2% of patients with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection. All patients with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection had confirmed pneumonia on a computerized tomography (CT) scan. Patients treated with HCQ were older than those with control (51.2 years vs. 37.3 years). At post-inclusion day 6, 70% of patients treated with HCQ were recovered compared to 12.5% in the control group (p\u00bc.001). At day 6 post-inclusion, 100% of patients treated with a combination of HCQ and azithromycin were recovered compared to 57.1% of patients treated with HCQ alone and 12.5% in the control group (p<.001). By comparison, at day eight of postinclusion, one patient under a combination of HCQ and azithromycin, who tested negative on day six post inclusion, was tested positive at low titre. Thus, the treatment of hydroxy chloroquine in COVID-19 patients is significantly correlated with viral load reduction/disappearance, and its effect is enhanced by azithromycin [5] .",

A larger open-label randomized clinical trial conducted on 150 patients with COVID-19, mean age \u00b1 SD (46.1 \u00b1 14.7 years). The patients were assigned in two groups, an experimental group which received HCQ as long as standard care (provision of intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen, normal laboratory testing, and COVID-19 test, hemodynamic monitoring and intensive care and the potential to supply concomitant medications) and a control group received standard care only. Hydroxychloroquine is efficient to ease the symptoms when confounding factors of anti-viral agents were removed in the post hoc analysis. Furthermore, CRP in the control group in much greater than the treatment group (6.986 in standard care and HCQ group vs. 2.723 in the control group, mg/L). Besides, there is a rapid recovery of lymphopenia. Adverse events were found in 8.8% of control individuals and 30% of HCQ recipients with two serious adverse events. The most common adverse event in the treatment group was diarrhoea (10%). Furthermore, the administration of HCQ did not result in a higher negative conversion rate but more alleviation of clinical symptoms than standard care only alone in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 without receiving antiviral treatment, possibly through anti-inflammatory effects [14] .",

Inclusion criteria were severe pneumonia with rapid progression, high viral load despite the use of antiviral and mechanical ventilation. They received mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment, and all participants received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. All patients received transfused with convalescent plasma. In four out of five patients following plasma transfusion, temperature normalized. Viral loads also decreased and were negative within 12 days of transfusion, and following transfusion, COVID-19-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titres increased (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day seven). ARDS was resolved 12 days after transfusion in four patients, and three patients were removed from mechanical ventilation within two weeks of treatment. Of the five patients, three have been discharged from the hospital, and two are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion. Thus, the convalescent plasma administration improved the clinical outcome of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS [30] . Also, in another case series study of four cases of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Three of them developed severe ARDS despite being treated by arbidol, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon-alpha inhalation and other supportive therapies. One case experienced septic shock, and she was given a whole of 900 mL Ocompatible convalescent plasma was transfused to the patient in three batches; the first batch was given at 8 AM on the 17th of February (200 mL), the 2nd one was at 8 AM on the 27th of February (400 mL) and the closing one was at 8 AM on the 28th of February (300 mL). The virus load of the patient on the 18th of February was 55 \u00c2 10 5 copies/mL, which appreciably reduced to 3.9 \u00c2 10 4 copies/mL on the 28th of February, and besides reduced to 180 copies/mL on 5th of March. The patient was extubated on 3rd March, CT scan shows persistent absorption of consolidation. RT-PCR of oropharyngeal swab done on 9th and 10th of March were negative for COVID-19. The patient was discharged on the 13th of March. Another case developed ARDS and was given non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Follow up CT scan shows interstitial pneumonia extended to both lungs. When 200 mL convalescent plasma from a COVID-19 recovered patient was transfused to this patient, no adverse effect was observed, and patient RT-PCR came negative and was discharged. The third case was found to have multi-organ failure and develop septic shock. Eight transfusions of B-compatible convalescent plasma (2400 mL) have been given to the patient. The patient viral load decreased and two RT-PCR of sputum in deep lung came negative. The patient was transferred to an unfenced ICU for the management of underlying diseases and a couple of organ failure. The fourth case was once a 31-year-old pregnant woman. CT scan of the chest confirmed opacities in the lower lobe of the left lung. The affected person developed severe ARDS, multiple organ dysfunction syndromes, and septic shock after admission. The affected person was in a ventilated and caesarean section done; however, due to endouterine asphyxia newborn died. Cardiac ultrasound counselled left ventricular enlargement with decreased systolic function. The affected person obtained invasive ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy: treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) and ribavirin (500 mg every 12 h). Three hundred millilitres transfusion of convalescent plasma was once given to the patient. The outcomes of two continual RT-PCR assessments of BAL fluid got here were negative. The patient recovered from COVID-19 and was discharged. Convalescent plasma would possibly be a therapy for critically ill patients infected with COVID-19 and no unfavourable effect was observed [29] .",

Totally, 15 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. The patients received tocilizumab (TCZ) ranging from 80 mg to 600 mg per day for one to seven days. Two of the patients were moderately ill, six were severely ill and seven were critically ill. Tocilizumab was used in combination with methylprednisolone in eight patients. Five patients received the TCZ administration twice or more. Tocilizumab decreased the CRP in all patients rapidly, but for the four critically ill patients who received only a single dose of TCZ, three of them dead and the CRP level in the remaining patient did not decrease to the normal range with a clinical outcome of disease aggravation. Serum IL-6 decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients and did not decrease in patients not affected by the treatment. A persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed in these four. In COVID19 patients at risk of cytokine storms 21, TCZ appears to be an appropriate treatment choice [31] .",

Two patients had a smoking history. No patients reported chronic respiratory diseases, cancer or other chronic diseases. Twenty-nine patients' CT shows pneumonia finding in 20 patients' bilateral involvement while in two patients no CT finding was present. The outcomes were viral clearance time, hospital stay and symptom duration. Eleven out of 31 were given corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 40 mg once or twice a day) within 24 h of admission. Corticosteroid-receiving patients had a higher median CRP level (p\u00bc.026) and a lower median lymphocyte count (p\u00bc.012) compared to non-corticosteroid patients [20] . Twenty-six (84%) of the 31 patients had recovered from COVID-19 and were discharged and five were still in the hospital. The median time to clear up the virus was 14 days (IQR, 12-16 days; range, 7-26 days). The median duration of symptoms was seven days (IQR, 5-10 days); the median length of hospital stay was 18.5 days (IQR, 16-21 days).

Seven confirmed COVID-19 patients were registered for MSCs transplants, including one critically severe type, four severe types, and two common types, and three severe types were enrolled for placebo control. MSCs were suspended in 100 mL of normal saline before the intravenous drip, and the total number of cells transplanted was calculated by 1 \u00c2 10 6 cells per kilogram of weight. The window period for cell transplantation was described as the time when symptoms or/and signs deteriorated even as the expectant therapies were being performed. The injection was conducted with a speed of $40 drops per minute, for around 40 min. The patients were examined by the investigators after receiving the investigational drug via the 14-day observation. The clinical results and improvements in rates of inflammatory and immune function and adverse effects of seven enrolled patients were monitored for 14 days. In two days after MSCs transplantation, these seven patients' pulmonary function and symptoms were significantly improved. Two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged within 10 days following treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the CXCR3-CD4-T cells, CXCR3 \u00fe CD8 \u00fe T cells and CXCR3 \u00fe NK cells disappeared within three to six days of treatment. Besides, a team of CD cell populations with regulatory CD14 \u00fe CD11c \u00fe CD11bmid increased dramatically. While levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha reduced significantly, IL-10 has risen in the MSCs treatment group as opposed to the placebo control group. The gene expression profile also showed that MSCs were ACE2-and TMPRSS2-which suggested that MSCs are free of COVID-19 infection. Intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in COVID-19 pneumonia patients, particularly in critically severe patients [11] .",

In vitro studies showed that these drugs can both inhibit COVID-19 transmission through alkalization of the intracellular phagolysosome, which hinders virion fusion and uncoating and, consequently, viral spread [38, 39] . Early clinical studies in China propose that chloroquine use might be associated with delayed symptoms [40] . Hydroxychloroquine has several advantages, being not expensive, readily available, and a well-known safety profile. The evidence behind the beneficial effect of them is still weak. Four studies reported improvement of clinical symptoms [5, 14, 16, 27] , but one only of them reported that HCQ was significantly associated with viral load reduction/ disappearance [5] . Gautret et al. elucidated that HCQ treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin but the study has several limitations: a small sample (20 participants who received HCQ, and 16 controls), a short observation period (six days), and no randomization, which raises concerns about selection bias [5] . The other French study reported that the combination of HCQ and azithromycin was associated with reduced viral load, but no other clinically relevant outcomes were reported. The study was non-controlled, with poorly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria [27] . The other randomized Chinese study, which included larger cohorts, found that HCQ did not result in a higher seroconversion rate but more alleviation of clinical symptoms, possibly through anti-inflammatory effects. But this study was open labelled [14] . The clinical observations of the effects of HCQ for patients with COVID-19 have not involved critically ill patients who are receiving several other medications and may have organ failure, which affects drug metabolism and potentially increase the risk of adverse events [27, 58] .",

The variations between worldwide countries in terms of the infection and death rates are still unexplained. The questions about (1) whether the virus has genetic preferences, (2) whether the virus transmission and course are affected by temperature and (3) whether the disease course is influenced by prior vaccination history, are to be examined in future research. Recent studies found that ivermectin, baricitinib, baicalin, scutellarin, hesperetin, glycyrrhizin, nicotianamine and saikosaponins are potential compounds that might be promising in the prevention of viral entry or the inhibition of viral replication of COVID-19. Future research should translate the in vivo and in vitro results to the first-inhuman trials of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, there is a need for reliable, specific serological tests to detect COVID-19-specific antibodies and, therefore, determine the exact burden of the disease and determine the immune individuals who can return to work and restore the normal life.",
