However, no integrative analysis of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacometabolomics (PM) of sotorasib has been reported to date. In the present study, a sensitive and robust high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was firstly developed and fully validated for the quantitation of sotorasib in rat plasma. After onestep protein precipitation, sotorasib and an internal standard (carbamazepine) were separated on a Waters XBrige C 18 column (50 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm, 3.5 mm) and analyzed in electrospray ionization positive ion (ESI + ) mode. The optimized method was fully validated according to guidance and was successfully applied for the PK study of sotorasib at a dose of 10 mg/kg. In addition, a longitudinal and transversal PM was employed and correlated with PK using partial least squares model and Pearson's analysis. With multivariate statistical analysis, the selected six (AUC model) and nine (C max model) metabolites completely distinguished the high-and low-exposure groups after sotorasib treatment, which indicates that these potential biomarkers can predict drug exposure or toxicity. The results of this study will not only shed light on how sotorasib disturbs the metabolic profiles and the relationship between PK and PM but also offer meaningful references for precision therapy in patients with the KRAS (G12C) mutation.",

            "text": "Cancer, which has increased incidence and mortality rates, has become one of the chronic diseases that seriously endanger human health. According to the latest literature and statistics, there are 19.3 million new cancer cases worldwide and 10 million deaths in 2020 (1) . Mutation in Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) viral oncogene homolog, which can potentiate the tumor-promoting activity, is one of the most common carcinogenic events in endodermal cancer (2) . In fact, KRAS mutations have been identified predominantly in lung (approximately 25% of cases), pancreatic (about 95% of case), and colorectal (approximately 35% of cases) cancers (3) . In KRAS mutated tumors, 80% of the carcinogenic mutations occur in codon 12, and the most popular mutation sites are KRAS (G12D), KRAS (G12V), and KRAS (G12C) (4) . The following characteristics of KRAS have led to many challenges in its druggability development: 1) KRAS binds to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) with picomolar affinity, which seriously hinders the development of nucleotide competitive inhibitors, and 2) the KRAS protein lacks ideal small-molecule binding pockets, which makes it difficult to design high-affinity allosteric inhibitors (5) . However, when KRAS (G12C) is in an inactive GDP-bound state, the structure-based optimization inhibitor is covalently bound to the mutant cysteine residue and holds a pocket in the switch II region (SIIP). Due to its excellent antitumor efficacy in preclinical analyses, sotorasib, a novel targeted inhibitor of KRAS (G12C), precisely blocks the KRAS (G12C) inactive GDP-bound state. Additionally, sotorasib has shown exciting tumor-suppressing effects not only for single targeted agents but also for combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (6) . At present, based on previous clinical trials (7) (8) (9) , sotorasib has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic KRAS (G12C) solid tumors (10) .",

            "text": "It is well known that comprehensive understanding of the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and pharmacometabolomics (PM) is an indispensable element for further improving the risk-benefit ratio of patients. Despite the high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) methods published by Madhyastha et al. (11) and Retmana et al. (12) for the quantification of sotorasib in mouse plasma and tissue homogenates, a wider linear range (1.08-5,040 and 2-2,000 ng/ ml, respectively), a higher lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ; 1.08 and 2 ng/ml, respectively), and the laborious sample extraction (liquid-liquid extraction coupled with evaporation and three-step protein precipitation, respectively) will decrease the quantitative throughput and efficiency to some extent, especially for large preclinical and clinical sample sizes. Undoubtedly, the detection sensitivity of the reported method still has much room for improvement. However, as far as we know, no HPLC-MS/MS analysis or PK has been delivered for the rapid and robust quantitation of sotorasib in rat plasma. Therefore, taking into account the urgency of cancer therapy and the emerging need for preclinical and clinical blood concentrations/exposures or robust analytical methods, a reliable and reproducible HPLC-MS/MS assay was developed, validated, and successfully applied for the quantitation of sotorasib in rat plasma. The results may provide a significant mirror for future KRAS-targeted therapy, PK investigation, and therapeutic drug monitoring in preclinical or clinical studies/trials.",

The final expression of measurement uncertainty at a concentration of 20 ng/ml was 20.42 \u00b1 8.06 ng/ml (mean value \u00b1 expanded uncertainty) for sotorasib with a coverage factor value of k = 2 (95% confidence limits).

Moreover, three common metabolites, namely, N,Ndimethylglycine, adenine, and OH-phenylpyruvate, were found in both predictive models.

The variables listed in Table 5 were considered potential biomarkers for predicting the AUC or C max . To validate the predictive ability of the above screened potential biomarkers, the rats were divided into a high-value and a lowvalue group according to their AUC and C max . Discrimination based on the screened biomarkers was performed using OPLS-DA models.

Emerging evidence indicates that cancer is a metabolic disease, and metabolic reprogramming is one of the important hallmarks of cancer (26, 27) . On May 28, 2021, sotorasib was granted accelerated approval by the US FDA for the treatment of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the KRAS (G12C) mutation (8) . Recently, integration analysis of PK and PM can not only provide a useful approach for the systemic investigation of therapeutic drugs but also reveal the internal pharmacological mechanism from the perspective of metabolite disturbance and drug exposure (28) . During the process of analytical method development, different chromatographic columns were examined and compared. Sotorasib showed a wide peak on the reversedphase Symmetry C 18 column (50 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm, 5 mm) using ACN as the organic phase. The broadening peak could be modified on the Waters XBrige C 18 column (50 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm, 3.5 mm), and chromatography separation was accomplished with high efficiency. The shape of the peaks showed the best separation with better symmetry. MeOH and ACN were both evaluated, and the peak shape and response were greatly improved when using ACN. By carefully optimizing the composition and pH, the organic phase was ACN (A) and the aqueous phase was water (B). All mobile phases contained 0.1% formic acid. The column temperature was investigated at ambient temperature, 40\u00b0C, and at 55\u00b0C. Given the whole responses and the separation efficiency, 40\u00b0C and ambient temperature were set for the column temperature and the autosampler. Despite analogs or stable ILIS being better for the determination of analytes due to the analogous LC conditions, carbamazepine as the IS was suitable for the analyte, which satisfied this PK study.",

To date, no metabolic profile study has been published regarding the PM of sotorasib in vivo or in vitro. In this study, both longitudinal and transversal trajectories were assessed using multivariable statistics. In the longitudinal results, the characteristics of the 8-h metabolites were obviously different from those in other sampling time points, which indicates that the metabolic profile compared to the PK showed a delayed and an opposite trend. Additionally, the metabolic phenotype after sotorasib treatment was significantly segregated, and the metabolic pathways were also disturbed. Pan et al. (34) have recently published serum metabolomics in lung cancer-bearing mice after treatment with anlotinib. Compared with the control group, 13 differential metabolites and five potential metabolic pathways (i.e., glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; tryptophan metabolism; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; phenylalanine metabolism; and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis) were observed.

            "text": "Tryptophan plays a critical role in protein synthesis and is a precursor of bioactive compounds. It is an essential amino acid and regulator of antitumor immune response and cancer progression (35) . Besides, the metabolism of tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway into free tryptophan has key functions in neurotransmission (36) and immune response regulation, and the accumulation of small-molecule inhibitors targeting tryptophan metabolism has been evaluated in the clinical phase (37) . The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as L-valine, L-leucine, and L-isoleucine play crucial roles in the glucose or nutrition metabolism pathways [e.g., the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase (PI3K/AKT) pathways] (38, 39) . In this exploratory study, three common potential biomarkers-N,N-dimethylglycine (a derivative of the amino acid glycine), adenine, and OH-phenylpyruvate-were selected to predict drug exposure. As previously reported, reprogrammed BCAA metabolism can directly promote cancer progression and development (40) . Besides, Ni et al. (41) reported that six metabolites (glycine, valine, methionine, citrulline, arginine, and C16 carnitine), using the PLS-DA model, were indicated to distinguish lung cancer from healthy controls and may be screening biomarkers for patients with lung cancer. Glycine or its derivative may be used for diagnosing lung cancer or real-time monitoring/predicting the efficacy of sotorasib. It has been reported that cholic acid or bile acid plays a pivotal role in the process of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of malignant tumors. A previous study demonstrated that bile acid metabolism, such as taurine, chenodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid, and deoxycholic acid, was regulated by mirabilite in colorectal cancer, and the results of this study-on the disturbance of metabolites before and after sotorasib administration-were basically consistent with those in published literature on the treatment of colorectal cancer (42) . Since the first description by Yoon et al. for the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus, PM has been increasingly applied to predict the drug response, safety/toxicity, and the PK profile (43) . After checking for outliers, a two-stage PLS analysis including an initial and a refined model was constructed between the metabolites and PK parameters (AUC and C max ). Finally, a total of six and nine metabolites were selected and further validated to further verify the predictive efficiency ( Figure 8) . Although this study used a limited number of samples, several metabolite biomarkers were firstly discovered and were utilized to predict drug exposure/toxicity. Amino acids, carnitines, adenine, and fatty acids are important metabolites in metabolomics and have recently attracted the attention of an increasing number of cancer research studies. Oncogenic KRAS can activate the ACLY enzyme to promote the conversion of citrate to acetyl-CoA and enhance de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (44) . Gene expression and metabolic flux analyses have shown that mutant KRAS upregulates the expression of the GLUT1 glucose transporter to promote glucose uptake, as well as inducing the expressions of the rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis (hexokinases 1 and 2) or other key glycolytic enzymes (e.g., PFK1, ENO1, and LDHA), which enhances the glycolytic flux and promotes the production of intermediates (e.g., glucose-6-P and fructose-6-P) (45) . Although substantial progress has been made in the interplay between KRAS mutation and metabolic reprogramming, a lot of work is still needed to fully discover the crosstalk of sotorasib from other aspects besides the PK and PM.",

Firstly, although the recovery and matrix effect criteria were not defined in the guidelines for quantitative biological sample determination, there is much opportunity for improvement in the biological sample pretreatment methods of plasma in this PK study. Secondly, the sample size of this exploratory research was small, and more data and external validation may be needed to pool and verify these results. Thirdly, due to the non-availability of blood samples from cancer patients, we only investigated the metabolomic profile in rats after a single administration of sotorasib. A more in-depth understanding of these concerns will pave the way for the development of well-tolerated and effective therapies for patients with KRAS-driven cancer. Taken together, our work is the first to reveal the comprehensive metabolite trajectories induced by sotorasib and the predictive drug exposure/toxicity biomarkers in rats, which will provide a notable scientific contribution to prevention or therapy in patients with the KRAS (G12C) mutation.",
