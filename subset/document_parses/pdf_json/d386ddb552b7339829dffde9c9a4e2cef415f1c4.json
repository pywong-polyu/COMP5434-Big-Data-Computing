Current efforts to monitor the drug supply are limited in population reach and comparability. This restricts capacity to identify and develop measures that safeguard the health of PWUD. This study describes the development of a low-barrier system for monitoring the contents of drugs in the unregulated street supply. Early results for pilot sites are presented and compared across regions. Methods: The drug content monitoring system integrates a low-barrier survey and broad spectrum urine toxicology screening to compare substances expected to be consumed and those actually in the drug supply. The system prototype was developed by harm reduction pilot projects in British Columbia (BC) and Montreal with participation of PWUD. Data were collected from harm reduction supply distribution site clients in BC, Edmonton and Montreal between May 2018-March 2019. Survey and urine toxicology data were linked via anonymous codes and analyzed descriptively by region for trends in self-reported and detected use. Results: The sample consisted of 878 participants from 40 sites across 3 regions. Reported use of substances, their detection, and concordance between the two varied across regions. Methamphetamine use was reported and detected most frequently in BC (reported: 62.8%; detected: 72.2%) and Edmonton (58.3%; 68.8%). In Montreal, high concordance was also observed between reported (74.5%) and detected (86.5%) cocaine/crack use. Among those with fentanyl detected, the percentage of participants who used fentanyl unintentionally ranged from 36.1% in BC, 78.6% in Edmonton and 90.9% in Montreal.",

The system used principles of flexibility, capacity-building and community participation in its design. Results are well-suited to meet the needs of PWUD and inform the local harm reduction services they rely on. Further standardization of the survey tool and knowledge mobilization is needed to expand the system to new jurisdictions.",

Accidental drug poisoning deaths continue to occur in alarming numbers, and have increased sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between January 2016 and June 2020, 16, 280 Canadians died due to accidental apparent opioid-related poisonings; record numbers were observed in at least 5 provinces and territories between April and June 2020 [1] . Deaths are largely due to contamination of the unregulated drug supply with psychoactive substances of unknown type or quantity, such as fentanyl and its analogues [1] and benzodiazepines [2] . Additional risks are posed by other modifications of drugs on the unregulated market, such as the addition of potentially harmful \"cutting agents\" to bulk substances [3, 4] . A better understanding of unregulated drug supply contents is needed to plan and improve responses such as observed consumption (injection or inhalation) sites, distribution of harm reduction supplies (e.g., needles, pipes), opioid agonist therapy, and harm reduction messaging.",

Nationally coordinated cross-sectional surveys such as I-Track, M-Track and Y-Track (formerly Enhanced Surveillance of Canadian Street Youth or E-SYS) have improved reach to marginalized populations [10, 11] , but survey cycles are infrequent. Regional cohort or cross-sectional studies of underserved populations [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] have improved upon the limitations described above, but methodological differences between studies (e.g., variation in reporting period of substance use) preclude comparing trends across regions.

This projectknown as the Fentanyl Urine Screen Study (FUSS)provided timely access to information on unintentional fentanyl use and associated behaviours (e.g., concurrent methamphetamine use) [31] . The FUSS survey tool and methodology were based on an annual survey implemented at harm reduction sites (health or social services aiming to prevent a wide range of drug-related harms) across BC from 2012 to 2015. This annual survey was identified as a feasible, low-barrier means to obtain locally-relevant drug use data from clients while also illustrating important regional differences [32] . The development, implementation and adaptation of the original survey tool has been described in detail previously [32] . In 2017, the Direction r\u00e9gionale de sant\u00e9 publique (Regional Public Health Department) of the Centre int\u00e9gr\u00e9 universitaire de sant\u00e9 et de services sociaux (CIUSSS) du Centre-Sudde-l'\u00cele-de-Montr\u00e9al (DRSP-CCSMTL) conducted a similar study that built on the FUSS methodology. Broad spectrum urine toxicology tests were employed to examine local prevalence of fentanyl and compare expected and actual substances used by participants. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using broad spectrum urine toxicology tests to examine contents of urine samples submitted by participants. Additionally, both studies identified a discrepancy between self-reported and detected use of drugs; presence of fentanyl among participants who did not report its use ranged from 73% in BC in 2015 [31] to 18% in Montreal in 2017 [33] .",

For example, stimulant use was prevalent in all regions, raising the need to better understand associated demands (e.g., for pipes and other harm reduction supplies [37] ) and supports for those who use stimulants only or in combination with opioids. On a similar note, polysubstance use was another important trend. Most participants reported using two (BC, Montreal) or three (Edmonton) substances. Reported polysubstance use was consistent with previous research in similar populations [38] [39] [40] . There is a need to better understand why PWUD use multiple substances in specific patterns given accumulating evidence on risk of harms related to poor physical and mental health [41] and overdose [1, 42, 43] . Harms may be compounded by adulterants such as levamisole, a non-psychoactive substance found in cocaine [31] . Among the entire sample in Montreal, fentanyl was detected but not reported used among 8.9% of respondents in 2018 versus 18.0% in 2017 [33] .

The latter is preferred by some PWUD who face barriers to obtaining a prescription but wish to use opioids of predictable type and quantity [46] . To further complicate matters, apparent diverted POs in the street supply may also be illegally manufactured. Counterfeit POs often contain unexpected substances of varying potency, including novel synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and The survey used in Montreal listed methamphetamine and speed separately as the content of the latter was not clear to participants or researchers. Accordingly, a measure of detected use of speed is not applicable in the context of this research c Detected use of heroin or morphine includes 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM; a direct metabolite of heroin), morphine, and morphine metabolites.

Drug detection timeframes and the reporting period (past three-day use) align for most but not all substances [34] . For instance, prevalence of use may be underestimated for drugs such as fentanyl and heroin which clear rapidly from urine. It can also be difficult to determine the origin of certain detected substances (e.g., morphine and metabolized heroin-related compounds are indistinguishable). The screening method only indicates whether a substance is present but not how much. Additionally, one can examine associations between expected and unexpected substances (e.g., cocaine/crack and levamisole) but cannot conclude precisely where contamination occurred if multiple substances are reported used. For these reasons, urine toxicology screening is complementary to drug checking services that can provide detailed qualitative and quantitative information about drug contents [29] . Various monitoring methodologies may be combined to further clarify contents of the street drug supply year to year; the BC Drug Overdose and Alert Partnership is one example of this synthesis of monitoring data [23] .",
