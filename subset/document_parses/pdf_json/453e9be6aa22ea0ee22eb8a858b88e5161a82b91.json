            "text": "Background: International travel is among the leading impactful factors of COVID-19 transmission; thus, adequate knowledge, good attitude and good preventive practices toward COVID-19 for international travelers are particularly essential for successful pandemic control. Methods: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted to determine knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of international travelers (both Thai and non-Thai) and expatriates in Thailand. The data were collected at the Thai Travel Clinic, Bangkok, Thailand and via online platforms during May to October 2020. The independent T-test, Chi-square test and multiple regression analysis (MRA) were applied to determine factors influencing the KAP. Results: Of 399 travelers, 46.6% were male, 72.1% had a Bachelor's degree or higher, and the mean age was 35.6 \u00b1 9.6 years. Due to unexpected travel restrictions and lock down, 77.9% of participants were Thai and the respective major purpose of travel was business/work. Travel cancellation/postponement was reported at 73.9%. While sufficient knowledge (\u2265 60% correct answers) was reported in 77.9% of participants, a low percentage of correct answers was found in the questions regarding disease transmission. The travelers reported a neutral attitude and an overall moderate concern regarding the COVID-19 situation. Adequate preventive practices were determined by the average practice score 3.54 \u00b1 0.38 (0 = never and 4 = always). The MRA revealed that the factors influencing good practices were travelers who: i) enrolled from outside the hospital (online platform); ii) received pretravel advice at hospital; iii) were female; iv) participated before the declaration of the end of the outbreak; v) were aged 40-49 years, and vi) visited friends and relatives. Conclusions: The majority of travelers in this study had sufficient knowledge, a neutral attitude and adequate preventive practices toward COVID-19. The factors influencing good practices included pretravel advice, sex, age and the point in the timeline of the outbreak. In order to better control the COVID-19 pandemic situation, pretravel counselling and advice should be promoted as a means to improve knowledge, particularly in disease transmission, increase awareness and emphasize appropriate preventive measures toward COVID-19 among international travelers. Furthermore, preventive practices should be bolstered at all times regardless of the outbreak situation.",

Since then, the disease has spread globally and wreaked havoc on all communities in its path, leading to a global pandemic within three months.

However, international travel is among the most significant contributing factors toward COVID-19 spreading during the pandemics infancy. Consequently, travel-related control protocols, including border closures, travel restrictions, vigorous exit and entry screening and traveler quarantine, have been implemented in tandem with policies to permit only essential travel in several countries as a measure to contain the pandemic. Despite the Thai Department of Disease Control having declared the response protocol against COVID-19 on January 4, 2020, the first confirmed COVID-19 case outside China was reported in Thailand a week later. She was a 61-yearold Chinese woman traveling from Wuhan as an international tourist [1] . A taxi driver who made contact with the sick Chinese traveler, was later diagnosed and confirmed as the first local transmission COVID-19 case [2] . An accelerated increase in cases prompted the Thai government to declare a state of emergency, impose a national lockdown, suspend all international flights and establish a quarantine system for international travelers upon arrival at the end of March 2020 [3] .",

Thus, traveler behavior plays a significant role in disease control and mitigation. Inappropriate awareness regarding COVID-19 may have some ramifications in term of a detrimental pandemic situation while appropriate knowledge regarding COVID-19 may assist with pandemic prevention. Since travel restrictions and quarantine measures may not be practical long-term as COVID-19 solutions, enhancing traveler knowledge and improving attitude which lead to effective preventive practices against the disease should be incorporated. Although studies have been conducted on knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19 in various populations, including health care workers in China, university students in Japan, and border communities in Northern Thailand [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , data for the traveler population have yet to be explored. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the KAP toward COVID-19 among international travelers in Thailand and identify the factors influencing the level of knowledge and preventive behaviors throughout the pandemic. As expatriates are collectively travelers, the KAP of expatriates living in Thailand were also studied.",

(Table 5 ) The results revealed that mean practice score tended to be higher in participants who completed the questionnaire from outside the hospital (Beta = 0.195), participants who sought pretravel advice (compared with those who did not) (Beta = 0.168) and females (Beta = 0.154).

Participants aged 40-49 years had higher mean practice score compared to those who were younger or older (Beta = 0.143). Lastly, participants who visited friends and relatives were more likely to have higher mean practice score than other travel purposes (Beta = 0.107). The differences in the practices of participant groups were then evaluated by item using the Chi-square test, and the percentage of participants who regularly (always) practice preventive measures were compared with those who do not regularly (sometime/rarely/never) practice (Table 6 ). Overall, the results showed a higher trend of 'always practices' in the first period than the second period of data collection. Most participants always wore a mask when going to public places, and there were no differences between different groups except Thai and non-Thai travelers (98.1% vs 90.9%, p-value 0.001). The hand hygiene practice was significantly higher in females and in the first period of data collection.

However, our findings were different from a previous KAP study in the border population of Northern Thailand at the very beginning of the outbreak which found that 73% of participants had poor knowledge [9] . The difference in results could be explained by both the baseline characteristics of participants and the period of the study. The factors that were associated with a sufficient knowledge score were: i) a higher education level (Bachelor's or above) which was consistent other studies [6, 9, [11] [12] [13] [14] and ii) the nationality, possibly due to too few non-Thai travelers in our study. Comparable with the other KAP studies [4, 8, 10, 11] , social media was the major source of knowledge concerning COVID-19. Therefore, improving reliability and maintaining up-to-date COVID-19 information on social media would contribute to better traveler knowledge. Interestingly, participants had relatively lower percentages of correct answers in questions pertinent to transmission when compared to symptoms and signs/diagnosis and prevention. This result indicates an opportunity to improve education toward COVID-19 transmission. In terms of attitude, most participants had a neutral attitude toward COVID-19. The level of concern over the COVID-19 situation was also neutral (average score 6.09 \u00b1 2.32 out of 10) perhaps due to the point in the timeline of COVID-19 at which the observation took place. Indeed, the study was conducted when the COVID-19 situation in Thailand was under control with no local transmission identified, and all the control measures in Thailand had been eased. Interestingly, even though our study participants were international travelers, most of them agreed that traveling abroad should be discouraged during the outbreak. The reason for this finding might be that the COVID-19 situation during the time of data collection was not very active in most countries, and thus some participants tended to be more aware of imported cases.",

This finding might be explained by the variation risk perception at that point in time. We hypothesized that when the outbreak was declared to be over, people might reduce their preventive behaviors as a study in Indonesia found that risk perception had a positive influence on preventive behavior [15] . We further analyzed the factor influencing practices. Females tended to have better practices than males; this was consistent with an observation from non-travelers KAP studies [6, 10, [16] [17] [18] . As expected, the pretravel advice was found to be associated with a higher practice score toward COVID-19 among travelers; this emphasized the impact of pretravel counseling and advice. Surprisingly, while the education level was significantly associated with the knowledge score, the practice score were similar among those with a low versus high education level. This finding was dissimilar to a Chinese study, which found that the education level was correlated with a good practice [12] . There was also no correlation between the knowledge score versus the practice score, or between the attitude score versus the practice score in our study. Of note, a relatively low percentage of participants reported regular avoidance of public places/use of public transportation, cleaning of high touch surfaces every day, and checking body temperature with a thermometer if feeling unwell, all of which highlighted the need to emphasize on these preventive practices.",
