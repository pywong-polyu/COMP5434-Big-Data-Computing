During the Korean MERS-CoV outbreak in 2015, almost all case patients were infected at hospitals, and the 5 largest clusters of the hospital outbreaks accounted for 83% of all cases [3] [4] [5] . However, it remains to be determined whether these outbreaks were due to contact with infectious droplets or inhalation of infectious droplet nuclei.",

Considering the small size of the target region (nucleotides 22 300-22 682), one would expect a sequence similarity of 100%. Indeed, a recent study showed that the nucleotide substitution of MERS-CoV during the Korean outbreak was very rare (3.78 \u00d7 10 \u22126 per site per day), and no nucleotide substitution was observed in the target region [6] . In contrast, the 8 MERS-CoV isolates (NOs. 64, 65, 66, 68 , 69, 71, 72 and 75) from the same room (hospital B, patient 3) had diverse similarity in the target region. Therefore, both the genotypic and the phenotypic characteristics of the environmental isolates are not in line with those of the clinical isolates. Further studies are needed to fully characterize the environmental isolates.",
