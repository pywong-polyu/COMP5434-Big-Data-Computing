However, these methods profile user interests by averaging users' historical behaviors (e.g., course enrollment, course bookmarking, etc.) with fixed weights, and the simple fusing strategy fails to capture users' temporal learning interests underlying the sequential user behaviors. The temporal learning interests of online users can be expressed in two forms: interest drift and interest evolution. Instead of regarding user interests as constant over time, interest drift indicates users' dynamic and diversified interests in course learning [10] [11] [12] . For example, one may be interested in courses related to blockchain given its popularity, while one's interest may turn to epidemiology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interest evolution indicates users' evolving learning interests as they gain knowledge, skills, and experience over time [13, 14] . For example, one is likely to study \"C++ Advanced Programming\" after studying the course of \"C++ Basic Programming\" since the former is an advanced course of the latter. However, the aforementioned forms of temporal learning interests underlying users' course enrollment sequences have remained uninvestigated in course recommender designs. The course enrollment sequence is a list of sequential courses that a user previously enrolled in. We seek to fill the research gap identified above by profiling temporal learning interests in users' sequential course enrollment behaviors for online course recommendations.",

            "text": "Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are widely adopted to capture temporal user interests over time by encoding historical sequential behaviors into a hidden state vector [15, 16] . Although the state vector helps to encode sequential dependency among historical enrollment behaviors, it fails to mine the temporal learning interests from the latent knowledge connections between courses. Here, latent knowledge connections refer to high-order relationships between two courses. As shown in Fig. 1 , one of the latent knowledge connections between \"C++ Basic Programming\" and \"Introduction to Statistics\" is that both of them are courses offered by the same university. Similarly, there is a high-order connection between \"C++ Basic Programming\" and \"FinTech Foundations\", since both of them have concepts belonging to computer science field. These latent knowledge connections are helpful for extending a user's learning interests reasonably and increasing the diversity of recommended courses. Recently, knowledge graph, a knowledge base that uses a graph-structured topology to integrate varied side information, has been widely used to incorporate domain knowledge into the recommenders [17, 18] . In our context, a knowledge graph can provide explicit and implicit knowledge connections between courses, thereby a recommender incorporating a knowledge graph can better capture and reasonably extend temporal learning interests underlying semantic relatedness among courses.",

The proposed method recommends the courses to a target user according to one's sequential course enrollment behaviors. The method has three innovative designs. First, it introduces stacked Transformers to extract users' temporal learning interests underlying their sequential enrollment behaviors. The multihead self-attention mechanism in the Transformer module can automatically capture the dependency among courses within a sequence. Second, it augments the Transformers by encoding the time interval between the enrollment time of the first course and the enrollment time of each subsequent course in the course learning sequence. Such time-aware design captures learning interests that are dependent on time. For example, on online learning platforms, users often enroll in many diversified courses in a short period of time but only enroll in the advanced courses after finishing the basic courses. Third, it incorporates external knowledge into the sequential recommender to utilize the latent knowledge connections between courses to enhance recommendation performance. Specifically, it constructs a knowledge graph to incorporate rich meta information of courses and leverages knowledge graph embeddings to represent courses by considering their rich semantics and high-order connectivity.",

To better recommend courses to the user, we propose a deep learning method with several innovative designs to capture temporal learning interests underlying users' course enrollment sequences. Our research goes further and illuminates topics for future theoretical research based on the interesting findings of ablation study, such as measuring the impacts of different types of domain knowledge on users' online learning performances and combing the sequence and timing of user activities to understand their temporal learning interests.

Among various knowledge graph embedding techniques, translation-based models, including TransE [41] , TransH [42] , TransR [43] , and TransD [44] , are popular ones given their high scalability to large real-world datasets. The basic idea of the translationbased models is that knowledge graph embedding can be learned by considering the relation r from the head entity h to the tail entity t as distance or dissimilarity. TransE as the first translation-based model has gained wide popularity due to its high efficiency. However, it fails to deal with the one-to-many/many-to-one/manyto-many relations in real-world knowledge graphs. TransH, TransR, and TransD are successively proposed to overcome the flaws of TransE. Among which, TransH and TransR mainly focus on modelling various relations while neglecting the difference between entities and relations. To deal with this problem, TransD is proposed to consider the diversity of both relations and entities by mapping them into separate paces. Moreover, TransD achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art translation-based models. Therefore, we adopt TransD in our study as the knowledge graph embedding technique. We can learn the representation of course entities with TransD. We use vector to represent the candidate course and a sequence of vectors { 1 , 2 , \u2026 , j } to denote the knowledge graph embeddings of courses historically enrolled by the user u.",

TransD considers the diversity of both entities and relations in the knowledge graph and achieves superior performance compared with other translation-based models. Moreover, TransD has better efficiency on large-scale graphs because it has fewer parameters and no matrix-vector multiplication operations. To train the proposed model, we randomly selected 70% of users as the training set and 30% of users as the test set. As mentioned before, we proposed a deep network by stacking Transformer layers to learn more complex item transition patterns. However, the network becomes more difficult to train as it goes deeper. To enable deep training and avoid overfitting, we set the number of Transformer layers as two. Following the negative sampling strategy used in Wang et al. [18] , for each positive sample, we randomly chose three or four negative samples to enlarge the dataset. The embedding size was set as 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. The dimension of 64 achieved the best performance. After comparing Adam and SGD, we chose SGD as the optimizer because the optimization effect of SGD was more stable. To balance the learning speed and effect, the learning rate was set as 0.00001 for all models by comparing the performance of different values in {0.0001, 0.00001, 0.00001}. We set the dropout rate as 0.5 for all models. The weight coefficients and other parameters were adjusted automatically in the process of model optimization. Table 2 shows the recommendation performance of the proposed model (i.e., KT_ Transformers) and baseline methods in terms of nDCG@k and Recall@k. The performance gaps between baselines and our model are listed in brackets. Overall, KT_Transformers outperforms baseline methods significantly, which demonstrates the capability of KT_Transformers in generating precise recommendations. Sequential recommendation helps improve recommendation effectiveness. In general, sequential recommendations, including FPMC, GRU4Rec, LSTM4Rec, ATT4Rec, and KT_Transformers, perform better than conventional recommenders such as POP, BPR, and ItemCF. However, the UserCF outperforms FPMC by 20.4% on NDCG@10 and 20.0% on Recall@10.

To evaluate the role of the knowledge graph, we compared KT_Transformers with T_Transformers where knowledge graph embeddings were replaced with randomly initialized embeddings. That is, KT_Transformers and T_ Transformers share the same model structures but different values of knowledge graph embedding. Figure 4 shows that a knowledge graph helps improve recommendation effectiveness. With the course knowledge graph embeddings as input, nDCG@10 increases by 18% and nDCG@10 increases by 33%. Given the importance of the course knowledge graph, we go further and investigate prescriptive insights extracted from diversification of domain knowledge. There is a wealthy of domain knowledge available on the online learning platforms that may be relevant to the learning resources (i.e., courses in our case), such as teachers, research institutions that list courses, course field, course concepts, and prerequisite learning recourses. However, it remains unclear how different types of domain knowledge drive user decisions on choosing shows that the model lacking the \"field\" entity performs worst and induces a 25% loss on NDCG@10 and 21% loss on recall@10 compared to the model with the intact knowledge graph. Compared to the \"field\" entity, models lacking other types of entities experience slight performance degradation, especially the \"teacher\" entity. That is, in the context of online learning, users' preferences on specific fields matter more than their preferences on other types of domain knowledge. Moreover, users' preferences on specific teachers are the least important factors in their choice decisions. In the context of offline learning, previous studies have highlighted the important roles of teacher characteristics on student outcomes [50, 51] . In view of this, our findings illuminate topics for future theoretical online learning research, such as measuring the impacts of teacher characteristics on users' online learning performances.",

The result indicates that temporal patterns including the order and the timing of user enrollment behaviors help to course recommendation. A possible explanation is that the order and the timing of user enrollment behaviors capture two important kinds of learning interests: interest drift and interest evolution [12] [13] [14] . On the one hand, users often enroll in many courses in a short period of time, which usually implies users' interest drift. The time interval between the enrollment time of the first course and the enrollment time of each course in the course learning sequence helps to capture the pattern. On the other hand, users will enroll in the advanced courses after finishing the basic courses, which usually reflects users' interest evolution as they gain knowledge. It can be captured by the order of the enrollment behaviors. Furthermore, as we mentioned before, previous studies in other fields has demonstrated the effectiveness of considering the order of user activities [15, 16] . However, it seems to be not sufficient in the context of online learning. As we can see, the POS yields worse performance than the Time + POS. This implies the importance of considering both the sequence and the timing of learning activities when understanding users' temporal learning interests in future research.",

The proposed model can be implemented on online learning platforms, such as Coursera.org and edX.org, and the design can help alleviate users' search costs from large course databases and facilitate the matching between users and courses. Besides, our study compares the performance of various designs respectively; an understanding of such results is a prerequisite for answering how to propose a course recommendation for students. We find, for example, course fields matter more than teachers to profile users' learning preferences. This finding can inform that features related to course field may need more attention than features related to teacher when designing course recommendation in the context of online learning. We also find that both the order and the timing of user enrollment behaviors help enhance course recommendation, meaning that the order and the timing are two important determinants of accurate course recommendation. Furthermore, the design of the course knowledge graph can also be leveraged for other course analyses, such as learning performance prediction, course concept extraction, learning path analysis, etc.",
