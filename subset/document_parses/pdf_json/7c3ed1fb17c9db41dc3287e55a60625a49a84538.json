            "text": "The World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March of 2020 as a result of the global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 . Testing and contact tracing are cornerstones of prevention, mitigation, and control efforts. Patient demographics for those who succumb to COVID-19 are multifactorial; however, the ability to test at high capacity has been associated with reduced mortality [1] . The ability to test often correlates with better infrastructure, hospital capacity, healthcare quality, and effective public health systems. The 'gold standard' test for COVID-19 has been quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect viral nucleic acid and has been adopted by most public health agencies. Serological and antigen detection assays also comprise a minority of tests and are more streamlined with faster turnaround times. However, the nature of the immune response whereby IgM and IgG antibodies are produced can be days to weeks following exposure to the virus [2] and antigen testing is less sensitive, particularly for asymptomatic patient diagnoses [3, 4] . Therefore, nucleic acid testing by qRT-PCR remains the most broadly applied procedure and requires sample collection, transport, RNA isolation, reverse transcription, amplification, sequence interrogation, and detection. Detection by qRT-PCR relies on a primer:probe set that specifically recognizes a target DNA sequence and generates a fluorescent signal during DNA amplification. This testing platform is based on specialized reagents, training, and infrastructure that is costly ",

            "text": "Isothermal RPA amplification and detection via LFA are a simplified approach for nucleic acid analysis that avoids the need for specialized infrastructure ( Figure 1A ) [6, 25] . The LFA strips employed in our study require test material that is labeled with both FITC/FAM and biotin ( Figure 1B -E). FITC/FAM:biotin conjugated analytes are captured at the test band that contains a biotin ligand ( Figure 1C ,E). FITC Au-NPs are in excess and a portion remain unbound and flow to the assay control band ( Figure 1D ). This ensures that the LFA test strip is functional and suitable for interpretation. We designed forward and reverse PCR primers that were labeled with FITC and biotin respectively, to generate SARS-CoV-2 ORF8a gene amplicons that flanked a single nucleotide polymorphism at genomic nucleotide position 28144 that causes a L84S amino acid substitution (Figure 2A ,B). ORF8a is a~100 amino acid protein with putative ER import signal sequences [29] . While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) assays detect the N and E genes respectively, we designed our assay for the ORF8a region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome because it does not overlap with other viral sequences and the L84S alteration was the first mutation observed in the USA (Figure 2A ) [30] . This mutation is proximal to a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) of -NGG (N = any nucleotide and G = guanine) for the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, making it suited for Cas9 detection (Figure 2A ). The use of dual-labeled (i.e., FAM and biotin) primers resulted in positive LFA test bands in either the presence or absence of an ORF8a template ( Figure 2C ). We hypothesized that primer dimers that resulted in a single complex containing FITC and biotin were the cause of this false positive result and corrected it by titrating the primer concentration. It was observed that higher primer concentrations contributed to dimerization and high false positive rates and lower primer amounts diminished sensitivity ( Figure S1 , in the Supplementary Materials). These results showed that direct amplification with labeled primers may be suboptimal for unambiguous nucleic acid detection of ORF8a by LFA. ",

We posited that biotinylation of this FITC-labeled PCR product could be accomplished using a biotinylated, nuclease inactivated ('dead') version of Cas9 (bdCas9) ( Figure 2D ). FITC ORF8a amplicons generated by standard PCR were incubated with bdCas9 and an ORF8a-specific sgRNA (Figure 2A ) or a mismatched control sgRNA (Supplementary Figure S2A) . Under these conditions, we observed a readily observable test band using the COVID-19 sgRNA and a faint one using the control sgRNA with no homology to SARS-Co-V2 ( Figure 2E ). Densitometry has been applied to ascribe values for semi-quantitative results as well as to differentiate the test bands of experimental and controls [31] . Because Cas9 is physically associated with DNA while scanning for target sites to cleave [32] , we predicted that this interaction led to non-specific DNA labeling and a faint but visible test band in the control sgRNA ( Figure 2E ). Therefore, to improve definitive interpretation, a competing 'soak' DNA that was rich in PAM-NGG sequences was designed in order to prevent indiscriminate Cas9:DNA interactions ( Figure 2F and Figure S2B ). This allowed for specific detection using a COVID-19 sgRNA, while the control mismatched sgRNA did not show a test band, therefore false positive detection was avoided ( Figure 2G ). Conversely, an irrelevant amplicon was not recognized by the COVID-19 sgRNA (Supplementary Figure S2C) . These results confirmed the ability of bdCas9 to label a FITC amplicon for detection via LFA.",

Even with a large excess of competitor soak DNA, a positive test band was observed on LFA strips with either COVID or control sgRNAs when a SARS-Co-V2 DNA template was present ( Figure 3A ). The two reaction components were then separated, first by performing a 20 min RPA at room temperature and then using RPA products for bdCas9 detection. With a 20 min bdCas9 incubation, test bands were visible that became more defined at 40 and 60 min and with increasing amounts of soak DNA ( Figure 3B ).

The ability to multiplex Cas9 with multiple sgRNAs also allowed us to test whether we could achieve simultaneous detection of viruses with overlapping symptomology. First, we designed, built, and tested DNA probes with distinct fluorophores for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, and RSV, respectively. These were tested and showed specificity of fluorescent signaling only for matched sgRNAs ( Figure 5A,B) . Next, the four distinct viral detection components were all combined in a single reaction mixture and analyzed simultaneously under isothermal (37 \u2022 C) conditions in a single tube using real-time fluorometry with a standard quantitative PCR instrument in a 96-well format ( Figure 5C ). Distinct fluorescence signals from cleavage of the pathogen-specific probe by the disease-specific sgRNA were observed. These results showed that all four viral pathogens could be detected in a multiplex fashion. ",

This amplicon was then used for establishing the limit of detection (LOD) with the fluorescence and LFAs. Fluorescence signal above background was observed for each sample, indicating that the Cas9-based assay limit of detection (LOD) was similar to that of qRT-PCR ( Figure 6A,C) . We further quantified ORF8a amplicons and performed a copy number LOD. Fluorescence above background was observed with 9 \u00d7 10 9 copies of target DNA ( Figure 6D ).

S gene D614G is highly prevalent [35] and N501Y has led to COVID surges [36] . Being able to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 strains may aid in whether certain strains are associated with differential clinical outcomes and/or could provide rapid information to public health departments. However, because the S gene between coronaviruses are highly homologous, we avoided targeting it with CRISPR/Cas9 to avoid false positives that may occur from a coronavirus other than SARS Co-V2. Instead, we targeted L84S caused by a SNP in the ORF8a gene that is unique to SARS-Co-V2 and delineated the relationships between S gene D614G, N501Y, and ORF8a L84S (Figure 2A and Figure S5 ). We tested the ability of Cas9 nuclease and bdCas9 to distinguish between cytosine and thymine at nucleotide position 28144 in ORF8a (Figure 2A) . We interrogated the sequence of an ORF8a DNA amplicon with a perfectly matched fluorescent probe and sgRNAs with matched complementarity (thymine) or a one base pair mismatch (cytosine). Either wild-type or a high-fidelity version of Cas9 (SpyFi\u2122) [37] were employed, and each showed differential fluorescence signal between matched and mismatched; however, it was not statistically significant ( Figure S6A ,B, in the Supplementary Materials). We then assessed the ability of bdCas9 in the LFA assay to distinguish targets at the single nucleotide level. For this, we utilized two soak DNA candidates: the PAM-rich soak DNA or a more homologous competitor soak that differed from the target and sgRNA by a single nucleotide ( Figures S2B and S6C , in the Supplementary Materials). A test band was observed for both the perfectly matched and one base pair mismatched DNA target when the PAM-rich soak was used ( Figure S6D ,E, in the Supplementary Materials). In contrast, when using soak DNA containing the single nucleotide mismatch from the target, only the sgRNA with perfect match to the target yielded a test band ( Figure S6D,E) . These data showed that, using an appropriate soak DNA sequence, bdCas9 and LFA could resolve DNA targets at the single nucleotide level.",

            "text": "We set out to leverage the ability and specificity of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 to interrogate and identify SARS-Co-V2 sequences to develop testing platforms for both field-based and more specialized laboratory testing. The former requires simplified methodologies and rapid readouts and would be particularly helpful in rural areas that lack laboratory facilities able to perform molecular diagnostics. Rural COVID-19 case rates are increasing [38] , rural residents are at elevated risk of COVID-19-related serious illness [39] , medical care capacity in lowly populated areas can be quickly overwhelmed [40] , and testing is challenging due to a lack of local facilities and funding [41] . To address these testing shortfalls, we employed Cas9 for targeting a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8a gene (Figure 2A) . Presently, the CDC and WHO test for sequences in the N and E genes, respectively (Figure 2A) . We chose ORF8a for our targeting strategies because there are seven coronaviruses that infect humans [42] and the ORF8a sequence is dissimilar between them, making it an ideal gene to target for SARS-CoV-2 detection without false positives occurring from these other viruses. Further, this site was ideal for designing a CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA with an -NGG PAM (Figure 2A) . The LFA test strips employed in our study require dual labeling of a candidate molecule for detection that is based on capture of the analyte by embedded Au-NPs coated with rabbit anti-FITC antibodies ( Figure 1B,C) . If the test material lacks a biotin label, it flows past the test band that contains a biotin ligand and accumulates at the assay control band that is coated with anti-rabbit antibodies. The presence of this band, that we termed the assay control, ensures that the LFA reagents and test stick device are functioning properly for detection ( Figure 1D ). If the reaction components are labeled with both FITC and biotin, a positive result is observed following Au-NP accumulation at the test band ( Figure 1E ). Using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) that allows for isothermal amplification of nucleic acids, we observed that the use of PCR primers labeled with FITC and biotin resulted in false positive test bands as a result of primer dimerization ( Figure 2B ,C and Supplementary Figure S1 ). In order to prevent this, we employed an amplification strategy using one FITC/FAM-labeled and one unlabeled primer ( Figure 2D ). To achieve the requisite FITC and biotin conjugation for LFA detection, we employed a nuclease inactive, biotinylated Cas9 with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) or control sgRNAs. Under these conditions, we avoided the false positives resulting from primer dimers; however, control sgRNA with no homology to ORF8a showed the presence of a test band ( Figure 2E ). Cas9 can remain stably bound to DNA as it scans for sequences of homology required to initiate DNA cleavage [43] . In the absence of nucleolytic properties, such as with 'dead' Cas9, DNA is also scanned and the on/off rate is rapid and impacted by Cas9 concentration [44] . Therefore, the false positive test bands we observed may be due to high concentration of Cas9 that can associate and dissociate with the former, leading to test bands irrespective of the sgRNA. To remedy this, a bait or \"soak\" DNA sequence comprised of PAM-rich sequences was designed for inclusion in the assay in order to sequester non-specific binding events ( Figure 2F and Supplementary Figure S2 ). Under these new conditions, LFA test bands were observed using the COVID-19 but not the mismatched control sgRNA ( Figure 2G ).",

            "text": "To further define the conditions for field-based testing, we explored the optimal settings for rapid amplification and detection via LFA. Previous studies using Cas enzymes have employed LAMP PCR and Cas in a 'one pot' approach for simultaneous amplification and detection [8, 45] . In our system, this strategy yielded high levels of false positives even in the presence of large amounts of competitor soak DNA ( Figure 3A) . In order to prevent this, isothermal RPA was performed followed by biotinylated Cas9 interrogation. Increased amounts of soak DNA and longer dbCas9:sgRNA:DNA incubation times from 20 to 60 min improved the resolution of detection ( Figure 3B ). Centralized reference and public health diagnostic sites can still face backlogs, leading to increased turnaround time for results. Therefore, we sought to apply CRISPR/Cas9 toward developing a higher throughput methodology. The design was based on the nuclease properties of Cas9 to cleave a fluorescent probe hybridized to a target amplicon ( Figure 4A ). Following a 20 min isothermal room temperature RPA, a fluorescently labeled SARS-CoV-2 probe was annealed to the reaction product and incubated with Cas9 peptide and an ORF8a sgRNA. This resulted in rapid fluorescence generation with a statistically significant difference between Cas9 with COVID-19 sgRNA and control and DNA:probe reactions observable in as little as 10 minutes ( Figure 4B ). COVID-19 symptoms can mirror those of influenza, which is most prevalent during the winter months in the northern hemisphere, and it is possible for one infection to be confused for another or for co-infection with both agents to occur [46] . Therefore, the CDC has designed multiplex qRT-PCR assays capable of detecting multiple viral pathogens in the same sample [47] . We likewise assessed the multiplex capability of Cas9 to detect and distinguish SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, and further designed and added components for detecting RSV. Individual sgRNAs were first tested against specific pathogen DNA:probe hybrids to assess whether there was any cross-reactivity. Figure 5A shows that only the Cas9:sgRNA complex matched to the target DNA:probe generated a distinct fluorescent signal. These data and those of Figure 2C ,E are complementary and support the mechanism of Cas that interacts with and scans DNA in a broad manner but cleaves DNA in a sequence-specific fashion [48] . As such, in the bdCas9 binding assay, a competitor soak DNA is required to inhibit this process in order to achieve specificity by LFA, while the nuclease-dependent fluorescent approach is capable of specificity without competitor soak DNA (Figures 2 and 5A) . The detection kinetics for each target were distinguishable from mismatched sgRNA sample fluorescence signal ( Figure 5B ). Because no promiscuous activity was observed between any sgRNA, the amplicon:probe hybrids were then pooled for single-well multiplex analysis. Rapid fluorescence was generated that was readily distinguishable from controls ( Figure 5C) , showing the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 nucleasebased diagnostics. Importantly, this method can be performed on a quantitative PCR instrument, and while this represents specialized equipment, it is also standard equipment in many research laboratories and most public health facilities. The speed of detection, capability to multiplex, and the ability to perform reactions in a 96-well format (or greater) makes this a scalable platform for high-throughput analytics.",

            "text": "With proof-of-principle established for our methodology using synthetic fragments, we then validated both LFA and fluorescence detection using the USA-WA1/2020 coronaviral isolate. A dilution series was performed using the CDC qRT PCR assay with the N1 and N2 primer:probe set and the 1:10,000 dilution showed a Ct of 34.9 \u00b1 0.78 for N1 and 36.7 \u00b1 0.55 for N2 ( Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure S3 ). Our CRISPR/Cas9 fluorescence assay was also able to detect the 1:10,000 dilution above background ( Figure 6C ). CDC guidelines are for positive tests to have a Ct < 40 [49] and other studies show reduced ability to isolate virus when Ct values exceed 35 [50] . Thus, our fluorescence assay is comparable to qRT-PCR with a LOD that correlates to a Ct of~35. In contrast, the LOD of LFA was an order of magnitude lower ( Figure 6E ), which is in keeping with its detection by visualization vs fluorescence, making it less sensitive, and may result in an inability to detect patients with low viral titers and makes follow-on confirmation of rapid tests important. To facilitate streamlined confirmation of LFAs, part of our design strategy was to employ a reverse transcription step using oligo dT/random hexamer priming. This allows for the same sample to be tested by LFA, fluorescence, and/or qRT-PCR. This is differential to some 'one-pot' approaches, such as RT LAMP; however, using gene-specific priming in this manner, we observed unacceptably high false priming events during PCR (data not shown). Moreover, the use of oligo dT/hexamer priming allows for standard control gene analysis during confirmation testing using nucleic acid amplification tests in accordance with CDC and WHO guidelines. Additionally, our RT strategy will support whole-genome sequencing that will provide further knowledge on coronaviral strain distribution and prevalence [51] . Follow-on confirmation testing is critical for any field-based assay, particularly for our LFA that does not generate/evaluate a human control gene. Rather, the observed assay control band shows proper function of the LFA strips. Future improvements to our approach will include a human control gene that is differentially labeled such that viral target and control genes can be analyzed on the same LFA.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses have genetic proofreading systems [52] ; however, mutations occur with potential to confer favorable properties, including increased infectivity or to diminish diagnostic capabilities [53] . S gene mutations such as D614G or N501Y and ORF8a L84S are suggested to have higher rates of infectivity [33] [34] [35] . The S genes in which the D614 and N501Y residues reside are homologous between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [54] . In contrast, the ORF8a gene shows little homology between coronaviruses and the L846 polymorphism is in the seed sequence of the sgRNA using the CRISPR/Cas9 enzyme from Streptococcus pyogenes (Figure 2A) . The seed sequence is the first~10 bp proximal to the PAM and dictates specificity to a higher degree than PAM distal sequences [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . These properties make ORF8a a desirable target site for overall specificity and single nucleotide analysis. Using wild-type or a high-fidelity Cas9, we assessed the single nucleotide distinction capabilities of Cas9 nuclease for ORF8a L84 (thymine) or S84 (cytosine) in our fluorometric assay. These data showed a trend for each enzyme in generating higher fluorescence signals when perfect homology between the DNA:sgRNA was present; however, the differences were not statistically significant (Supplementary Figure S6A,B) . In contrast, analysis with bdCas9 and LFA allowed for single-nucleotide resolution when a soak DNA was included that was mismatched from the target DNA sgRNA site by 1 bp (Figures S6C-E and S2B , in the Supplementary Materials). Being able to rapidly obtain information on viral polymorphisms could greatly enhance the ability to track the spread or infectivity of novel viral strains. The mutational rate of SARS-CoV-2 shows hotspots in the Orf1ab [60] gene, which may owe to its larger size, and diagnostics that require sequence specificity such as ours may be invalidated should a target site be mutated [53] . However, the plasticity of CRISPR/Cas9 targeting allows for the rapid development and deployment of new reagents to circumvent this. Further, our deliberate use of wholly commercial reagents, most of which are obtained lyophilized and therefore highly stable, supports the development and archival of assays and reagents for current and emergent biological threat events.",

Fluorescence-based analysis showed high specificity and sensitivity, and in a multiplex fashion, was able to identify four disparate respiratory viral pathogen sequences. LFA allows for field-based application, while the fluorescence assay is highly scalable, allowing for quicker turnaround times. As others have reported [62] , the robust amplification obtained by RPA and LAMP can result in cross-contamination and special precautions are required, particularly in multi-step reaction conditions such as ours.

The y-axis is relative fluorescent units (RFU), the x-axis represents the DNA target, and the label at the top represents the sgRNA for COVID, Influenza A or B, RSV, and template:probe hybrids alone (ODN). (C) Multiplex detection of four respiratory viral pathogen sequences. Annealed probe:DNA complexes for each target were pooled and interrogated simultaneously with all four sgRNAs complexed with Cas9. Background subtracted fluorescent units (BFU) obtained by subtracting the fluorescence of controls (annealed DNA/Probe without Cas9) are shown as the mean and standard deviation of three experiments. The color-coded bars in the graph correspond to the color-coded identifiers at the left. The fluorescent values were acquired using a real-time PCR instrument that measured fluorescence signal every 30 s (1 cycle= 30 s for 121 cycles). The x-axes for the graphs in (A) and (C) are labeled as 'cycles' which represents the time at which fluorescence images were captured during the one hour 37 \u2022 C isothermal assay (1 cycle = 30 s).",

COVID-19 DNA amplicons with a thymine at position 28114 were interrogated with a sgRNA either perfectly matched (T sgRNA) or mismatched by a single base pair (C sgRNA). The fluorescence values for three independent experiments for (A) wild-type Cas9 and (B) SpyFi\u2122 Cas9 are shown as mean and standard deviation. Controls were an unmatched sgRNA with the indicated Cas9 and probe:DNA hybridization products with no addition of Cas9. Three independent experiments in duplicate were performed with both Cas9 and SpyFi\u2122 included on the same 96-well assay plate. (C-E) Single nucleotide detection via LFA. (C) Experimental schema. SARS-Co-V2 DNA amplicons with a thymine (T SNP) or cytosine (C SNP) at ORF8a position 28114 were amplified using a FITC-labeled primer. bdCas9 was complexed with a perfectly matched or single base pair mismatched sgRNA. Decoy soak DNA was included as a PAM-rich soak or was mismatched by a single base pair to the specific sgRNA complexed with bdCas9. Dashed lines indicate the blockade of Cas9 by soak DNA. COVID target DNA with a thymine (D) or cytosine (E) were interrogated with the sgRNAs shown under the LFA test strips. Soak refers to whether the reaction contained a decoy DNA with a cytosine (D), thymine (E), or the PAM-rich soak DNA.
