In the last few years, researchers have turned their attention to automatic script discovery from text (Chambers, 2013; Weber et al., 2020 Weber et al., , 2018 . However, exclusively data-driven sub-event discovery methods face the challenge that narrative descriptions often omit common knowledge. 1 We aim for a process for building a library of scripts through human-machine collaboration leveraging NLP techniques to augment human background knowledge. The resulting demonstration system serves two related purposes. First, it is a knowledge acquisition tool that supports the development of a repository of scripts for use by downstream applications. Second, it is an annotation tool that supports the creation of a library to 1 Common knowledge might be missing from narrative descriptions due to the quantity and relevance maxims (Grice, 1975) . aid our understanding of how people create scripts. Such a library can inform and/or benchmark future script discovery approaches. Each script includes a natural language description of the steps in the complex event with links to an ontology. Events within a script are connected by (a) temporal order (e.g., negotiating the price of a car happens before buying the car) and (b) by shared argument (e.g., the person buying a car is also the person who negotiated its price).

Training systems to incorporate common-sense knowledge (Lin et al., 2019; Shwartz et al., 2020) has not yet addressed script creation. Another source of information for script discovery could be extraction from multiple languages and modalities. While some extraction systems have incorporated these other sources , such extractions have not yet fed into script discovery. Resolving the cooccurrence of events or entities between languages and modalities often relies on a common mapping, e.g., a structured ontology, such as ACE (Walker et al., 2006) or ERE (Song et al., 2015) . While our Machine-Aided Script Curator (MASC) does employ a structured ontology, it does not currently incorporate multi-modal or non-English sources. However, the limited ontology allows the eventsequencing background knowledge we encode to be used as a supplement to state-of-the-art information extraction systems, like OneIE and DYGIE++ (Wadden et al., 2019) , providing connections between otherwise disconnected extractions.",

There are two ways to connect events: the first, traditionally the focus of scripts, is temporal order; and the second is shared arguments (e.g., the same person is the agent of both Movement events go to a car dealership and take a test drive). To add sequential order, the curators enter pairwise before relations. Alternatively, they select multiple events and anchor them as coming before or after a single event. The latter method is convenient when the complete order is under-defined. 3 The curators add shared arguments to the script by selecting multiple events with the same argument, naming the argument (e.g., buyer, seller in Figure 2 ), and assigning an entity type (e.g., PER in Figure 2 ) and ontological role to each argument (e.g., Identifier, Researcher in Figure 2 ). While this process is mostly manual, MASC uses the ontology's constraints to limit the available label options. In addition to project-specific entity types, MASC suggests links to the much larger set of types available using Wikidata entities (e.g., suggesting Q786803 for car dealership).

We find that curators link 67% of the unique reference variables to Wikidata (e.g., buyer in Figure 3 ). We have not measured the ceiling on using Wikidata as an argument ontology.

For example, our curator included sign confidentiality agreement as an event in the script for a MERGER. While news frequently reports the final step of a merger, the full process is rarely described. Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of each of these scripts. They vary in (a) the number of steps initially created (row 1), with only 5 steps for MED and 16 for both EVAC and JOB; and (b) the time required for initial script creation (row 6). The script that took the longest was not the one with the most steps (or the most arguments). Instead, it was the domain that the curator knew the least about (and thus chose to research).

Interestingly, the curator incorporated more suggestions for two events that one thinks of as everyday experiences (FOOD and MED) than they did for the script they were unfamiliar with (MERGER). This suggests that the recommendation functionality can be useful even in a familiar domain; by capturing what the curator omits through forgetfulness or because they assume common knowledge. Further exploration of how a machine can aid a person whose knowledge may be incomplete or may forget to be explicit seems promising. Examples of possible research directions include incorporating suggestions from approaches that discover scripts (e.g., Rudinger et al. (2015) ; Weber et al. (2018 Weber et al. ( , 2020 ) and leveraging background knowledge (e.g., Wikidata).",

In general, using a human-in-the-loop process means that rather than treating an automatically generated label or event as correct, we treat it as a suggestion that the curator can ignore. Still, the suggestions can influence the curator. Thus it is vital that the metrics reported in this paper be interpreted with an understanding of the potential for bias and any use of MASC account for bias.",

Recent work has provided data sets for measuring bias (Nadeem et al., 2020) and metastudies of the approaches taken to study and address bias (Blodgett et al., 2020) . Much work has focused on bias as it impacts demographic groups. MASC focuses on events, not individuals. The publicly available GPT-2 models have learned from data that might not cover current events (e.g., GPT-2 was trained before the COVID-19 epidemic), represents only English dialects from the inner-circle (Dunn and Adams, 2020), and contains toxic language (Gehman et al., 2020). In our immediate context, we mitigate against the challenge presented by language model bias by requiring manual review of all automatically suggested output. If the ideas in this paper were extended to a fully automatic approach, language model and domain-specific studies of the impact of bias on LM-based suggestions would be necessary.",

These scripts provide interesting examples of what we could learn from a larger scale data set; however, they are not large enough themselves to serve as a new benchmark. The five scripts were created by full-time research staff compensated following US state and federal law. The scripts were created by a single individual and represent that individual's pre-existing knowledge (and their im-plicit biases). To counter bias in a large-scale script repository, we recommend that the curator workforce is diverse and that any given activity is represented in scripts written by multiple people. Any released repository should have sufficient reporting about the data set creators to provide users with an understanding of data bias. The paper reports empirical results based on this five script sample. However, the paper acknowledges that the sample is small and treats these results as case studies for MASC, not a new benchmark.",

In other cases, e.g., the steps in grooming an individual for human trafficking, the script's conclusion is negative, but understanding the process is necessary to prevent the activity. As AI's ability to discover and apply such knowledge increases, it will be necessary to regularly audit the use cases to ensure the focus remains a benefit to society.
