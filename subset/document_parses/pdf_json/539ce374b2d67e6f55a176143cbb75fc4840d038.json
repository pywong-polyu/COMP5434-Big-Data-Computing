In this blinded randomized clinical trial (EudraCT 2021-002348-57) we compare the efficacy and safety of an additional booster vaccination with a vector versus mRNA vaccine in non-seroconverted patients. We assigned 60 patients under rituximab treatment, who did not seroconvert after their primary mRNA vaccination with either BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna), to receive a third dose, either using the same mRNA or the vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca). Patients were stratified according to the presence of peripheral B-cells. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion rate between vector (heterologous) and mRNA (homologous) vaccinated patients by week four. Key secondary endpoints included the overall seroconversion and cellular immune response; safety was assessed at weeks one and four.",

Newly induced humoral and/or cellular responses occurred in 9/11 (82%) patients. No serious adverse events, related to immunization, were observed. This enhanced humoral and/or cellular immune response supports an additional booster vaccination in non-seroconverted patients irrespective of a heterologous or homologous vaccination regimen.",

Two types of vaccines have been currently approved by the European Medicines Agency: vector vaccines, such as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2-S (Johnson&Johnson), and mRNA vaccines, such as BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna). However, immune responses to these vaccines vary between individuals and antibody levels wane over time 3, 4 . Application of an additional booster dose is heavily investigated by ongoing clinical trials and first reports have been published [5] [6] [7] [8] . Several countries already started a third vaccination, especially in patients at high risk. Most recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration authorized an additional vaccine dose for certain immunocompromised patients 9 .",

In order to stimulate the humoral immune response of rituximab-treated patients who do not respond to the conventional scheme of COVID-19 vaccination, an additional booster vaccination may be an obvious clinical strategy. Recent studies also evaluated the safety and efficacy of homologous versus heterologous schemes for primary and secondary vaccination in healthy individuals [16] [17] [18] . However, it is unknown whether a heterologous approach could benefit those who completely lack a humoral immune response after basic immunization. Furthermore, no data exist on responses to an additional booster vaccination in patients who had completely failed to mount a specific antibody response after the primary two-vaccination schedule.",

In our study, no significant advantage for either the homologous or heterologous vaccination strategy was found: the primary outcome showed a 10% higher seroconversion rate for mRNA (homologous) versus vector (heterologous) vaccination.

While the small sample size precluded delivering ultimate statistical evidence concerning the clinical question of differences in immune responses to booster vaccination with homologous versus heterologous products, the important result of our study is that a third booster vaccination is effective in inducing an immune response in these refractory patients. Since we cannot generalize these data to the wider population of non-responders to COVID-19 vaccines, i.e. beyond immunosuppressed patients, broader population-based programs are needed to evaluate the impact of an additional booster vaccination in non-responding healthy individuals. It is important to note, that it still needs to be determined how humoral and cellular immune responses (or their absence) relate to protection against clinical infection with SARS-CoV-2.",

Even though the primary endpoint was not met, 27% of all vaccinated patients seroconverted independent of the vaccine used with a median SARS-CoV-2 S antibody level of 15.7 [IQR: 4.7, 25.8] BAU/mL. Seroconversion rate was higher in patients with detectable peripheral CD19 + B-cells versus those without (Figure 2A). Among patients with no detectable peripheral B-cells (37/55, 67%) antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike (S) protein (anti-RBD antibodies) were detectable in 3/37 (8%) patients; in patients with detectable peripheral B-cells, seroconversion rate was 67% (12/18) at week four (Figure 2A to C). Median levels of anti-RBD antibodies were 19.4 [IQR: 8.2, 114.8] and 12.4 [IQR: 3.8, 17.8T-cell responses were determined by ELISpot assay in all patients before and after booster vaccination. Matched samples before and after the third vaccination were available from 36 patients. Patient characteristics for this group stratified by third vaccination are presented as Supplementary Table 2. At screening, 15/20 (75%) of patients assigned to the vector group and 10/16 (63%) assigned to the mRNA group had detectable spike-specific T-cells. Administration of a third vaccine dose led to an increase to 20/20 (100%) in the vector and 13/16 (81%) in the mRNA group (Figure 3A-B). The number of spot forming cells (SFC) to the spike peptide pools (S1/S2) was slightly higher after boost with vector vaccine (median: 459, IQR [133, 722] as compared to mRNA vaccine (median: 305, IQR [171, 416]) (Figure 3C). Integrative analysis of humoral and T-cell responses for 36 patients with matched samples before and after the third vaccination was performed: before third vaccination 11/36 (31%) had neither anti-RBD antibodies nor T-cell response (AB-,T-), and 25/36 patients (69%) did not have a humoral but exhibited a cellular immune response (AB-,T+). After the third vaccination 8/36 (22%) showed a humoral and Tcell response (AB+,T+), 1/36 (3%) had a humoral but no detectable cellular immune response (AB+,T-), in 25/36 (69%) a cellular but no humoral immune response (AB-,T+) was observed; 2/36 (6%) developed neither a humoral nor a cellular immune response. Overall a cellular and/or humoral immune response could be achieved through an additional booster vaccination in 9 out of 11 (82%) of those patients who did not respond to conventional vaccination strategy with two doses of mRNA vaccine (Figure 3D, Supplementary Table 2 and 3).",

Compared to mRNA booster vaccination, the vector vaccine showed a lower likelihood of inducing humoral response though not statistically significant. With respect to T-cell response, no association with age, use of prednisone or presence of peripheral B-cells could be observed (Figure 4). All patients vaccinated with the vector regimen developed a Tcell response, while all patients without T-cell response were co-treated with a csDMARD, resulting in non-convergence of the respective regression models (Supplementary",

As described after conventional vaccination with two mRNA vaccine doses, presence of detectable peripheral B-cells was the strongest determinant for seroconversion also in patients receiving an additional booster vaccination. These data support the critical consideration of the timing of rituximab treatment, potentially suggesting postponing its application until after vaccination, or that vaccination should be timed after peripheral B-cells have repopulated. Which strategy may be preferable will be guided by the perceived severity of underlying disease as well as the risk from a severe COVID-19 infection.",

Key exclusion criteria were previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 or known allergies to study compounds. The detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria can be found in the trial protocol (Supplementary information). Patients were block-randomized in a 1:1 ratio based on the presence or absence of peripheral B lymphocytes by a computerized randomization algorithm to receive either a third dose of an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, respective of their initial vaccination compound) or a third vaccination with a vector COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19). During the screening visit (visit one), data on demographics, concomitant medication, possible hypersensitivity reactions to the previous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and medical history regarding SARS-CoV-2 infections were collected. The absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against nucleocapsid and spike-protein was verified before enrollment and the level of peripheral B lymphocytes was assessed. The vaccination was applied during a baseline visit (visit two, within 28 days after screening) followed by visits three and four (one and four weeks after vaccination, respectively) to determine the efficacy and safety of the third COVID-19 vaccination. Serum samples obtained during visits one, three and four were stored below -70\u00b0C at the Biobank of the Medical University of Vienna, a centralized facility for the (PBMCs) were isolated at screening and week one by density gradient centrifugation and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until further use. All patients were blinded throughout visit four, mainly to allow objectivity in safety assessment of the two strategies; blinding of vaccines was ensured by using prearranged dose aliquots in syringes without reference to the type used. The City of Vienna provided the vaccines for this study free of charge through the Central Pharmacy of the Vienna General Hospital. The study was conducted in following Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol and all relevant documents were approved by the competent authorities and the local ethical committee (vote number 1481/2021) of the Medical University of Vienna.
