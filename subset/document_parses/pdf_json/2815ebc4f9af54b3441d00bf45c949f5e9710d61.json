The COVID-19 pandemic is a broad stressor with significant physical and social threats. In the current study, we were interested in ascertaining the degree to which AS would relate to distress and disability in the context of COVID-19. We hypothesized that AS would be associated with increased distress and disability. Moreover, we hypothesized that AS would be uniquely predictive while controlling for other relevant risk factors such as age, race, and perceived local COVID-19 infection rates. Method: Participants (N = 249) were U.S. adults assessed using online data resourcing and re-assessed one month later. Results: At the first time point, during the beginning phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, AS was significantly related to COVID-19 distress and disability with a moderate effect size. AS was longitudinally associated with higher COVID-19 worry and depression. Limitations: Our findings are limited by the use of a relatively small online sample. Additionally, assessment of pre-pandemic and post-pandemic symptoms and functioning would be beneficial for future research. Conclusions: Taken together, the current study provided evidence consistent with AS as a causal risk factor for the development of distress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "In late 2019, a new coronavirus illness was identified in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the globe, resulting in a pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020) . In addition to impacting the physical health of millions of Americans, the COVID-19 pandemic is a significant psychological stressor due to both the threat of the illness and the mitigation strategies used to contain its spread (e.g., social distancing). It is imperative to understand cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to the pandemic, as such data are crucial for informing population-level interventions. Several authors have made calls for researchers to rapidly gather data regarding the effects of the pandemic on psychological and social functioning, highlighting that increases in overall distress, incidence of psychiatric conditions, and unhealthy coping behaviors (e.g., substance use) are likely to occur (Cullen et al., 2020; Holmes et al., 2020; Pfefferbaum and North, 2020; Reger et al., 2020) . Research from past viral outbreaks, such as SARS and Ebola, supports these hypotheses, showing increases in distress, disability, and significant mental health issues, even several months after quarantine and other protective measures have ended (Brooks et al., 2020; Hawryluck et al., 2004; Jeong et al., 2016; Mazumder et al., 2020; Mihashi et al., 2009; Sprang and Silman, 2013; Taylor, 2019) .",

In particular, people with a propensity to magnify stress are likely to experience more severe and disabling consequences to the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a construct that captures individual differences in this tendency. AS refers to the fear of negative consequences stemming from maladaptive interpretations related to their experience of anxious arousal (Reiss et al., 1986) . Previous research (Taylor et al., 2007; Zinbarg et al., 1997) has identified three lower-order dimensions of AS including fears of physical, cognitive, and social consequences of anxious arousal. For example, trouble concentrating or racing thoughts may be interpreted as \"going crazy\" or \"losing one's mind\" (i.e., cognitive concerns). Physiological arousal, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, may be interpreted as an impending heart attack (i.e., physical concerns). Observable symptoms of anxiety, such as sweating or blushing, may be interpreted as potentiating a negative evaluation by others (i.e., social concerns). Together, these subfactors combine to represent one of the most well studied risk factors in the development of anxiety and mood pathology (Naragon-Gainey, 2010; Olatunji and Wolitzky-Taylor, 2009; Schmidt et al., 2006) .",

For example, AS has been found to predict acute panic attack responses during basic training (Schmidt et al., 1997 as well as posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following childbirth (Keogh et al., 2002) . Elevated AS also predicts stress reactions to novel laboratory stresses including biological challenges (e.g. Asmundson et al., 1994; McNally and Eke, 1996; Schmidt, 1999) as well as trauma films (Boffa et al., 2016; Olatunji and Fan, 2015) and exposure to actual trauma such as a campus shooting (Boffa et al., 2016) . Further, AS is associated with a range of maladaptive coping behaviors including compulsive behaviors such as hoarding and excessive washing (e.g. Medley et al., 2013; Raines et al., 2014) as well as avoidance (e.g. Norton and Asmundson, 2004; Stewart et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Given that AS has been well-established as a causal risk factor for adverse responses to a wide array of stressors, we would expect AS to be predictive of amplified stress responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, recent cross-sectional findings support the idea that AS is associated with COVID distress (Manning et al., 2021; Rogers et al., 2021) . However, these reports are significantly limited due to their cross-sectional nature. A more powerful test of the influence of AS on pandemic distress would be to demonstrate longitudinal effects of this purported risk variable. Thus, the primary aim of the present study is to document the degree to which AS is prospectively associated with elevated distress and disability in the context of the pandemic. Given that the pandemic differentially affects individuals based on age, race, and exposure to COVID-19, we were interested in examining whether AS is associated with distress and disability after controlling for these factors. We hypothesized that AS would be significantly associated with increased COVID-19 related worry, behaviors (e.g., stockpiling), and disability both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. In addition, we explored whether this pattern of effects was differentially related to AS facets. In particular, we expected that AS physical concerns, which involves the amplification of physical sensations, may be particularly predictive of distress given that COVID-19 presents in a wide array of cardiorespiratory sensations that may mimic normal stress responses.",

Participants rated how much they agreed with each item on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (very little) to 4 (very much).

Overall, mean scores tended to decrease slightly from Wave 1 to Wave 2 potentially reflecting adaptation to COVID-19 related threat and regulations. Of note, the decrease was significant for GAD-7 scores from Wave 1 to Wave 2 (t = 3.22, p = .002). Consistent with our hypotheses, AS was significantly correlated with COVID-19 related behaviors, worry, and disability as well as anxiety and depression symptoms across timepoints. Notably, the level of association suggests fairly robust cross-sectional associations between the ASI, COVID scales, and symptom measures with most correlations in the .5-.6 range. Though still statistically significant, the association with the COVID behaviors scale was somewhat lower (.36-.44).",

Results indicated that in each model the Wave 1 autoregressive variable was highly associated with the corresponding variable at Wave 2 and accounted for a large proportion of the variance (R 2 = .44-.68). In regard to covariates, greater perceived outbreak size was associated with higher levels of COVID-19 behaviors (t = 2.12, \u03b2 = .12, p < .05) and age had a significant effect on depressive symptoms with younger individuals reporting more symptoms (t = -2.16, \u03b2 = -.14, p < .05). In terms of the final step in the models, AS predicted increases in worry (t = 2.02, \u03b2 = .17, p < .05) and depressive symptoms (t = 2.17, \u03b2 = .15, p < .05), but not behaviors (t = -1.35, \u03b2 = -.08, p = .18), disability (t = 0.88, \u03b2 = .08, p = .38), or anxiety symptoms (t = 0.83, \u03b2 = .06, p = .41). We followed up these analyses by conducting exploratory analyses of the COVID Impact subscales as well as the first order facets of the ASI-3 (physical, cognitive, social). Results indicated differential associations between the ASI-3, ASI-3 subscales, and COVID Impact subscales. Specifically, when examining total ASI-3 scores, Wave 1 AS was significantly associated with increases in catastrophic (t = 2.53, \u03b2 = .22, p < .05), but not health (t = 1.61, \u03b2 = .14, p = .11) or financial (t = 1.59, \u03b2 = .11, p = .12) worries.

When examining individual facets of AS, worry findings were specific to cognitive AS. Cognitive AS predicted increases in worry (t = 2.72, \u03b2 = .22, p < .05); catastrophic (t = 3.30, \u03b2 = .27, p < .05) and health (t = 2.11, \u03b2 = .17, p < .05) worries in particular.

Consistent with this, a brief computerized AS intervention program designed specifically to reduce AS cognitive concerns found reductions in AS to be associated with reduced PTSS at one-month follow-up in a mixed veteran/civilian sample (Mitchell et al., 2014) . Finally, a previous study reported that a single-session AS intervention led to greater reductions in PTSS than a control condition after one month in a trauma-exposed sample; moreover, this effect was mediated by pre-to-post intervention reductions in AS (Allan et al., 2015) . Given that AS is malleable, and this malleability is related to change in stress symptoms, it is plausible that an AS intervention administered during the pandemic could prospectively mitigate the development of later symptoms. Cross-sectionally, AS was significantly positively associated with each outcome measure assessed. The weakest of these associations at each timepoint was that with CIB behaviors, but the remaining correlations were rather strong (.56-.70). This falls in line with previous research which finds AS to be significantly related to depression and generalized anxiety symptoms (Allan et al., 2014a (Allan et al., , 2014b Warren et al., 2021) .

While AS did not predict changes in specific pandemic related behaviors or general worry as indexed by the GAD-7, there was an association between AS and changes in worries, particularly catastrophic worries such as being worried they would not have enough money or resources to survive or worry that quarantine would result in them going crazy. While the linkage between cognitive AS and catastrophic pandemic related worry shows nice specificity, it is interesting that cognitive but not physical AS is strongly associated with negative health outcomes given the similarity between COVID-19 respiratory symptoms and physical sensations of anxiety. This may speak to the importance of the mental stressors involved with dealing with the pandemic and is somewhat consistent with prior AS findings where cognitive AS outperformed physical AS in predicting negative outcomes during a stressor (i.e., basic military training) involving a combination of both physical and mental challenges (Schmidt et al., 1997 .

First, we necessarily relied on online data sources for the acquisition of study participants. Although use of online crowdsourcing mechanisms is increasingly common and the procedures are generally well-accepted (Sheehan, 2017; Thomas and Clifford, 2017) , there are some concerns about these procedures including the contamination of data from automated or \"bot\" responses and the representativeness of such samples (Pei et al., 2020) . To mitigate some of these concerns, we utilized reliability checks, which are commonly recommended for these data sources (Peer et al., 2014; Pei et al., 2020) . However, the findings from this sample should be interpreted with caution as they may not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population. Additionally, the sample size was relatively small. Thus, additional research examining COVID-19 related outcomes within more diverse and clinically relevant samples is indicated. Additionally, the current study utilized two timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, AS was not assessed prior to the pandemic and implications for post-pandemic functioning are unclear. While we were able to assess changes over time, future research would benefit from including participants for whom pre-pandemic measurements are available as well as examining post-pandemic symptoms and functioning. Finally, distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be fully disentangled from that related to other significant stressors including large-scale political unrest and acts of violence in the U.S.",
