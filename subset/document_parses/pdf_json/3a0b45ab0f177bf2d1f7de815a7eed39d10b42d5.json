Inappropriate health-seeking behaviours contribute to adverse outcomes, and community engagement is key in driving behavioural change. WHO has highlighted East Africa as a geographical area of concern for snakebite envenoming. The overall aim of the project is to develop a community engagement toolkit for snakebite envenoming and other NTDs. The objective of this scoping review was to identify current practices in recent community engagement in rural East Africa; the applicability of these results to snakebite envenoming are discussed. PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched from 1 January 2017 to 3 September 2020. Search terms were used to identify publications which related to rural communities and health or disease, for both humans and animals. After reviewing the full papers for all geographical areas, 112 publications were included, 30 of which were conducted in East Africa. Papers included nine different countries and covered a broad range of health topics; notably, water, sanitation and hygiene, nutrition, and maternal and child health. Only one publication considered animal health. The most common form of engagement was in the context of a group meeting, lecture, presentation, discussion or question and answer session (63.3%). A variety of locations within the community were used to engage with people, the most common being an individual's household (23.3%). Communication factors was the key influencer for engagement, both positively and negatively. Key barriers to engagement include local languages and health beliefs, literacy levels, mobile phone ownership and the level of mobile Internet coverage, burden of agricultural work and weather conditions. This study provides an extensive overview of recent public health community engagement in East Africa, which will serve as a useful resource for any group seeking to plan an intervention in remote and rural areas in East Africa. Furthermore, it serves as a guide to help tailor community engagement to snakebite envenoming.",

Indeed, a change in knowledges, attitudes and perceptions is not enough to drive a change in behaviour, especially when it is deeply intertwined in the very fabric of culture itself. This can be seen as victims of snakebite continue to seek care from traditional healers, rather than from a healthcare facility, despite better availability of snake antivenom (Schioldann et al., 2018) .",

Globally the three areas with the highest number of envenomings include South Asia, South-East Asia, and East Sub-Saharan Africa (Kasturiratne et al., 2008) . Chippaux (2011) estimates up to 14,600 amputations occur per year secondary to SBE in Sub-Saharan Africa; East Africa is estimated to have 5177 deaths, 6127 amputations and 22,941 cases of post-traumatic stress disorder secondary to SBE (Halilu et al., 2019) . There are several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where the data on the number of envenomings or deaths remain limited or absent. Data from Halilu et al. (2019) provides the mean number of cases of SBE, which ranges from 61 cases in Djibouti, up to 35,633 cases in Ethiopia. The estimated number of cases of SBE for the remaining East African countries included in the study are: Mauritius 763, Somalia 3,315, Burundi 3,870, Zambia 3,940, Zimbabwe 4,066, Rwanda 4,171, Malawi 5,855, Mozambique 6,996, United Republic of Tanzania 13,504, Uganda 13,801 and Kenya 15,411. Rural areas in Sub-Saharan Africa are disproportionately affected, with an incidence of SBE approximately 10 times higher compared to urban areas (Chippaux, 2011) . For this study, the United Nations classification was used to classify countries into geographical regions; East Africa comprises British Indian Ocean Territory, Burundi, Comoros, Dijbouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, French Southern Territories, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mayotte, Mozambique, R\u00e9union, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe (The United Nations Statistics Division, 1999) .",

The use of traditional medicine or techniques such as tourniquet use, tattooing, burning, cutting or placing a stone or herbal medicine over the bite site remain commonplace. Those bitten by snakes will often seek care from a traditional healer rather than presenting to a healthcare facility. Indeed, in Sub-Saharan Africa, at least 75% of victims opted for traditional medicine as firstline treatment (Chippaux, 2011) . There may be multiple reasons for these actions, such as a perceived or actual lack of adequate medical facilities, an inability to afford treatment, issues with transport to a healthcare facility or a mistrust of services. Furthermore, traditional healers often hold a position of influence within communities as respected and trusted individuals. The use of traditional treatments, in addition to the infrequent use of the correct first-aid management of snakebite, contributes to the current high burden of morbidity and mortality from SBE. Furthermore, an understanding of, and engagement with, the preventive measures to avoid a snakebite is crucial. An educated community is an empowered community, and it is well-recognized that CE is a fundamental component in reducing the impact and negative outcomes of SBE (Kadam et al., 2021) .",

Community empowerment and engagement, specifically through education and training, is one of four strategic aims highlighted in the roadmap. Like a number of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), this disease is both preventable and treatable, and effective engagement with affected communities may be the most cost-effective approach to improving outcomes. It is essential to consider the local knowledge, attitudes and health beliefs on SBE at the community level in order to ensure that a CE intervention is targeted to the need and is culturally appropriate. CE should focus on, but not be limited to, the prevention of SBE and appropriate first-aid management. Community services should be in place to support victims, who are left not only with long-term physical disability but also with psychological sequelae such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (Bhaumik et al., 2020) .",

A move away from siloed approaches will facilitate a recovery from the devastating blow of the COVID-19 pandemic, as we work towards the targets set out by the Sustainable Development Goals and, ultimately, to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). It is not possible to develop a 'one size fits all approach' for CE; a customized approach is not desirable, but rather is essential to the success of such programmes. For NTDs, which largely affect the rural poor, CE underpins the entire process of building sustainable NTD capacity (Ortu and Williams, 2017) . Specifically, for SBE, a critical action outlined in the NTD road map is to \"build awareness in communities on best practices in prevention and seeking treatment for snakebite envenoming\" (WHO, 2020) . Furthermore, the WHO snakebite roadmap emphasizes the impact of SBE on animal health and the importance of a transdisciplinary alliance between veterinary and human medicine for a 'One Health' approach to prevention and control of SBE (WHO, 2019).",

On review of the next 100 publications, there was agreement on 91% of papers, with only 9% that required discussion. Thus, a single expert reviewer (BM) independently reviewed the publications by title and abstract, a methodology also supported by Waffenschmidt (2019).

Traditionally, there are five forms of communication; intrapersonal, interpersonal, group, public, and mass (LibreTexts). Intrapersonal communication represents an internal dialogue and hence was not a relevant category for this study. Interpersonal communication comprises a \"two-way, nonmediated message exchange between a very small number\" of people, whereas conversely mass communication was defined as \"one-way, technologically mediated messages, delivered to large audiences\" (O'Sullivan and Carr, 2017) . Group communication entails an interactive participatory process between at least three people, whereas if within a group of people one person is delivering information to an audience, this is defined as \"public\" (LibreTexts). A wide range of different methods were used to mobilize communities or engage with them as part of the study intervention (Table 3) . Large group events were most commonly used to communicate (63.3%), followed by communication on an individual level at a visit to the household (30%).",

Communication factors were the key influencer for engagement, both positive and negative. Use of other literate individuals, pictures, visual aids, models and even preparation of recipes aided communicating with those who were illiterate, which is a common barrier to engagement in remote and rural settings. Interpreters were required for local languages, and this proved problematic at points requiring bi or trilingual interpreters; one publication highlights that lack of certain words existing in the local language, such as cancer, in either the verbal or written form (Lidofsky et al., 2019) . Where interventions were tailored to a community or setting, a positive impact was identified.

            "text": "The use of a participatory approach to engagement by involving the community in the decision-making and the use of a package of interventions rather than a single area being targeted were highlighted as factors that facilitated engagement. One study developed a model of sustainable village governance to support the existing programme to control NTDs; the model placed 'the village at the centre of the reform process' and this highlighted relevant issues that related to the power and control between those implementing the program, the social services committee, the community and other actors (Madon et al., 2018) . A nutrition education program that included practical cooking sessions attributed the successful behaviour change to the use of participatory approaches used in the education sessions (Chiutsi-Phiri et al., 2017) . A Maternal and Neonatal Implementation for Equitable Systems (MANI-FEST) project used a participatory approach for implementation which involved giving the local stakeholders responsibility for selecting the approaches used; they were able to make changes as they felt appropriate (Ekirapa-Kiracho et al., 2017) . This was reported to promote 'social approval and ownership of the project, which reduces resistance to the uptake of interventions' (Ekirapa-Kiracho et al., 2017) . The background of the study team, the support and supervision that they received and positive personal characteristics were of note. The social network of study participants was also observed in some cases to have a substantial positive influence on adopting sustainable behaviour change. Conversely, where support from family or friends was lacking, this negatively impacted on participation. Two studies described the association of stigma with the condition under study, impacting both engagement with and access to services (Mutamba et al., 2018; Settergren et al., 2018) . Some diseases may be stigmatizing to all those affected or particular sociodemographic groups, such as women. An in-depth understanding of the disease itself, in addition to the complex social context, is essential in order to successfully engage with those affected by stigma. Particular attention should be paid to those who are engaging with communities, to ensure they are trusted and respected individuals who will be able to reach these hard to access groups. If women are experiencing stigma, then CE is more likely to be successful if those conducting CE are also female. Furthermore, a more private location may be appropriate if individuals are being targeted, rather than a public arena.",

This was linked to competing events such as agricultural activities, or local holidays, which in turn are intertwined with the seasons and climate.",

            "text": "This scoping review is the first to provide a broad overview of recent CE in remote and rural areas in East Africa. From all the data gathered, a large degree of heterogeneity was observed in the methods used to engage with rural communities, across a wide range of health topics in nine East African countries. Methods of communication varied from a personalized one-on-one interaction to an impersonal mass media approach. A variety of creative methods were used to both mobilize and engage, from cooking demonstrations to songs, and from football games to T-shirts with messages on them. Indeed, most studies used several different methods of engagement rather than just a single intervention in isolation. The range of 30 publications highlighted multiple significant contributory factors that both facilitated and hindered CE, which pertain to the individuals in the community, the environment and the study conditions. This scoping review serves as a useful resource for anyone wishing to plan an intervention on CE in rural East Africa, particularly for those working on NTDs, which are over-represented in agricultural and unindustrialized locations. This timely publication serves as a buttress for the new road map Ending the neglect to attain the Sustainable Development Goals: a roadmap for neglected tropical diseases 2021-2030, endorsed by the Seventy-third World Health Assembly in 2020, which strives to achieve a 90% reduction in people requiring interventions against NTDs and a 75% reduction in disability-adjusted life years related to NTDs by 2030 (WHO, 2020). One of the three pillars of the road map to support these efforts is the scaling up of cross-cutting approaches (WHO, 2020). Furthermore, De Wager et al. (2018) highlight the importance of \"quick and tangible wins\" to the success of a CE intervention. This scoping review highlights opportunities for quick wins through cross-sectoral collaboration in East Africa; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), nutrition, and maternal and child health were common topics of study. WASH has a clear overlap with many NTDs, predominantly in reducing and preventing trachoma, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases and dracunculiasis (Johnston et al., 2015) . This is less obvious for SBE. Nevertheless, WASH plays an important role in good wound care and, where water is scarce, attempts to access a water source could lead to SBE; walking long distances to a water source, often without footwear, increases the chance of inadvertently stepping on a snake. Certain practises during menstruation, such as women being exiled outside of the household when menstruating, have been linked to a risk of SBE (Amatya et al., 2018) . Children are also an important demographic to target in combatting SBE; activities such as playing or walking to school place them at increased risk of SBE, and they often suffer more severe envenomations due to their smaller volume of distribution (Le Geyt et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2019) . Furthermore, when children are non-verbal it can be particularly difficult to diagnose SBE. Of the 59,000 annual human deaths from rabies, 40% are children living in Asia and Africa (World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations & World Organisation for Animal Health, 2018). Health education in schools should be incorporated into the curriculum, as this is an excellent opportunity to engage with children on the prevention of animal bites, particularly in endemic areas. We can see clear overlay between SBE and current areas where CE is ongoing in rural areas in East Africa. Cross-sectoral collaboration must be encouraged and capitalized on; behaviour change is a lengthy process and project teams need to invest time to develop relationships with communities and build trust. Where a project team has achieved this, they could be supported by another sector for mutual gains that lead to 'quick wins'. For example, if successful CE on malaria is ongoing, those wishing to engage CE on the prevention of SBE could support the malaria project through provision of bed nets or education materials that also demonstrate how nets keep out snakes that might enter the home. Additional education on other aspects of prevention of SBE could also be included alongside this. This is likely to be more cost-effective than developing a novel CE program in the same area. 'Quick wins' should not be confused with an approach that has not be properly considered or is not sustainable. Furthermore, there have been a number of successful interventions designed to prevent and control NTDs including leishmaniasis, leprosy, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases and trachoma, through specifically targeting children (Das et al., 2014; Rujeni et al., 2017) . Thus, targeting schoolchildren for CE interventions represents exciting opportunities to educate a group who can act as agents of change on a broad range of health topics for both their families and communities (Milakovich et al., 2018) .",

Although it can be challenging and time-consuming, the NTD community must seek ways to work with traditional healers and community and religious leaders, who hold trusted and influential positions within their communities and thus are key in driving behavioural change (Awah et al., 2018; Kadam et al., 2021) . Samuel et al. (2020) demonstrates the efficacy of an education video that includes \"snake rescuers\" and members of the public who have been bitten by snakes; inclusion of victims of SBE can be a powerful way of engaging with people, and they can act as local champions for the disease. Given the transdisciplinary nature of SBE, veterinarians, herpetologists, snake handlers and snake enthusiasts should also be included in the delivery of CE on SBE, particularly in addressing the impact of SBE on animal health.",

Thus, there is a need to engage with communities on promoting livestock management practices that help prevent snakebite, or indeed other NTDs, in both humans and animals.

Whilst a number of different methods to engage with people was used in rural East Africa, the most commonly observed method was in a group setting, as a meeting, lecture, presentation or discussion. Whilst Samuel et al. (2020) used Facebook with much success to highlight a campaign on SBE in Tamil Nadu, consideration is needed about the level of mobile Internet connectivity in that geographical area. There remains a significant technological divide, with Sub-Saharan Africa \"accounting for almost half of the global population not covered by a mobile broadband network\" by the close of 2019, with only 26% of people connected to mobile Internet (Bahia and Delaporte, 2020) .

This is important to consider for SBE, as understanding what happens when a snake bites is key to the explanation of the first-aid management of snakebite. It also underpins a comprehension of why traditional treatments are both ineffective, but potentially harmful. The process of explaining how venom is injected and travels round the body poses a challenge in local languages and should be carefully deliberated to make it culturally relevant. The same is true when explaining that a patient who appears tired may in fact be displaying a bilateral ptosis secondary to a neurotoxic bite.",

Whilst this study is limited to East Africa, the results for other geographical areas will be completed as part of the overarching project. The short timeframe of 3.5 years could have been extended; however, given the considerable size of literature on CE the decision was made to limit this to identify more recent, and therefore relevant, CE. It should be noted that there is a probable bias in this review; the approach of the scoping review captures published literature and therefore may not capture effective CE work conducted on a local level by committed and motivated individuals within communities. A limitation of this review is that publications that targeted community health workers were not included, because they were considered as a professional role. However, we note that in some communities these roles are filled by volunteers who work in the community in which they reside; this was often not clear from publications. Where publications demonstrated a nonsignificant outcome, they were not excluded. It was felt that these studies could also outline relevant contributing factors about the CE that had led to the failure to achieve the intended outcomes.

We must consider the elements of good practice in CE more broadly, yet also tailor it to be snakebite-specific. The success of a community education programme is underpinned by an understanding of more than just the disease in isolation; a holistic and comprehensive knowledge of the country and its healthcare system is essential, in addition to the health beliefs, traditions, religions, languages and cultures present. Ultimately, this scoping review will support the development of a WHO CE toolkit for snakebite envenoming and other NTDs. As we concentrate on the impending deadline of 2030, efforts to halve death and disability from SBE must be redoubled, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic; CE is a critical component of the multipronged strategy to enable potential victims of SBE to escape death and destitution and to support the recovery of those who have already suffered physical and psychological harm.",
