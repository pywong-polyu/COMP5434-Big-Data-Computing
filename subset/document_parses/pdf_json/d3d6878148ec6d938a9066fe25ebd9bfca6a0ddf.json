Untargeted sequencing of purified viral samples, termed 'shotgun sequencing' , was first applied to environmental viral populations in 2002 by Breitbart et al. Viral par ticles were prepared from seawater, and then shotgun metagenomic sequencing was employed to character ize the viral communities present 8 , revealing highly abundant and diverse phage genomes, as well as a large proportion of viral 'dark matter' (that is, sequences that looked like nothing in available databases). The next year, the same research group carried out the first study of whole viral communities from human faeces 1 , again revealing rich and diverse viral populations, and emphasizing how little of this diversity had been stud ied previously. Since then, similar methods have been applied in many studies of virome populations, providing a rich picture of the associations of the human virome with health and disease, and continuing to emphasize the expanse of viral dark matter (reviewed in refs 9,10 ).",

These vast populations, inferred to be mostly unstudied phages, are extremely diverse in the number of types as well as overall numbers of particles. Furthermore, in a few cases, viral lineages have been shown to evolve rapidly, also con tributing to the observed rich sequence variation 4 . The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Genomes database contains only 10,462 complete viral genome sequences (as of February 2021), a tiny fraction of the global diversity. Thus, studying the virome is excit ing for the extent of the novelty in every experiment, but also daunting for the analytical challenges.",

This is an inference because, in most cases, the majority of sequences uncovered in a virome metagenomic sequencing experiment do not align with any information present in existing databases (box 1), so it is unknown whether they are phages or some other virus types. The major taxa of phages are typically Caudovirales (tailed phages) and Microviridae (icosahedral nontailed phages) of the group including phage \u03a6X174. Phages can have multiple relationships with their bacterial hosts, which constrain ideas about virome dynamics ( fig. 1 ). Lytic phages inject their nucleic acid into cells, leading to the synthesis of new viral com ponents, the assembly of particles and the lysis of host cells, thus releasing progeny phages. Another mode of replication, carried out by temperate phages, can spare the host initially. Phages inject DNA into cells, after which the DNA can then become integrated into the host cell chromosome, forming a prophage. Prophages are maintained in a quiescent state by repressor proteins 23 . However, should conditions become unfavourable in the host cell -for example, by damage to DNA -phage DNA can become excised from the cellular chromosome leading to lytic growth, resulting in cell lysis and the production of viral progeny. Phages can also have other relationships with their hosts -one is pseudolysogeny, in which phage genomes persist as episomes without integration. In another mode, phages can bud out of infected cells, sparing the host cell from lysis and death. Viruses that infect human cells are also an impor tant part of the human virome. Some may cause acute infections, and others may establish longterm latency. Some viruses engage in benign colonization and can not be associated with any particular disease, appearing to be longterm 'passengers' or 'commensals' . Virome sequencing studies have unveiled some new lineages of human viruses that appear to be such commensals. For example, the Anelloviridae are a family of nonenveloped, singlestranded DNA viruses with quite small circular genomes (2-4 kb), including torque teno virus, torque teno mini virus and torque teno midi virus [24] [25] [26] . The genomes of viruses in this family encode what appears to be a single large protein, although gene expression has not been Box 1 | Methods for studying the virome and the 'dark matter'",

Combining contig analysis with cataloguing gene types, and quantifying matches to gene families known to be viral, can help with attribution. another helpful step can be assessing circularity in contigs, which commonly indicates completion of a metagenomic viral sequence (although this too can arise as an artefact of sequence repetition in a contig assembly).",

Thus, metagenomic sequencing boosts the discovery of novel viral genomes enormously. the vast majority of these probable viruses have yet to be grown in cell culture, classically a key step in establishing viral taxa, but today viral lineages are commonly specified as sequences before successful culture. as a consequence, for many members of the virome, it is not known what organisms serve as hosts for replication. the field is developing stand-alone virome-derived contig databases that can be updated regularly, such as the Gut virome Database (GvD) 133 , which are useful for updating new discoveries and establishing standards for annotating the dark matter.",

In lysogenic growth, phages inject their genomes into cells, and the genomes then become integrated into the bacterial cellular chromosome. The prophage is maintained in a quiescent state until detection of a suitable induction signal, after which the phage genome becomes excised and goes on to direct lytic growth. Pseudolysogeny is a loose interaction between the phage and the host in which the phage genome is present in the bacterial cell but not actively directing lytic growth 156 .

Anelloviridae are the most common, but, surprisingly, the newly discov ered Redondoviridae 32 is the second most common virus family. However, it should be noted that prevalence meas ures are expected to be dependent on the sampling meth ods used, and the multiple displacement amplification steps typically used to amplify virome samples likely favour amplification of small DNA circles, potentially boosting detection of Anelloviridae and Redondoviridae. Reports so far put the prevalence of Redondoviridae at 2-15% in different populations [32] [33] [34] . As with Anelloviridae, whether Redondoviridae can cause disease is unknown. Preliminary studies show increased levels of redondo viruses in humans with periodontitis, patients who are critically ill in a medical intensive care unit and indi viduals with severe respiratory diseases 32,33 , although to date there is no evidence that redondoviruses are con tributing to the disease states. Thus, both anelloviruses and redondoviruses appear to be common commensal viruses that might be undetected if not for developments in viral metagenomic sequencing methods. Phages, like most of the cellular microbiota, even when found in the lung appear to be derived mainly from the abundant bacterial populations in the mouth and upper respiratory tract.",

A pioneering study found viral particles in blood using electron microscopy and identified genomic sequences related to several eukar yotic viruses, including Anelloviridae 63 . Other recent studies have reported Herpesviridae, Marseilleviridae, Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae and Picornaviridae fam ilies, with proportions varying with the geographical site sampled 64, 65 . Some of these findings illustrate the challenges of virome studies, where samples with low levels of authentic viruses may be prone to contamina tion (box 1). It is important to note that Marseilleviridae, Mimiviridae and Phycodnaviridae are not known to rep licate in human cells, and may represent environmental contamination. Phages belonging to the Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, Microviridae and Inoviridae families have also been reported in blood, and, similarly, their origin is unclear (reviewed in refs 48, 66, 67 ) . Some of these studies did not perform viral particle enrichment prior to sequencing, so that prophage sequences inte grated in bacterial genomes (rather than viral particles) may have been identified. A recent study reported that phage particles may be transported across gut epithe lial cell layers by transcytosis, potentially reaching sys temic circulation, with unknown consequences 68 . Thus, much remains to be learnt about the blood virome of healthy individuals; however, it does seem likely that at least Anelloviridae are common in blood and so must be expected to be present throughout the blood supply.",

Lower particle numbers are found at other body sites, but all seem to have detectable viral colonization. For sites with a resident microbiota, the viruses found are typically a mixture of viruses replicating in the local human cells and viruses infecting the local microbiota. The extent of circu lation between sites is just starting to be assessed. Upper respiratory microbiota likely contribute much of the microbiome and virome to lower respiratory sites, at least for the phage population. Small circular DNA viruses (Anelloviridae and Redondoviridae) are common in res piratory samples and can also be found in faecal samples, although it is not known whether they appear in the gut because of replication in the gastrointestinal tract or swal lowing of saliva. Anelloviridae but not Redondoviridae appear in blood, indicating systemic circulation. Even sites that are mostly cut off from normal microbial colo nization, such as cerebrospinal fluid, show low levels of viruses including phages. How much of this colonization is due to true local viral replication, how much is due to systemic circulation of viruses and how much is due to technical mishaps associated with reagent contamination remains to be fully clarified. At all of these sites, unanno tated 'dark matter' sequences are prominent, emphasizing how much remains to be learnt.",

The timing of virome establishment is linked to the question of establishment of the microbiome as a whole in human neonates and infants. Historically, the inability to culture microorganisms from samples from healthy deliveries has supported the idea that neonates are usually born sterile. Starting in 2014, several studies using metagen omic sequencing were carried out, leading to the pro posal of a microbiome in the placenta, amniotic fluid and even the fetus, implying that microbial colonization may start in utero [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] . However, multiple recent studies have indicated that these detections of microorganisms are likely to be false positives due to experimental con tamination, and that no placental microbiome is pres ent before rupture of membranes and delivery [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] . This raises the question of when viral colonization takes place in human neonates. Vertical transmission of pathogenic viruses during pregnancy has been well documented for rubella virus, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses, HIV, Zika virus and human papillomavirus (reviewed in refs [89] [90] [91] [92] ). However, these are characteristic of disease states and not health. Virome populations are robust in adults, so the question is when does the virome become established in healthy neonates.",

In a study of amniotic fluid, no evidence was found for the existence of a virome in healthy pregnancies before delivery 86 . A later study of neonate stool samples, investigating both RNA and DNA viromes, taken a median of 2.6 days after birth found high diversity in the gut virome, consistent with rapid colonization after delivery 50 . Another metagenomic study using stool samples collected a median of 37 h after birth again showed high viral diversity, supporting rapid virome acquisition 94 . A more recent study of VLPs sam pled a median of 17 h after birth reported that only 15% of samples were positive 49 .

Pioneering bacteria colonize the gut of the neonate, such that infants have a detectable microbiome by month 1 of life. These bacteria commonly harbour integrated prophages, which occasionally induce prophages, providing a first wave of viral particles in the gut. Later, by month 4, more viruses that infect human cells can be detected. Infection with these viruses, some of which can be pathogenic, is inhibited by breastfeeding. Breastfeeding can also alter the types of phages present by altering the proportions of bacteria in the infant gut, which consequently alters the proportions of their phages. The protective effects of breast milk can be conferred by maternal immune cells or various macromolecules. These include maternal antibodies, human milk oligosaccharides, lactoferrin, mucin and gangliosides. The viral groups targeted by each antiviral factor in human breast milk are shown.

Intense interest has focused on the potential influence of human genetics on the microbiome, raising the linked question of the role of human genetics in programming the virome. Several studies of twins, comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, have suggested an influence of human genet ics on microbiome composition because the monozygotic twins showed more similarity [124] [125] [126] . By contrast, a recent largescale study of healthy adults (nontwins) reported little effect of genetics and emphasized environmental factors 127 . In studies of the infant virome, the gut virome compositions of cotwins were more similar than those between unrelated individuals 50, 94, 102 , but this similarity was not strongly affected by zygosity 94, 102 , emphasizing the importance of the shared environment over human genetic composition. In an early study of adult twins, no greater similarity of virome samples was seen in twin pairs 3 . In a more recent study with a larger cohort of adult monozygotic twins, some were found to have greater sim ilarity in virome composition compared with unrelated individuals, but in other cotwin pairs the microbiota and the virome had diverged to the degree that the twins were no longer notably similar 128 . Collectively, studies of the gut virome in twin pairs so far show similarities early in life, but not stronger similarities in monozygotic twins versus dizygotic twins, thus emphasizing the importance of shared environmental factors in colonization versus contributions of genetic makeup.",

One drastic example involves epidermodysplasia verruciformis (also known as treeman syndrome, which is a rare heritable skin disease). In the presence of a mutation in TMC6 (EVER1) or TMC8 (EVER2), skin papillomaviruses replicate aggressively and cause massive inappropriate outgrowth of skin cells, resulting in treeman syndrome (reviewed in ref. 129 ). Other primary immunodeficiencies may similarly allow specific viruses or microorganisms to replicate unchecked, resulting in distinctive disorders. The effects of immunodeficiencies on the skin virome were mentioned above; also, virome studies of individ uals undergoing treatment for Xlinked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIDX1) revealed distinctive out growths of several viral lineages in the gut 130 . An inter esting question for future investigation is how much of the phenotypes of diverse human genetic diseases are a result of altered interactions with the normal virome.",

A window on phage predation and host health is pro vided by phage therapy, in which phages are deliberately applied to human individuals to treat bacterial infec tions. As more drugresistant bacteria are emerging, there is increased interest in this approach (reviewed in ref. 137 ). Recently, several studies have used phage cock tails to treat bacterial infection in a few individuals, with apparent success (reviewed in ref. 138 ) motivating larger clinical trials. Evidence that the phages are in fact creat ing evolutionary pressure on pathogenic bacteria in these studies comes from the observation that bacteria often mutated to become resistant to the therapeutic phage. Phages may even be useful to treat additional diseases. For example, a phage cocktail targeting adherent invasive Escherichia coli strains has been suggested recently as a treatment for Crohn's disease 139 .",

We now have a detailed picture of the stepwise nature of the assembly of the human virome after birth. The impact of viral colonization during early life on longterm health outcomes is still unknown and warrants careful study. Breastfeeding appears to have an important role during viral colonization; how the antivi ral components in breast milk interact with the different components of the virome warrants further investiga tion. Emerging data indicate that factors that influence the human microbiome also often influence the virome as well, so that sorting out the influence of each will be a challenge going forward. Resident viruses are not only actively interacting with other microorganisms but also with the mammalian immune system. Many intriguing conclusions have so far only been obtained in animal studies or in vitro experiments, focusing attention on translation to studies in humans.

The gastrointestinal tract is com monly the most abundant site of viral colonization, reaching ~10 9 VLPs per gram of intestinal contents. Analysis of virome sequence data suggests that phages are the most abundant identifiable members of this population (reviewed in refs 9,10,35-38 ). Phage replication cycles.
