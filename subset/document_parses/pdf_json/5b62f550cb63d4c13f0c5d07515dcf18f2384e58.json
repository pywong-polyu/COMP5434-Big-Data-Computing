Retrospective analysis on patients admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with moderate/severe COVID-19 and availability of at least two nasopharyngeal swabs. The primary outcome was the time to nasopharyngeal swab negativization. A multivariable Cox model was fitted to determine factors associated with nasopharyngeal swab negativization. Of 280 patients included, 59 (21.1%) patients were treated with steroids. Differences observed between steroid users and non-users included the proportion of patients with a baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264 200 mmHg (45.8% vs 34.4% in steroids and non-steroids users, respectively; p = 0.023) or \u2264 100 mmHg (16.9% vs 12.7%; p = 0.027), and length of hospitalization (20 vs 14 days; p < 0.001). Time to negativization of nasopharyngeal swabs was similar in steroid and non-steroid users (p = 0.985). According to multivariate analysis, SARS-CoV-2 clearance was associated with age \u2264 70 years, a shorter duration of symptoms at admission, a baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 > 200 mmHg, and a lymphocyte count at admission > 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L. SARS-CoV-2 clearance was not associated with corticosteroid use. Our study shows that delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance in moderate/severe COVID-19 is associated with older age and a more severe disease, but not with an early use of corticosteroids.",

However, in patients with severe/critical illness, the benefit of steroid administration overcome the potential risks. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Our study has several limitations. First, we cannot exclude a potential selection bias, given that the included patients need to have at least two nasopharyngeal swabs. This criterion excluded patients showing a more aggressive course who unfortunately died within a few days of hospital admission (leading also to an underestimation of the number of observed deaths). Second, treatment with steroids was not standardized, and the decision to administer this drug and the timing of administration was at the discretion of the different physicians.
