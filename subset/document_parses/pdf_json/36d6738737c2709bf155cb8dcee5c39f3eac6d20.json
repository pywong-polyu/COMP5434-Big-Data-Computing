            "text": "Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog prodrug, has displayed pharmacological activity against SARS-CoV-2. Recently, eicosanoids are widely involved in regulating immunity and inflammation for COVID-19 patients. Rats were intravenously administered remdesivir at a dose of 5 mg/kg, and series of blood samples were collected before and after treatment. Targeted metabolomics regarding the eicosanoid profile were investigated and quantitated simultaneously using the previously reported reliable HPLC-MS/MS method. Additionally, interplay relationship between metabolomics and pharmacokinetic parameters was performed using the Pearson correlation analysis and PLS model. For the longitudinal metabolomics of remdesivir, metabolic profiles of the same rat were comparatively substantial at discrete sampling points. The metabolic fingerprints generated by individual discrepancy of rats were larger than metabolic disturbance caused by remdesivir. As for the transversal metabolomics, the prominent metabolic profile variation was observed between the baseline and treatment status. Except for TXB2, the inflammatory-and immunology-related eicosanoids of resolvin D2, 5-HEPE, 5-HETE, and DHA were significantly disturbed and reduced after single administration of remdesivir (p < 0.05, p < 0.001). Moreover, the metabolite of PGE2 correlated with GS-441524 (active metabolite of remdesivir) concentration and pharmacokinetic parameters of C max , AUC 0-t , AUC 0-infinity , and CL significantly. Eicosanoid metabolic profiles of remdesivir at both longitudinal and transversal levels were first revealed using the robust HPLC-MS/MS method. This initial observational eicosanoid metabolomics may lighten the therapy for fighting COVID-19 and further provide mechanistic insights of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.",

            "text": "Metabolomics is one of the most powerful tools for studying the interaction between genetic background and exogenous and endogenous factors in human health. Pharmacometabolomics can provide a metabolic profile or metabotype variation induced by drug treatment, which straightly mirrors the metabolic status of small molecules between tissues and fluids and facilitates better understanding of biological processes related with the disease. Endogenous small-molecule metabolites are indispensable for vital infection, which can provide fundamental material for rapidly proliferating and constructing nucleic acid, proteins, and membrane (Thomas et al., 2020) . As one of the key components for physiological function, eicosanoids not only play a crucial role in the pathological process of allergy, inflammation, and cancer (Harizi et al., 2008; Wang and DuBois, 2010; Dennis and Norris, 2015) but also promote the cytokine storm of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Hammock et al., 2020) . It is now well known that general alterations in metabolomic profiles and trajectories, which are a link between genotypes and phenotypes and provide terminal information, can provide crucial comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 infection pathogenesis (Thomas et al., 2020) . Unfortunately, the metabolic mechanism of remdesivir was not fully figured out, especially with regard to eicosanoid metabolite reprogramming/perturbation. Limited literatures have reported the metabolite changes among COVID-19 patient cohorts, such as cytosine and tryptophan-nicotinamide pathways (Blasco et al., 2020) , lipids (Archambault et al., 2021) , amino acid, and fatty acid (Shen et al., 2020) . However, as far as we know, no eicosanoid metabolic profiling literatures were reported pertaining to remdesivir treatment both in vitro and in vivo. It is therefore reasonable and feasible to study the association of eicosanoid metabolic profiles and remdesivir treatment. In view of the shortcomings described above, the purpose of the present study was originally proposed to longitudinally and transversally investigate the eicosanoid metabolic fingerprint induced by remdesivir treatment in rats. Furthermore, correlation analysis was investigated between eicosanoids metabolomic and pharmacokinetics. Overall, we provide the first deep interrogation of eicosanoid changes that benefit propitious understanding of how remdesivir interacted with small molecular metabolites. The results of the present study will shed light on how remdesivir combats SARS-CoV-2 virus from the perspective of metabolomic perturbation.",

For the transversal pharmacometabolomics of remdesivir, Figures 3A ,B illustrated all metabolic data from six rats were introduced for unsupervised PCA and OPLS-DA analysis. Although limited metabolic samples were used in the present study at baseline time points, the individuals of both groups were discriminated well in the OPLS-DA model. Moreover, the random permutation test with 100 iterations was employed to investigate validity and predictability of the OPLS-DA model. Figure 3C showed no overfitting was observed for all introduced data [R2 (0.0, 0.0413), Q2 (0.0, -0.102)]. In addition, hierarchical cluster analysis was also carried out to investigate transversal metabolic disturbance. As shown in Figure 3D , the metabolites correlated with each other positively (e.g., PGE2, TXB2, 5-HEPE, and DHA) or negatively (e.g., TXB3, 14-HDHA, 15-HEPE, and arachidonic acid). The individual metabolic data are shown in Figure 3E , which indicated that there was a visible discrimination between pre-and post-dosage. The clustering heatmap provided an overview of all eicosanoid in plasma before and after intravenous administration, indicating the fluctuant levels of relative increase (brown) and decrease (blue). To find potential significance of metabolites associated with the treatment of remdesivir, the VIPs were determined in view of the established OPLS-DA model. The VIP values larger than 1 were set the most significant influence, with a plot shown in Figure 3F . A total of seven metabolites were screened out with VIP > 1. Taken together, the above data indicated that remdesivir can perturbate the eicosanoid metabolic profile via cyclooxygenase, cytochrome 450, and lipoxygenase pathways.

Additionally, coronavirus infection led to tissue damage and subsequently triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress response as well as eicosanoid cytokine storms. Eicosanoids stimulate the resolution of inflammation and alleviate systemic hyperinflammatory responses by modulating the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (Mehta et al., 2020) . Infectious processes often activate the formation of inflammasomes, which subsequently form an eicosanoid storm composed of pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators, thereby disrupting the time course and resolution of inflammation (Dennis and Norris, 2015) . Thus, exploring the eicosanoid metabolic characteristics and mechanism has become a high priority in determining management strategies to block the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and targeting eicosanoids may provide a new therapeutic approach to combat COVID-19.",

The most obviously disturbed metabolites shown in Figure 2F included the lipoxygenase pathway (15-HETE, 15-HEPE, 5-HEPE, and 14-HDHA) and cyclooxygenase pathway (TXB2). Of note, these metabolites play a critical role in the physiological and pathological functions of inflammation, immunology, and cytokine production. As previously reported by academics, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is an hyperinflammatory syndrome and often triggered by viral infections, which lead to unremitting fever, cytopenias, increased interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, granulogytecolony stimulating factor, and interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 in patients with COVID-19 Mehta et al., 2020) . Moreover, Schwarz et al. (2020) reported that the levels of free PUFAs and cascade metabolites, such as arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were enhanced in the COVID-19-infected cohorts, and the changes of these eicosanoids could discriminate the severe from the moderate disease patients. It is known that plasminogen is the main source of PUFAs in immune and structural cells (Lebrero et al., 2019) . When systemic immune cells are activated, PUFAs are released from parent glycolipids and subsequently converted to various immune signaling eicosanoids (Dennis and Norris, 2015) . The imbalance among pro-inflammatory, immune-regulating, and pro-resolving eicosanoid mediators can not only affect the efficacy of immune response in the process of infectious and sterile inflammatory diseases but also may contribute to disease progression and further change the status of successful treatment of inflammation (Serhan and Savill, 2005) . Nowadays, there is no metabolic research regarding remdesivir treatment from this perspective of eicosanoid metabolic disturbance. Our work first revealed the endogenous metabolites trajectories induced by remdesivir treatment, which will benefit in understanding biological pathways related to antiviral drug and initiate mechanistic hypotheses.",

Some eicosanoids, such as resolvins or EETs, could weaken pathological thrombosis and facilitate clot removal, which is becoming a critical pathology of COVID-19 infection . In this context, metabolites including TXB2, PGE2, and 5-HEPE were all significantly disturbed with VIP > 1 when remdesivir was administered before and after treatment (Figure 4) . Conti et al. (2020) reported that IL-1 induces TXB2 releases in activated neutrophils and macrophages, and causes leukocyte aggregation and inflammation, which would explain the dramatic thrombi formation, platelet aggregation, and organ dysfunction in COVID-19. Moreover, results of targeted lipidomic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavages from COVID-19 patients have shown that leukotrienes, and metabolites derived from AA, EPA, and DPA were all increased (Archambault et al., 2021) . In the present study, the metabolic levels of DHA, resolvin D2, 5-HEPE, and 5-HETE were decreased after remdesivir treatment (Figure 4) , which may provide considerable mirror for understanding the mechanism of COVID-19 and antiviral drugs. Besides, the decrease of resolvin D2 may weaken the antiinflammatory action to some extent. The reason for this decrease may be attributed to the limited rats in this study. Given that the pivotal role of eicosanoids in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and therapeutic targets, an open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial (NCT04335032, 2020) was performed in hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. This clinical trial was classified into two groups: receiving standard care or providing daily 2 g of EPA capsules. The main endpoints comprised the efficacy of EPA, pro-inflammatory IL-6, mortality rate, ICU stays, and mechanical ventilation. Overall, these inflammatory-related metabolites play an important role for the therapy or prevention in patients with COVID-19.",

Using an animal model and in vitro analysis, Coulombe et al. (2014) demonstrated that PGE2 production during influenza A virus (H1N1 strain) infection resulted in the inhibition of type 1 IFN and apoptosis of alveolar macrophages, thereby contributing to increased viral replication. In that case, the inhibition of PGE2 enhanced the antiviral response, indicating that the specific inhibition of PGE2 represents a therapeutic pathway for the cure and prevention of influenza and other potential viral infections. In order to evaluate whether the levels of metabolites correlated with blood drug exposure, correlation analysis between metabolites and pharmacokinetic parameters was conducted and shown in Figure 5 . As described, PGE2 correlated with C max , AUC 0-t , AUC 0-infinity , and Nuc concentrations positively with r > 0.5 and p < 0.05. Besides, for the parameter of CL, PGE2 exerts negative correlation. HEPEs which derived from EPA displayed a different tendency. With respect to the correlation analysis between metabolic profile and pharmacokinetics, a PLS model was built after PCA analysis.

The results of the present work will provide metabolomic evidence regarding eicosanoids after treatment of remdesivir in vivo. As there have been no effective drug therapy options to treat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, although many strengths exist in our study, several limitations had to be mentioned in future works. For instance, a limited number of rats can only provide restricted metabolic data, which may reduce the robustness of the data available in this article. Clinical trials with larger sample sizes will be able to supplement some of the gaps in this study in the future. Second, despite our endeavors to collect blood samples from COVID-19 patients, due to poor sample accessibility, we only examined the metabolomic profiles in healthy rats after a single administration of remdesivir. As reported by Schwarz et al. (2021) , compared with the healthy condition, the lipid mediators and eicosanoids were disturbed, including decreased products of ALOX12 (e.g., 12-HEPE, 12-HETE, RvE3, and LXA4) and COX2 (e.g., PGE2, PGD2, PGF2a, TXB2, and 18-HEPE), increase products of ALOX5 (e.g., RvD1-4, LTB4, 5-HEPE, 5-HETE, 7-HDHA, and 7-HDPA), and cytochrome p450 (5, 6 DiHETrE, 8, 9 DiHETrE, 11, 12 DiHETrE, and 14, 15 DiHETrE) in human serum. Besides, plasma metabolic results identified 18 metabolites (e.g., LTB4, 9,10-DiHOME, 12,13-DiHOME, PGE2, and PGD2) with statistically significant differences (p < 0.01) with more than four-fold change between healthy controls (n 44) and COVID-19 patients (n 6) (McReynolds et al., 2021) . Much works, either in vitro or in vivo, may be necessitated to evaluate metabolomic characteristics under virus attack. Additionally, it will be critical to reproduce novel evidences with an external cohort. Accordingly, external validation datasets should be replenished and verified for better illustrating the robust eicosanoid metabolomics. Taken together, with continuous research and technical advancements, eicosanoid metabolic reprogramming will no doubt provide a notable scientific contribution to the innovation in COVID-19 therapy practice.",

Inherent metabolic phenotype variations of eicosanoids metabolites, such as 15-HETE, 5-HEPE, TXB2, PGE2, and DHA, had turned out after remdesivir treatment. Presently, this study originally provides a systemic and comprehensive eicosanoid metabolomic profiling in rats after intravenous administration of remdesivir, and it also offers strong evidence to the pathology in fighting COVID-19. Collectively, eicosanoid metabolic fingerprint of remdesivir treatment may shed light on therapy development for COVID-19 patients.",
