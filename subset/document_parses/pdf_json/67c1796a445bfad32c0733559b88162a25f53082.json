[4] [5] [6] [7] Most existing studies have focused on factors influencing surgical choices, while patient involvement, decisional conflict and decision-making experiences are underexplored. Besides, empirical evidence focusing on decision-making about mastectomy is rare, which remains the most commonly used surgical approach for breast cancer in many regions.

            "text": "Open access than 80% of Chinese breast cancer survivors have had mastectomy surgery. [19] [20] [21] Several studies have investigated surgical decision-making among Chinese women with breast cancer who live in non-China countries. A qualitative study in the USA suggested that Chinese-American women with breast cancer preferred mastectomy over BCS as they believed the mastectomy decision was safer. 22 Another study examined factors related to surgical choices among 184 breast cancer women in Malaysia, and found that women of Chinese ethnicity, compared with Malay and Indian women, were more likely to undergo mastectomy and they were less concerned about femininity loss caused by the removal of the breast. 23 Similar findings were reported in studies from Australia and Canada that included women of Chinese ethnicity. 24 25 Currently, no study has been conducted in mainland China to understand decision-making about mastectomy among Chinese women with breast cancer. Decision-making is complex due to the heterogeneity of this behaviour. 26 In the healthcare context, a consensus about the definition of 'decision-making' is not evident. Without a clear definition, most existing studies considered 'decision-making' from a single dimension. For example, several studies considered decision-making from the perspectives of roles and power, as well as patient involvement in making treatment decisions. 27 28 Glatzer et al 26 considered decision-making was the result of factor interactions and proposed a model consisting of decision-maker factors (patients and doctors), decision-specific factors (the nature of the decision itself) and contextual factors (environment in which the decision is being made). However, as a process, decision-making is dynamic and multifaceted and may also include dimensions concerning time, 29 30 information, 31 32 supports, 33 34 interpersonal communication, 29 35 and decision outcomes. 36 37 Hence, we describe a protocol for a mixed-methods study to offer a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of decision-making about mastectomy by examining the current use of mastectomy, investigating womens' perceptions regarding involvement, decisional conflict and factors that influence their decisions in mainland China, as well as exploring Chinese women's decision-making experiences with mastectomy. The mixed-methods design, involving both quantitative and qualitative data, will enable us to obtain rich knowledge of this complex behaviour. 38 This study will include any forms of mastectomy as long as the women removed the cancer-affected breast, regardless of whether they had a neoadjuvant therapy or not. It includes unilateral mastectomy, bilateral mastectomy, mastectomy alone and mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.",

The Chinese version of SDM-Q-9 was validated in 660 Chinese patients and proved to be an appropriate instrument to measure patient involvement in the decision-making process (Cronbach's \u03b1=0.945). 40 The 16-item Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) will be used to measure the decisional conflict, including decision uncertainty, factors contributing to the uncertainty and patient-perceived effective decision-making (Cronbach's \u03b1=0.78-0.92). 41 It consists of 16 items in total, containing 5 domains: 'feeling informed' (3 items), 'uncertainty' (3 items), 'clear values' (3 items) , 'support' (3 items) and 'quality of decisions' (4 items). 41 Each item is rated on Open access a 5-point Likert scale from 'strongly agree' (score=0) to 'strongly disagree' (score=4). Higher total scores indicate more decisional conflict. In this study, decisional conflict will be categorised into 3 levels: a total score lower than 25 will be considered the low-level decisional conflict, and a total score above 37.5 will be considered the high-level decisional conflict, which is associated with decision delay or uncertainty about the decision. 42 A total score between 25 and 37.5 will then be considered the moderate level of decisional conflict. The Chinese version of DCS was validated among 471 Chinese women with breast cancer in Hong Kong (Cronbach's \u03b1=0.51-0.87). 43 The Choice Influence Scale (CIS), developed by Lam et al, is a compilation of prevalent factors and issues women consider when they make breast cancer treatment decisions. 44 It contains five domains: 'effects of surgery on physical appearance and sexuality and surgery-related physical suffering' (5 items), 'treatment effectiveness in achieving cure' (4 items), 'avoidance of further treatments' (2 items), 'family and friends' influence' (5 items) and 'doctor's influence' (3 items). 44 Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale, with the score 1 indicating 'not important at all' to score 5 'extremely important'. The mean score of each item is calculated to compare the importance of these factors. Such a list of prevalent factors is widely used in previous studies to evaluate the importance of factors in women's decisionmaking behaviours. [45] [46] [47] This study will primarily employ the CIS to assess the influence of given factors in women's decision-making of mastectomy. After analysing the results of phase one, the CIS will be amended as appropriate and more factors associated with the choice of mastectomy will be added to the factor list.",

Descriptive statistics, such as the mean, median, SD, percentage and frequency, will be used to summarise patients' characteristics. In phase one, the differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics between surgery groups (such as the mastectomy group vs BCS group) will be analysed using the t-test, Fisher's exact test or \u03c7 2 test, when appropriate. Multiple logistic regression will be used to examine the effect of sociodemographic characteristics and clinical history on mastectomy use. Patients with missing data will be excluded from the regression analysis. In phase two, the SDM-Q-9, DCS and CIS scores will be calculated. Analysis of variance will be used to compare SDM-Q-9 scores across different categories of each sociodemographic and clinical variable. The \u03c7 2 test or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare patients' characteristics across three decisional conflict levels. Pearson's correlation will be used to investigate the relationships between SDM-Q-9 and DCS scores. Two-tailed p values will be adopted, and p <0.05 will be considered statistically significant.",
