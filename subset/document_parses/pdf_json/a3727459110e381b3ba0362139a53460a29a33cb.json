We assume that a borrower has exclusively an option to invest in a project in two stages. The project's cash flow follows a double exponential jump-diffusion process and it is increased by a growth factor once the second-stage investment is exercised. The first-stage investment cost is financed by a bank loan with the guarantee provided by an insurer, who promises to provide the second-stage investment cost as well as take the lender's all default losses. In return for the guarantee and investment, the borrower pays a guarantee fee upon first investment and grants a fraction of equity upon second investment to the insurer. In sharp contrast to prior papers on guarantee, the guarantee costs are contracted prior to investment. We provide closed-form solutions and produce a numerical algorithm for the timing and pricing of the two investment options.",

On the one hand, to support micro-, small-and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), Chinese governments demand that insurers provide guarantees for MSMEs to get a loan from a bank and the guarantee fee must be less than 3% or so of the money borrowed. On the other hand, most of projects managed by MSMEs are exposed to very high risk, and the guarantee fee rate is too low to cover the default losses incurred by insurers. To solve this problem, Shenzhen High-Tech Investment Group Co., Ltd. (HTI henceforth) has invented the G-I mode.",

Under this mode, the first-stage investment cost is financed by a bank loan with the guarantee provided by an insurer, who promises to provide the second-stage investment cost as well as take the lender's all default losses. In return for the guarantee and investment, the borrower pays the insurer a guarantee fee at the first investment time and a fraction of equity at the second investment time. Due to the fraction of equity granted to the insurer, which is valuable in general, the insurer will be sufficiently reimbursed while the guarantee fee rate satisfies the standard required by the government.",

The equity-for-guarantee swaps are mainly for MSMEs who must get a guarantee in advance to obtain bank loans. The equity-for-guarantee swaps are impossible to be replaced by credit default swaps (CDSs) since the latter are signed between insurers and lenders instead of borrowers. In particular, the buyers of CDS insurance are generally large corporations rather than MSMEs in the equity-for-guarantee swaps. With CDSs, lenders pay regular premiums for hedging risk until a credit event. By contrast, equity-for-guarantee swaps allow lenders to transfer risk to insurers at the cost of an MSME's one and only one lump-sum payment in the form of capital or equity, which motivates the lenders to grant loans to MSMEs. Hence, the equity-forguarantee swaps give rise to a large welfare improvement to the economy. All in all, without such equity-for-guarantee swaps, MSMEs might be unable to start a profitable project. By sharp contrast, CDSs mainly involve shifting of risk.",

We assume that the cash flow of the project follows a double exponential jump-diffusion distribution rather than an arithmetic Brownian motion discussed by the latter. This difference makes our model much more difficult to solve. For example, one main task is to define fair guarantee costs which depend on the cash flow level when the agreement is signed. However, the cash flow level at investment time is uncertain due to jumps assumed in this paper but it can be an optimally chosen level in advance in Dong and Yang (2020) since jumps are absent there. Actually, there is a new challenging problem that is never considered in prior papers on the guarantee. For this reason, this paper mainly aims to provide an algorithm to fix the pricing and timing of the option to invest in a jump-diffusion model with the G-I mode.",

            "text": "The jump-diffusion model is widely used in the financial literature. This is because many empirical studies have shown that financial returns exhibit significantly fatter tails than standard normal models. To effectively improve the latter, roughly speaking, there are two approaches: One is to develop stochastic volatility models and the other is to introduce stochastic jumps, setting up jumpdiffusion models, say one introduced by Merton (1976) . As a matter of fact, stochastic jumps occur more often than not in a period. For example, in the COVID-19 pandemic, many MSMEs have experienced financial distress and thus their cash flows experience a sharp decline. Recently, the double exponential jump-diffusion process, a new jump-diffusion model, attracts a growing research interest due to its two merits, as argued by (Kou 2002) : First, its two-sided jumps and the leptokurtic feature of jump size lead to the peak and heavy tails of return distribution found in reality. Second, the double exponential distribution has a memoryless feature which facilitates the calculation of conditional means and variances. For these reasons, in this paper we focus on the double exponential jump-diffusion process instead of the pure diffusion model discussed by Dong and Yang (2020) .",

The MSME must borrow money from an lender (bank) under the guarantee provided by an insurer for the first-stage investment and pay the bank a coupon rate of C unless it is solvent. If the borrower defaults, the insurer takes the firm's liquidation value with the bankruptcy loss rate being denoted by 0\\a\\1, and compensates the lender for all default loss incurred. In return, the MSME pays the insurer a given guarantee fee at the time the loan is issued and also gives the insurer a forward-like claim, which claims that if the second-stage investment is conducted, the entrepreneur grants the insurer a given fraction w of equity after the insurer pays the sunk cost I of the second-stage investment. As assumed by Dong and Yang (2020) , once the second-stage investment is exercised, the MSME's cash flow level increases from d to \u00f01 \u00fe h\u00ded, where h represents the growth factor coefficient. If the cash flow level is low enough, the MSME will default no matter whether the second-stage investment is executed or not.",

We aim to produce an algorithm for the pricing and timing of the option to invest in a project with the G-I mode. We make use of the well-known theory of corporate securities pricing and capital structure, see e.g. Leland (1994) , and the backward induction method, see e.g. Tan and Yang (2017) , and provide closed-form solutions and produce a numerical algorithm for the timing and pricing of the option to make the two-stage investment.",
