            "text": "Numerous viruses, mostly in mixed infections, have been associated worldwide with poult enteritis complex (PEC). In 2008 a coronavirus (Fr-TCoV 080385d) was isolated in France from turkey poults exhibiting clinical signs compatible with this syndrome. In the present study, the median infectious dose (ID 50 ) , transmission kinetics and pathogenicity of Fr-TCoV were investigated in 10-day-old SPF turkeys. Results revealed a titre of 10 4.88 ID 50 /ml with 1 ID 50 /ml being beyond the limit of genome detection using a well-characterized qRT-PCR for avian coronaviruses. Horizontal transmission of the virus via the airborne route was not observed however, via the oro-faecal route this proved to be extremely rapid (one infectious individual infecting another every 2.5 hr) and infectious virus was excreted for at least 6 weeks in several birds. Histological examination of different zones of the intestinal tract of the Fr-TCoV-infected turkeys showed that the virus had a preference for the lower part of the intestinal tract with an abundance of viral antigen being present in epithelial cells of the ileum, caecum and bursa of Fabricius. Viral antigen was also detected in dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages in these areas, which may indicate a potential for Fr-TCoV to replicate in antigen-presenting cells. Together these results highlight the importance of good sanitary practices in turkey farms to avoid introducing minute amounts of virus that could suffice to initiate an outbreak, and the need to consider that infected individuals may still be infectious long after a clinical episode, to avoid virus dissemination through the movements of apparently recovered birds.",

PEC includes several intestinal disorders that occur in turkeys mostly within the first three weeks of life (Guy, 2013) and its clinical signs often include diarrhea, stunting, anorexia, dehydration, weight loss, and immune dysfunction (atrophy of the thymus and the bursa of Fabricius) that promotes secondary infections.

The parameters necessary to calculate R0 are (a) the speed of transmission and (b) the shedding duration of the infectious viruses. Generally, a virus with an R0 less than 1 will disappear quickly because an infected individual will have a low ability to infect another. A virus with an R0 greater than one will spread in the susceptible population. For IBV, an R0 of 19.95 has been estimated (de Wit, de Jong, Pijpers, & Verheijden, 1998) , which is a figure comparable to the R0 of highly contagious human viruses such as measles virus (R0 12-18) (Masters & Perlman, 2013) . For TCoV, R0 has not yet been fully calculated; however, a study with an American TCoV isolate demonstrated that infectious virus particles can be shed up to six weeks post-infection in experimentally infected turkeys .",

As shown in Figure 4 histograms, antigen detection in the other regions of the intestine (duodenum or jejunum) was inconsistent in both the inoculated and contact-birds exposed to the same samples, as illustrated by the fact that no viral protein was detected in the duodenum of any contact subject exposed to T6, T27 and T41. No viral protein expression was seen in any of the intestines taken from the inoculated and contact subjects exposed to T13, T21 and T34. to be taken into consideration. Similarly, at one ID 50 /ml, viral RNA levels were also beyond the limit of detection of a well characterized qRT-PCR (Maurel et al., 2011) , so that 10-day-old turkeys might be also more sensitive than qRT-PCR to detect infectious TCoV. Such a high susceptibility of young hosts was also reported in a recent paper where an enteric coronavirus of pigs (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, PEDV) was shown to infect more efficiently 5-day-old piglets than tissue culture (minimal infectious dose = 0.056 TCID50) (Thomas et al., 2015) . RNA levels at the PEDV MID have also been reported to be beyond the limit of detection by qRT-PCR (Goyal, 2014) . The effects of turkey age on the ID 50 of Fr-TCoVwere not investigated in the current study however, the fact that TCoV associated enteric disorders such as PEC or poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) are predominantly diseases of younger subjects lends support to more resistance in older birds. was also difficult to justify on an ethical level in respect to the principals of the 3 Rs (Russell & Burch, 1959) .",

At this time the authors have no data on why some subjects stopped excreting infectious virus four weeks in advance of others or if, in fact, excretion detected at six weeks was representative of subjects with intermittent excretion profiles as has been observed in cats experimentally infected with FECV (Kipar, Meli, Baptiste, Bowker, & Lutz, 2010) . In cats, this intermittent excretion has been suggested to be linked with persistent infection in the colon (lower intestine) from which viruses then have the potential to re-infect the small intestine at any time. The presence of virus in both regions of the gut can then result in renewed excretion (Kipar et al., 2010) . Concerning Fr-TCoV these questions should be assigned to specifically designed trials and histopathological examination, however, the present study seems to indicate a clear tropism of Fr-TCoV for lower intestine, as described for FECV (Kipar et al., 2010) . Indeed, in the current study, Fr-TCoV's ability to infect the turkey intestinal tract was successfully demon- (Reddy et al., 2016) . However, although the stellate morphology and the localization of the depicted cell (see inset Figure 3c ) suggest that it likely belongs to one of the mentioned APC families, additional assays characterizing these cell types (for example double immunohistochemical staining for both viral protein expression and cell-characterizing protein epitopes) are needed to confirm a APC tropism for TCoV.",

This discrepancy could be explained by the F I G U R E 4 Detection of viral antigen in intestinal tissues. Immunohistochemistry of: intestinal tissues D = duodenum, J = jejunum, I = ileum, C = caeca B = bursa of Fabricius, taken 3 dpi from subjects inoculated with samples T6, T13, T21, T27, T34 orT41 of Exp 2 (a) and from their corresponding contacts (b) difference in age of the birds inoculated as in the US TCoV study, birds had been inoculated at 6 days of age; alternatively, like the distribution pattern discussed above, this discrepancy might be a time-dependent feature, with 3 dpi in our study being too early for morphologic changesresulting from epithelial damage, local tissue reactions and influx of immune cells to manifest. Furthermore the specific date postinoculation when microscopic lesions were observed in the US TCoV study was not given . It is equally possible that under experimental conditions the European lineage of TCoV simply has a different pathogenic profile to those of the US lineage. Infection studies for EU and US TCoVs in turkeys of the same age and under the same controlled conditions are required for comparative analysis into the pathological profiles of these different lineages.",

The virus spreads very quickly via the oro-faecal route among susceptible subjects (a new subject at least every 2.5 hr) and infectious virus may continue to be excreted for at least six weeks after the initial infection which may be linked to a preferential tropism for the lower intestines. These results stress the importance of good sanitary practices at the entrance to livestock buildings and the need to consider that infected individuals may still be infectious long after the clinical episode.",

Susceptible (S) animals correspond to na\u00efve individuals who are exposed to the virus shed by infectious (I) animals. The individuals then turn to the recovered (R) stage at the end of the shedding period. The transmission rate, denoted as \u03b2,reflects the number of new infections generated by one typical infectious individual per time unit. In this study, owing to the high transmissibility of the virus, a two-hourly time scale was selected. With these notations, the probability for a susceptible individual to become infected on a time interval [t, t + \u0394t] is given by p t = 1 \u2212 exp (\u2212\u03b2I t \u0394t/N), where N is the total number of individuals involved in the experiment (here, N = 30). Therefore, the number of new cases on each time interval [t i , t i+1 ] follows a binomial distribution with parameters S ti , the number of susceptible individuals at time t i , and p ti , the probability of infection.

Viral protein expressing enterocytes and goblet cells were mainly situated in the villar region and hardly in the crypt region.

In general, the highest number of cells containing viral protein was found in the caudal intestinal tract (ileum, caecum and bursa). A positive sample with T41) showing virus protein in caecal enterocytes is shown in Figure 3b. In the bursa of Fabricius and near the caecal tonsil, viral protein expression was mostly restricted to the epithelium covering the lymphoid tissue (Figure 3c,d), but less distinct and fragmented staining was also regularly seen subepithelially in the lymphoid follicles. Incidentally, individual cells in the lymphoid follicles seemingly showed viral protein comparable (in terms of quantity) to the epithelial viral protein expression. One subject (negative control from airborne transmission experiment), which was negative by qRT-PCR, was used as a control for histopathology. This subject neither showed histopathological changes nor viral protein expression in any of the examined intestinal samples.4 | DISCUSSIONWhen considering viral infection in animals the infectious dose, the transmission rates, the age of animal infected and environmental conditions are all influencing factors of efficacy.

Considering the same virus stock had been titrated previously in embryonated turkey eggs and found to have a virus titre of 10 4,01 EID 50 /ml, this would suggest that 10-day-old SPF turkeys are more sensitive than embryonated eggs (1 EID50 = 7 ID50) in recovering infectious TCoV, although the repeatability of Reed & Muench titration needs",

            "text": "An extremely rapid transmission via the oro-faecal route was observed under the current experimental conditions for 10-day-old SPF turkeys resulting in almost all of the na\u00efve contact subjects being infected from one infectious individual within 24 hr. No airborne transmission over a distance of 2-3 m was observed. Mathematically the results of the oro-faecal transmission gave a calculated rate of one newly infected individual every 2.5 hr and provided a figure for the first parameter in estimating an Fr-TCoV R0. This transmission rate was measured in terms of detection of viral RNA and the passage of each individual from a negative to positive status above the threshold of the qRT-PCR used.Considering what was discussed previously regarding the relative sensitivity of qRT-PCR and 10-day-old turkeys to detect infectious TCoV, the actual rate of transmission could be quicker. The qRT-PCR used in this study is in the authors' experience the most sensitive tool for detecting Fr-TCoV and thus until a more sensitive method becomes available the calculated figure of 2.5 hr cannot be refined. Nevertheless, these results showed that Fr-TCoV can be transmitted extremely rapidly and also draw attention to the fact that when calculating transmission rates, no matter the pathogen, results will relate to the sensitivity of the diagnostic tools applied. In other words, more sensitive tools for detection equals increased transmission rates.",

The virus showed preferred tropism for the lower intestines similar to what has been also observed for US lineage TCoV (NC95)(Guy, Smith, Breslin, Vaillancourt, & Barnes, 2000), which likely reflects distribution of the TCoV receptor(Ambepitiya Wickramasinghe et al., 2015). This distribution pattern could be time-dependent though and since all tissue sampleswere collected at a single time point (3 dpi in Exp 3), evaluation of intestinal segments taken at different time points after infection would be needed to fully confirm these observations. Regarding specific cell tropism within the target tissue, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (among which the so-called caecal tonsil) and the lymphoid tissue in the bursa of Fabricius might be of special interest. Although viral protein expression was most distinctively seen in epithelial cells (enterocytes) overlying these subepitheliallylocated lymphoid tissues, in several birds a delicate, finely dispersed and dotted immunohistochemical staining signal was present subepithelially within these lymphoid tissues. Taking into account both the signal's fragmented subtle aspect compared to the signal at the epithelial level and otherwise the biological function of these lymphoid aggregates, the authors speculate that this might be the result of immunohistochemical demonstration of degraded viral protein within phagocytozing antigen-presenting cells. Occasionally, as shown in the inset picture in Figure 3c, individual cells in the subepithelial lymphoid tissues displayed a 'full-cytoplasmic' immunohistochemical staining signal comparable to the signal seen in the majority of infected enterocytes. Since, upon viral inoculation of an animal, such abundant intracellular signal is usually seen in cells known to be within the virus' tropism (in other words 'presumably correlated with true viral replication'), it is therefore possible that Fr-TCoV can incidentally replicate in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), represented by dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages. APC tropism was recently demonstrated for subtypes of TCoVs relative IBV, with this ability to infect APCs being a determinant for cellmediated viremic systemic spread and subsequent infection of the chicken's urinary tract",
